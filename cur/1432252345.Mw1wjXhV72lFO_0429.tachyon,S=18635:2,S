>From a rhetorical standpoint, this argument is completely bogus. If you want
to be reckless with logic, then you might be able to say that in a perfect
world, trust of the proof may result in implicit trust of that's proof's
application to an ideal (though this is technically flawed), but the trust
is not transitive, nor commutative. Trust of a proof may result in trust of
a proven concept, but the two are not indistinguishable. Further, the
colloquial connotation of the word trust, which seems to me to be the major
rhetorical nightmare here, appears subjective, and thus hard as hell to do
anything with from a logical standpoint. Attempting to make a shaky logical
argument about someone else's trust (in the colloquial sense) of anything
may indicate some properties of the subject's method of assigning trust with
which I am not at all comfortable. Defining trust in this sense would
require a massive amount of data from the subject, which I (for one) am
unwilling to collect. Might we, instead, ask the subject how their trust
differs between proof and protocol, and inquire about the potential
differences in trust assignments? Granted, this list is a bogon sink.

Sorry Jim, the devil made me do it.
