"this past spring the Bush Administration cut by 93 percent the funds 
requested by the Energy Department to bolster security for nuclear weapons 
and waste; it denied completely the funds requested by the Army Corps of 
Engineers for guarding 200 reservoirs, dams, and canals, leaving fourteen 
large public-works projects with no budget for protection. A recommendation 
by the American Association of Port Authorities that the nation spend a 
total of $700 million to inspect and control ship cargo (today less than 
two percent of container traffic is inspected) has so far resulted in 
grants of just $92 million."
