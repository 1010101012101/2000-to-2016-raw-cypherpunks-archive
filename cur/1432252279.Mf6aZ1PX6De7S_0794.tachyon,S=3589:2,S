That's because studios are private-sector businesses, not nonprofits dedicated 
to the arts. Is a film a work of art or a commercial product? Can you really be 
both? On the other hand, how can you produce art if nobody pays for it? Then 
again, can you really have a work of art shot through, riddled and co-opted 
with BS product placement every five seconds? I tend to think not.

Still, I can't buy the idea of "good movies have a right to be made." Either 
somebody with money is willing to back it, or not. Censorship isn't really an 
issue here, just the hard, cruel laws of economics. ha. 

You might want to check out some back issues of the "Journal of Cultural 
Economics," lots of relevant articles there.
