Yeah, well Pd has 46 protons and atomic numbers ranging from 91 to 124.
Most are stable, but some have half lives in the micro to millisecond
range, a few with hours to days and 1 with 6.5 million years.  It's just
before silver, so it's most likely to be found in nuclear reactors as a
fission product.  I'd have to dig some more to find its neutron cross
section :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
