A high-pressure water cleaner puts out ca. 100 atmospheres of
pressure, and on the other end, can also flatten a hose if the water supply is shut off and the pump is running.

John Y or 100K other structural engineers/architects can probably explain about the multiple-level tanks used in skyscraper hydraulics.

Butyric acid squirts from vocal, immature lone wolves is the least of 
your problems.

Damn, but Empire is expensive.
