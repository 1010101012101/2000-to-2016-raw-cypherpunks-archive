=C2=A0> =C2=A0 results 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 all go to the same spam page.=C2=A0
I think you're wrong about that. =C2=A0It isn't "the same spam page". =C2=
=A0Rather, it is multiple copies of what amounts to (looks like, to the hum=
an eye) the same spam page, but located at different URLs.

hat
> =C2=A0 =C2=A0they can't even run a search engine?
Again, I think you're wrong about that. =C2=A0I don't think Google has done=
 anything wrong, here. =C2=A0Rather, I think that someone else has manufact=
ured many pages which look alike to the human eye, but apparently contain h=
idden text that can be searched for and found. =C2=A0Google-search has simp=
ly catalogued the search results, including the otherwise-invisible text. =
=C2=A0(White characters on a white background can't be read by eye, but the=
y can be read by Google-search.)


>> Some results are genuine, but most are apparently not.

> =C2=A0 =C2=A0...that work against an IT company that rules the universe a=

=C2=A0> =C2=A0 has a 'market cap' of 428 000 million dollars...
Again, I think you're wrong. =C2=A0What I believe I have seen does not "wor=
k against" anybody, except possibly me. =C2=A0Google is simply cataloguing =
the web pages it sees, as the person (or organization) that produced those =
pages intends. =C2=A0The only negative consequence, to Google-search, is th=
at they have to catalog a few hundred kilobytes more of web-pages. =C2=A0Th=
at's no skin off Google-search's nose. =C2=A0And as far as I understand, th=
e only tricky thing here is that text is present on these pages which canno=
t be read by a human. =C2=A0If I knew more about the Web than I do, I would=
 probably understand how to adjust my web browser to display visibly what w=
ould otherwise be invisible text. =C2=A0The next question is, "what does th=
is mean, and who produced this, and why?". =C2=A0 I posted this query to fi=
nd somebody who had experience in SEO techniques.
