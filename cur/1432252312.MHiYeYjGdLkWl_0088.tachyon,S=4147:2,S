Untrue.

Most people operating an illegal busines much prefer to have arrangements
that do not require the threat of breaking people's arms and legs.  An old
school tie much reduces the cost of doing business.

You do not want to know where someone lives, you want to know if he can be
trusted.  Indeed, if you know where someone lives, he probably knows where
you live.  Far better if both know the other can be trusted, and neither
knows where the other lives.
