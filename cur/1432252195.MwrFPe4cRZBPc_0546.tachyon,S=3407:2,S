 Trio try for better mobile security

The Trusted Mobile Platform from Intel, IBM and NTT DoCoMo aims to make
mobiles a better bet for secure networking
Daniel Robinson, IT Week 01 Nov 2004

Intel, IBM and mobile communications company NTT DoCoMo last week announced
a set of security specifications for mobile client devices. They said the
aim is to create a secure architecture for future wireless data services.

The Trusted Mobile Platform specification, available via the link below,
defines a set of hardware and software components plus communication
protocols that can be used to build devices with various levels of
security. It is intended to be an open standard, according to NTT DoCoMo
chief executive Takanori Utano.

The specification defines three classes of trusted mobile device (TMD),
ranging from handsets with no hardware security features to those that
include a trusted platform module (TPM) to handle cryptography functions
and hardware-enforced separation between trusted and untrusted applications
and their data. It also defines a set of protocols that allow a TMD to
communicate with other platforms more securely

The partnership brings together Intel's expertise in silicon and wireless
devices, IBM's experience of business security and NTT DoCoMo's knowledge
of security in wireless networks, the companies said.

"This collaboration enhances handheld architectures to provide the trusted
capabilities vital for widespread adoption of mobile commerce and
enterprise usage," said Intel vice-president Sean Maloney.

Chip designer ARM already includes technology called TrustZone in its
latest processor cores to provide separation between secure and non-secure
code. Although Intel uses ARM technology in its XScale mobile chips, the
company has not disclosed whether the Trusted Mobile Platform supports
technologies such as TrustZone.
