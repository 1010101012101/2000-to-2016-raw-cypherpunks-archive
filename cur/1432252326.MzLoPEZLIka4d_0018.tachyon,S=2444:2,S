True 'nuff.  But DRAM is so cheap you put a few tens o' megs in the
drive
and cache the hell out of it.

And the busses on the x86 have gotten much faster too.

And the CPU itself is caching things up the kazoo.  Remember the
640KB days?    Its easier to add cache than to add a Montgomery
unit, though instruction-sets are evolving towards symmetric crypto
too.   The FPGA players are noticing all this too.  Get an Arm (tm)
by default, or synthesize a soft CPU,
and buy a third-party verified Montgomery unit.  Maybe even
get to add your own instructions to the basic CPU unit.

And yeah, you keep enough pointers around, you can have some
pretty fast DBs.  Dereferencing spaghetti.  Or dodder in the forest
of trees.
