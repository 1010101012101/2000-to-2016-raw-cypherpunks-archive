"Vo. Ag." in a public school is certainly not where I would expect 
basic economics to be taught (more's the pity, but this is how things 
are).

Your words here indicate you don't understand the economics of 
middlemen, lubrication of markets, risk arbitrage, etc. Suffice it to 
say that "speculators" perform an incredibly important function. See 
any non-socialist textbook. (Even Samuelson, for example, as opposed 
to Prof. Raisa Gorbachev's text on socialist economics.)

See basic textbooks.
