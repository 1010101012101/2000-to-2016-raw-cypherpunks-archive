Well, you have not lost it nor has it has been "stolen".  You are simply barred
from using it.  This is the result of impersonation, since now the other person
is the one that has access to it.

The use of "identity theft" instead of impersonation is thus utterly misleading,
even though lawyers and lawmakers are the ones perpetrating such use.  No
legally relevant conclusions can be drawn from the misuse of the technical
term "theft" in the soundbite.

In comparison, defining non-repudiation in terms of protocol messages and
only for protocol messages is, at most, a solipsistic endeavor. However, it is
IMO a most useful one so that others, including lawyers and lawmakers, are
prevented from using it in a perverted way just because RFCs are written in
English.
