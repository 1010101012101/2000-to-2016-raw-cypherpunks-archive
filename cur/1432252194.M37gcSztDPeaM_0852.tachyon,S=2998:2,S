The Fourth still applies, even to hotel and motel residents (where the 
owner of course enters on a daily basis).

If it did not apply, then entire hotels and motels and apartment 
buildings would be swept for contraband, illegal sex material, drugs, 
guns, etc.

There was a controversial case in Chicago, which may still be pending, 
where the Housing Authority (?) was proposing to sweep the apartments it 
administered for guns. Civil libertarians pointed out the issues.
