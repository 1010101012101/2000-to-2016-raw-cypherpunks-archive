I strongly suggest that you look beyond simple all-or-nothing thinking 
about digital signatures; they are neither the "undeniable irrevocable 
absolutely certain proof of enforceability" that their proponents want to 
believe, nor are they "irrelevant" or worthless because of the mere 
possibility of key compromise.

Other kinds of proof and evidence with respect to transactions and 
agreements admit many more levels of nuance, meaning, and reliability and 
there's no reason to expect that digital signatures will prove to be any 
different .. or should be any different.
