"15 grams or
less of marijuana, the poll found"

15 Grams? Now I haven't smoked since about 84, but as I understand it 15 
grams these days could get a whole housing project high. Can anyone confirm 
this? (OK, an exageration, but 15 grams is enough stock for a petty dealer 
to keep on hand, no?)

Hey Canadians, don't bogart the bowl, eh?

>
>While the new law would impose fines for pot possession, yesterday's ruling

>the accused teenager.
>
>Courts in Nova Scotia and PEI have already put prosecutions on hold pending

>More telling, 63 per cent of respondents supported Ottawa's plans to issue

>For the moment, however, marijuana possession remains the most frequently
