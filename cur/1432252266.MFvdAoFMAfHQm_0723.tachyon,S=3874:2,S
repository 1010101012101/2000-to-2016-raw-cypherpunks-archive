1. encrypted data is indisttinguishable from uniformly distributed noise
2. LSBs in digitizations of analog signals are noise
3. ignoring the nuance of different LSB distributions, how can you
distinguish a stego'd from unaltered file?

Stego by itself is much less interesting than stego'd encrypted data
(with idenntifying headers stripped of course)

That spam, mp3, or image could be merely a transport for more privledged
info.  Posting /reading to a public newsgroup solves traffic-analysis
issues too.
