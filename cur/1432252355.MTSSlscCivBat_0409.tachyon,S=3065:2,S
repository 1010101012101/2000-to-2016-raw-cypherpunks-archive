Reply-To: ukcrypto@chiark.greenend.org.uk

Oxford University Computing Service have notified me that they intend
to cease forwarding mail sent to the old UKcrypto submission address,
ukcrypto@maillist.ox.ac.uk, as of 31st October. Please check that you
are no longer using that address.

Another request: if you mention UKcrypto on a website, please make
sure you are sending people to the right place! I receive a couple of
subscription requests per day bounced through the Oxford address,
which I currently deal with manually. If you link to UKcrypto, please
link to the URL
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ukcrypto
or for the archives:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/ukcrypto/

Thanks,

Steve Early
