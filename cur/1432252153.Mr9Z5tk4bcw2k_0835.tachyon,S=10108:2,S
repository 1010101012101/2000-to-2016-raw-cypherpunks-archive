Hello,

John, for some reason your name reminds me of someone who I think was
the ninth person to walk on the moon?  Same John Young? (long shot I
know) Just kidding though - you are the founder of Cryptome, right?

Anyway, It's not my intent here to ruffle any feathers (on this
thread), but I did want to suggest (and I'm sure someone has already
thought of this) that people be able to search for their names or IDs
in (searchable) databases of leaked info.

I think this came up in a thread on twitter some while back actually...
https://twitter.com/AnonyOdinn/status/344585372216487937

(That twitter thread was from a discussion in mid-2013[!] which
referenced MainCore and also (different than MainCore) a 'list of
targets' that Greenwald had mentioned, but regardless of if it's
MainCore or Greenwald's 'list of targets' or other such thing, I think
searchability is really important, which of course implies that really
all the data should be made available in some kind of format to allow
keyword searches.)
