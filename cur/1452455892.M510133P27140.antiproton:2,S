Sounds like the kind of thing that Tor and similar anonymity protections
were made for. Kind of sad that journalists, of all people, would have
to resort to publishing stories anonymously. As William Randolph Hearst
said, "Whatever a patron desires to get published is advertising;
whatever he wants to keep out of the paper is news." Or, as more often
phrased, journalism is that which someone doesn't want published, and
everything else is public relations (PR).

Back in Hearst's day, though, killing journalists to silence them was
unthinkable, and people in general had a bit more scruples back then.
