A characteristic of plants is that because they expect to
be eaten, they do not have vital organs, and regenerate
parts taken.

Thus, if a ciphersystem expected to be broken, it might
be able to mend the break, sacrifice parts to protect the
whole, without disclosing full content.

Surely there is a sytem that already does this. Multi-level
security may be close.

That a plant cannot move but depends upon absorbing
nutrients in its locale or delivered by movable actors --
insects, wind, rain, animals, other plant seeds -- might
also suggest a way to protect static machines and
networks.

Surely that is being done.

In both cases parts are sacrificed to movable actors who
are deluded to believe they rule over lesser beings which
they cannot understand.

So where are the eatable broken crypto which regenerates
itself without giving up full content, and networks which
are protected by use and traffic passing through? Tor might
be close to the latter for protecting content but the
hardware remains vulnerable.
