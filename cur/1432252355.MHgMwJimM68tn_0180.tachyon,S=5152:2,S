Yeah, of course. The clear answer is to ensure that this is done in a
sustainable manner as well. I don't mean fiscally either, I mean, more
than merely living through it and staying "free" for some sense of the word.

I'm not sure that I follow but it sounds poetic, as usual, John. ;-)

Indeed, on all counts.

I pre-empted his 9/11 trolling by talking about the holocaust. It
clearly surprised him and the entire event was captured on video. He
blamed FISA for 9/11, I blamed the FBI, NSA and CIA for being a bunch of
criminals that exceeded their authority - without their misdeeds, FISA
wouldn't even exist. He had nearly nothing to say to this assertion. I
think he doesn't often spar with people who will go toe to toe.

All the best,
Jacob
