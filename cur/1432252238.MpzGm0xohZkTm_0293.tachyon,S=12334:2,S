2005 Year in Review
What happened on the Underground (NHFree.com) during the last year
By Kat Dillon

The New Hampshire Underground is a loose organization of freedom
fighters composed mainly of  Free State Project
(<http://freestateproject.org)>http://freestateproject.org) members who
have already made the move
to NH.  There, these members worked with native New Hampshirites with
the encouragement of Freestaters still waiting to make the big move to
NH.  It is difficult to describe the incredible synergy from amassing
so many liberty lovers in one area.  The individuals who have left
family, friends, jobs to move cross country for freedom have an extra
incentive to get out there and work for liberty in our lifetimes.
They feel the need to prove they weren't crazy to uproot themselves
and move to the Frozen Wonderland of the North.  So people who were
timid and uninvolved in their previous life seem to blossom and become
involved after the move.  When surrounded by people who think like
they do, they are constantly encouraged to try new and greater feats
to promote freedom.  Plus, it is just plain fun being surrounded by
like-minded people!

Licensing civil disobedience
To support people's inherent right to seek work and provide for
themselves, Mike Fisher defied state licensing laws by giving an
unlicensed manicure in front of the state Board of Cosmetology. For
this offense, he was arrested and spent a day in jail. Currently,
there is a bill being introduced to reduce licensing requirements.

Free to travel civil disobedience
Russell Kanning attempted to board a flight to Philadelphia (the heart
of American liberty) with just a Bible and a copy of the Declaration
of Independence. Russell objected to the new requirements coming from
the Real ID act, and the loss of dignity of his fellow travelers who
are subjected to unreasonable searches. When he attempted to enter the
terminal without showing ID and without pat-down searches, he was
arrested and spent 2 days in jail.

Property tax revolt
Objecting to paying for a public school system that teaches children
that the government is the answer to every problem, Kat Dillon decided
to cease paying for the detrimental school system. Dillon homeschools
her child and does not use the school system and does not want to pay
for what she doesn't use. Rather than paying the city, she donated the
money that would have gone to the schools to the Liberty Scholarship
Fund. For reasons to abandon the public schools, see 101 Reasons the
Public Schools are Hopeless.

Separation of School and State booths
Last year we manned tables at various times to promote the idea of
Separation of School and State. We handed out leaflets and talked to
people about the idea of getting government out of education. In
addition, we talked to people about how education could be handled
privately with the help of organizations like the Liberty Scholarship
Fund.

UN flag burn
We staged multiple UN flag burning events over the last year+. The
first in Keene, Dec. 2004, several at the Porcupine Freedom Festival,
and the last in Keene, Dec. 2005. We were protesting the UN attempts
at world taxation, gun control, and one world government.

Protests for Myrtle Woodward
The family of Myrtle Woodward, a 96 year old Hampton resident, wished
to keep her at home rather than putting her in a nursing home. In
order to do this, they needed to expand their home to accommodate her.
The city refused permits to do this building, and then accused the
family of building the room anyway. Hampton city officials slapped the
family with a $200,000 fine. Many from the Underground protested
outside Hampton City Hall and Rockingham County Courthouse over the
early months in 2005.

April 15th tax protest
On tax day, we gathered at the main Manchester post office to protest
the income tax. People stayed from 11am to Midnight to hand out
literature about the injustice of the income tax.

Souter protest
The Supreme Court decision in Kelo vs. New London angered many of us
on the Underground. When vying attempts to seize Supreme Court Justice
Souter's Weare property via eminent domain arose, Undergrounders
rallied for and against Souter. Purists wished to have no one lose
their property through eminent domain, while others viewed it as
poetic justice for Souter to lose his own property.

Robert Saulnier protests
After the town of Londonderry seized his property, Robert Saulnier
began protesting on his own land. He was arrested for trespassing.
Undergrounders rallied for Saliner when he went to trial and after his
trial.

FEMA protest
In protest of FEMA's actions in New Orleans, several of us burned FEMA
flags outside the federal building in Concord. FEMA arranged the
confiscation of legally owned firearms in NO and deliberately
interfered with relief efforts.

Free Lauren Canario
Freestater Lauren Canario moved from Nevada to New London, CT to help
protect the homeowners who were losing their homes through eminent
domain (Kelo vs. New London). When attempting to attend a public city
council meeting regarding the eminent domain, Lauren was arrested. She
then refused to cooperate with her thug abductors and was held in jail
for two weeks. (Lauren's my hero! KD)

Social security card burn
Several of us met outside the Social Security Office in Concord to
burn our social security cards. We were protesting the corrupt system
that forces people to pay into it like a Ponzi scheme and the use of
the SS cards as a defacto national ID card.

Londonderry property rights rally
30 people rallied at the airport for Londonderry property owners who
were in danger of losing land through eminent domain. The Town of
Londonderry and the airport stand to gain from the stolen land.

Litter pick-up
Freestaters banded together to tackle trash on the highway in
Peterborough. The FSP participated in the Adopt a Highway program in
2005, and will continue to do so in 2006. The idea was to show what
can be done through voluntary effort, as opposed to involuntary
taxation. Plus we helped keep NH looking beautiful and had fun doing it!

Free Jim Perry
To symbolize Jim Perry's newfound freedoms from moving to NH, we
chained him to a pole in Nashua at the MA border and cut his chains of
Massachusetts statism. He was then allowed to enter NH where he drove
without a seatbelt, openly carried his firearm, and burned his MA tax
forms.

Keene Free Press
We started up our own newspaper, the Keene Free Press as an outlet for
information about corrupt government and liberty related issues.

Freedom Friends Tuath
A community of friends has formed, the Freedom Friends Tuath based on
the Zero Aggression Principle. Members agree to ZAP and agree to seeks
Tuath arbitration rather than using the courts when having a dispute
with other Tuath members. The Tuath is designed as a voluntary
alternative to government, with members seeking to assist one another
whenever possible.

So much more happened in NH in the last year, so I tried to narrow it
down to just the things that were planned on the Underground for this
review. Please do visit our friends at the New Hampshire Liberty
Alliance, Liberty Scholarship Fund, Coalition of New Hampshire
Taxpayers, Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, Republican Liberty
Caucus of New Hampshire, Liberty Ladies, The Liberty Conspiracy,
NHCASPIAN and Gun Owners of New Hampshire to see more of the exciting
things happening in NH!
