The bigger and more glaring flaw--pointed out by many of us, years 
ago--was in having an identifiable nexus for pressure to be applied. 
Cf. the archives for much discussion of what would happen when MI-6 
finally got tired of them, or of when Mossad decided to do something 
about things, or when Hollywood got fed up.

Bruce Sterling dealt with this in "Islands in the Net," circa 1988, 
which predated Cypherpunks by several years and which was coming out 
just about when I was writing up my first things on crypto anarchy. I 
though Sterling had placed much too much emphasis on the havens' 
attempt to be physically secure by owning small countries and not 
nearly enough (if any) emphasis on using strong cryptography to achieve 
security inside cypherspace, a la "True Names."

The idea of being secure in plain sight within the claimed territorial 
waters of Britain was just too laughable.
