JFK's father bought him the election. Look at the voting in Illinois, 
look at his father, the bootlegger. (I have nothing against 
bootlegging, but the hypocrisy of the Kennedy Clan railing against 
perceived moral crimes while making their family fortune off of 
bootlegging and graft is precious.)

Bay of Pigs backfired, so Cuban Missile Crisis was the reserve plan.

Escalating a nonexistent alliance with the Republic of South Vietnam, a 
cabal of dictators, into a war.

I'm old enough to remember the Kennedy years and to remember how many 
people thought a bullet ought to end his power grab.

Of course, he was canonized and sainted after his "sacrifice," and so 
one seldom heard after this death the call I remember from 1961-62: 
"Someone ought to put a bullet in that bastard's head."

How soon we forget, and how much we have forgotten in this modern era 
that calling for the kiling of the Chief Criminal used to be a lot more 
common than it is today. It used to be we knew when bozos needed 
killing, and we weren't afraid of opining thusly. Today, however, The 
Criminal Whose Name May Not Be Uttered is uniquely protected from 
"Someone ought to frag his ass" comments.

I liked it better when we thought "Good riddance!" when the Kennedy 
criminals were killed.
