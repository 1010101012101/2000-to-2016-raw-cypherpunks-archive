I'm not interested in trying to get published in "Down with WTO Times" 
or "Skateboard Magazine," or whatever it is that these kids are 
reading. (Actually, I don't think most of them do much reading. I spend 
a lot of time in the great bookstores in Santa Cruz--rarely do I see 
the "persons of piercing" leave their hangouts out on Pacific Avenue to 
enter the bookstores, except to try to use the restrooms.)

And the problem is not even so much with Gen X but with Gen Y, or 
whatever they are being called these days.

I reach who I reach. Their choice to read what I write.

I see an explosion of Blogs, the daily musings of people involved in 
EPIC, EFF, etc.

This is similar to the explosion of personal Web pages several years 
ago, when home pages had snippets of philosophy, lists of books people 
had read, etc.

(And perhaps just as so many of these personal Web pages fell into 
disrepair and were seldom looked-at by others, the wave of personal 
Blogs will crest and then decline in amplitude.)

So, you are free to be "Matt Gaylor, Activist!" and to try to get 
articles published in "Liberty" or "Gold Currency Times" or wherever 
you get published, but I have other things I'd rather be doing.

Preaching to me that I ought to be sacrificing my time for the 
betterment of some skatepunks by publishing in "Piercing Magazine" is 
the silliest kind of altruistic thinking.
