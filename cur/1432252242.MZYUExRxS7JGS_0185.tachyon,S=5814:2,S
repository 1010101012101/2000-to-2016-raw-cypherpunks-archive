I read about this a couple days ago. The reason for the stop is
interesting - apparently Mr. Smoak left his wallet on the roof of
the car. After they started down the highway, it blew off, scattering
bills. 

Another driver saw the flying wallet and currency, thought it had
been thrown out the window, and called it in as a carjacking/robbery
in progress.

The cops accepted this, hence the felony stop.
