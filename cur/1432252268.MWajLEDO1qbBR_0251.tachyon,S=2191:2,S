Oh no! Loss of the Houston library card! My passport to knowledge!!!

Well, the idea would be not to get caught. I'm thinking basically of just 
adding one of those $40 Tor nubbins at the end of a USB cable and then 
tucking the nubbin under the carpet with a sign saying, "DO NOT TOUCH". If 
it lasts a month then it might be money well spent, particularly if Al Qaeda 
successfully nukes DC.

Damn. They blocked Telnet? They might as well just block TCP/IP. Do they do 
this by blocking the likely ports or by merely de-balling the protocol stack 
somehow? I assume Tor is smart enough to try various open ports....
