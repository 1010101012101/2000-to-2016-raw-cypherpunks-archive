True, the devil is everywhere, unavoidable, only religion can
save you sinners whose souls must be spied by conscience,
confession to god's agents for forgivenss and guidance the
only protection. Give generously to the building fund.

Spies have forever preached this panopticism of the kindly
and wise overseer, along with authoritarians of endless
diversity and venality. How they fear the collapse of their
temples, their insiders becoming apostates, their servants
throwing off yoke of authority, rising up to lop howling heads
apraying for forgiveness, the untutored no longer willing to
accept the autocracy of the learned.

Then learned preachers call in their wholly supportive and believing
cops of coercion where might overrules reason and kindliness,
then the prayerful affirm the righteousness of law and order,
the need for ubiquitous spying, then judges, legislators, lawyers
and educators are blessed with allegedly supreme wisdom
and rewarded with mighty fine perquisites and stay out of jail
no matter how corrupt and devilish, albe the perks are limited
to the religion of male supremacy, disguised in all genders,
armed to the max against their demon-righteously angry subjects.

Senator Diane Feinstein dislikes the word "survellance"
as spies dislike the word "spies." They all share a faith
in complicitously necessary oversight of everyone-is-an-
agent-of-the-devil-in-disguise except themselves -- for
themselves only top secrecy faith in national security
armed with megadeath retribution to shield the shrewdly
aggrandizing learned in their temples of rationality for
thinking deeply and kindly of how next to fuck the public.
As their god wills and panoptically spies full spectrum
emanations (once known as vapors of sin).
