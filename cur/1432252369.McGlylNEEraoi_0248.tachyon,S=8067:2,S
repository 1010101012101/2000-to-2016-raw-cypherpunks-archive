Afaik, skype used a central lookup to get to unknown peers, not a DHT.
So they perhaps knew who wanted to talk to who. Of course now skype
is untrusted by anyone with a clue.

Sure, there's a class of users that want this, a big class. They can
have and use their modified legacy centralized email as they wish.
There's another big class that want's something more than that.

We're also going to see faster hardware, lighter code, and maybe
even wearable battery packs... because as you say, these users
want it all and are willing to go to almost any means to get it.

There could also be ways to make the heavier weight anonymous
routing p2p transport let these lightweight clients stub in just to make a
direct p2p connection for encrypted voip/messaging (if say you
published your node as accepting that option).

We're exploring ideas. What is to say we are able to develop into it some
kind of automaton taho-lafs delivery storage nodes. Storing messages in
transit under some expiry policy is not a huge space concern. So who knows.

Maybe everyone with their uber important phones will end
up VPN to their home/colo servers where the horsepower is.

Predicting mobile is hard. Throw more apps out there and your
$30-50/mo unlimited data plans go away. Now is everyone going
to pay $150+/mo for that? Where is free open wifi going to end up
spanning? And so many other things.

What I think is clear is that there will for the far to indefinite forseeable
future be some form of real workstation/laptop in the home and office.
Phones just can't replace that. Maybe we're seeing something in how
you see larger tablet/netbooks/laptops with headsets being carried about
now as if it is natural. And lots of those people will want a highly
secure system to communicate over with their peers in this new
world of disgustingly gratuitous surveillance and databasing.
I would not underestimate the demand for that sort of a comms system.

That could be the multimodal thing above. Or the in network thing.

DSPAM, spamassassin, clamav and the like do fairly well enough
on their own locally.

I suggest not cataloging a defeatist list of what you think you can't
do... but rather what you could do, what you would gain and what
could happen if you build it :)

That's why you should be doing the development of these new
protocols entirely within existing secure networks such as Tor
and I2P. And why you should bootstrap via peers instead of
clearnet authorities like Tor that can be shutdown... it's a little
less secure, but you can have in network authorities wrapped
in web of trust and then rejoin listening only to them later. And
if clearnet get''s that bad, it becomes a freedom of speech issue
which is well, SHTF time.
