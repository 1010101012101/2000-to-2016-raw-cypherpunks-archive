I haven't paid enough attention to AF to be able to form an opinion as to
whether she's threatened anyone. However, her second sentence is such a
strange Clintonesque legalistic circumlocution that it raises questions 
as to just what she may be be tiptoeing around (possibly nothing). 

If her character could not be 'placed into question' ... 'in this regard',
to just
what exactly is she responding? Why can't she just make a clear, 
unambiguous statement, as in the first sentence? There seem to be at 
least 3 levels of ambiguity in the second sentence.

A better followup would have been: "If you maintain otherwise,
show the quote where I am threatening someone. Put up or shut up."
