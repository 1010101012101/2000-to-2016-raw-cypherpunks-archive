It's a top-down problem. They're only doing what they believe is their
job as defined by their controllers. These sort of events just show what
those in power think of their fellow citizens. Expect it to get worse if
we get a Republican-controlled government and the resulting Republican
Supreme Court appointees. Just look at the dissenters in the recent
Indianapolis Drug Search decision. The Republicans seem to be more
authoritarian than the Democrats though overall they both stink like
last week's fish guts.
