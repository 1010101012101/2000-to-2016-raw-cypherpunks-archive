 REVIEW & OUTLOOK



Internet Pirates
August 10, 2004; Page A10

If you own a movie or record copyright, and someone else "induces" people
to start infringing it, should you be able to sue the inducer? Senator
Orrin Hatch thinks so, and it's possible his bad idea could become bad law.

Granted, he's trying to address a real copyright problem. Music labels and
movie studios are playing a frustrating game of whack-a-mole, with new
Internet file-sharing networks popping up faster than the recording
industry can protest. The newest networks, including KaZaa and Morpheus,
are run as for-profit piracy havens but have found ways to skirt copyright
laws.

They display advertising on users' desktops but make sure that individual
users, rather than anyone in corporate HQ, handle the actual dirty work of
infringing copyright. The network operators then claim to be shocked by the
illegal activity of individual file traders -- even though they're well
aware that their users aren't swapping Shakespeare.

Trouble is, the facts don't support the idea that legal action against
these network operators would help in the larger fight against piracy.
Napster's court-ordered shutdown in 2001 might have been a symbolic triumph
over intellectual property theft, but it caused only a minor hiccup in the
supply chain for pirated media. The new firms that took its place (the ones
that Mr. Hatch's bill targets) are housed outside the U.S., which makes it
tough to make them pay a court judgment.

Long after they're gone, old copies of their software will allow new
swappers to join the party. And even if none of these problems existed,
there is already a second tier of file sharing programs like BitTorrent
created by hobbyists who don't profit from piracy, and make lean targets
for lawsuits.

Which brings us to Mr. Hatch's legislation, known as the Induce Act, which
gives copyright holders a cause of action to sue anyone who "induces" the
violation of their copyrights. While it wouldn't make much of a dent in the
Internet piracy problem it's designed to solve, it would unleash a wave of
frivolous lawsuits. Makers of technologies ranging from computers and
multimedia software to portable music players could find themselves in the
crosshairs, on the theory that their wares encourage infringement.

Even if the industry's major players showed restraint in using their new
power to sue, technology producers would have to contend with the most
litigious of copyright holders. Winning such suits, as legitimate
technology producers hopefully would, is financially burdensome, especially
to startups. The prospect of costly court battles would deter new
investments in technology.

Mr. Hatch claims his bill would leave in place a Supreme Court ruling that
protects the makers of general-purpose technologies from copyright
liability. Even if he were right, the conceptual problem with criminalizing
tools is inescapable. As long as the necessary legal umbrella protecting
technology tools stays in place, the shadier network operators will find a
way to shelter themselves under it.

The better legal tools to stop file traders are hidden in plain sight, in
pre-Internet U.S. copyright law. "Willful" infringement -- when the copier
knows, or should know, that he's over the line -- carries a statutory
penalty of $150,000 per illegal copy. The content industry can also
continue to sue individual pirates. With penalties this high, it doesn't
take very many suits to substantially increase the expected cost of
pirating an album or film.

These suits aren't popular with customers, which is why music and movie
companies are asking Congress for other ways of stopping piracy. But it's
high time providers and consumers alike bit the bullet and recognized that
individual users who pirate content really do deserve steep punishment.
That's a better solution than creating more causes of action for the trial
bar.
