Simply asking for and receiving bomb info is not a crime. However, if you
were to say carry on a private conversation or help provide parts with
such a person then the whole game changes; conspiracy. Where you'd fuck up
in this situation would be in carrying on any sort of private email
exchange outside of 'go the hell away punk'.

It's also no big deal to buy such books at the local bookstore.
