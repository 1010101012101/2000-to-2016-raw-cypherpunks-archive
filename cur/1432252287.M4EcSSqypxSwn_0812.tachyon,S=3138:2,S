A silly comment. I take it you're saying "Because the rules don't allow 
it." Or something similar to this.

The "rules" are precisely what we are discussing.

And "vote buying" is much more widespread than what happens at the 
lowest level we happen to be talking about here, where Alice is paid 
$10 to vote for some particular candidate. In fact, vote buying is much 
more common and more dangerous at the level of political 
representatives.

Appealing to "the rules" (what your Djinni state as the rules) is 
nonproductive. Payoffs and kickbacks can be declared illegal, but they 
continue to happen in various ways.

Liberty is characterized in the .sig below:


""Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. 
Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote!"
-- Ben Franklin
