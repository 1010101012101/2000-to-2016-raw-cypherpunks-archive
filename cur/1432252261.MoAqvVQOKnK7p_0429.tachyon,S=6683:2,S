I think that's pretty on the money. Terrorism doesn't actually need to 
affect any single Head Bandit, but after a regime change or two and a 
pullout occurs the new Bandit can say "We meant to do that anyway." The 
French and Algeria is a great example.

The Mosaic analogy was a good one, too, and not even original: See John 
Adams' "The Death of Leon Klinghoffer" and you'll know why it took so much 
heat....having Palestinians singing phrases from Exodus and Psalms was just 
a little too much for the music-funding establishment. It says a lot, 
however, that the guy still gets commissions.
