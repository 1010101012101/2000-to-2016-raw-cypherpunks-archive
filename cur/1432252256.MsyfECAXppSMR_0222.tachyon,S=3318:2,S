Subject: Crypto-related domain name auction to benefit FSF and FSFE

Hi everyone,

I have a few crypto-related domain names that I bought a few years ago for one
project or another.  (Among other ideas, I had once thought to set up a 'who
will sign my PGP key?' exchange, but then biglumber.com did it so well, there
was little point in doing it all over again).  I've been sitting on the
domains for a while, but they're not really doing anyone any good like that.
So, rather than just letting them expire and be snapped up by link farms, I
thought I could do something more useful for the community - auction them off
and donate the money to the FSF and FSFE.

The 5 domain names are:

 keyservers.net
 keyservers.org
 (I don't own keyservers.com - it's parked by someone with advertising links
on it)

 keysigners.com
 keysigners.net
 keysigners.org

I figured a two-week auction period would do it, but if someone feels strongly
that isn't enough time, let me know.  The basic idea is that people can send
me their bids for each domain name, and I will post the current high bids
(without identifying the bidder) on
http://www.jabberwocky.com/domain-auction.html

After the auction is over, I will notify the high bidder for each domain that
they are the winner.  The auction winner is responsible for sending the
winning bid directly to the FSF or FSFE (winner's choice).  An easy way to do
this is via Paypal to donate@fsf.org or paypal@fsfeurope.org, but other means
are available if necessary.  Once the FSF or FSFE confirms to me the donation
has arrived, the auction winner and I can do the usual domain name transfer
process.

Any questions or comments?  I'd like to start the auction on Monday (May
24th).  Feel free to forward this note to anyone who might be interested in
the domains.

David
