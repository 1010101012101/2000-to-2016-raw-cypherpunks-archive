An e-gold account is a gold demoninated, offshore account.

Same for Pecunix, which has been more recently audited, has
better security provisions -- it provides for PGP based login,
etc.  It is less widely accepted than e-gold, but provides a
better deal.  Did I mention it has been more recently audited.
And just in case you missed it, e-gold has not been audited for
a while.

None of these accounts provide Chaumian anonymity, which means
they can track identity, which means they must track identity,
which costs them.

However one can withdraw, and deposit, physical gold, which
actually is anonymous, and provides a physical mix, since one
gold atom looks very like another.
