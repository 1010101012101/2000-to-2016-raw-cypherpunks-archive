Yes, he does. But he says that about invading _Afghanistan_, not Iraq.
He says that he took W's word on Iraq. That does not reflect well on
him, and I'm disappointed that he hasn't acknowledged his error. But so
it goes.

It it were vengeance the US wanted, they should have invaded Saudi
Arabia :) Free oil! They should also have cut off the fucking Israelis,
who knew that the attack was immanent.
