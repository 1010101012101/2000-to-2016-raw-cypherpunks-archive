US launches 'anti-terror' satellite

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1582000/1582673.stmThe
United States has launched a satellite which intelligence analystssay will
probably be used to gather information in the global campaignagainst terrorism.The
Titan IV rocket was launched from Vandenberg airforce base inCalifornia on
behalf of the US National Reconnaissance Office, asecretive agency specialising
in providing information for the CIA andthe National Security Agency.The rocket
is believed to have been carrying a top secret KH-11 spysatellite - that could
monitor Afghanistan ahead of an expected militarystrike.The US Air Force refused
to comment on the payload, but the NRO buildsand operates America's spy satellites
and specialises in gatheringpictures and electronic data, such as telephone
conversations on theground.Pin-point accuracyExperts from Aviation Week and
Space Technology Magazine said thesatellite was likely to be equipped with
a digital camera able to pickout objects as small as 10 cm (4 inches) across
on the ground.Orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth the 15 tonne KH-11
is capableof tracking small groups of people walking on the ground as well
asvehicle and weapons movements.It can monitor conversations and even spot
campfires at night usinginfrared technology.Identifying the enemyAccording
to Aviation Magazine such information could be used to monitorthe movements
of Taleban groups and refugees to help allied forcesseparate potentially hostile
groups from "non-combatants".The United States is believed to have spy satellites
over Afghanistanalready as US forces continue to build up nearby ahead of expectedmilitary
strikes.Before 1996 the NRO did not publicly disclose the launches of itssatellites.
