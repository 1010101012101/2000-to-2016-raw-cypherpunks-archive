You could make a black bag teams' job much harder with some
epoxy.  At a price of making whatever you're securing closed forever.
But keyboards are cheap.  You'd have to secure the cable too, against those
inline keystroke recorders.  And the rest of the PC.

A good idea for circumstances like computers in offices which are
not secured against cleaning people....  Or if you're paranoid but don't
shower with your 'Pilot.
