Inaccurate indeed.  List owner policies have nothing to do with it.  Jim's
assertion, your mockery of it, and my mockery of your similar assertion back in
1997 all had to do with intellectual property rights, not list owner policies.

I am looking forward to hearing you explain that the assertion "you own your
words" is not an assertion about intellectual property rights.  But I'm not
holding my breath....
