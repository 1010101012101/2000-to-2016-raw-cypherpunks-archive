Kill metadata and other crypto-issue-overdone diversions.

Metadata and other crypto-workarounds resulted from the
crypto wars of the 1990s which were bragged to be won
rather than faked out.

The fake-out was orchestrated by some of the very same
crypto warriors claiming to be against gov-controlled crypto.

A way to identify them is to note who rose to prominence and
wealth in crypto com-edu-org. Still at it, ratcheting up the need
for ever more crypto, acknowledging the workarounds but, but,
but: Let's Encrypt, HTTPS-HTS everywhere, secure drops,
freedom of the press and courage foundations, Snowden
talks and tweets, FISC amicus curiea, POTUS and TLA advisories,
industry lobbyists, dual hats riding the crypto gravy train and
more likely, the subway out of sight.

The money and prestige to be gained by working all sides of
the crypto phony war is, as Greenwald crows of Omidyar's $250M
bribe, irresistable.

Crypto has always been a cheating game. Public key crypto even
more so -- open source vetting: math marked cards.
