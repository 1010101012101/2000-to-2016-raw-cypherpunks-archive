Have not seen it, in large part because I would not expect 
anything written by Michael Moore to contain even a grain of 
truth, and various people have asserted that everything said in 
"Bowling for Columbine' is untrue.

For all I know it could be gospel, but that would surprise me 
considerably.

and the mass murder of innocents.

There was nothing unethical about allying with Stalin, Pol Pot, 
or Saddam against their and our common enemies.
