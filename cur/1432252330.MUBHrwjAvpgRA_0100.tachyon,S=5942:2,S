If you're not already removed from the list, you should look at the message 
headers and find the Sender: line. Take that domain name (ssz.com or 
cyberpass.net or algebra.com or something) and send mail with "help" in the 
body to majordomo@thatdomainname.com.

Or you could find the original message you received when you signed up, 
which is probably easier.
