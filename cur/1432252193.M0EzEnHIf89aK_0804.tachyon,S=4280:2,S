Hello,

My name is Michael Paris, head of the Trojan analysis 
department for LockDown Corp. located in in Dover 
New Hampshire.

While searching the Internet for security related 
web pages and information, I found your email address 
on the URL http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.98.06.08-98.06.14/msg00122.html

Kindly note that I am a real person and not some 
hightech spambot, that cannot be contacted by 
email or telephone and I am sending this email through 
the click on email address cypherpunks@toad.com 

I am sending this message in hope that you would
be concerned about this particular security threat 
and would want to inform your friends and associates so
that they will not be fooled by this or others like it 
in the future. 

You can help to inform people by having the following
link added to as many web pages as possible or simply 
forward this email to them.

we have done in our product LockDown Millennium.
