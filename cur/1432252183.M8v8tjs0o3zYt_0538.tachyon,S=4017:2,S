Wouldn't it be much more efficient to use Cypherpunk technologies to 
make their espionage widely known to their subjects? That way the 
targets of the CIA spying could simply find ways to dispose of the 
spies locally.

That would presumably deter anthropologists acting as spies and 
saboteurs more than all of the "official denunciations" ever could.

Note: This has happened several times, actually. A list of spies 
pretending to be cultural attaches resulted in the assassinations of 
CIA agents in Athens, Bogota, and other cities. Sounds fair to me.
