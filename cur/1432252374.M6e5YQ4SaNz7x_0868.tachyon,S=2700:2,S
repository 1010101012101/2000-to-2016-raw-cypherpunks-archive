No need.  A govt has the means for secret payments and secret
missions already.  Why would Mossad bother with anon tech when it already
has skilled personnel on salary?   Similarly with well funded NGOs like
Mafia or FARC.

As for the rest of your post, yes, it would seem inevitable that
various "options and futures" shenanigans would evolve, just as they
have in other markets.

Even mixed ones.  Bet that Intel's stock will rise above some level
XOR some number of AMD design engineers will meet an untimely death
within the same quarter :-)
