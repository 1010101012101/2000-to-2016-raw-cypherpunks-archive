Here's another link on licensing of software engineers, this time from the
ACM:

http://www.acm.org/serving/se_policy/report.html

it seems that cryptographic/security software, if we ever get the
liability structure whose lack is often pointed out by Schneier ("we don't
have good security because we don't have to"), may be a prime target for
such licensing.
