It's cute, but it won't wash.
The problem is that a list like this doesn't provide any
Obscurity to its users unless there are a large number of subscribers.
One reader out of a thousand is slightly Obscure.
One reader out of three just isn't.
Adding large numbers of posters to the list doesn't help,
though you could use it as a dead drop for those NYTimes subscriptions
and egroups subscriptions if you wanted.

A gateway from alt.anonymous.messages might be fun anyway.
Back when people read Usenet on their own machines,
instead of getting it from an ISP via NNTP clients,
Usenet groups gave readers Pretty Good Obscurity.
That might still be the case at universities or companies
that maintain their own news feeds, but there aren't a lot any more,
especially since a full newsfeed takes multiple T1s full-time.
