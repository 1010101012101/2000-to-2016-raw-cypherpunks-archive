I'm pretty heretical about this. I think if we had decapitated Iraq, went
after our military objectives, like securing what was a threat to us,
including Iraq's senior military and political leadership and their weapons
stockpiles, and left political order to emerge there on its own, like we
did in Afghanistan, we could have done it with Rumsfeld's original 50,000
troop estimate.

No. Seriously. :-).

Cheers,
RAH
