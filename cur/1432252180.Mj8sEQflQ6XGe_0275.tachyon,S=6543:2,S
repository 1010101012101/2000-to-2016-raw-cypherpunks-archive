So the obvious question is, does this speed up the cracking capabilities of 
computers? On the surface, I'd say no, but then again I'm no computational 
science expert. (I say no because any of the primes used in X-bitlength 
encryption are already known, and these strings of primes aren't going to be 
used any more frequently than any random batch of primes.)
