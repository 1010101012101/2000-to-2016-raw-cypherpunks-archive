NYC is extra special because of the high number of foreigners who died.
If you killed a random 6000 in kansas you wouldn't get the impact.
Getting international businesses in the former WTC is extra points too.
There's a bunch of guys with turbans and beards holding up white boards
with
5.8 6.0 5.9 5.9 5.8 on it somewhere.

Also because of the density, everyone is a few 'hops' ('degrees of
separation',
'erdos number') from someone who is affected.  That is, first you kill a
lot because
the 6000 were packed so dense, then on top of that you affect a lot more
'out of state' because
you've gotten the attentioin of the 1e7 in the city who have connections
everywhere.
You can get a first-person report from any of ten million (less 6000)
viewpoints...
