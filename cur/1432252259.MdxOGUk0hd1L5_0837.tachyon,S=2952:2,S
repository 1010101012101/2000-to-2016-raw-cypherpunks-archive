Any Cypherpunks discussion on the topic would be in the archives,
at http://www.inet-one.com/ in Singapore.  You're probably better off
looking on a general-purpose web search engine,
or looking at specialized sites such as nwfusion.com or eetimes.com.
I think Nortel developed some of that technology,
but I don't know if they're the latest and hottest stuff.



				Thanks!
