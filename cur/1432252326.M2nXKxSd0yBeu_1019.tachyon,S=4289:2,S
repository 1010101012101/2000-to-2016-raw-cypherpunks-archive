Well, shit there's an idea. Particularly if the virus is benign enough not 
to get noticed too often.
A mini-mixmaster is a particularly wonderful idea, if you could get it to 
work....in fact, imagine a mixmaster network where each node only exists for 
a short amount of time. Your P2P ID messages for the mixmaster network 
should be invisible to users of the ostensible services of course.
