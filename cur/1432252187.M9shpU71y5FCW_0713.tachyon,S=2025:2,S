Well, clearly there's the frequency on which the satellites broadcast
(~1500MHz).  I think his point was that to jam the GPS you've got to put
out RF energy on the appropriate frequency, which would then be
traceable to you.

Of course, you can do a bit better by using the external antenna jack
and feeding the signal straight into the phone.  Make sure in this
case that you're using low enough power that you don't blow up the
front end.
