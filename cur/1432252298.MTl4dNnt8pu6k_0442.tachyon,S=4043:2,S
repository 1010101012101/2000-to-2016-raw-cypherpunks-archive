Indeed.

Some years ago, in 1993, I used an anonymous remailer (I think I used 
a remailer, but I may have just posted it directly) to advertise 
a"nude lolita." Just as your example cites. ("Lolitas" being a code 
word for young girls, snatch, er, natch.)

Much gnashing of teeth, much demand that the author be tracked down 
and prosecuted.

I wonder how long a Freedom nym would have lasted?

After several days of merriment, I pointed out that that _diagonal_ 
of my .GIF ASCII text block read: "t H i S i s N O t A r e a L i M a 
G E," or something similar to this. I just took a PGP-encrypted text 
block I had laying around, edited it to add the hidden disclaimer, 
then remailed the alleged "Lolita" to places where the call for 
censorship would be predictable.

I had always planned to someday get a Freedom account and use my 
"five nyms" for some true tests of how free the free speech they 
advocate really is. The lack of a Mac version has held me back, as I 
only have a PC emulator, and I never use it for the Net.

Anyone know how well Freedom 1.1 operates under Virtual PC 3.0 
running Windows 98 SE with underlying Mac PPP and TCP/IP services?

I may still get an account and really go to town with the most 
outrageous uses I can think of, then report back here on how many 
nyms lasted for how long.
