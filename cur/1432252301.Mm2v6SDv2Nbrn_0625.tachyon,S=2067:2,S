Actually, Lucre uses the double-blinding method to avoid this. The paper
discusses the ZK proof as an alternate way of doing it, but I chose not
to use it because of its potential interpretation as a blind signature.

There is an implementation of the ZK proof included in Lucre just for
fun, though.

Cheers,
