Hi, Digitalfolklore!

Hope you wanted to send this message to cypherpunks lists, not for me in
special.  :)

I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/

Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.

I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about  <https://ourresponse.org>  and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.

Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.

It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)

Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)

Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)

It would be fun to use Tor Project panties.  I still use their stickers in
my notebooks and devices, even after all this mess.  It's a pity that
g-strings have no much area to onions or Schneier facts, hahaha!!!  ;D

There are Schneier Facts T-shirts, but cryptography in panties would be
awesome, wow!!!  Loved the idea!!! Ok, I will consider it just for fun!  <3
