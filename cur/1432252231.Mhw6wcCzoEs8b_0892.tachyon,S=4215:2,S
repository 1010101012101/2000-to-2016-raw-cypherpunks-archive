No shit Sherlock, when did that dawn upon you?  But hey, guess
what?  When you go to driving school, you have nice stickers on the car
that say "Student Driver" and you have an instructor (car master?) who has
a second brake incase you fuck up so you can learn.

But once you leave the driving school and have your license, you're in the
real world.  You don't have the student driver stickers, nor the "car
master" next to you.

In an airplane with 3-4 terrorists, you'd presumably be one passenger of
120.  If even 5% of the passengers had guns, none would have to reload.  I
highly doubt that they would need a weapons master to tell them how to
hold a gun.  I certainly think that most people would be glad they were
alive and unhurt thanks to said gun carriers, and would mind the ringing
in their ears far less than being dead.

And certainly assuming most guns have at least 6 shots, multiplied by 6
people (that's 5% of 120 people) would give you 36 shots to put 4 assholes
out of everyone's misery, I don't think you have to worry about reloading.

You have very little to add to this conversation Mr. Anti Gun.
