After reading the handful of messages that made it through lne.com's 
filters, I double-checked my "trash" directory to see what my own 
filters had thrown away.

Some kind of new record: 18 messages from Choate, posted during just 
a 2-hour period this morning. From the headers, most look to be 
Choategrams giving us pointers to what Yahoo or CNN make readily 
available.

(One pulled at random: 
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20010721/wl/summit_protests_46.html
"Summit Protests Rage for Second Day")


Gee, Choate, how would we know about yesterday's news, reported 
widely, discussed here, if you didn't pass on a pointer to Yahoo?

Some would call it mail-bombing the list to disrupt it. Perhaps. But 
I expect it's just plain cluelessness. Some kind of "URL Tourette's 
Syndrome."

Thank Baal for filtering tools.
