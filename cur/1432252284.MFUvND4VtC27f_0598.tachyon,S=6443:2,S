Mr. Blank Frank,

I simply asked for your assistance -- none of your repulsive filth was =
due me.  It's people like you -- or the perception that you tried to =
give me of you that I am trying to protect my son against.  When =
deception, filth, dishonesty, and the such as you have displayed rule =
this world ... when talking isn't the answer, a parent has the =
responsibilty to care for their child.  Perhaps you are not a parent, or =
you never had a parent that cared enough to protect -- but, I am one =
that will fight to the bitter end to protect the innocence of my =
children.  I simply asked for you assistance in cracking the .pwl file =
and your response was nothing to do with that request.  If you are =
unable to help me, no response would have been better than the one you =
sent.  I'm sorry that misery seems to emmanate from you -- there's a =
Peace that can be found in Your Creator ... may He bless you today.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Banks
