As I wrote in my previous article, IT IS NOT TRUE that private 
hospitals must accept all those who appear at their doorstep. This 
would be a "taking," and is not constitutionally permissable.

It may be that _some_ private hospitals take in _some_ emergency room 
cases, but they are not "required" to.
