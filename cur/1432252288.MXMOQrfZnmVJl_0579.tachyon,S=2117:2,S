My (perhaps flawed) reading of Steve's post was different from Tims: the
ISP bills the
*tapped* person for "misc unplanned network work", not the *tappers*.
The ISP puts it into their contract: if tapped by court order, we'll
bill you for our effort.

If your CPA has his time spent on govt things, can he bill you for it?
If your ISP is hassled by RIAA, can they bill you?  Certainly, if its in
your contract.
