Did it ever occur to you that WHO might have an agenda of its own
that its rankings are intended to advance?

That's bullshit.  "Liberals" in this country like to bitch and
moan about the suffering of the poor and how stingy the rest of
us are, even while most of the so-called poor have cell phones
hanging on their belts.  The poor aren't getting poorer, their
expectations are simply getting higher.  How many "poor" homes
don't have a color TV and a VCR?  To the extent that there are
things they are "forced" to do without, it largely reflects their
own personal choices and/or their lack of ambition.

The few that can really be called poor in this country are the
homeless, most of whom are either mentally disturbed or simply
ambitionless addicts and alcoholics (or both).
