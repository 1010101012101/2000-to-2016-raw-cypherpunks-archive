	No, the argument was over what it would be *right* for 
insurance companies to do.

	I am not calling you a thoughtless whiner because you 
disagree with me. I have disagreed with many on this list--including 
Mr. May, and Mr. Choate, but I would call neither of them thoughtless.

	You have consistently (in the short time you've been "here) 
advocated positions that indicate a severe lack of cycles spent on 
the ramifications of that which you argue.

	No, they wouldn't.

	Ailments caused by genetic predispositions, once they 
manifest, are *very* expensive, and help set the bell curve. In an 
insurance market with deregulated players (both providers and 
consumers) a companies would be forced to compete *much* harder than 
they do now.

	As it is, government influence in the Medical Insurance 
market has strongly distorted costs, and driven up the prices for 
medical care *and* insurance.
