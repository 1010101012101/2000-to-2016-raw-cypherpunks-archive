It's already a reality in some sports and some countries.
In France for instance, police can randomly drug test professional
cyclists at any time.  They can also search them, their
houses and cars at any time and with no warrant.

Italy also has somewhat similar provisions.

Perata is a well-known rights-taker.
He's also a well-known hypocrite, having sponsored gun-grabbing
legislation while using his position to get himself
a concealed weapon permit, something that is nearly always 
denied to ordinary California citizens.
