two serious possible outcomes:

a) BT goes over a large fish after making a few small ones pay, and the
large fish pays a couple mio. to a lawyer to find a loophole that
invalidates the patent.

b) BT strikes patent portfolio exchange deals with the large fish and
lets the small fish pay.


that's just how the patent system works.
and yes, there's possible 20k other patents out there that are just as
trivial and evil (subjectively, of course ;) ).
