   Just heard about this local guy who reluctantly went to Iraq because
he was in the reserves, now his contract is up (as of 7/31) and they 
won't let him out. 
========================================================================
Dear friends
     As many of you know I am in Iraq with the 724th
Eng Bn.  Many of you may not know however that on July 30th 2003 my
enlistment contract ended and the I have been involuntarily extended.  I
am now a prisoner of the US army.  I find it very troubling that the USA
would force people against their free will to be in
the military, furthermore the fact that their are
hundreds perhaps thousands of able bodied volunteer
soldier in the Wisconsin Army System that have not
been activated and that could replace those soldiers
who are in Iraq involuntarily.  I request you
assistance in helping me get home.  Free Moon!!

Below is a letter I have written to our Wisconsin
congresspersons, and governor.  Also below are their
addresses and email addresses.  I ask that you read my letter to them and
email or write all of them with a similar letter addressed from your view
point.  Please do not forward my letter to them but rather write them in
you own words your objection to the practice ofinvoluntary extension as it
pertains to me.  I feel that if enough people write that it may actually
influence my Battalion Commander, who has the power to do so, to grant me
my honorable discharge and send me home.  Also please forward this email
to people who you know know me and would be willing to help.  Please help
me return home, reunite with my son, and practice my religion of
non-violence.  Thank you.

Love,
Jason Moon
