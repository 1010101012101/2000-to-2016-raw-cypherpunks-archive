"Col. David Hogg, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division,
said tougher methods are being used to gather intelligence. On Wednesday night,
he said, his troops picked up the wife and daughter of an Iraqi lieutenant
general. They left a note: "If you want your family released, turn yourself
in." Such tactics are justified, he said."

  There obviously is very, very little difference anymore between the US gov't
and the Third Reich anymore. Read the whole article, it's nauseating.
