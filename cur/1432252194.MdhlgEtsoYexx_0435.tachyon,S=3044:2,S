"""
  Pointing to the examples offered by Boback, Towns said that the
file-sharing industry's promises to regulate itself had clearly failed.
"Specific examples of recent LimeWire leaks range from appalling to
shocking," Towns said. "As far as I am concerned, the days of
self-regulation should be over for the file-sharing industry."
  Other members want the issue investigated by the Federal Trade Commission,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and law enforcement authorities. They
said that the continued failure by companies such as LimeWire to take more
proactive steps to stop inadvertent file-sharing is tantamount to enabling
illegal activity resulting from the data leaks.
  Towns plans to meet with the chairman of the FTC to determine whether the
failure to stop inadvertent file-sharing constitutes an unfair trade
practice by P2P companies."

Anyway, the slashdot comments have lots of rebuttals to those points.
