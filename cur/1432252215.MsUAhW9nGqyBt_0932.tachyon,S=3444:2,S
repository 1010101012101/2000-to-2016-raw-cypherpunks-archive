For the most part, I'm not.  I had just hoped to have a better 
music format available on the web, and it looks like MP3 is blocking
it from happening.

To your message recipient, it's covertext.  To everybody else 
who downloads tunes, (since you're talking about putting stego
in *all* MP3s downloaded from your site) it's degraded sound 
quality.

Understand, it's your site and you do what you want: I'm just saying 
MP3 is already too thin. My crypto-relevant warning to you is that 
if you stego it at all heavily, the difference will be audible to 
some people.  Even if you can't hear the difference, somebody (maybe 
a lot of somebodys) will be able to, and this could tip snoops off 
to the existence of the stegogram.
