I do not recall the spam attribution, but I've delved and quote it below
for posterity.  It was the fact that the cyberpass node lost its list of
screibers, then that it would go down for days at a time, that motivated
me to jump ship.  Especially since there was no reply and no explanation
for any of the above occurrences.  I figured Lance wanted to shut that
node down and move on to other things.

The cypherpunks@cyberpass.net node of the cypherpunks list will be
closing on Friday August 10.

You should ensure that you are subscribed to a different node of the
cypherpunks list before that time.
