This shows a common but not entirely correct view of the PCA. You may wish to
read it for yourself:
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1385.html

A seperate question is whether the PCA has much meaning anymore; it's
just an act of Congress and can be repealed by another. Also the PCA
seems to strongly indicate the president can call out the military and
for domestic law enforcement without Congress' authorization.
