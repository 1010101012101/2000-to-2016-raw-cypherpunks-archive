Note that there's NO stipulation about 'if you can't afford an attorney
one will be appointed to you'. Whether you're rich or poor the state is
OBLIGED to provide you an attorney.

                                Amendment VI

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the
crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the
accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have
compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the
Assistance of Counsel for his defence.
