It might be possible to bring this location versus target discussion
into a more publicly accessible form by having a little vignette,
something like "A is a citizen of B, and is just now boarding a
flight from C to D which will, incidentally, overfly B as well as
E and F.  Which of B, C, D, E, or F can assert a lawful authority
to monitor A's phone calls, and how can they know when can they do
it?" perhaps followed by the notion that a satellite phone call has
a similar sort of little vignette around it.
