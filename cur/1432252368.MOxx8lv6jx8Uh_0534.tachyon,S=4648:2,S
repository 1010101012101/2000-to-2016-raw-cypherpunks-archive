Personal Message:

Let us all pray for the family's of those who have fallen in the wake of the tragedy that has befallen our Nation.  If you are able to give blood, please do so.  There is a great demand for it.  If you would like to make a donation, I know that PayPal.com has set up a relief fund on their sites.  But most of all...let us all pray.  Prayer in numbers is a very powerful thing!  Take care and God Bless You All!
