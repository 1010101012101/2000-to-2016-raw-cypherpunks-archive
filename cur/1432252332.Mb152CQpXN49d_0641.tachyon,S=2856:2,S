OTOOH, if you've a little money to invest, the optical reflection DSP
techniques developed to detect sniper rifle scopes could be used to find
cameras in large areas.  (Laser reflected off spinning scanning mirror into
target area, digitize reflected light and process to detect internal
reflections of lens assemblies.  Done right it can identify scope by make
and model, mirror gives relative bearing to points of interest.)  

This technique should apply to everything but pinhole lenses, which aren't
very useful for staring-eye type field surveillance.  A simple commercial
version of this is already available to sweep for hidden cameras in a small
room type environment, scaling for large field use should be relatively
simple with better optics and detectors.  Its likely a few of the spooks on
this list have used such equipment, its probably been deployed for a number
of years now by the US.
