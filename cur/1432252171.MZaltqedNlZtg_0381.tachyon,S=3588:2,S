Wow.  The imagery!

Actually the best way to deal with it is by a memetic vaccine (what would
the equivalent be in memetics? mezzine? someone fluent in latin help me
out here).

I really think that humanity will discover that a lot of what humans call
beliefs are really just widespread memetic plagues.  When memetic engineering
reaches the same stage in scientific development as biology has, much
of the 'isms that regularly wipe out entire populations may be brought
under control.

And humanity can move on.

(But not before memtic and nanotech warfare resurface the planet 
in some unpredicatable way, no doubt).
