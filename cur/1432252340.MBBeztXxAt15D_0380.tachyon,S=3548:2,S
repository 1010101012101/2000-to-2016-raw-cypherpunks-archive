Earth to Greens: metal-detector wands are _not_ a "radioactive 
instrument_.

A 7th-grade understanding of physics is all that is needed to know this.

No wonder the Greens have such a backasswards view of so many things.

Heinlein's quote below is especially appropriate.

"Stupidity is not a sin, the victim can't help being stupid.  But 
stupidity is the only universal crime;  the sentence is death, there is 
no appeal, and execution is carried out automatically and without pity."
