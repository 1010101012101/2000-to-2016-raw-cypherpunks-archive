"Without property rights in the means of production to separate one man's 
plan from another man's plan, there can only be one plan, one plan for 
everything, one plan for everyone, one plan that all must obey."

Libertarianism? Its the one plan here that all must obey.The ubergeeks one

'punk'.You stand exposed as the fraud you are james by your own straw man 
argument.
Will you denounce the march for capitalism for its rank socialist 
organising and marching?
