cooperative certificate authority to act as a "man-in-the-middle" for
encrypted web traffic.

this list (see "rogue certificates" in the "SSL would prevent it" thread) and
ten years ago I presented a paper at the Red Hat Conference, that said: "The
CA paradigm is thus, essentially, to rely on an authentication chain that ends
in a ... CA that eventually certifies itself. Therefore, the validity problem
is shifted from a local perspective to a global perspective, with the whole
chain depending on one final link. At the end, ignorance (and the possibility
of fraud) is leveraged to a high degree, in which one weak link may compromise
a whole chain of certificates." with copy online at

sure who Mr. Gerck thinks is claiming such a thing.
