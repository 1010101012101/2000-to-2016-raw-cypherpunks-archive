Girl enters list that discusses intellectual topics.

I assert that private property rights are good in actual private 
property, such as places that belong to some people and not to other 
people, because the alternative is mass murder, but the case for 
intellectual is considerably less convincing.

Girl replies  "Private property is wicked.  Furthermore I am a native, 
therefore I am right and you are wrong, because of the horrible crime 
committed against my people."

Confirming the standard stereotype of girls in engineering.

An actual native american, probably male, gets pissed because this faux 
indian is an embarrassment to actual Indians.

It would perhaps have been more entertaining had her argument been that 
private property oppresses women.
