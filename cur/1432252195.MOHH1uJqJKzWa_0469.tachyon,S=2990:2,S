        I was subscribed to cyberpass.net, been gone for two days and
came home to no cpunks mail. Subscribed to lne and it started flowing
again.
       Pretty weird -- even wierder is what happened to openpgp -- I was
subscribed to that one, it went down, came back up, went down again and
never a word from the owner since.
