"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?  I [Jesus] tell you,
Nay; but rather division:  For from henceforth there shall be five in
one house divided, three against two, and two against three." (Luke
12:51-2)

"Think not that I [Jesus] have come to send peace on earth:  I come not
to send peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34)

"...for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
(Matthew 26:52)

"...and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
(Luke 22:36)

And that doesn't even touch the red-handed, ravening god of the old
testament.
