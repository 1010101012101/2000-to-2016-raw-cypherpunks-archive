There is no magic involved, it's just time consuming and virtually no
companies have staff they are willing to spend on it.
Also, that's a server distribution with fewer than 200 packages.

My laptop:
gandalfthegreat:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
3061

server #1:
magic:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
1195

server #2:
gargamel:~# dpkg --list | wc -l        
2685

You get the point, it's time consuming, especially if you're checking /
stripping each package first, including fixing parts that make the package
non invariant on rebuilds.

We also had a package diff-er that accounted for zipped man pages, pyc files, 
and other files that changed each time you rebuilt them.
But really, not rocket science.
