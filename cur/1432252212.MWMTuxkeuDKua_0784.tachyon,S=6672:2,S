You're right, but I'm not sure of the point you're making. No one here
seems to think the cusser actually broke any laws, or at least any
enforceable laws.

Right. Even a 1L knows that. :-)  I was simplifying. And the thread has
been mingling the current American legal system, Tim's ideal system, and
my ideal system, without always clearly demarking them.

Also, I think the evidence shows that at least in some cases American
juries ignore evidence and law and (in my opinion) justice and award
whatever they want. McDonald's coffee and that tobacco case in Florida
come to mind. True, only the outrageous cases come make the headlines,
and true, the awards are usually knocked down or thrown out at the
appelate level, but still.

To get back on my favorite legal hobby-horse, I think that a loser-pays
system would keep a lot of the truly frivolous cases from being filed.
That should free up enough of the courts' time that they can give proper
attention to the cases that do make it in.

Right. Which is why it's useful to work within the system and try to
help on specific cases rather than whine about the current system and
refuse to play in it.

Hmm. Good point. I'd been thinking of the "technology trumps laws"
argument in terms of what I described in my previous message: the
slashdotters nattering about how the net routes around censorship and is
therefore invulnerable to government action. (Extremely simplified
presentation, of course.) But before I completely concede the point,
I'll wait for further developments in the
NSA-versus-the-crypto-companies thread.
