          World Court Favors Germany
          Over U.S.

          THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) - The World Court
          ruled in favor of Germany in a case involving the U.S.
          execution of two German brothers in 1999, saying the
          United States violated international law when it failed
          to grant consular rights to Germans.

          In a landmark ruling Wednesday, the court also
          pronounced that its provisional orders to national
          courts were legally binding, criticizing the U.S. state
          of Arizona for ignoring the World Court's order to
          delay the execution of one of the brothers.

          Brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand were executed in
          Tucson for the 1982 murder of a 63-year-old bank
          manager during a botched robbery.

          Germany took the United States to court, claiming the
          brothers had been denied representation by the German
          consulate that might have saved their lives. In doing
          so, Germany argued, the United States violated the
          1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.

          The verdict is binding and not subject to appeal,
          however the World Court has no independent means to
          enforce compliance.
