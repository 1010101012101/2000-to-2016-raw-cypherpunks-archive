Roosevelt did devalue the dollar.  On January 31, 1934, he issued an 
Executive Order which devalued the dollar from 23.22 grains of gold down to 
13.71 grains.  That was a 59% devaluation.

As you say, devaluing the dollar did increase the value of gold in terms of 
dollars.  The value of gold in terms of dollars jumped from $20.67 to 
$35.00, an increase of 69%.

Yeah, good thing Roosevelt didn't make the mistake of devaluing the 
dollar!  Whew!  :-)

Yes, the only way to avoid communism was to devalue the dollar and make 
possession of a yellow metal punishable by fine and imprisonment.  Anybody 
can see that.  :-)

Seriously though, we didn't avoid communism at all.  FDR was our first 
communist president.
