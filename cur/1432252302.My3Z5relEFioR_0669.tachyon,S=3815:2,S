No.  No more than your choice of reading materials is censorship.

If I chose not to publish or buy text-X its not censorship.
If the government interferes, it is.

Now if I choose a spawning mate based on their apparent fitness
(as judged by me), this is personal 'eugenics', and its fine morally.
(Similarly with those who voluntarily delegate the choice to
family members.)

Now if the State does the choosing, its coercion by the state, which
was pretty tainted by the German Socialists a generation or two
ago, regardless of the possible future benefits, even if 'fitness' is 
agreed upon by all.  Regardless of the benefits, its coercion.

Private choice vs. Coercion by the State.  Simple.  Not all
choice is censorship, or bad eugenics.

.....

Aside: When the State enslaves 'fit' citizens as soldiers, some fraction of
which are taken out of the gene pool, an indirect form of eugenics
(animal husbandry) is taking place.  Selection against 1As
and carriers of patriotism traits, for instance.

Evolution never sleeps.
