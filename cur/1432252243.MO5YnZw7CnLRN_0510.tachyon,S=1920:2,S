There might be blind cypherpunks, we don't discriminate[1], and most
provincial
(in both senses) laws prohibit touch.  Probably beer and sweat
overwhelms
any smells that the blind might dig.

[1] the original phone phreaks were blind, looking (unintended pun) to
converse for free,
having lots of time, and being precise listeners of DTMF frequencies.
Back when the protocols were unprotected... much like the 'net today :-)
