** Canadian Pharmacy 0nline Testimonials:      
       
Here's what some satisfied customers had to say:    
        
"I reviewed an AARP bulletin online (Sites to See: Getting Prescription Drugs Safely From Canada)... This article suggested checking with the following organizations when buying meds from Canada (Canadian Pharmacies):   
        
1. CIPA: Canadian International Pharmacy Association  
2. IMPAC: Internet and Mailorder Pharmacy Accreditation Commission   
3. Pharmacy Checker  
        
In reviewing all the above, I could only find two Pharmacies that were recommended by all three... and one was Pharmacy Online.  
  
I highly recommend Pharmacy 0nline for all meds purchased from Canada... Most important, I ordered on the 20th of January and received them on the 27th of January... Thank you again for being there..."      
       
"I got on the Internet looking for (Canadian 0nline Pharmacy) alternatives and most of the companies were either not registered with the Better Business Bureau or had bad reports. Yours was registered and had a very good report..."
