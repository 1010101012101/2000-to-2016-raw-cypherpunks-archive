'Rave' party organizers indicted under federal drug law

January 12, 2001
Web posted at: 3:26 p.m. EST (2026 GMT)

NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern
District of Louisiana and the Drug Enforcement Administration announced
the indictment Friday of three "rave" party organizers, marking the
first time the federal "crack house" law has been used for prosecuting
organizers of such events.

"Raves" are large dance parties often associated with the drug MDMA,
commonly called ecstasy.

The indictments were returned against Robert J. Brunet and James D.
Estobinal of Louisiana and Brian J. Brunett of Tampa. Florida as a
result of "Operation Rave Review," a joint investigation conducted the
DEA and the New Orleans Police Department.

The 1986 law, passed to combat crack cocaine, was designed to punish
the owners or operators of houses used for the manufacture, storage,
distribution or use of illegal drugs. Violators face a maximum penalty
20 years on prison and a $500,000 fine.

Users of ecstasy often describe a feeling of euphoria. Researchers have
reported the drug can cause brain damage by destroying neurons that
produce the neurotransmitter serotonin, responsible for controlling
mood, sleep, pain, sexual activity and violent behavior.
