No, as I said before, what you're describing is PEM circa 1991, not S/MIME.  In
the S/MIME model, anyone can issue certs (just like PGP), including yourself.
In addition, many large CAs will issue certs in any name to anyone, so even if
you don't want to do your own keys a la PGP you can still get a Verisign cert
which behaves like a PGP key.

Rather than wasting all this bandwidth in a lets-bash-S/MIME-by-pretending-
it's-still-PEM debate (what is it with this irrational fear of S/MIME?), I'd be
more interested in a serious discussion on which key-handling model is less
ineffective, WoT or X.509-free-for-all.  At the moment both of them seem to
work by using personal/direct contact to exchange keys, with one side
pretending to be WoT-based (although no-one ever relies on this) and the other
pretending to be CA-based (although no-one ever relies on this [0]).  The end
result is that they're more or less the same thing, the only major
differentiating factor being that most X.509-using products don't allow you to
distribute your own certs the way PGP does.

Peter.

    instructed to rely on it, or else.
