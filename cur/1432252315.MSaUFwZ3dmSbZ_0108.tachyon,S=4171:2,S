Well, I don't know what's the CDC's concerns are, but nasal swabs seem 
likely to answer one question - "does this person presently have anthrax 
spores inside their nasal passage?" which is different in several important 
ways from other questions of interest, including -

Has this person been exposed to anthrax bacteria or spores in the last 60 - 
90 days?
Has this person's immune system created antibodies to the anthrax bacteria?
Have this person's lymph nodes become infected? Are toxins being produced?

Some people may have anthrax spores in their nose but no infection (perhaps 
they were exposed to far fewer than the 5-10000 spores needed for 
inhalational anthrax) and some people may have an infection but no spores 
in their nose (because they have cutaneous anthrax, or because they blew 
their nose a lot, or because they're frequent users of powderered inhaled 
drugs like cocaine or amphetamine and don't have hair inside their noses).

So - if the purpose of the test is to determine which people need medical 
treatment - the test is likely to be misleading, sometimes optimistically, 
sometimes pessimistically.
