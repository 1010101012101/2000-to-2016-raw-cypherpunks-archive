Yup.  Quit your job at the police force and go join the
French Foreign Legion.  See the world, meet exciting and
interesting people, and kill them.   C'mon, Joe, you can always
change your name.

Declaring bankruptcy is another popular approach.

Of course, the way my generation dealt with the problem
was to have low-interest student loans which the Carter and
Reagan governments inflated into pocket change.
Kids these days have to go back to the old-fashioned way
of financing them, like working hard for a long time 
to pay them back.
				Thanks!
