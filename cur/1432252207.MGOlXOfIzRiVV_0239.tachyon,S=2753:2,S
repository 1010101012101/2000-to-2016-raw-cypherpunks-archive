>From R. A. Hettinga:

:So, as has ever been the case, whoever builds a robust,
:instantly-settled, identity-independent, internet-ubiquitous
:transaction mechanism that actually works in production for assets
:people want to trade in large quantity is going to do quite well for
:themselves by saving the entire economy a whole lot of money, and not
:just people suffering from the depredations of an increasingly
:powerful nation-state.
