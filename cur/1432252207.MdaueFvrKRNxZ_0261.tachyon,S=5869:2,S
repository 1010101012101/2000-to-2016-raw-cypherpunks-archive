Call For Papers

CodeCon is the premier showcase of cutting edge software development. It
is an excellent opportunity for programmers to demonstrate their work and
keep abreast of what's going on in their community.

All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally
accompanied by source code. Presentations must be done by one of the
active developers of the code in question. We emphasize that
demonstrations be of *working* code.

We hereby solicit papers and demonstrations.

    * Papers and proposals due: December 15, 2005
    * Authors notified: January 1, 2006

Possible topics include, but are by no means restricted to:

    * community-based web sites - forums, weblogs, personals
    * development tools - languages, debuggers, version control
    * file sharing systems - swarming distribution, distributed search
    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls

Presentations will be 45 minutes long, with 15 minutes allocated for
Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.

Submission details:

Submissions are being accepted immediately. Acceptance dates are
November 15, and December 15. After the first acceptance date,
submissions will be either accepted, rejected, or deferred to the
second acceptance date.

The conference language is English.

Ideally, demonstrations should be usable by attendees with 802.11b
connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on Windows,
UNIX-like, or MacOS platforms. Cross-platform applications are most
desirable.

Our venue will be 21+.
