Well well well - what a tangled and hellish web the West weaves (see
below)... the sad and indicting facts of reality are steadily going
public. "Conspiracy nuts" have no joy in this. The evil is beyond a
London Has Fallen or "Benghazi" propaganda movie. City of London and
Wall Street 'had to take down Qaddafi' to stop his pan-African/Arabic
gold backed currency "initiative", so unfortunately lost him his life.
The odd speech I've watched, Qaddafi was compelling, and with heart
for his people and those beyond his nations boundaries. Now we can see
why the West acted and continues to act so brutishly.

French oligarchs - your number's called!

City of London and Wall Street bankers - you can't hide your deeds!

Western oligarchs - you stand with despotic authority.

How small minded are the West's oligarchs? So narrow minded, so
belligerently addicted to control of currencies and nations, as though
there's not enough abundance to go round... major cases of small dick
syndrome are evidently in abundance all around the West's 'halls of
power' - how absolutely fucking pathetic! (Evidently Hillary and
Merkel are thoroughly bound - so this is nothing that men have any
monopoly on.)

I'm guessing that at least in hindsight it might be seen to have been
in Qaddafi's interest to work with Russia on that particular gold
backed currency initiative. Still surprised he not took the lesson
from Saddam's "oil for Euros" hanging. Perhaps Russia was seen as
weak, or rather if we be frank "devastated" as it was when the USSR
was destroyed, only now beginning to get back her stride.

The sanctions against Russia and the CIA sponsored "colored springs"
(turmoil) around Russia in the last few years take on a more poignant
appearance in the face of Hillary's emails - attempts to keep the bear
occupied, hey hey, Wall Street's version of "Occupy Russia" - I only
wish it were a laughing matter.

Is difficult for me to comprehend the acceptance of Hillary Clinton by
at least some faction of American's in the face of her ghastly "we
came, we saw, he died" laughter - the acceptance of such insanity is a
sign, and more than "the 'leaders' have lost touch with the people"
but really that (the American) people have lost touch with the
despotic evil reality of their 'leaders'.

We have a duty to stand against such evil.

Small mercies that we get these little leaks of information here and there...

Hillary Emails, Gold Dinars and Arab Springs
Column: Society
Region: Middle East
Country: Libya

Buried amid tens of thousands of pages of former US Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton’s secret emails, now being made public by the US
Government, is a devastating email exchange between Clinton and her
confidential adviser, Sid Blumenthal. It’s about Qaddafi and the
US-coordinated intervention in 2011 to topple the Libyan ruler. It’s
about gold and a potentially existential threat to the future of the
US dollar as world reserve currency. It’s about Qaddafi’s plans then
for the gold-based Dinar for Africa and the Arab oil world.

Two paragraphs in a recently declassified email from the illegal
private server used by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during
the US-orchestrated war to destroy Libya’s Qaddafi in 2011 reveal a
tightly-held secret agenda behind the Obama Administration’s war
against Qaddafi, cynically named “Responsibility to Protect.”

Barack Obama, an indecisive and weak President, delegated all
presidential responsibility for the Libya war to his Secretary of
State, Hillary Clinton. Clinton, who was an early backer of an Arab
“regime change,” using the secret Muslim Brotherhood, invoked the new,
bizarre principle of “responsibility to protect” (R2P) to justify the
Libyan war, which she quickly turned into a NATO-led war. Under R2P, a
silly notion promoted by the networks of George Soros’ Open Society
Foundations, Clinton claimed, with no verifiable proof, that Qaddafi
was bombing innocent Libyan civilians in the Benghazi region (
http://www.cfr.org/libya/libya-responsibility-protect/p24480 ).

According to a New York Times report at the time, citing Obama
Administration senior sources, it was Hillary Clinton, backed by
Samantha Power, then a senior aide at the National Security Council
and today Obama’s UN Ambassador; and Susan Rice, then Obama’s
ambassador to the United Nations, and now National Security Adviser.
That triad pushed Obama into military action against Libya’s Qaddafi.
Clinton, flanked by Powers and Rice, was so powerful that Clinton
managed to overrule Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Tom Donilon,
Obama’s national security adviser, and John Brennan, Obama’s
counterterrorism chief, today CIA head (
http://www.thenation.com/article/obamas-women-advisers-pushed-war-against-libya/
).

Secretary of State Clinton was also knee-deep in the conspiracy to
unleash what came to be dubbed the “Arab Spring,” the wave of
US-financed regime changes across the Arab Middle East (
http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2011/01/154595.htm
), part of the Greater Middle East project unveiled in 2003 by the
Bush Administration after occupation of Iraq. The first three target
countries of that 2011 US “Arab Spring”–an action in which Washington
used its “human rights” NGOs such as Freedom House and National
Endowment for Democracy, in cahoots as usual, with the Open Society
Foundations of billionaire speculator, George Soros, along with US
State Department and CIA operatives–were Ben Ali’s Tunisia, Mubarak’s
Egypt and Qaddafi’s Libya.

Now the timing and targeting of Washington’s 2011 “Arab Spring”
destabilizations of select Middle East states assume a new light in
relation to just-released declassified Clinton emails to her private
Libya “adviser” and friend, Sid Blumenthal. Blumenthal is the slick
lawyer who defended then-President Bill Clinton in the Monika Lewinsky
and other sex scandal affairs when Bill was President and facing
impeachment.

Qaddafi’s gold dinar

For many it remains a mystery just why Washington decided that Qaddafi
personally must be destroyed, murdered, not just sent into exile like
Mubarak. Clinton, when informed of Qaddafi’s brutal murder by
US-financed Al Qaeda “democratic opposition” terrorists, told CBS
news, in a sick, joking paraphrase of Julius Caesar, “We came, we saw,
he died,” words spoken by her with a hearty, macabre laugh (
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-on-qaddafi-we-came-we-saw-he-died
).

Little is known in the West about what Muammar Qaddafi did in Libya
or, for that matter, in Africa and in the Arab world. Now, release of
a new portion of Hillary Clinton’s emails as Secretary of State, at
the time she was running Obama Administration war on Qaddafi, sheds
dramatic new light on the background.

It was not a personal decision of Hillary Clinton to eliminate Qaddafi
and destroy his entire state infrastructure. The decision, it’s now
clear, came from circles very high in the US money oligarchy. She was
merely another Washington political tool implementing the mandate of
those oligarchs. The intervention was about killing Qaddafi’s
well-laid plans to create a gold-based African and Arabic currency to
replace the dollar in oil trades. Since the US dollar abandoned gold
exchange for dollars in 1971 the dollar in terms of gold has
dramatically lost value. Arab and African OPEC oil states have long
objected to the vanishing purchasing power of their oil sales,
mandated since the 1970’s by Washington to be solely in US dollars, as
dollar inflation soared more than 2000% to 2001.

In a newly declassified Clinton email from Sid Blumenthal to Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton dated April 2, 2011, Blumenthal reveals the
reason that Qaddafi must be eliminated. Using the pretext of citing an
unidentified “high source” Blumenthal writes to Clinton, “According to
sensitive information available to this source, Qaddafi’s government
holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver… This gold was
accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used
to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar.
This plan was designed to provide the Francophone African Countries
with an alternative to the French franc (CFA
https://www.foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_DecWebClearedMeta/31-C1/DOC_0C05779612/C05779612.pdf
).” That French aspect was only the tip of the Qaddafi gold dinar
iceberg.

Golden Dinar and more

During the first decade of this century, Gulf Arab OPEC countries,
including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, began seriously diverting a
significant portion of the revenues from their vast oil and gas sales
into state sovereign wealth funds, many based on the success of
Norway’s Oil Fund.

Growing discontent with the US War on Terror, with the wars in Iraq
and in Afghanistan, and with overall US Middle East policies after
September 2001, led most OPEC Arab states to divert a growing share of
oil revenues into state-controlled funds rather than trusting it to
the sticky fingers of New York and London bankers as had been the
custom since the 1970’s when oil prices went through the roof,
creating what Henry Kissinger fondly called the “petro-dollar” to
replace the gold-backed dollar Washington walked away from on August
15, 1971. The present Sunni-Shi’ite war or clash of civilizations is
in fact a result of the US manipulations after 2003 in the region—
“divide and rule.”

By 2008 the prospect of sovereign control by a growing number of
African and Arab oil states of their state oil and gas revenues was
causing serious concern in Wall Street as well as the City of London.
It was huge liquidity, in the trillions, they potentially no longer
controlled.

The timing of the Arab Spring, in retrospect, increasingly looks tied
to Washington and Wall Street efforts to control not only the huge
Arab Middle East oil flows. It is now clear it was equally aimed at
controlling their money, their trillions of dollars accumulating in
their new sovereign wealth funds.

However, as is now confirmed in the latest Clinton-Blumenthal April 2,
2011 email exchange, there was a qualitatively new threat emerging for
Wall Street and the City of London “gods of money,” from the African
and Arab oil world. Libya’s Qaddafi, Tunisia’s Ben Ali and Mubarak’s
Egypt were about to launch a gold-backed Islamic currency independent
of the US dollar. I was first told of this plan in early 2012, at a
Swiss financial and geopolitical conference, by an Algerian with
extensive knowledge of the project. Documentation was scarce at the
time and the story remained in my mental back-burner. Now a far more
interesting picture emerges that puts the ferocity of Washington’s
Arab Spring and its urgency in the case of Libya into perspective.

‘United States of Africa’

In 2009, Qaddafi, who was at the time the President of the African
Union, had proposed that the economically depressed continent adopt
the “Gold Dinar” (
http://www.wnd.com/2011/08/337881/#fQbTdeRLfVczxYqc.99 ).

In the months prior to the US decision, with British and French
backing, to get a UN Security Council resolution that would give them
the legal fig-leaf for a NATO destruction of the Qaddafi regime,
Muammar Qaddafi had been organizing the creation of a gold-backed
dinar that would be used by African oil states as well as Arab OPEC
countries in their sales of oil on the world market.

Had that happened at the time Wall Street and the City of London were
deep into the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the challenge to the
reserve currency role of the dollar would have been more than serious.
It would be a death knell to American financial hegemony, and to the
Dollar System. Africa is one of the world’s richest continents, with
vast unexplored gold and mineral wealth, had been intentionally kept
for centuries underdeveloped or in wars to prevent their development.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank for the recent decades
have been the Washington instruments to suppress African real
development.

Gaddafi had called upon African oil producers in the African Union and
in Muslim nations to join an alliance that would make the gold dinar
their primary form of money and foreign exchange. They would sell oil
and other resources to the US and the rest of the world only for gold
dinars. As President of the African Union in 2009, Qaddafi introduced
for discussion to African Union member states Qaddafi’s proposal to
use the Libyan dinar and the silver dirham as the only possible money
for the rest of the world to buy African oil (
http://www.youshouldbuygold.com/2011/10/end-of-african-gold-standard-the-oil-gold-relationship/
).

Along with the Arab OPEC sovereign wealth funds for their oil, other
African oil nations, specifically Angola and Nigeria, were moving to
create their own national oil wealth funds at the time of the 2011
NATO bombing of Libya (
http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/Policy/Rise-of-the-African-sovereign-wealth-fund?ct=true
). Those sovereign national wealth funds, tied to Qaddafi’s concept of
the gold dinar, would make Africa’s long-held dream of independence
from colonial monetary control, whether of the British Pound, the
French Franc, the euro or the US dollar, a reality.

Qaddafi was moving forward, as head of the African Union, at the time
of his assassination, with a plan to unify the sovereign States of
Africa with one gold currency, a United States of Africa. In 2004, a
Pan-African Parliament of 53 nations had laid plans for an African
Economic Community – with a single gold currency by 2023.

African oil-producing nations were planning to abandon the
petro-dollar, and demand gold payment for their oil and gas. The list
included Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Tunisia, Gabon, South Africa, Uganda,
Chad, Suriname, Cameroon, Mauritania, Morocco, Zambia, Somalia, Ghana,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Cote d’Ivoire, plus Yemen which
had just made significant new oil discoveries. The four African
member-states of OPEC–Algeria, Angola, Nigeria, a giant oil producer
and the largest natural gas producer in Africa with huge natural gas
reserves, and Libya with the largest reserves–would be in the new gold
dinar system.

Little wonder that French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was given the
up-front role in the war on Qaddafi by Washington, went so far as to
call Libya a “threat” to the financial security of the world (
http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4630-gadhafi-s-gold-money-plan-would-have-devastated-dollar
).

Hillary’s ‘rebels’ create a central bank

One of the most bizarre features of Hillary Clinton’s war to destroy
Qaddafi was the fact that the US-backed “rebels” in Benghazi, in the
oil-rich eastern part of Libya, in the midst of battle, well before it
was at all clear if they would topple the Qaddafi regime, declared
they had created a Western-style central bank, “in exile.”

In the very first weeks of the rebellion, the rebel leaders declared
that they had created a central bank to replace Gadhafi’s state-owned
monetary authority. The rebel council, in addition to creating their
own oil company to sell the oil they captured announced: “Designation
of the Central Bank of Benghazi as a monetary authority competent in
monetary policies in Libya and appointment of a Governor to the
Central Bank of Libya, with a temporary headquarters in Benghazi (
http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4630-gadhafi-s-gold-money-plan-would-have-devastated-dollar
).”

Commenting on the odd decision, before the outcome of battle was even
decided, to create a western-style central bank to replace Qaddafi’s
sovereign national bank that was issuing gold-backed dinars, Robert
Wenzel in the Economic Policy Journal, remarked, “I have never before
heard of a central bank being created in just a matter of weeks out of
a popular uprising. This suggests we have a bit more than a rag tag
bunch of rebels running around and that there are some pretty
sophisticated influences (
http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4630-gadhafi-s-gold-money-plan-would-have-devastated-dollar
).”

It becomes clear now in light of the Clinton-Blumenthal emails that
those “pretty sophisticated influences” were tied to Wall Street and
the City of London. The person brought in by Washington to lead the
rebels in March 2011, Khalifa Hifter, had spent the previous twenty
years of his life in suburban Virginia, not far from CIA headquarters,
after a break with Libya as a leading military commander of Qaddafi (
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/middle-east/article24618421.html#storylink=cpy
).

The risk to the future of the US dollar as world reserve currency, if
Qaddafi had been allowed to proceed–together with Egypt, Tunisia and
other Arab OPEC and African Union members– to introduce oil sales for
gold not dollars, would clearly have been the financial equivalent of
a Tsunami.

New Gold Silk Road

The Qaddafi dream of an Arabic and African gold system independent of
the dollar, unfortunately, died with him. Libya, after Hillary
Clinton’s cynical “responsibility to protect” destruction of the
country, today is a shambles, torn by tribal warfare, economic chaos,
al-Qaeda and DAESH or ISIS terrorists. The monetary sovereignty held
by Qaddafi’s 100% state-owned national monetary agency and its
issuance of gold dinars is gone, replaced by an “independent” central
bank tied to the dollar.

Despite that setback, it’s more than notable that now an entirely new
grouping of nations is coming together to build a similar gold-backed
monetary system. This is the group led by Russia and China, the
world’s number three and number one gold producing countries,
respectively.

This group is tied to the construction of China’s One Belt, One Road
New Silk Road Eurasian infrastructure great project. It involves
China’s $16 billion Gold Development Fund, and very firm steps by
China to replace the City of London and New York as the center of
world gold trade. The Eurasian gold system emerging now poses an
entirely new quality of challenge to American financial hegemony. This
Eurasian challenge, its success or failure, could well determine
whether we allow our civilization to survive and prosper under
entirely different conditions, or whether we decide to sink along with
the bankrupt dollar system (
