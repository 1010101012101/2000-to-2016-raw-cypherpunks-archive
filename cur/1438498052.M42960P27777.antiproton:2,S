The thing I REALLY want to see exposed is the fake, phony, forged docket fo=
r Ninth Circuit Court appeal case 99-30210. =C2=A0It's the appeal case that=
 was secretly initiated by corrupt attorney Judith Mandel Levins on about J=
une 20, 1999, one day before she resigned. =C2=A0Naturally, she never told =
me about the existence of that. =C2=A0 https://cpunks.wordpress.com/2013/11=
/19/jim-bell-to-andy-greenberg-your-errors-about-me-in-your-book/=C2=A0 : =
=C2=A0And, for the next 10 months or so, I received no mail from that court=
 about that case: =C2=A0Ordinarily, I (ostensibly representing myself, but =
completely unaware of the existence of that case) should have gotten mail, =
but I didn't get any mail while at FDC Seatac (until about September 3, 199=
9) nor at FCI Phoenix (from about Sept 10, 1999 through April 13, 2000.)
The phony docket was forged, but it was again re-forged, probably about May=
 2000, when they discovered that I was demanding a REAL appeal, still not h=
aving learned of the pre-April 2000 existence of that case. =C2=A0(Unfortun=
ately, I was unable to write very much about my May 20 discovery of the pho=
ny appeal case, in my July 2003 refiling of my Portland Federal Court lawsu=
it. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0http://cryptome.org/jdb-v-usa-106.htmhttps://casete=
xt.com/case/bell-v-district-courts-of-tacoma-and-seattle=C2=A0 This is beca=
use I was using someone in Portland doing the editing, and I learned about =
that phony case too late to add a lot. =C2=A0I did put in a few mentions, h=
owever.)

The docket is available to anyone, for free, using the PACER (www.pacer.com=
) system, if you use less than 150 pages per calendar quarter. =C2=A0Also, =
there are at least two FORGED filings, ostensibly from me, dated (from memo=
ry) approximately November 20, 1999 and March 5, 2000. =C2=A0The first was =
a handwritten filing, ostensibly in my handwriting, but anyone who knows my=
 handwriting knows it to be terrible. =C2=A0THAT handwriting was very neat;=
 Probably a woman's handwriting. =C2=A0The March 5 filing was apparently do=
ne using a modern word-processor, although the law library at FCI Phoenix d=
id not have such; only typewriters.
That docketing computer was presumably backed up regularly, at least weekly=
, and probably daily, and the backups might have been sent to the=C2=A0
You will notice that I lambasted Andy Greenberg for repeating errors about =
me (and especially my attorneys) in this book. =C2=A0He never responded to =
my accusations against him. =C2=A0He claimed that I had repeatedly tried to=
 fire attorneys: =C2=A0But the reality is that I was never SUCCESSFUL at fi=
ring an attorney: =C2=A0Initially, I did not try to fire them, though I obj=
ected strenuously to their misconduct. =C2=A0Later, I TRIED to fire a few, =
but the judge never allowed me to do so. =C2=A0Eventually they left, of the=
ir own accord, after they had done the damage to me that they were trying t=
o accomplish. =C2=A0 I wrote a series of motions in February/March 2001 tha=
t strongly objected to corrupt attorney Robert Leen's actions, for instance=
.
