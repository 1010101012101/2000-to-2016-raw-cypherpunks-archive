positions of Recruitment Supervisors to hire and manage homeworkers. I am a
professional Ad Placer as well as a Recruitment Supervisor. This is where a
lot of profit can be made because not only will you be paid for every
response that you receive from ads BUT also for EVERY Response received by
anyone that YOU cypherpunks recruit to place ads from home!
