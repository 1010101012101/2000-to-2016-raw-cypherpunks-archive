There are specific ops I could promote (#OpDeathEaters, for example),
but I think maybe this question should be answered in a more general
way. And I think what we should often do is, help the victims of
whichever injustice attain the goals they're trying to reach. In other
words, let the victims choose and lead toward the objectives. So, to
take a current example, Doctors Without Borders, having had their Kunduz
hospital just bombed, wants an IHFFC investigation. How can we help with
that? And so on for other injustices. A caveat being that most people,
in the US anyway, can't think outside the box of capitalism, but trying
to reform capitalism isn't the answer.
