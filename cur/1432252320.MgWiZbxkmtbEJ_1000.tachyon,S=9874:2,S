* Have you ever thought or uttered the words....
>
* "If only I could find an easier way to make money"
>
* Or....
* "If I had more money, I could spend more time with my family, and less time at work"
>
* Or even...
* "I sure could use more money so I could pay off all my bills once and for all"  IT WILL 
HAPPEN WITH THIS
* PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!!!!
>
* Well its possible we haven't actually met before but you did not receive this letter by 
mistake, I just felt that
* everyone in the world deserves to know about, and should be given a chance to get in on 
this amazing
* program. I think every one can spare $25. Please read this letter and you will see what I'm 
talking about.
* Thanks so much...
>
> Dear Friend,
>
* When you start to read this letter I want you to read it slowly, sit
* down, and then read it again. The first time I read this letter I didn't believe a word it said, 
the second time it
* started to set in just how much money someone can really make with this program. Well, 
about 5 months
* ago I decided to give it a try. My total investment was $110.00. That covered the five, $5 
bills I sent as
* outlined below, and a bulk e-mailer.  From that $110 I have made over
$17,000.  That may not seem like a
* lot of money to some people but it sure helped me out this year. Now you don't have to 
take my path your
* total investment can be $25 and with the reports from those listed below, they will direct 
you to free ad
* sites, the best targeted e-mailers and a lot more. All in all I believe this business is the best 
one on the
* Internet...Please read on....

* Success Stories,

* Hopefully my name is still on the list. I am a retired attorney.
* Approximately, two years ago a man came to me with a letter similar to
* this one. He asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal. I told him I would review it 
and get it back
* to him. When I first read the letter a week and a half later, we met in my office to discuss 
the letter. I told
* him that the letter he originally brought me was not 100% legal and I advised him to make a 
small change in
* the letter so it would be.
>
* I was still curious about the letter, so he proceeded to explain how the letter works. I 
thought it was a long
* shot and decided against
* participating. However, before my client left, I asked him to keep me
* updated as to his results. About two months later, he called to tell me
* he had received over $25,000 in cash. I did not believe him. He suggested that I try his 
idea and find out for
* myself. I thought about it for a couple of days and then I realized I had nothing to lose only 
some money to
* gain. If nothing else I would make my investment back, so I asked him for a copy of the 
letter. I followed the
* instructions exactly, mailed out 100,000 e-mails and sure enough, the money started 
arriving. It came
* slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more mail in than I could open in a day. 
After about 3
* months, the money stopped coming in. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the 
end they totaled
* $38,495.
>
>
* I was earning a good living as an attorney. However, as anyone in the
* legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes with the job. I told myself that 
if things really
* started working out, I could retire from my practice and play golf with in a few years. I 
decided to try the
* letter again, but this time I sent out 500,000 e-mails. Well, three months later, my earnings 
totaled $69,180. I
* just couldn't believe it. I met with my old client for lunch to find out why or even how this 
letter was
* working so well. He told me that there are five names on the list instead of six and with this 
program your
* only sending $5 to those five people instead of $10 each. That fact alone resulted in many 
more returns.
* The other part was guaranteeing that the whole program was legal since no one wants to 
risk
* participating in something illegal.
>
* I'll assume by now you are curious to know what little change I told him to make. Well, if 
you sent a letter
* like this out, to be legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. I 
told him that
* anyone sending a dollar to him must expect to receive something in return.
So, when you send a dollar to
* each of the 5 people on the list, youmust include a slip of paper with the words, "Please 
put my name on
* your mailing list-this is the key to the program!"
>
* FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOWEXACTLY, and in less than three 
months you will receive
* over $20,000 or more!
>
>
* Instructions:
>
* 1. Send $5.00 cash to each of the five names listed below, and remember to include a 
note requesting
* each individual report so the people on the list know which one to send you.
>
* 2. Then send $5 placed between a sheet of paper to each one.  Make sure you give your 
correct email
* address so they can send you the report.  Please print it legibly.
>
* 3. Remove the name in the number five position and move each of the other names and 
addresses down
* one place-number one becomes number two, two becomes three, three becomes four, 
and four
* becomes five. Put your name and address in the first position.
>
* 4. Start sending out e-mails  so you can start receiving orders.  This is very simple and if 
you don't want to
* do it yourself, there are several companies on the internet that will send out thousands for 
you very
* inexpensive.
>
* 5. Finally, save this letter so you can use it over and over again.
>
* Once again, this letter is not a chain letter, but perfectly legal way to make money. Refer to 
Title 18
* sections 1302 and 1342 of the United
* States Postal and Lottery Laws

* Last Thoughts
* We waste money in lotteries, enter sweepstakes and clip coupons. We need to invest in 
one another.
* Perhaps you are not in need of money. Then do it for someone else! Do it for a friend, a 
neighbor, college
* student, endowment fund, camp, etc.    Let's help to fulfill everyone's dreams!
>
* Just think how much money you can make with this program, instead of just throwing this 
letter away keep
* it, save the $25 up and invest. If everyone gets involved we can all make our financial 
dreams come to life!!
>
* When you start receiving orders for Report #5, you will be making money quicker than 
ever!!
>
* Many say, "God has given us the knowledge to prosper", but you will only prosper when 
you use the
* knowledge.
>
* Thank You and Good Luck!
