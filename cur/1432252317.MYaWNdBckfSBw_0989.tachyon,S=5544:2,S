Illegal is a judgement call. If you keep people in the dark with enough
compartmentalization and inter-department rivally, each individual (may)
think they are doing their duty to $DIETY and Country. It takes someone
who can see enough of the whole picture willing to have their career 
'buy the farm' to either take a stand internally, and risk getting fired,
or leak it.

I doubt the IRS is in cahoots with the NSA AND the SEC AND the FEC, AND
the EPA. Each of these organizations has their own information, motives,
and dirt on various politicians and upper-level managers play each other
and politicians to expand their fiefdoms and hire more wage serfs.

The problem (for them) is every once in awhile the serfs get unruly.

My wager is 'the code' will be Microsoft exchange and eXcel spreadsheets.

What you want is the documents and the bank records, and I think the only
way you'll ever get that is if the GAO starts mandating use of some
transparent cryptocoin. The Federal Reserve could easily issue 'dollarcoin'
that they directly control the money supply for and will back with federal
reserve notes.
