Actually your cite is the wrong one. It has nothing to do with a court
issuance. There has never been a question in that regard. As I said in a
earlier note, destruction of evidence is a crime which is well covered. As
soon as you have any reason to believe it's evidence (actually whether a
cop or other agent advises you of such or not) it becomes illegal for you
to alter or destroy it. Tampering with evidence is a crime and always has
been.

But back to the point,

It's called CALEA. It's one of the requirement when one becomes a 'commen
carrier'. It's also worth noting that it applies to network providers who
provide 'significant' telephone services through their network (can you
say PBX? I thought so).

I'd send the actual page but Timmy might have a CVA. There's a reference
to the CALEA standard at the bottem of the last URL I sent out.

So, what we actually have is the DoJ participating in a strawman,
basically saying that since they can require 'commen carriers' to keep
logs then extending that to everyone isn't that big of a deal.

It actually is.
