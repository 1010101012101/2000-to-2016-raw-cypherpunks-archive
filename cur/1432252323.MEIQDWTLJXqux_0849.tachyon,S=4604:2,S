Right, a fair point.  I've heard cypherpunks say that and I do think 
Clay was being a bit hard on them.  To place the cypherpunks in the 
best possible light, perhaps better than they deserve, we might say 
it's sort of like criticizing Nikola Tesla for not routing an AC power 
grid through rural Tennessee.

Yes, I have seen statements to that effect.

Mind you, I only had occasional exposure to the cypherpunks list via 
Hettinga's feed.  Which is probably fine because I have heard that 
receiving the cypherpunks list is like drinking from a fire hose, and 
Hettinga seems to forward the really informative and entertaining stuff 
from Tim May, Adam Back, et al anyway.

Right, on the one hand it's cool that hordes of otherwise ordinary 
computer users can become interested in "darknets," but on the other 
hand it's a bit scary that the sheer scale of it is orders of magnitude 
beyond getting a whiskey in a speakeasy.  This could either thoroughly 
discourage the government or motivate them to do really draconian 
things like requiring computers and chips to meet a specific government 
specification which severely limits how they function.  They're working 
on it.

Yes, a good observation from the time of the first big "War on Drugs," 
that is, the demon alcohol, wrecker of homes and corrupter of public 
morals, as anyone who has watched "Cops" can attest.  Now I need a 
drink -- a glass of port sounds good.
