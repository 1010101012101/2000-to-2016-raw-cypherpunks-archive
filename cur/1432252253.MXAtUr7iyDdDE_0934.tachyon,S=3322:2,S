I think freon is incredibly inert, that's why it's used.

My impression is that virtually any transparent
liquid will do a reasonable job of making the envelope transparent,
but the considerations are that you'd want something that doesn't
leave a residue and won'tr make the ink run.  

I believe that paper is white for the reason that snow is (as opposed 
to the reason that titanium oxide is), that is, you've got a bunch of 
surfaces where the index of refraction changes significantly from 
that of air and there's a chance of reflection at each surface, but the
actual paper fibers are transparent.  The liquid you spray on is
filling in the gaps with something with an index of refraction much
closer to that of the paper fibers. 

Pretty sure that's more or less how they work.  Definately there's
no chemical reaction going on.
