As much as I'd appreciate, purely from the perspective of continued
amusement, this perpetual election to continue, I suspect it won't.

At least some Dems are publicly telling Al to back down:
http://www.perpetualelection.com/article.pl?sid=00/11/11/090229

If Al's stated litigiousness becomes perceived as a liability, we
might see a kind of trip from Capitol Hill to the Naval Observatory to
tell Al enough is enough. The irony is that one of the senators most
tempermentally likely to do so is, of course, the Dem VP candidate.
