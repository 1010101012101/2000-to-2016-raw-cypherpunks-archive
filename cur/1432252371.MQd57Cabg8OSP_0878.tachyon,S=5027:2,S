   Nothing That Glitters Is DigiGold
   By Declan McCullagh (declan@wired.com)
   2:00 a.m. July 6, 2001 PDT
   
   Hurt feelings, financial disputes and bizarre sexual allegations have
   led to a legal tiff between a high-profile digital currency firm and
   its software developer.
   
   After the once-friendly relationship between DigiGold and Systemics
   soured this spring, DigiGold sued the software company in an attempt
   to keep its servers online. Systemics' computers, which maintain
   DigiGold's customer accounts, are located on the West Indies island of
   Anguilla.
   
   Systemics' Ian Grigg claims he wants to pull the plug on the server
   since DigiGold has paid only $370,000 of the $500,000 it owed him
   under a 1999 contract.
   
   But DigiGold says it was willing to pay the remaining cash, according
   to court documents that describe how a close personal relationship
   between Grigg and DigiGold investor Douglas Jackson led to the
   creation of Systemics, the invention of a remarkable digital currency,
   a spate of personnel disputes and an eventual estrangement.
   
   Making an odd situation even more unusual are allegations involving
   one of Jackson's business development employees, Wajiha Khan, who's
   described in internal e-mail messages as "a person who would use her
   physical attractiveness as a tool for manipulation of men." According
   to e-mail written by Grigg, another employee "was well and thoroughly
   seduced by Wajiha and her attractive younger sister."
   
   In response to DigiGold's lawsuit, a judge in Anguilla prohibited
   Grigg "from terminating support for the DigiGold project or from
   taking the server offline," according to documents provided by
   Systemics. On June 19, Judge Hariprashad Charles lifted her injunction,
   and the dispute currently is in arbitration.
