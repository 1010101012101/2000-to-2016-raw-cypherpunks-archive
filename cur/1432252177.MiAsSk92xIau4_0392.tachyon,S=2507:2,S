nCipher chief is standing down



ALEX van Someren is to step down as chief executive of nCipher after 11 years.

Neil Lloyd will join the company as chief operating officer and a director
on July 1 and it is planned that he will replace Mr van Someren on January
1 next year.

Mr van Someren will remain on the board as a non-executive director after
he has stepped down.

He said: "Neil's leadership qualities and management experience will help
drive the continued growth and success of the company.

"After 11 years as chief executive officer, I have decided to step down and
I am looking forward to working with Neil during this period of transition."

Nicko van Someren will resign from nCipher's board with effect from July 1.

He will continue as chief technology officer and the company hopes to
appoint an additional, independent non-executive director to the board
later this year.
