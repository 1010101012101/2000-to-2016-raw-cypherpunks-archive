The fix that's been suggested for some time in the common wisdom about RC4, 
namely discarding the first 256 bytes of output, would seem to be entirely 
adequate to address the problems discovered. If this is considered to be 
part of the key setup, it slightly less than doubles the time, and it's 
extremely simple.

I have always felt that folding in the key with only a single pass was a 
bit "close to the edge". Note that the RC5 *key schedule* does at least 
three passes! (Not strictly comparable, of course.)

Another alternative suggests itself, which would be to continue the 
key-based randomisation for a second pass over the state array. I'd worry 
about weak keys that somehow undid their own actions, though, so I think I 
still prefer just letting the randomisation-through-generation continue.

Greg.
