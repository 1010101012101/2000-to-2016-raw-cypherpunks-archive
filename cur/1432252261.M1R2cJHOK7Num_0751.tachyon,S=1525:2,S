And that, boys and girls, is what traffic analysis is about.  You don't
need to know the surname of the endpoint of a communication to
know that said endpoint is interesting.

Also, of course, Al's mistake of thinking that the handset is the
endpoint, instead of the SIM.

Internet-broadcast stego is best if you don't have a courier and a
donkey.
