First Israel, now Vietnam.  Only Vietnam wants the US to
charge US citizens with terroristm against Vietnam.

Curiouser and curiouser.

Excerpts:

As the United States presses its war against terrorism,
Vietnam is demanding that American officials extend the
crackdown to an immigrant group they say has sponsored
Southeast Asian bombing attempts from its headquarters
in a nondescript Garden Grove office building.

..

 "Vietnam has asked the
U.S. to stop harboring, tolerating or supporting that
group. It should punish those who commit terrorist acts
on Vietnam . . . like Nguyen and his group."
..

Though it is not illegal for U.S. citizens to call for the
overthrow of a foreign government, it is against the law
for Americans to become involved in the effort to do so.


-----
Domestic terrorism is the only way to remind Americans that they
are responsible for what their government does.
