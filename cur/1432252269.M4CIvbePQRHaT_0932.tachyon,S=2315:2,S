Aperture is tiny (and expensive, exponentially so). Visible wavelength vs.
microwave is a
complete overkill in terms of mirror precision (lambda/10..100).
Depending on angular resolution you might want to check
out a small parabolic sat dish (less wind load on the mount -- which better be
not
azimuthal -- use a stepper-driven equatorial platform).

If you're just going to scan the horizont, it's just one degree of freedom.
2 1/2 if you wiggle a little up and down. Easy enough to improvise for cheap,
especially if you do it with a monster dish, which isn't at all like a truss
of a lightweight giant scope.
