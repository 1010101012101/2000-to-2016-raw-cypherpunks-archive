Germans Use Nokia Phones in Wireless Ticket Trial
 Tue Nov 2, 2004 06:04 AM ET

 HELSINKI (Reuters) - The world's top mobile phone maker Nokia said on
Tuesday its phones would be used in a project to test wireless public
transport fares in Hanau, near Frankfurt in Germany, beginning early next
year.

 The trial, in cooperation with the public transport authority for
Frankfurt's greater area and electronics group Philips, begins next year.

 It will enable owners of Nokia's 3220 handset to equip their phone with a
high-tech shell used to pay for and store electronic tickets.

 The shell, developed by Philips, contains technology that makes the phone
compatible with Hanau's existing ticketing system.

 "Users will simply need to touch their phones against the contactless
reader as they get on and off the bus to register their journey," Nokia
said in a statement.
