I can no longer keep count of how many lawsuits and other actions are 
now in the courts in various counties in Florida and heading for the 
State Supreme Court. At least a dozen, though some are being 
consolidated. More have been added, so the overall count will likely 
go up.

There is not even any point in my trying to summarize what the 
various camps are arguing about...pregnant chads, due process, 
dimpled chads, explanations of why recounts are required, hanging 
chads, voter fraud, Carol Roberts switching ballots, swinging door 
chads, constitutionality of recounts, rights of African-Americans, 
sunlight tests, butterfly ballots, legality of absentee ballots 
arriving late, chads, and indented pregnant dimpled chads.

While there were past close elections, and even elections where fraud 
probably gave the election to the loser, this looks to be a curiously 
modern election: the same lawyers who got O.J. off will get Gore into 
the White House.
