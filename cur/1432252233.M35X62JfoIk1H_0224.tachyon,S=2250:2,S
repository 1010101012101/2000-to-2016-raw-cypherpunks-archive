No one expects the Pedantry Police!

Goldberg used the phrase in a 1999 column, but he did not invent it. 

It's from a actually from a 1995 Simpsons episode, "Round Springfield"
(production number 2F32) Here's the quote in context:
----------------------
	[A little later, Bart puts his hand up]. 
Bart: 	Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I _please_ go to the
nurse? 
Edna: 	Gosh, Bart, maybe you really are in pain. 
	Well...it would be cruel not to let you go. 
	[files her nails, hums the national anthem] 
	[hums part of "Stars and Stripes Forever"] 
	Heh heh heh, _now_ you may go. 
Bart: 	[walking into nurse's room] Lunch Lady Doris? Why are you here? 
Doris: 	Budget cuts. They've even got Groundskeeper Willy teaching French. 
Willy: 	"Bonjourrr", you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!

First broadcast: April 30, 1995
