	A lot of people in the silk road forum liked to brag about how
	clever they were and how good tor was...

	Of course. I never suggested otherwise. The point is, they are
	vulnerable more or less like tor is, but at least they don't
	have some of tor's downsides.

	Yes, that sounds pretty likely.

	I think you know all the stuff I keep repeating as well as I
	do, or perhaps even better. You just don't want to draw any
	radical conclusion...

	Maybe I'm not fully complying with the technical definition of
	backdoor, but regardless of the name we use, tor works as if it
	was 'backdoored' by the people who created it. They can
	deanonimize people. It's not as easy as calling an actual
	backdoor in the code, but it can be done anyway.



> You argue that Tor is vulnerable to

	True. But I never said "it's just tor" either...

> numerous users are vulnerable to global adversaries.

	Yes.

	You can of course ask for imposible levels of proof. Do you
	want videos of meetings between syverson and his pentagon
	bosses?

	What I said is there's too much uncertainty for people who want
	to pretend that tor is 'reasonably' safe. THEY have the burden
	of proof and THEY can't prove their claims because there are
	lots of possible failure points. 

	If you are selling something that is complex, and even you
	 don't even fully understand, then that's too bad...for
	you! You can't get a free pass because *your* system is complex.

	PLUS, there's a fair amount of evidence illustrating failures.
	Ever heard about Ross Ulbricht? Freedom hosting? Agora? Sybil
	attacks? 2015 FBI attack? (I'm not even keeping up with the
	news)

	Ah yes. The more broken windows, the more economic development
	we get.

	I don't think you need an 'AI'(whatever you imagine them to be)
	to count packets or match timing/patterns.

	And you think the pentagon is funding a system that could cause

	So how are you going to destroy government using nuclear

	Well, chemical weapons are pretty much doable at home too and
	were not directly created by the government. They are a basic
	application of 19th century commercial chemistry. 

	But all this is beside the point.

	The internet is a tool for total domination.
