Hey i got your email from a message board. But since it seems you know
enough about fake ids. I had a question and i was hoping you could answer it
for me. I wanted to get a new identity and i was told i could do it two
ways. 1 way was to steal a living persons identity, and the other was to
steal a dead persons id. write back if you know anything to help me.
