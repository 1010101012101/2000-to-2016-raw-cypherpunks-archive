1. Invisiblog http://invisiblog.com/ lets you publish a weblog using GPG and the Mixmaster anonymous remailer network. You don't ever have to reveal your identity - not even to us. You don't have to trust us, because we'll never know who you are. 

2. File-Exchange https://www.meshmx.com/fe/ allows you to exchanging files with other people without giving away your identity or harming your privacy.
Furthermore it is so simple that you need nothing else but a web browser. No need for special software, hardware, resources etc. 

How to use it? 
You simply upload a file through the front end and get back an "access-key". This key can be send to any other person
by email, instant-messaging or IIP. Anyone who has that key can download the file again by entering the key into the front end....
By default the file will render unaccessible one hour after it had been uploaded.
