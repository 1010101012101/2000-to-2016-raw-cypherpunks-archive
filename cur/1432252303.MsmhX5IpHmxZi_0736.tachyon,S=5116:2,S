Wow, I got some money? When? From where?

You really should get your facts straight or your dose adjusted, John.

I was hired on the week IBM bought Tivoli. I didn't get a penny. Never
heard of Tivoli until they walked into the local Linux user group I was
helping run and asked me to come in for a job interview. Biggest network
I'd ever seen was about 50 machines, now 10,000 is itty bitty. Didn't know 
anything about IBM buying them out, and nobody outside of Tivoli & IBM did
either (well some lawyers perhaps). I was working at the local Community
College on a 'Semiconductor Technology' course to train folks for the
various fab's around Austin. It's only the 4th one to ever get accredited
by all the major manufacturers. I was the technical lead, responsible for
course content, lab design, etc. Not bad for somebody without a degree
I've always felt. Outside of that I ran their books, managed purchasing,
and did the occassional tutoring across the full electronics course
schedule. I worked there about 2.5 years. Before that I'd worked for
Compu-Add, coming on board to do technical support for Desert Storm
(though we didn't know it at the time) and their Point-of-Sale line.

As to my technical and troubleshooting skills, I'll let anyone who has
worked for me or directly with me answer that. Anyone else isn't qualified
to even have an opinion.

I would like to also add that I'm glad I don't live in NY. Any state that
would let somebody like you practice medicine without a license is not
someplace I want to even visit.
