In addition, in order to be covered by the parts of the Geneva Convention
dealing with POWs, you have to be soldiering for a signatory state.
Afghanistan signed the Covention a few decades ago but I don't know if the
Taliban would be covered.

The reverse of this BTW is that civilians defending their homes against
"unlawful combatants" are in the best position.  They aren't bound by the
Geneva Convention either and can use "expanding rifle ammo" (dum-dums) and
other goodies.  If civilians are defending against irregulars (say Al
Quida troops on the streets of New York) they don't have to accept
surrender offers and can be pretty much as nasty as they want.

War was invented to restore to men in agrigultural societies the
legitimate excuse to get away from home that hunting had provided in
hunter-gatherer societies.
