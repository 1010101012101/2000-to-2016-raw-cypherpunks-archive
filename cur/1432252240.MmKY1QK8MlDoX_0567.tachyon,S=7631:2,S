True, I guess--this time around, I just happen to be in the extremely lucky 
1%. Any work I have to do that's somewhat of a grind is a tiny, tiny price 
to pay for the rest of the time I have complete freedom to work on whatever 
projects I want while surrounded by excellent resources: my office is so 
private, comfortable and well-equipped, I usually stay late every night and 
come in on the weekends--researching, writing, coding, studying, absolutely 
anything I feel like doing. In a few weeks, it's back to a full graduate 
courseload on top of a flexible 40 hour workweek (we set our own hours), 
but since my employer is actually paying 100% of the tuition, and all the 
coursework dovetails nicely with the research I'm doing (for myself and for 
them), I couldn't be happier. I'd be a fool to let an opportunity to be in 
an environment like this pass me over in the name of "more leisure time."  
Even if I were unemployed and had my absolute choice, I'd still be 
researching, writing, coding, studying, etc. So the paycheck and free 
tuition is basically just icing on the cake. I never dreamed I'd get to the 
point I could say that, but there it is...

Yep, good point. But then again, there's the question of the differences in 
work environment between academia/nonprofit/NGO/think tank-types of places 
and the private sector, small businesses/corporations. Each of these 
sectors has a different reason-for-being, which in turn attracts different 
types of people. For instance, no matter how much freedom I could possibly 
have at a widget factory, I don't think I could ever get over the fact that 
the bottom line is I'm just there to make money for someone else via 
widgets. Plenty of dissatisfation to go around.

On the other hand, the first group of institutions is different in that 
respect because the "end" isn't a healthy profit, it's producing ideas or 
some other kind of service for the "good", (define as you will). Sure, 
there can be a lot of overlap between the public and private sectors, but 
in the best-case scenario that's a large part of the motivation. In fact, I 
think that blending the best of the nonprofit and for-profit worlds is the 
key to eliminating their respective drawbacks and getting rid of government 
intereference alltogether. I'd be glad to take this up further, if you 
don't find it utterly laughable.

oh blah, blah: for the rest of us, it's just part of a strategy to get 
farther, faster on the continuum of doing what you want to do. If you want 
to be able to work at Prestegious Groups X Y or Z but they aren't hiring, 
what else can you do? Before you know it, you've got a resume with 
experience from X Y and Z on it. And since you had the guts to propose and 
design the internships yourself, you have better control over what you get 
experience in whereas Day One payrollees get stuck with the low-level 
stuff, longer. Use people's sense of self-interest to further your own, 
it's the easiest thing in the world.

So when are you going to set up the Cypherpunks Mailing List 501(c)(3)? LOL!
