The attorney has no legal obligation to turn over HIS property to me, he
did buy the document after all. The subpeona was directed at me, not
another person who I have no control over. Here's his name and address,
serve him a subpeona at your discretion.

Worthless answer, but clearly exemplary of at least one of the problems of
the court system.

About the only way a judge could justifiably require all copies would be
if any copy not in control would represent a clear and present
danger/harm to some party.
