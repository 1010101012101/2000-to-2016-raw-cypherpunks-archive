   It used to be the case that people would hack PBXs and dial them in a 
sequence.  Feels like a lost art.  =/

   As for burner phones now, $10 in cash will get you a phone with ten 
minutes of talk time already on it.  Another $20 will buy you an hour's 
worth of time, and so on. No ID required.  The idea that people are 
paying $75 for a burner phone, only to totally misuse it, is annoying.  
Ideally, burner phones would be both disposable and used only for 
talking with <4 other burner phones which *also* only communicate with 
that same group of phones.  But even then, it's problematic to say the 
least.

   Social graphing cell phone users is extremely useful.  Think of your 
own phone habits.  Who do you call?  An average person might call their 
boyfriend, their best friend, their office, and maybe order a pizza.  So 
how many people call those four numbers?  How many people call *one* of 
those numbers?  Less than ten on a regular basis?  Also, this basic 
social graphing doesn't even take into account one's location.  Steve 
Rambam has had a lot of great things to say about this as well:

   And that's how people get caught being "anonymous" with cell phones.
