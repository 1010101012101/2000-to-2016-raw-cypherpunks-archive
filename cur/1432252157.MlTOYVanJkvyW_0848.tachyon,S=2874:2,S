Given that a tax is already collected to make backups of music (the 
1992 Home Recording Act levies a tax on blank media), if one were to 
buy a CD at Tower Records and then not be able to make a copy, one 
would expect:

-- a refund of taxes levied on blank media

or

-- a refund of the money paid for the alleged CD

(plus compensation for the time and mileage consumed)

Were Tower Records to refuse a full refund plus compensation, then of 
course it would be moral to burn down their building.

Maybe after a few such burnings and 20 or 30 deaths of co-conspirators, 
the practice will change.
