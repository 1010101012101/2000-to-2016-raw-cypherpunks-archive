	I used to work for a mid-sized and rather famous magazine as technical support for the designers and editors, as well I was (by training and work experience) a graphic designer. 

	To answer your question, the kind of workplace where something like this can happen is, for a magazine, a very "normal" kind of work place. Stories crop up late, or changes get made at the last minute. You're a bit under length so you scramble for filler, or you're a bit over, so you cut. Something happens to the server, so you're waiting to restore from backup and hope you haven't lost too much. Or one of a hundred different things.

	No, only one person had to make the *conscious* decision. All the other people simply had to not notice the lack.

	If you read First Freedom (and my copy is currently on the tank awaiting further perusal) with a critical eye, and have an understanding of the underlying issues and numbers, it's often quite obvious that that magazine, while it may tell the truth, it does not tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 

	But it's not supposed to. It's a propaganda rag for the NRA. All we should expect is that they don't deliberately lie.
