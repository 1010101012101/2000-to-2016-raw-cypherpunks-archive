We can also periodically "reuniquize" the shared files, in some sane 
period, say every weekend. (That pollutes the shared-files pool with a lot 
of almost-the-same copies, diminishing the advantage of multisource 
download. So perhaps is it better to just use encrypted data storage and 
anonymized P2P network, and keep uniquicity only of the system 
executables?)

Yes. However, depending on the system, same files (with the same hash) 
differing only by name will look as a single file (eg. edonkey or WinMX). 
Other systems, depending on the file name only (eg. OpenNap), will show 
files with different names as different, even if identical inside.

Care to elaborate further, please?

Or buy an Enfora Enabler GSM/GPRS module, add a Gumstix module with 
built-in bluetooth, slap in a suitable display and keyboard, eventually 
add a GPS receiver, and we're set. All features and security modes we can 
imagine, and then some.

Preventing spatial tracking is difficult though, as we're dependent on the 
cellular network for staying online. Though if the given area has wifi 
mesh coverage, it could be easier. (And if the device becomes widely 
popular, the handsets can serve as mesh nodes themselves - but that's a 
song of rather far future.)

Why not? :) Isn't the main purpose of science-fiction (at least its 
certain kinds) to be the inspiration for the future?

On the other hand, perhaps it's cheaper to just get a bulk supply of 
"blank" faceplates and hire an artist with an airbrush and a talent.

It's also possibly easier (and cheaper) to make the parts in more 
classical way, eg. by casting them from resin. The rapid prototyping 
machines so far usually don't provide parts that are both nice-looking, 
accurate, and with suitable mechanical properties at once.

There is nothing like "too many" gizmos! (Well, you could call such 
situation "almost enough", but never "too many".)
