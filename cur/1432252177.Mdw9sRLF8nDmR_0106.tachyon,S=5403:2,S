Okay, a have a chemical laser, something which burns tons of fuel
(deuterium/fluorine) in a second in a resonant cavity. It is hence a not
very small cavity. The wavelength is IR, several microns. This is
high-power optics with a giant aperture (because, you don't want your
optics to suffer the fate of your target, and because the resonant cavity
itself is huge).

Lenses don't like giant fluxes, either. Even a ruby laser pulse can break
optics, or the rod, if it has a blemish. Lenses are *HEAVY*. Lenses are
not flexible, so you can't use them for tracking. Lenses don't do very
well when we're talking about few um IR.

So what that leaves you with is an active mirror optics.

Jim, I fear that bullet accident you had took a chunk out of one of your
frontal lobes. Or at least lead to a hemorrhage to a lesion in that area.
Have you ever had a MRI screen done? I'm serious.
