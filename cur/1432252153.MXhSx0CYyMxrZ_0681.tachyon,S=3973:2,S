No, it's diplomacy by other means. War is only one means, not 'the' means
as this would indicate.

Well their political leaders do anyway. Not sure if it's consistent to
equate the American people with their leaders.

There is usually no single objective. Further, if your goal is anything
other than peaceful co-existance any distinction between you and the enemy
is specious.

Specious distinction. The agent pursuing the 'antagonistic interest' is a
country in most cases (at least at the scale you are speaking of).

Yeah, it's called politics.

Stating the obvious again.
