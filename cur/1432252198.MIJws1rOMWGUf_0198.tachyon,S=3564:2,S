McFarland & Co. is now accepting pre-publication orders for "Aid and 
Comfort": Jane Fonda in North Vietnam.  Please visit www.hanoijane.net to 
view the book's cover, a flyer containing information about the book, a 
pre-publication order form, and ordering information.  You will also find 
at www.hanoijane.net a link allowing on-line purchase of "Aid and Comfort": 
Jane Fonda in North Vietnam.

I encourage those of you who want this book to succeed to forward this 
notice to your email lists, and to ask those recipients to forward it to 
others, and so on down the line.  Also, feel free to print, copy, and 
distribute the flyer/order form, and ask libraries to purchase "Aid and 
Comfort."

I cannot stress enough the importance of pre-publication orders.  For one 
thing, they will affect the quantity of the book's first printing.  For 
another, pre-publication orders may influence the publisher's promotional 
and related efforts on behalf of the book.  Thus, it will be very helpful 
if those of you who intend to purchase "Aid and Comfort": Jane Fonda in 
North Vietnam order it now, and encourage others to do so.

HANK AND ERIKA HOLZER
