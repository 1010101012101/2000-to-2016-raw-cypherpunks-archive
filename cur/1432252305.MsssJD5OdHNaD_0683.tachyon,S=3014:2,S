Exactly.  I also run an open WiFi (labelled as "Open Wifi" :-) for others,
as a payment for those that I use around town.  Interestingly, I don't
know of anyone who still actively wardrives at random (as opposed to
against specific targets) for this same reason.  Why bother?  The only
thing you really *should* have is a high powered card with any reasonably
directional antenna (~$120.00usd as a set).  That and a laptop and you can
run any midsized office that doesn't need to provide services at a fixed
IP :-)

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
