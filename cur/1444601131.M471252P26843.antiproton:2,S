Used to be you'd be accused of being COINTELPRO, now it's JTRIG. "Differing
opinion"? Almost never an option.
Different=3Dwrong-bad-evil-enemy-hate-suspect-accuse.

On technical issues, I'm definitely a neophyte, but I'd been in contact
with JYA for quite sometime, he'd published a few documents I supplied and
shared many links on twitter. You'd think that would get him to look at the
data before smearing me. As for off-message? That's a spin term. I'm not
anti-authoritarian enough, I guess - that's quite possible by some
standards.

&gt;<br>
&gt; So how the fuckd this really happen?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Mirimir &lt;<a href=3D"mailto:mirimir@riseup.net">mirimir@riseup.net</=
a>&gt; Are you arguing that users could have<br>
&gt; found those logs?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I almost can&#39;t imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewh=
ere,<br>
&gt; and I can&#39;t imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can&#39;=
t<br>
&gt; imagine how Cryptome archives would have included anything from<br>
&gt; /var/log/, even after system restore from backups.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &lt;--SNIP--&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Should access logs be kept for that long? Absolutely not. From wh=
at<br>
&gt; &gt; I&gt; have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log fi=
les<br>
&gt; &gt; were&gt; included in a NetSol total restore. My guess is that<br>
&gt; &gt; John/Cryptome did&gt; not intentionally keep these files, and did=
 not<br>
&gt; &gt; realize these files were&gt; included in the archive.<br>
&gt; But that&#39;s the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how<=
br>
&gt; would the &quot;NetSol total restore&quot; have changed that?<br>
<br>
Not necessarily...<br>
<br>
Logs in /var/log is where they should be by default, but if the box is<br>
on a shared hosting account, then things are completely different. For<br>
instance, Bluehost charges $3.95/month, which gets you a home directory<br>
on a box shared with hundreds of other users. In your home directory,<br>
you get something like (from memory, which was a long, long time ago):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 ~/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/html/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/access_log<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/error_log<br>
<br>
So as you can see, the user does have permissions to access logs, but<br>
are kept in the user&#39;s _home_ directory. Now you can see why this could=
<br>
have mistakenly been distributed:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 tar zcf cryptome-backup.tar.gz ~/<br>
<br>
The backup would have also slurped in all the logs. There was no malice,<br=

just an easy mistake that everyone here could have make given the same<br>
circumstances.<br>

It&#39;s simple.<br>
Someone made a mistake. Best was initially assumed full of shit by JYA, as<=
br>
he&#39;s a neophyte - and is consistently &#39;off-message&#39; for this li=
st.<br>
<br>
Others, wishing to read more into it, other than face value of hubris, see<=
br>
plans within plans.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, Bests&#39; disclosures amount to nothing of conseque=
nce.<br>
At best he overhyped them, being a neophyte. At worst he&#39;s JTRIGd the l=
ist,<br>
hilariously easily. The technical cognoscenti on the list stay quiet, &quot=
;code<br>
compiling&quot; as the good doctor says.<br>
<br>
In general, this oversight is valuable because it demonstrates one thing:<b=
r>
Even if you try to delete it.<br>
If there&#39;s a signal it will leak. Purposefully or not.<br>
<br>
When the protocol you use doesn&#39;t provide metadata anonymity, don&#39;t=
 expect<br>
it because you won&#39;t get it. If you don&#39;t understand this - keep st=
udying.<br>
<br>
Why guess at &#39;motivation&#39;? Do we need to FUD yet another leaker sit=

your money where your mouth is - improve it, donate, write your own, fix<br=

the bug &amp; plug the hole.<br>
