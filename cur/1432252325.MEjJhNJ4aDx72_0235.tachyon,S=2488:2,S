A cynical man would suggest that he's already been co-opted by MwG and MSM.

But this is nothing new.  The MwG's trend for many years has been to
conflate anonymity with illegality.  The recent news about BitTorrent
"cooperating" with ??AA, for example, seems more about "clearing"
BitTorrent's name than anything else.  Anonymity does not serve the
(police) state.
