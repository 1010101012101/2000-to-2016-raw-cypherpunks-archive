Told You So
Alas, a Couple of Bob's Dire Predictions Have Come True

By Robert X. Cringely

Just over three years ago I wrote a column titled "Cooking the Books: How 
Clever Accounting Techniques are Used to Make Internet Millionaires." It 
explained how telecom companies were using accounting tricks to create 
revenue where there really was none. Take another look at the column (it's 
among the links on the "I Like It" page), and think of Worldcom with its 
recently revealed $3.7 billion in hidden expenses. Then last August, I 
wrote a column titled "The Death of TCP/IP: Why the Age of Internet 
Innocence is Over." Take a look at that column, too, and think about 
Microsoft's just-revealed project called Palladium.
