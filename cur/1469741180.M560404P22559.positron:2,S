May be ioerror got 'just desserts'. It does not look that way to me.

Also seems the "leak" war (using Wikileaks) going on between warring
factions in North America at the moment is a Good Thing (TM)(C)(R).

BUT, you may well be right that the harm being caused by USA, all around
the world, droning people to death day in and day out, is being fuelled
by their well funded tool Tor and that the balance is not in our favour.
Though I believe that the balance is certainly not in our favour, if you
have a North American establishment damaging leak, I think you owe it to
the world to get that leak out there, whether via Wikileaks or some
other mechanism.

I am barely hopeful for a "soft landing" for the world when the USA's
fiat dollar finally crashes. After the turmoil, it's possible we may see
some genuine improvements.
