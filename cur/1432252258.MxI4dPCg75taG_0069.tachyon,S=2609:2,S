Then why do people pay?  

Ultimately law is backed by violence.

Having, say, your restaurant license revoked by a bureaucrat in
an agency created by a committe empowered by elected officials does
not change the fact that Folks With Guns will haul you and your property
away if you operate without their permission.  

You "don't go to jail for not paying GEMA" but you do go to jail
for not paying fines for not paying GEMA, not showing up in court, etc.  

Don't pretend.
