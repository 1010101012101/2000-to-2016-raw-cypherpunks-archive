I have to admit, the statistics (50/50) are what one would expect from a
random draw; there have been a raft of 'situations' with respect to the
actual voting; there's all sorts of law-suit and criminal charges threats
flying about, and now the various minorities have gotten into it. I'm
wondering if we haven't just seen the first (metaphorical) shot.

It's clear that whatever side one is on, the general totality feels
threatened, betrayed, disenfranchised, and basicly fucked over.

We might not have to wait till 2020 after all...
