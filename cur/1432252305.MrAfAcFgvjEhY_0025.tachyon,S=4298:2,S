Its nice in theory, but in practice look how long it takes the bulk of
the
internet to install urgent patches - how long is it going to take to get
people to install an upgrade to privacy that actually causes more
problems
for them?
Besides the core here is that
1) everyone with a server enroute can read the mail
2) you are relying on every other link in the chain to protect your
privacy

clientside crypto fixes both these problems, reduces the total crypto
load
on the chain (encryption/decryption is only ever done once) and allows
use
of digital signatures.

Exactly the intention, yes :)
Just for the sake of it (anyone who cares will have seen my signature
enough times by now) I will sign this one :)
