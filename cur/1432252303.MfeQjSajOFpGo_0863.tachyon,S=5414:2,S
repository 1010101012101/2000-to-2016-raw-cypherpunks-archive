Just a followup having read a little more about cjdns now -- basically
Serval doesn't need cjdns because the Serval overlay mesh network uses
public keys as network addresses.  Being an overlay, it is also possible
for us to use arbitrary transports, and not have to worry about needing
root access on a device.  This means that we can make a 1st-class Android
mesh client that doesn't need root, for example.  The use of public keys as
network addresses means that all communications can be encrypted and
authenticated without any further complications.  The use of IP on Serval
mesh nodes is just to provide something for the mesh to tunnel over, so the
IP configuration is not interesting to us, and can be configured however
the user otherwise wishes if they want it to interoperate with some
existing IP network or mesh.
