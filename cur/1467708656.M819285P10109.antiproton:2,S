&gt;<br>
&gt; I have carefully examined the code of The DAO and decided to<br>
&gt; participate after finding the feature where splitting is rewarded with=
<br>
&gt; additional ether. I have made use of this feature and have rightfully<=
br>

&gt; reward. It is my understanding that the DAO code contains this feature=
<br>
&gt; to promote decentralization and encourage the creation of &quot;child<=
br>
&gt; DAOs&quot;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am disappointed by those who are characterizing the use of this<br>
&gt; intentional feature as &quot;theft&quot;. I am making use of this expl=
icitly<br>
&gt; coded feature as per the smart contract terms and my law firm has<br>

&gt; &quot;The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart<br>

&gt; 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this<br>
&gt; explanation of terms or in any other document or communication<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; A soft or hard fork would amount to seizure of my legitimate and<br>

<br>
&gt; Such fork would permanently and irrevocably ruin all confidence in<br>
