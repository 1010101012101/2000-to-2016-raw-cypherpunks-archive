What, because law is made by criminals, for criminals? idk why you don't
like law. I guess you'd rather grab a horse, a sack, and a rope, and call
that justice.

Ethical considerations like animal rights should not encode into strict
law. Same goes for drugs, sexuality, etc. Because these things are
difficult and I am not going to hurt people (punish them) for something
that might be fine, depending on how you look at it.

You know, when I answer with a joke it's probably because I couldn't bother
to bridge to your level of stupidity. Sorry for letting that out, but
compare the Wild West to the Roman Empire, compare African tribes to old
Japan. Structured violence can decrease overall violence.

If that's beyond you, well, I guess that's why 100% consent is not an
option.

I explained in detail why this is. If you didn't get the "costs of
enforcement" argument you're allowed to admit it. Hell, you might try
providing any argument yourself instead of responding to mine.

(to recap: if it costs 100 bucks to enforce a contract, the contract will
not at all protect any damage below 100 bucks. Without governance the cost
of strict enforcement is huge. You may also be in no position at all to
enforce a contract, like when your adversary is more powerful than you)

You're like a redneck piece of shit or something. To call CERN scammers ...
you must be seriously troubled.

And, actually, yeah, I think humanity is pretty much nothing but little pet
projects. I think bigger and cooler pet projects are practically all we can
hope for.

I know it's hard to reason with undefined variables, but the system was
instantiated as "some organization that can generate 'appropriate'
political decisions", where I marked "appropriate" such that you might
understand it is an undefined variable, that I cannot fill in just like
that.

It's not the first time you've failed to grasp my meaning, and responded
unkindly to the shadows you drew instead.

Nah, I'm fundamental. If you think the word freedom has a good exact

Continuing in the same vein as the CERN comment. Sad.

Well, at least I don't think I'm the source and means of justice.

Like, I dunno Juan, I'm really trying here. I thought you were about to
start explaining what you think, but here you are, spewing meaningless
offense again.

I mean, I learned some formal logic, you'd say that's a superset of basic
logic. UKGOV (through cie <http://cie.org.uk/>) even certified me for
critical thinking which, I think, involved some logic. I mean I got a
pretty bad grade, but I think it is because I merely skimmed the book the
day before the exam and dedicated my essay to shitting on the BBC and how
they're pressured for time in a world with bad journalism and lack specific
expertise to discuss complex topics, but whatever.

Doctors say no, Juan says yes, the mystery continues...

Did you ever go for a mental checkup? Or did you prefer the criminals keep
their scary tentacles away from you?

Poor alternative to admitting natural rights are just propagandaspeak for a
proposed core/basic/minimal morality, and adjusting how you think about
them.

I feel your pain, but please direct your frustration towards the mountain.
It knows how to help you.

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Same thing with natural rights. =
