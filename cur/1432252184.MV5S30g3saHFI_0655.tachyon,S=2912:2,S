I don't follow your logic.  (At least you admit my alleged irresponsibility
is arguable.)  Please tell me how you think referencing an alleged crime
many years in the past somehow endangers anyone's safety today.  I don't
see.  I've committed felonies, you've committed felonies, we've all
committed felonies, over the years.  So what?  What difference can
mentioning it make?  Where is the danger to Tim's safety?  Who represents
that danger and how are my actions the proximate cause of such alleged
danger?

You're a smart and reasonable guy, Declan, and you may be right.  I don't
think so, but I'm open to your argument.
