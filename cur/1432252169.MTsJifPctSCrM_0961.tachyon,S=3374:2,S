      All the more reason to morph freenet/mojo to mix duties, maybe even
create a worm version 
that gives no evidence of it's existence, other than some increase in traffic.

   What happened to melontrafficers.com BTW?

  Last I checked, the vast bulk of remailers were in North America and
  Europe. Given sufficient provocation (Bush twins kidnapped, Osama
  talking biochemwomdterror in DC), I could easily see a coordinated set
  of pre-dawn raids to "gather evidence" and seize computers as part of
  a criminal investigation. Obviously the servers would have to be held
  as potential evidence for a trial - did they keep logs? our techs will
  find out - which could take a decade. This would cripple the current
  remailer network and generate almost no public outcry beyond the
  cypherpunks and such.
