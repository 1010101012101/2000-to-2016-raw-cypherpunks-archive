Lee spent 9 months in solitary confinement and lost significant 
salary and retirement benefits.

This makes it a moral requirement that former Defense Secretary 
William Perry face a similar period of confinement and similar loss 
of benefits. Perry has acknowledged downloading top secrets to his 
home computer and leaving codeword material where his family, 
housekeepers, and other visitors could have found and copied it.

There are a couple of cases of other DOD folks in the same straits.

What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
