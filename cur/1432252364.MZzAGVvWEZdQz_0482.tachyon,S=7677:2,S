Check out "Using Payments to Promote Cooperation in Anonymity Protocols"
by Figueiredo et al, ftp://gaia.cs.umass.edu/pub/Anon_Incentive_03-31.pdf
for a pretty good introduction to the problem. There are a lot of unsolved
problems here though. For example:

One could imagine a payment protocol where the initiator delivers to
node i+1 a coin which is only valuable to node i, and if all is going
well then i+1 hands the coin to i. But what about paying the last node
in the path? External sites (e.g. webservers) don't know about your
protocol. So either you don't pay the last hop, in which case there's
no incentive for anybody to honor that, or you give him the money and
hope for the best, which again isn't so good incentive-wise.

This is critical because of another sort of free-riding on systems
like onion routing: many users would prefer to run middleman nodes
(relaying traffic only inside the network, and allowing nothing to exit
from their node).

Another issue to consider is collusion. If nodes work together, can
they take your money without providing service? An incentive/payment
scheme should at the least tolerate some amount of this, especially in
the context of Sybil attacks: http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#sybil

Does the payment system enable the adversary to attract more traffic by
performing well? See "Reliable MIX Cascade Networks through Reputation"
for more details around this issue: http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#casc-rep

Rather than explicitly trying to reward good behavior, you might also
consider implicit incentives. For example, running a node (and relaying
traffic) can provide *better anonymity* for a user, so he should want to
do it, and the most plausible cover traffic is actual other traffic. See
"On the Economics of Anonymity", http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#econymics

Another area to look at is the token-based incentive scheme in GNUnet --
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html#ebe2003 and
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#bennett:pet2003

There's a lot still to be worked out here.

How do you make sure the guy you just paid gets the guys later in the
path to perform well?

Is "credit" local (relative to just you) or global (I do something for
Janet, then get to use Jane's resources)? If global, how do I tell people
that somebody has performed well/poorly without revealing that I just
used them?

Do I choose nodes for my paths based on my view of peoples' credit, so
an adversary who tracks my perspective could guess which paths are mine
based on which nodes are in the path? (Or worse, he could influence my
view of the network so I'm likely to pick nodes that nobody else picks,
making me even more partitioned.)

How do you distinguish between somebody who's legitimately down sometimes
and somebody who provides selective service (relays some traffic, but
always just takes Jane's money and ignores her)?

What incentive do nodes have to pass traffic *back*? Most requests
in Tor (the deployed second-generation onion routing system, see
http://freehaven.net/tor/) send a few bytes forward and get many bytes
in return.

If the credits are local, here's another attack: the adversary shows
up and uses your node, then gives you a token so you can use his. He's
just bought the right to relay some of your traffic. Depending on the
design, either you get to choose the later hops in the path, in which
case you'll probably have to pay for them too (meaning you'll have
gathered tokens for them -- and how did you do that? Some nice guy
showed up and used your node, then gave you a token to use him back),
or the adversary gets to choose your next hop, and we all know where
that leads (cf http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#morphmix:wpes2002).

I've written a bit more discussion about these topics in
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#rep-anon, including some questions about
reputation and currency in section 6.

It might sound like I'm trying to convince you this is an impossible
problem. But I actually think we're getting closer to finding some sort
of halfway-decent incentive scheme in the next couple of years. I figure
the first step is to understand it well enough to figure out which parts
we can ignore. Maybe enumerating the problems will drive somebody to
show me how easy it is? :)
