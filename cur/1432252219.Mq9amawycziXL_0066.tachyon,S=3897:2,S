Asking Jim to make his posts "meaningful" doesn't do anything other
than annoy Jim and add to the clutter on the list.  If readers do
not find Jim's posts worth reading, then they should not waste their
time reading them.

Below is a procmail script fragment to filter out Jim's cypherpunks posts
into a seperate folder without affecting any other mail he might send to
the recipient.  If you wanted you could get fancier and also filter on
"slashdot" in the mail body.
