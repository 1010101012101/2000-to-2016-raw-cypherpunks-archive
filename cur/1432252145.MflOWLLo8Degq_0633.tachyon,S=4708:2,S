I concur.  The problem is that the most prevalent e-mail
program (Outlook) requires no user intervention as a default
when signing and/or encrypting a message with S/MIME.  One can
override the default to "High Security" (requiring password)
only while the X.509 certificate is being installed.

I also agree that alternative authorization mechanisms (or
combination thereof) are entirely appropriate:  smartcards,
flashcards, biometric readers, magnetic strips, bar codes, etc.
 Different schemes will work provided the hardware is available
and adequate authentication can be assured.
