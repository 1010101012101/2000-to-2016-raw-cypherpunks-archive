Since 'targeting' a product at someone usually only implies dissemination of
information of some kind, it is difficult to justify any restrictions. I've
yet to see any proper reason for treating 'commercial' speech as separate
from the traditional highly protected kind. Besides, advertising is a mass
thing, which implies that giving a single parent any control over what is
targeted at his/her children would given him/her pretty much the same
control over what all chilren get. This is even harder to justify.

So what is an 'adult' product? I find Penthouse highly suitable for the
12-16 year age range. You?

There is no such conflict. You can always go live in the woods if the urban
culture doesn't please you. Who said people have a right to all the comforts
of modern society without paying the price of reduced control over the
upbringing of their children?
