Its usually easier to gain access to a resource by exploiting those who
have the perms you seek.

Its usually easier to gain access to a resource by exploiting those who
have the perms you seek.

These types of competitions are neat; skilled attackers aren't really
incentivized to sink 0days on CTF games when there's a huge payoff for
responsibly disclosing / not to mention the potential payoff of malicious
use of an Apache code exec.

Your best bet is relying on operating systems with a good track record,
using a capabilities based security model (pax + grsec on nix). Routine
administrative bits: least privileges, patches, hardened binaries,
isolation.
