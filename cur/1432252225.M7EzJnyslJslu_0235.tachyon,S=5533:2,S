</B></FONT><I><P>&#9;You can make <B><U>$2,250 OR MORE</B></U> for every fax blast we do for you.  There is no limit to the amount of fax broadcast you can order.  Here is how it works.  You will mail a $125.00 payment (for an Internet Marketing Software Package &amp; Fax Broadcast Service) to:  Sturgeon Enterprises, 15072 E Mississippi Ave, #120—Aurora,CO  80012.</P>
<P>&#9;You will also mail a $75.00 payment each to the members in the #2 and #3 positions below.  Once you have done this we will fax broadcast this same circular with  your name and address in the #2 position to 1,000 opportunity seekers or until you receive at least 5 responses for $375.  Just ½% response will bring you $375.  Think what will happen with 1% response.  Then we take all orders from your fax broadcast (remember  you are guaranteed 5 responses for $375) and fax broadcast for those  1000 times each or until they all receive 5 responses with your name and address in the #3 position.  This will bring you a minimum of 25 guaranteed responses for $1875 making your total return $2250 at a minimum.  And that’s not all.  Once you are a member you can order additional fax broadcast for $150 each.  This will allow you to make $2250 or more each time for a $150 fax broadcast order.  To prevent any cheating we will need for you to send  us the names of all people who send!

<P>&#9;Fill out the application below &amp; mail or overnight it and the membership fee of $125 to Sturgeon Enterprises.  Mail your $75 payments to the members in the #2 and #3 positions below.  You can send the entire $275 to Sturgeon Enterprises if you want to, and we will forward the $75 payments to #2 and #3 for you.  Please send money orders only—no checks or cash.</P>
