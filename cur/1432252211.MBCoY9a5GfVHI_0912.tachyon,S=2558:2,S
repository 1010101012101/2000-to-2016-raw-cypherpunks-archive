   An anonymous reader writes "CNet is reporting that Congress may be
   working to [1]extend the record retention requirements they're already
   working on for ISPs to social networking sites. Sites such as MySpace
   or FaceBook would be required to hold onto content access records for
   an unspecified length of time." From the article: "In those meetings,
   Justice Department representatives went beyond the argument that data
   retention was necessary to protect children--and claimed it would aid
   in terrorism investigations as well. During Wednesday's hearing,
   politicians also claimed that social-networking sites were not doing
   enough to verify that their users who claimed to be a certain age were
   telling the truth. (Recent news reports have said that sex predators
   are using MySpace and similar sites to meet up with teens.)"
