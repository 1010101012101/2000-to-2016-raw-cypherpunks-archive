Are you guys still talking about the feasibility of a cipher that implements
each AES candidate in turn with the same key? I don't really get this idea.
Provided you were actually using the same key with each stage of the
encryption, then your system is only gong to be as secure as the key of the
first algorithm. In fact, it seems that if the key is compromised at any one
point, then the entire system is shot, given that you know the algorithm
(Kerckhoff's principle IIRC). Maybe I am misunderstanding. 

ok,

o Your opponent has the cryptologic capabilities of the a major world power
o The content has very high value (multi-billion dollar deal, could 
bring down a government, could start a war)
o Long term protection is required (30+ years)
o You are in a position to properly secure the terminals at both ends
0 Efficiency is not a concern

For example, a chief of state's personal diary, an opposition 
leader's communications, best and final bids on large projects, etc.

In a way I see this question as how one should manage the transition 
from 3DES to AES. Does one keep using DES until the big day and then 
switch to AES? Or does a blended solution make sense in some cases?

While I think there may be a use for something like a Paranoid 
Encryption Standard in very unusual situations, I don't wish to waste 
more of people's time arguing with those who say there's no need for 
it at all. I don't have any compelling evidence.  It's pure 
speculation.

I am really more interested in the theoretical "why not?" question, 
i.e. is there any real downside in combining ciphers in this way, 
besides efficiency?  Conventional wisdom seems to be more cautious 
than I think is justified and I am trying to prove that.
