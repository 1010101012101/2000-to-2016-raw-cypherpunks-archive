One might read the decision this way, if the Supreme Court had not
specifically written that "The second amendment means no more than that
it shall not be infringed by Congress".

The national government is simply mentioned in the decision because the
question at bar was if the 2nd applied to the States via the 14th. Under
Cruikshank, the Supreme Court ruled that it does not. The Court held
that the 2nd only constrained the national government, not the States,
and of the national government, only Congress.

Under Presser, such an executive order by the President would likely be
considered unconstitutional.

FYI, the Supreme Court has since revisited, and overturned itself, in
just about every aspect of Cruikshank, *except* that the 14th does not
extend the 2nd to the States. Which was the issue that Steve Schear
inquired about and to which I responded with my post.
