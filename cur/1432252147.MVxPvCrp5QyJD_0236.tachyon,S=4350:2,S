The Internet is a big bathroom wall and everyone has a crayon.  I learned
long ago that trying to apply meatspace standards for libel and slander to
the Internet was a futile exercise.

I still think it's more likely than not that Sharon made the comments, but
I learned long ago that seeking absolute truth in anything other than
discrete mathematics was also a futile exercise.

Some do.  Some don't.  Oddly enough, the "We control America" slogan seems
to be gaining popularity in Israel.  There are now reports in the
Palestinian press of workers with American peace organizations,
investigating the treatment of the Palestinians, being taunted by IDF
soldiers shouting "We control America."

Either a clever propaganda campaign to sour relations between the US and
their Zionist client state, or Israeli cajones that need to be beaten back
down to normal size.

Perhaps Sharon could seize the moment, and print up "We Control America"
bumper stickers for his re-election campaign.
