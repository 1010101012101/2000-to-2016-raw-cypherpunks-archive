in the past i've used p2p networks along with traditional search
engines to locate documents of interest. in particular, PDF and DOC
formats, especially related to "Confidential Information" and court
filings.

i won't go into details, but suffice to say this is very effective if
pursued as a consistent strategy over a modest time period. ("it only
takes one...").  and if they've used "redaction" to white-on-white the
sensitive bits it's even easier to pull out the high value details
within.  preaching to the choir here,


i was more interested in critical infrastructure at the time, rather
than political or other cruft. yet the principal is the same for WL or
whoever.
