Well, first off it is commonly known that aiding and abetting a known 
terrorist group is a crime anywhere. Especially if it's one no one with 
disreputable hobbies like ISIS.

Secondly, I'd like to present the following hypothesis: the actuator or 
the currency used to procure whatever an ISIS-fighter might want or need 
will take the form of US$ in exchange for some commodity.

But I won't digress on that point. What is important is if governments 
are so easy to point out that things beyond their control are so 
nefarious because they themselves are unable to control it, I'd like to 
suggest that they start by controlling streams of goods and services 
that they themselves are contributing to the prolonged existence of ISIS.

We, the informed community, all know most of their equipment comes from 
sponsors that are nations that would persecute this very person for 
aiding and abetting. Where as when a member of U.S. Congress or the CIA 
lend a helping hand to the "resistance" in the form of war-materials and 
supporting services it is considered but a faux pas.
