Oregon refuses to ignore basic constitutional rights for the sake of the
war on terrorism:

"Portland police have refused a U.S. Justice Department request for help
in interviewing Middle Eastern immigrants as part of its sweeping
terrorism investigation, saying it would violate state law."

"Arabs and Muslims have expressed outrage at the U.S. Justice Department's
plan to interview the 5,000 men, who are not suspected of any crimes. The
list is comprised of men ages 18 to 33 who entered the United States since
January 1, 2000, from countries that have been linked to the hijackers in
the September 11 attacks or were waystations for the terrorist
organization, al Qaeda."

Oregon does battle with Ashcroft over physician-assisted suicide laws:

"The judge said his order "nullifies giving any legal effect" to
Ashcroft's directive -- in other words, doctors should not fear legal
repercussions if they follow the Oregon law."

"Ashcroft's order prompted the court challenge, with Oregon officials
saying the government was trying to strip the state of its right to govern
the practice of medicine"

DEA feds declare war on Californians:

"Unable to find Osama bin Laden or dismantle al Qaeda, the Bush
administration has attacked an easier target -- the 960 mostly AIDS and
cancer patients of the Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center."

"The basis for the raid is the long-standing state-vs.federal government
dispute over who has say over drug laws. In 1996, California voters
approved Proposition 215, which gave patients the right to possess medical
marijuana. The federal government has refused to recognize the law in
California and eight other states and Washington, D.C., which have passed
similar medical-marijuana measures. Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
against the reopening of an Oakland club, a decision cited in last weeks
search warrant."

Add that to the raid on the Sacramento doctor and lawyer recently,
resulting in hundreds of seized patient records. Damn pesky West Coast
states, trying to pretend that they still have rights. They're part of the
Union and have to do what Bushcroft says -- except, of course, when it
comes to power outages. Then they're on their own.

Hmm. Anyone see Redmond as the capital of the Independent States of the
Pacific Coast?
