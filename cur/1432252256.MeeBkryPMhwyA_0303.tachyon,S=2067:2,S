This is old news.

No, really, I'm not channeling Mr. May and telling you to hit the 
archives...  A few years ago, this was a topic here, and the outcome was 
that cypherpunks should wear their hair long so as to cover their ears. 
Kinda goes with the long hair - 10 gallon hat kinda look. :)

I believe the INS requires pictures at 45 degrees for green cards, but not 
passports(???), so that they can see one ear (or enough of it to use as ID) 
so it's quite likely that somewhere some black budget project likely 
already made leaps into this technology, and that this is possibly just 
another example of a university doing stuff that the spooks have already 
done 10 years ago - or whenever...
