This letter is in regards to the email sent to you with the 
subject line "CDR: Public Demo of Carnivore and Friends".  I found 
the information to be extremely helpful as I am currently 
researching the Carnivore system and the cover-up by the FBI/DOJ.  
I will be presenting my research to my honors board at the end of 
August at Westminster College.  I was wondering if you could help 
me by providing some contacts that will be able to give me more 
information on the program, etc.  I have been researching this for 
2 years and I have a ton of resources but I'm hoping to find some 
of the "good stuff" if you know what I mean.  Any help would be 
appreciated, all correspondence can be done anonymously, no names 
will be needed.  Thanks for your help, Cal
