Why would anyone waste time arguing for something which absolutely 
could not happen in today's world?

I'm serious. People spend time on things they think could be changed. 
This is why there is "not much call."

There is also "not much call" to bring back indentured servitude, even 
though the arguments for it are compelling. It won't happen, period, 
short of some Mad Max meltdown, so arguing for it is a waste of neurons 
and chronons.
