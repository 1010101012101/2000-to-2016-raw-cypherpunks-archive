Well, that about answers it then, doesn't it?

There is indeed an issue of it being possible that escalation will eventually
lead to it's own series of problems.  This has been true about almost every
advance in history.  And yet things continue to evolve.

What's stopping digital signatures now?  Purchasing impediments and UI
integration.  They're either too hard (or expensive) to purchase or impossible
use with jumping through flaming UI hoops.  And even when someone possess a
usable key the process of managing it it even more of a pain in the ass.

But the underlying concepts of reputation and trust have some validity and are
worth considering.  Just running about making silly Star Wars analogies, while
entertaining, does little to advance the discussion.
