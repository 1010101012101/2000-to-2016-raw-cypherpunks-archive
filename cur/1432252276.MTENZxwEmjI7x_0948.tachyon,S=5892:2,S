Cool. :)

Not true. You can verify my public actions, my public statements. What matters 
in the end is if the result is right. If my actions, my statements were 
conducive towards better privacy or bettering of our common human condition, 
one can assume with high degree of certainty that my reasons were right. If 
not, well, woe is me.

And information assymetry. That's why we have to build our own tools and use 
them to guard our own privacy.

Well, there is always the element of trust. I have to (I don't have the time, 
money, etc to verify myself) trust my hardware and software to some extent.

But I *can* choose hardware and software in a way that should make that trust 
better founded. Free software, open hardware. I use an "ancient" Nokia N900, 
which is by far not ideal, still much better than any iPhone.

I can make listeners' lives harder. And I do.

Abso-fucking-lutely! Still, I would like to know what is the threat model you 
were talking about. I don't see how advocating privacy and anonymity can be 
sinister -- apart from using these terms in context that these terms have no 
purpose other than muddying the waters (i.e. "privacy of government agencies 
or corporations").
