I don't agree.

One thing we do know is that, although Crypto is available and, in special 
contexts, used, it's use in other contexts is almost counterproduct, sending 
up a red flag so that those that "Protect Our Freedoms" will come sniffing 
around and bring to bear their full arsenal of technologies and, possibly, 
dirty tricks. Merely knowing that you are using stego/crypto in such 
contexts can cause a lot of attention come your way, possibly in actual 
meatspace, which in many cases is almost worse than not using crypto at all

In addition, although strong and "unbreakable" Crypto exists, one thing a 
stint on Cypherpunks teaches you is that it is only rarely implemented in 
such a way as to actually be unbreakable to a determined attacker, 
particularly if there are not many such cases to examine in such contexts.

The clear moral of this story is that, to increase the odds of truly secure 
communication, etc, Crypto in such contexts must become much more 
ubiquitous, and I still think Cypherpunks has a role to play there and 
indeed has played that role. Such a role is, of course, far more than a mere 
cheerleading role,a fact that merits a continued existence for Cypherpunks 
in some form or another.
