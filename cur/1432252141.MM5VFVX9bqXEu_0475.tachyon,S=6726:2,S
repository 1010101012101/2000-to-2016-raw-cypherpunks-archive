That may be so, but I would have thought that ORBS
could have usurped one of the many types of queries
which DNS permits to package it's reputation data.

I think you  misunderstand SMTP (If not, please
correct me. :-)

If you look at RFC 821, section 3.1, you'll find that the
RCPT TO: command takes only a single address; multiple
addressees are handled by sending multiple RCPT TO: lines,
and waiting for a 250 OK or a 550 Failure response after
each one. My suggestion is that, on a given connection, an
open relay server wait 10 seconds after before issuing a 250
OK response.  This is too short to time out a client, but
slows the process down greatly for messages with multiple
recipients.

Yes, you couldn't spam your entire company's internal
mail from an open server in this manner, but you
usually would do this by sending to a single address
which runs a mail exploder within the company. Nor
does it protect against spammers sending messages to
hundreds via mailing lists such as cypherpunks. However,
it would permit open relays to exist without them adding
significantly to the spam problem, which is the problem
I am trying to solve.

In my initial letter, I suggested delaying response only
after the second RCPT message, but on second thought, I
think delaying after the first one is ok. For single
messages, you would not be bothered by a 10 second delay.
and it prevents the spammer from opening hundreds to
connections at once to get around the restriction.

I'll admit that was an off-the-cuff remark, and I'd have to 
think hard to find other ways. OTOH, I'm sure there are many.

I'm not trying to identify spam per se; I'm trying to make the
relay unattractive to spammers, while minimally impacting 
everyone else. I'm working at the SMTP protocol level, not 
envelope, headers, or content.

I'm impacting behaviour, not content or header info.
