That's unfortunately a potentially serious problem given current practice.
Most remailer keys are unsigned, or at best self-signed, so the only
way to know if a key is the real one is to compare it with the first 
announcement of the remailer on the remailer-operators list -
which as far as I know isn't archived anywhere.  
*Sloppy* practice, and not hard to change if people wanted to.  
And some remailers occasionally change their keys,
either for periodic hygiene or because they lost a disk drive,
or at least there are announcements to the list claiming they have,
usually not even signed with the old key.

Of course, no Bad Guy would *ever* think of eavesdropping the
PGP.com or MIT keyservers to do traffic analysis on key requests.


				Thanks!
