The RIAA/MPAA could join our cluster, however the design properties of Tahoe
would prevent them from accessing our data.

Again, the design properties of Tahoe blur the concept of whose data is
actually on the cluster. From the outside looking in, the contents of data
you provide to the cluster is cryptographically opaque. Unless they can
prove you have the cryptographic keys to access a particular piece of
content, you can make the argument that you literally had no way of knowing
that the encrypted data you are storing was in fact pirated content.

In the type of system I'm envisioning, it would by design allow you to
easily discover which node IDs had chunks of a given file. However, that
file is encrypted. Provided you can obtain the encryption keys, you may be
able to prove that a particular file is, in fact, infringing on a copyright.
However in order to prove that participants in the network actually engaged
in an act of piracy as opposed to merely providing nodes which engage in the
free exchange of encrypted data, you would also have to prove that a
particular user also has the encryption keys needed to access a particular
piece of content. I think this would complicate prosecuting users for
copyright infringement, however IANAL.
