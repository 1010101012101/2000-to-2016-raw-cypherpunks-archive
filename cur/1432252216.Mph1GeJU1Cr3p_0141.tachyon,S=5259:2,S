Right. I suppose there's not much that can be done for people who
expect "security" to be handed down to them from the sky on a silver platter.
I'm sure it couldn't be more obvious to most here that if you don't put out
the effort to take responsibility for your own security, you aren't going to
have it--for your computer or anything else. 

But then, that sounds suspiciously resonant with "if they're too lazy or stupid
to get it, then screw em", doesn't it. I think the real flaw there--what keeps
me so uncomforable with it (even though my gut tells me it's a logical
conclusion)--is reflected in the sheer number of people I've seen change their
minds once they found out a little more about how insecure they really are.

Haven't you ever been in a discussion/argument/presentation about computer
security with someone, and at some point you notice that moment when it finally 
registers, you know that it really penetrated something...and they must have
that sickening queazy little feeling in the pit of their stomachs when they
say: 

"Oh my God, I had no idea". 

And at some point, haven't you all felt that sick, queasy shock of recognition
yourselves? Maybe from something you read on John Young's site, or in 
response to being hacked? I certainly did--after that everything was different.

It's a great feeling to have someone thank you for giving them the information
they needed to wake up and do something to help themselves. The downside is
you always risk coming across like a nutcase cyber-Cassandra, but you don't have
to if you just let the raw facts do the convincing for you.

More generally, I found it puzzling to see everyone getting hysterical over
911 when we're precisely no more and no less vulnerable than we ever were. I 
didn't learn a thing from it I hadn't already come to terms with on my
own. (Having been abandoned as a child and homeless on your own at 17 tends to 
do an excellent job of ridding a person of any excess sense of security. Not
that I'd recommend it...) So maybe for all the people who responded to the 
shock of 911 with "I'd give up all my civil liberties to feel safe again" there
were enough who were jolted into taking responsibility for their own security to
make a difference. 

Something to consider when thinking about the future of crypto, anyway.
