It's a freakin' C program that works on a file - but carrying a floppy around
is so ... ordinary.

Bits are overwritten by running PRNG output on them 128 times, PRNG being
seeded by the data that has just been erased. We use DES in counter mode as
PRNG.

Why would sender need to decrypt known plaintext is beyond me ... sender XORs
and destroys bits, recipient XORs and destroys bits. Each in their respective
dongles, once.
