And a major key to that is militarily useful weaponry in the hands of
the citizens.

It would be nice to think that most US soldiers would not participate in
the forceful subjugation of fellow Americans, but history (Kent State;
shooting a Texas goat herd while on border patrol) and psychology
(Stanford prison experiment) argue against that. And regardless, I'd
rather retain some measure of control over my destiny, rather than
solely trust in the good will of others.
