No.  Just one on using crypto in america to avoid the feds listening in -
currently this is legal, but adds an additional penalty if you are
convicted of something *and* the feds decide you used crypto as well.

obviously you don't - but I doubt you could conveniently find a
steganographic channel convincing enough to pass muster and yet fast
enough to handle VoIP traffic.  Besides, it could easily devolve into a
your-word-against-theirs argument, after you have already spent some time
in jail waiting to get to trial (or at least the threat of this).
Martha already found out how the FBI can bend the rules if they want to
make an example of you.
