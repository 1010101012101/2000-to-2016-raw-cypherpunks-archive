  Blaze at offshore military fort


  A man was airlifted to hospital after a fire broke out on an old sea fort
  off the coast of East Anglia.

  The blaze started on Friday at Sealand, an inhabited former military
  platform, which is about seven miles east of the Suffolk-Essex coastline.

  Thames Coastguard said the platform was surrounded in thick black smoke.

  A coastguard spokesman said it was believed a generator caught fire. The
  one person on board was airlifted to Ipswich Hospital.

  Harwich lifeboat were also called to the scene.

  'Territorial waters'

  Britain built the anti-aircraft platform during World War II.

  It remained derelict until the 1960s when a retired Army major, Paddy Roy
  Bates, took over the 10,000 sq ft platform and declared it the independent
  nation of Sealand.

  At the time, the platform was beyond the then three-mile limit of British
  territorial waters.

  All this changed in 1987, when the UK extended its territorial waters from
  three to 12 miles.

  The British Government does not recognise the sovereignty of Sealand.
