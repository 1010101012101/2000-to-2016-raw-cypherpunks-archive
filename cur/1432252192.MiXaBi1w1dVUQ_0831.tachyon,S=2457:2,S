"A way that works" would involve passphrase-locked keyrings, and forgetful
MUAs (this mutt only caches the passphrase for a preset time).

Filtering for signed/vs. unsigned mail doesn't make sense, authenticating
and whitelisting known senders by digital signature makes very good sense.

Of course, this doesn't help with people you don't yet know. Would work well
with prioritizing mail if taken together with other modes of filtering,
though.
