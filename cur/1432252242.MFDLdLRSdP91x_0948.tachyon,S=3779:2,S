So it seems we agree, that most folks will end up trusting a gizmo
and/or code they haven't personally inspected.  The engineers' goal then
becomes to design [a range of] architectures that are as trustworthy 
and foolproof [1] as they can be.  (The lawyers' goal should be to get a
fair and reasonable legal infrastructure to support them, where
appropriate, e.g.,
crypto sigs.  The marketeers' goal is to figure out how to pay
for the implementation and profit off its use.)

[1] You can be foolproof and not trustworthy, but you must be
foolproof to be trustworthy.
