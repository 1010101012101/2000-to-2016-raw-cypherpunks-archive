You're incorrect.  The problem isn't GPG, it's the Mutt mailer.
Riad's using 1.2.5i, which almost did the right thing,
and he went to the trouble of hacking the program to fix it.
So now his messages are plaintext GPG or PGP in the message body,
which is what they should be.
I'm not sure if hacking was necessary - it looks like 
RGB on the linux-ipsec mailing list is getting the same effect,
(though perhaps he also hacked the source.)
				Thanks!
