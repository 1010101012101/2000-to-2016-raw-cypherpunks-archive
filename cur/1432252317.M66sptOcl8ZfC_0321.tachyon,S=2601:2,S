[snip]

Just an FYI.  I was checking this out when I noticed via
WHOIS that

    www.thebell.net
    www.safevote.com
    www.ivta.org
    [and possibly even NMA.com?]

are all apparently self-promotional mouthpieces for this Gerck
fellow (formerly of the "Meta-Certificate Group", another
self-promotion vehicle) who has shown up on cypherpunks and other
crypto/security lists from time to time, usually with somewhat
crankish ideas.
