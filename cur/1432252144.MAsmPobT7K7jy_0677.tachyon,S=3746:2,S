Heh. For every Democrat (and perhaps some Republicans) who goes on TV
and proudly proclaims this perpetual election as a good thing because
it buttresses our civics knowledge, I want to ask: Why don't we
encourage the president, say, to commit a felony? The subsequent
prosecution and conviction would be fascinating to observe and would
*really* educate America's children.

Of course, I think the perpetual election (see perpetualelection.com)
is a good thing for entirely different reasons than those I give
above. See: http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,40200,00.html
