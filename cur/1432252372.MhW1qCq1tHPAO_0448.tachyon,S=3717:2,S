If the growing street protests/riots in Pakistan (Pesawar, Karachi, 
Islamabad) trend toward a new ultra-Islamic, pro-Taliban government, I 
expect India to strike first. India cannot allow a nuclear state on its 
border with Taliban leanings. India will knock out Pakistan's nuclear 
capabilities if it can.

A nuclear war between India and Pakistan will utterly dwarf recent 
events, will crash the Dow to 1000, and will have other profound 
consequences.

Interestingly, there's been a run on potassium iodide capsules, gas 
masks, and guns. It may be that nothing happens, of course, but it shows 
what happens when people wait until the stampede starts to shop for 
supplies.

(Yes, I still have my KI tablets, my other supplies. I never got a real 
gas mask, for fairly obvious reasons. The best defense is to avoid 
crowded areas. And at the slightest sign (on CNN, etc.) that people are 
showing up at hospitals in more-than-normal numbers, to stay indoors and 
not mingle with vectors. Good sources are Ken Alibek's "Biohazard," 
Laurie Garrett's "The Coming Plague," and Judith Miller's new "Germs.")
