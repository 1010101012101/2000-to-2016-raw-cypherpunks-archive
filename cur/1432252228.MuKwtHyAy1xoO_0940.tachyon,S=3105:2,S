Bill Could Boost Recruiting at Schools
Privacy: Federal measure would force high schools to give names,
addresses
and phone numbers to the military.

By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES EDUCATION
WRITER

U.S. high schools would be required to aid military
recruiters by turning over the names, addresses and
telephone numbers of their students under a federal bill
that has drawn fire from educators and privacy
advocates.

                      Nearly half of the schools in California and about
a third
                      nationwide restrict recruiters' access to that
information
                      or to their campuses, according to the Department
of
                      Defense. If the provision is approved by Congress
and
                      signed by President Bush, school districts that
fail to
                      comply could face substantial losses of federal
aid.
