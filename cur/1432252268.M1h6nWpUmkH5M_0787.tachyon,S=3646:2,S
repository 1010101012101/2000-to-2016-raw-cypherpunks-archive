Adobe's pulling back on Dmitry doesn't change the fact that the company
lied in saying what was being distributed was "copyrighted Adobe
software."

Despite the EFF's effusive praise of Adobe, I don't plan to use any Adobe
software in the future.

In other DMCA news, does Fox really think they can stop "Planet of the
Apes" from being posted to Usenet?  This should be an amusing test of
Usenet routing around "damage," as Fox Intellectual Property attempts to
spam every newsadmin in the world with takedown notices faster than the
machines can talk to each other.

Bailing with a teaspoon if you ask me.
