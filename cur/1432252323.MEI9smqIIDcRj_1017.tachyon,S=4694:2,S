What has happened is that we in California have moved from a state imposed 
and controlled monopoly, to a highly regulated market.  This has not worked 
well, one of the many reasons being that those who now have to decide to 
build power plants are now the evil greedy developers, rather than the wise 
and benevolent bureaucrats, and in consequence those who want to build 
power plants are having great difficulty.  Naturally, however, all the 
newspapers are entirely confident that the problem is capitalist greed.  If 
it was not for those greedy people itching to destroy the environment by 
building power plants, we would have plenty of power.

This is analogous to the US health care crisis.  If an evil greedy 
capitalist health care institution decides not to give an elderly pauper 
triple bypass surgery, in order to retain ever greater bloated profits, 
that is an intolerable evil of capitalism.  If, however, a rational 
bureaucrat decides to wisely ration bypass surgery by ensuring that it only 
goes to those who can truly benefit from it, that is a wonderful saving on 
health costs.   As a result, governmental health care systems really are 
much better at controlling costs that regulated semi private health care 
systems.
