When Robb London hurled the careerist word "terrorism" the left 
bank of Jim-gawkers hissedly overwrit their cryptoed HDs, the 
right bank of techno-Quanticoeds caressed their de-degaussers.

Jeff Gordon said he cypherpunkishly PGPs, and employs avant-garde

ratfinkerfucker, a fool tsked. Jeff thumbed a hole in n out.
