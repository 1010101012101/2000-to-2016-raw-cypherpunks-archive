TRENTON, N.J.  These days, a truant officer's job goes beyond
                  keeping kids in school. Some spend more time keeping
                  out-of-towners out, sometimes by spotting bogus leases
or trailing
                  students home.

A few school districts are even
going a step further, offering
members of the public
bounties of $100 or more for
information on students who
sneak across district lines.
