I have a possible trip coming up soon.  I intend to have my tickets 
purchased by a third party and fly under an assumed name (maybe Tyler 
Durden ;-)  I will carry no ID on my person. Perhaps there is now a need to 
have large numbers of refusnik travelers assume the same "nom de avion" 
identity.  Sort of like the Killroy in WW II.
