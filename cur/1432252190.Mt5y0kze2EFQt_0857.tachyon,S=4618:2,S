see this link for papers on steganalysis:
http://ise.gmu.edu/~njohnson/Steganography/

essentially, the papers assert that given our knowledge of how images and
music files are encoded, and given information about how some of the popular
steg. programs work, it's possible to detect the presence of hidden
information and perhaps extract that information.  this is very early stage
work, so it doesn't provide all of the answers...
