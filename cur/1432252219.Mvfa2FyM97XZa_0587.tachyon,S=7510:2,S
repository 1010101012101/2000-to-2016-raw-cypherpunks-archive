                    WPI CRYPTOGRAPHY SEMINAR

     Efficient Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems
        on the TI MSP430x33x Family of Microcontrollers

                        Jorge Guajardo
                             WPI


Place:       AK218

Date & Time: Wednesday, Feb 7, 1:30pm
             (refreshments at 1:15pm)


This contribution describes a methodology used to efficiently
implement elliptic curves (EC) over $GF(p)$ on the 16-bit TI
MSP430x33x family of low-cost microcontrollers. We show that it is
possible to implement EC cryptosystems in highly constrained embedded
systems and still obtain acceptable performance at low cost.  We
modified the EC point addition and doubling formulae to reduce the
number of intermediate variables while at the same time allowing for
flexibility.  We used a generalized-Mersenne prime to implement the
arithmetic in the underlying field. We take advantage of the special
form of the moduli to minimize the number of precomputations needed
to implement inversion via Fermat's little theorem and the $k$-ary
method of exponentiation.  We apply these ideas to an implementation
of an elliptic curve system over $GF(p)$, where $p=2^{128} - 2^{97}-1$.
We show that a scalar point multiplication can be achieved in 3.4
seconds without any stored/precomputed values and the processor
clocked at 1 MHz.

This work will also be presented next week at PKC 2001 in Korea.
