Further:

     Frist, R-Tenn., said the man must have been exposed to an intense
     form of the bacterium, strong enough to move through his
     respiratory track and deep into his lungs.

This leads one to question the descriptions of anthrax as "weaponized"
and "non-weaponized", particularly as there are several dimensions of
weaponization.  The lesser is spore size, with 5 micron being the
preferred form for inducing inhalation anthrax.  The greater is
antibiotic resistance, and it appears that this is the criterion on
which statements of "non-weaponized anthrax" are being made.  Truth
seems to be that resistance is secondary to spore size given the
difficulty of treating advanced cases of inhalation anthrax.

My suggestion to the press would be to disaggregate the term
"weaponized" to its components:  inhalable, and antibiotic resistant.
This provides the public with more useful information:  the bacterium is
or is not a grave infection threat (inhalable), and the bacterium is or
is not treatable (resistant).  This is actionable information:
inhalable, but nonresistant, anthrax means that individuals should be
aware of respiratory illness symptoms and submit for early diagnosis
and/or treatment. 

The media hype also tends to ignore the fact that anthrax is, in the
forms detected to date, largely treatable.  Gross attempts at
containment (expensive) are less advisable than identification and
treatment of exposed individuals (less expensive).

Peace.
