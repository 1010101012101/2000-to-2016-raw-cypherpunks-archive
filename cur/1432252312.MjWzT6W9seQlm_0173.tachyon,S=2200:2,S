On Twitter @th3j35t3r, an alleged undercover informant, is claiming
this list is an Al Qaeda affiliate based on Google hits of my posts to
<bold>cypherpunks@al-qaeda.net </bold>.

He and followers will paroxysm when Andy Greenberg's book is released
on September 13, 2012:

Be thankful the due date is not 9/11.

The SEAL political PR stunt book release was moved from 9/13 to 9/7,
continuation of the OBL/Al Qaeda political PR stunt begun in the 1970s,
but latest installment now leaking copiously boosted by DoD threat of a
law suit, and DoJ cessation of any CIA prosecution for the decades-long
thriller, the agency's best ever, 100s complicit, 1000s dead,
millions fooled, billions squandered.

CIA sings joyously "tomorrow will always be 9/12."
