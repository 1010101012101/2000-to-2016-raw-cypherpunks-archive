How could you _possibly_ look in my killfile?

I often discard older killfiles when I change my system, when I change 
my mailer, etc. My recollection is that you were in my Eudora Pro 
killfile, but that was a year or so ago.

True, mostly I delete your stuff after only reading the first 
paragraph. The phony "ums" and "ers" and the silliness about "listen, 
boys and girls," all of this stuff should be edited out.

And the content is, um, redundant. And, er, uninteresting. And that, 
boys and girls, is enough to make me blow milk out my nose. To use 
another, um,  Hettingaism.

And the silly use of smileys.

Have as many lists as you like, er, though it, um, seems to be silly to 
concentrate so much on spamming material to so many seemingly, um, 
related lists. Ebuscks, Philodex, E$, DCSB...this seems to be your main 
industry, creating new little mailing lists.

Too many smileys, too many "heh"s and "um"s and "er"s. Bad enough in 
spoken speech, and utterly pointless in writings.

More examples included below. You really ought to consider a major 
change in your writing style. The smileys and ums and hehs and ers and 
phony folksiness distracts from what may be your real message.

Unless being a certain kind of prose stylist is your goal...in which 
case I would even _more_ strongly urge you to tighten up your prose.
