It should be obvious, should it not, that AP isn't deployable at the
present time? I would be quite surprised if AP was brought into the case
with any greater role than "proof" that Jim was engaged in that most
dangerous activty known as thought, focused on the concepts of
revolutionary action.

"Look, this guy is so dangerous, he even developed an untraceable method
for commissioning contract killings!"

The prosecution won't want to make AP a major part of their case. It will
distract from the cyber-stalking issue, which is what they'll get him on.

Besides, free publicity for AP isn't going to make Jeff Gordon sleep any
better at night.
