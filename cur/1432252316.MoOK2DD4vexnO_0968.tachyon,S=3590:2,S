AWACS-type planes have long had the ability to act as "cell towers," so 
cell traffic is easily picked-up, if in fact they are doing this. 
Landline signals are vastly harder to pick up, and I doubt strongly 
that every minorly-radiating landline signal is being picked up.

Perhaps for very, very targetted signals, but not cruising over general 
cities, it seems likely to me.

I'm not sure of the context here, but in the past year there were some 
reports of planes circling over university campuses, and many were 
hypothesizing that SIGINT was being done on telephone and computer 
messages. This seemed unlikely to me.

I concluded--and posted on Usenet about my thinking--that some campuses 
may have been targeted for low-level gamma ray surveys. Kind of a gamma 
ray version of Shipley's "war driving" maps. Possibly for construction 
of baseline maps of existing radioisotopes in university labs, 
hospitals, and private facilities. Then deviations from baseline maps 
could be identified and inspected in more detail with ground-based vans 
and black bag ops.
