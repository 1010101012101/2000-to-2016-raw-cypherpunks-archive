Or rigging the lottery drawing, but surely *that's* never been done :-)
You can also simulate time travel through delayed transmission;
         cf: The Sting
for examples of that.  Probably wasn't done here, but it could have been,
and putting out a broadcast story of "Earlier today, The Amazing Bogomeister
successfully predicted the Powerball Lottery", showing Himself with
the clock in the background *clearly* indicating the time as
an hour before the real lottery drawing took place would reinforce it.
