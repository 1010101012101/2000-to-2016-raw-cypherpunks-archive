Traffic analysis is likely feasible if you can watch all of the
internet. The question is at what resolution? With full packet captures
of everything, for all time, it becomes a statistical question with some
possibly negative outcomes.

Actually, we see from the documents that they cannot deanonymize all
people, all of the time; they must target. So actually, it *does*
protect people from instantly falling into the pitfalls related to
dragnet surveillance. You're avoiding this and it is totally silly.

The Tor Project is a 501c3 non-profit. As a company, we're not tools of
anyone and as a tool, tor, is similarly not a tool of the US government.
Your statements indicating otherwise are just rude and uninformed.

How does that old quote go? "That which is presented without evidence
may be dismissed without argument." Yeah, exactly.

The NSA and the GCHQ ran a real operation to deanonymize someone. Do you
understand how they attempted to do this? Do you understand the evidence
presented or will you continue to ignore it?

Yes, you did - read the above documents already? The CES summer school
document discusses some of this and it is sadly very poor research. The
open community, such as Aaron's recent paper, is much much further
ahead. This is what we expect - this is why we work with an open
research community so seriously.

I'm giving you some credit - break it, already?

Can you please explain to everyone how they found the location of the
Silk Road? Hint: it wasn't Tor, it was his extremely bad operational
security and using... a VPN!

You criticize the only people working to inform the public and you
degrade their honor without having real information about their
specifics. Do you live under threat for your work? Do you live in exile
from your home country? Do you do anything that matters where someone
else has some criticisms because they don't have a full view on your
entire life or because they misunderstand something about what is
presented in public?

You could actually demonstrate that you see that Glenn, Laura and others
have taken real risks by doing anything at all to inform us. The way
that you behave, it is a wonder that they take such risks with people
who are so cynical and ungrateful as their peanut gallery. Lucky for the
rest of humanity that for every dozen people spending their energy being
so unkind, as you are, we have thousands who appreciate their efforts.

All the best,
Jacob
