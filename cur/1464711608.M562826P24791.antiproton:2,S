THIS is the kind of shit that the American people need to start pushing
back against. This is outright abuse. It's the government simply saying
"We own your ass and there is nothing you can do about it". But will
they? Of course not! They are too busy watching our mindless television
and focusing on what Kimye is doing this week.

What will it take for us to finally wake up and fight back? A total
suspension of the Constitution and a revocation of our rights? Disgusting.
