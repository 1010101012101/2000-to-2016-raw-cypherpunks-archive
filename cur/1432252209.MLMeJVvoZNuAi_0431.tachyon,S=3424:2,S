.

Good morning...

I gues (not)everybody has read this:

"Interception capabilities 2000"

http://www.europarl.eu.int/stoa/publi/pdf/98-14-01-2_en.pdf

(http://tinyurl.com/4lxds)

This is an official report carried out for the
European Commision in 2000.

It deals with the "Echolon" network and the "alleged" use of it by
the US and friends for militairy and industrial espionage...

Yes i know it's old stuff but not outdated and makes very good
reading...

So i tried to upload it to the files section...but it was refused
since it is to big.

I consider this standard reading and it should be in the files
section since it is not that easy to find if you don't know where to
look for it (yes i know now).

Maybe someone can cut it into 2 pieces (Pdf) and upload it ?

Tnx
