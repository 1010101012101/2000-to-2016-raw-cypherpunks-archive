"Communications Security in the Digital Age Featured Only at
TelecomNEXT; AT&T's National Disaster Recovery Team on Display on
TelecomNEXT Exhibit Floor"

http://www.voip-magazine.com/content/view/2152/20060302005890/

 Thursday, 02 March 2006

Powered By BusinessWire WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 2, 2006--A
top priority for telecom service providers competing in today's
borderless economy, key security issues will play a central role on
the exhibit floor and in must-attend conference sessions at
TelecomNEXT in Las Vegas, March 19 - 23, 2006. TelecomNEXT, the only
place where the business and technology of communications and
entertainment meet, replaces SUPERCOMM(R) as USTelecom's annual
industry show.

"Network security and the ability to operate in the face of disaster
are some of the top concerns for integrated communications providers,"
said John Abel, USTelecom's Senior Vice President, Marketing,
Membership and Business Development. "In today's converged telecom
market, security solutions are more critical than ever before and
TelecomNEXT is the only place to see the latest advances in network
security."

The TelecomNEXT exhibit floor was recently expanded and an additional
hall was added to accommodate a premier enterprise security exhibit
-AT&T's Network Disaster Recovery (NDR) team. The NDR team is part of
AT&T's comprehensive business continuity plan to ensure that voice and
data communications can be restored quickly for business and
government customers if a disaster damages or destroys parts of the
network. The fully mobile NDR team allows AT&T to monitor, manage and
proactively protect the networks of its enterprise customers.
