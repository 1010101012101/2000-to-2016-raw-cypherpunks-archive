What clearsite? One aspect of the design is that lighttpd runs in a VM
that can't see the Internet except through a Tor-gateway VM.

Running a clearsite just doesn't work for me. It would paint too big a
target on the server. Anyone not using Tor can just use
<http://dbshmc5frbchaum2.onion.link/>.

Don't have a clearsite :)

Upstream = Tor. And sure, maybe Tor gets hosed.
