critics say the report simply highlights the inability of the
country's privacy laws to cope with 21st-century anti-terrorism
efforts.

News of the Army project came to light in September 2003 when JetBlue
admitted it had violated its privacy policy by turning over 5.1
million passenger records to Torch Concepts , an Alabama-based
defense contractor.

Torch subsequently enhanced the JetBlue data with information about
passengers' salaries, family size and Social Security numbers that it
purchased from Acxiom , one of the country's largest data aggregators.

plan to screen visitors to Army bases.
