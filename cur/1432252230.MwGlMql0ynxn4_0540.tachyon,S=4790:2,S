I am well aware of this argument, and I use it often. My question here =
is=20
different: with all the info we have about Snowden, QUANTUM, etc, and w=
ith the=20
number of Tor users today, AND with some Tor design choices (like: not =
padding=20
the packets so that each packet, regardless of between which nodes it i=
s sent=20
and how many encryption layers have already beed removed -- has the sam=
e=20
length, which would make it that much harder to do traffic analysis), i=
s it=20
PRACTICALLY REALLY better to use Tor, OR does it get people flagged and=
=20
exploited in other ways?

For Joe Schmoe, is it better to use Tor, or to hide in the noise?

I guess one part of the question is the fact that NSA probably doesn't =
really=20
have to break encryption, they just need info on who is communicating w=
ith=20
whom, exploit one of these endpoints and get all the unencrypted logs, =
data,=20
etc they want.
