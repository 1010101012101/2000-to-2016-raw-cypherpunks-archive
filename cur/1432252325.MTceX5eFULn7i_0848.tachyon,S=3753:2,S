For anyone in the SF Bay Area who is even mildly interested in the privacy
discussion, I highly recommend that you attend a public affairs-style
discussion on Internet privacy to be held at The Commonwealth Club on
Thursday, October 26, from 5:15 -- 7:15pm.

The discussion will be moderated by John Markoff of The New York Times.
Panelists include: Bob Lewin, President and CEO of TRUSTe; Marc Rotenberg,
Exec. Dir. of EPIC; FTC Commissioner Mozelle Thompson; and Chris Kelly,
Chief Privacy Officer for Excite@Home.

Together, the panel represents the five points that are driving the privacy
discussion: the media, self-regulation, government, industry, and advocacy.
Let's see if they can agree on anything.

Go to The Commonwealth Club site (www.commonwealthclub.org) for ticket
information... See you there.
