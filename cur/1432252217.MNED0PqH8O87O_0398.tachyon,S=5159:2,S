Hello, all. After a temporary hiatus, the nowar list is back, with many
events to announce. Please note the two new listings -- a teach-in on the
connection between U.S. interventionism and democracy and one on the Texas
Military-Industrial Complex.

On Tuesday, April 29, from 7:00-9:00 pm, John Brady Kiesling will speak on
American Moral Capital and the Misprojection of U.S. Power
Kiesling, formerly Foreign Service Officer at the US embassy in Athens,
resigned from the State Department in February 2003 to protest the conduct
of the Administration's foreign policy and the looming war in Iraq. His
letter of resignation to Secretary of State, Colin Powell, was reproduced
by the New York Times and rapidly circulated around the globe as a cry for
preserving America's endangered international legitimacy. He has just
returned to the U.S. from Athens, and will discuss the reasons for his
protest and offer insights into the future of American foreign policy. Mr.
Kiesling was a diplomat for 20 years, serving in Greece, Armenia, Morocco
and Israel. He holds a Masters degree in Ancient History and Mediterranean
Archeology from UC Berkeley.
Location: UT Campus, Painter Hall 3.02 (on 24th St. between Guadalupe &
Speedway)

On Tuesday, April 29 at 7:00 pm, Madison Hobley, freed from Illinois' Death
Row, will speak as part of a national tour calling for an end to the death
penalty. Also speaking will be Madison's sister Robin Hobley; Marlene
Martin, national director of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, and UT
Law Professor Rob Owen.
Location: Utopia Theater (in the School of Social Work at the University of
Texas), San Jacinto between MLK and 21st St.
For info: email lilymae30@hotmail.com or call 494-0667.

On Wednesday, April 30, at 7:00 pm, there will be a teach-in on "Enhancing
Democracy? Why the U.S. Military Won't Bring Democracy to the World."
Speakers include UT History Professor Geoffrey Schad, speaking on Syria;
Communications Professor Dana Cloud; and Rahul Mahajan of the Nowar
Collective, author of the forthcoming "Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power
in Iraq and Beyond"
(http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100353810).
Location: UT Campus, Gearing 105 (Gearing is just west of Welch Hall).

On Saturday, May 3, the Showdown in Texas commences (other related events
will already be in progress -- see
http://www.showdowntx.com/html/schedule.html). The Showdown rally is a
demand for human security, not "homeland" security: funding for healthcare,
housing, education and jobs; environmental sustainability; protection of
civil liberties for citizens, immigrants and indigenous peoples, a
moratorium on the death penalty, and an end to US military interventions
and war at home and abroad.
Starting at 11:00 am at least 6 issue marches starting in different
locations (see http://www.showdowntx.com/html/schedule.html for details)
will converge at the Capitol at High Noon for an opening rally. This rally
will be followed by a mass march past some of the top defense industry
contractors located in downtown Austin and end up back at the Capitol for a
Festival of Love and Resistance.
Except where otherwise noted, events are free and open to the public.
Please forward where appropriate.

On Sunday, May 4, from 6:00-8:00pm, there will be a teach-in on "The Texas
Military-Industrial Complex: Profiting from War and Occupation." This event
is associated with the Showdown. Speakers will talk about Lockheed Martin,
Dyncorp, the role of oil in the Military-Industrial Complex, and the
connection of Texas to the occupations of Palestine and Iraq.
Location: UT Campus, Jester Auditorium, 21st and Speedway, across Speedway
from the Perry-Castaneda Library.

All events are free and open to the public. Please forward where appropriate.

In Solidarity,
the Nowar Collective
