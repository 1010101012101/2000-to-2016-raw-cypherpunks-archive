Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large group of pheno|ic secondary 
metabo|ites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,000 different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wal|s of the blood vessels including capillaries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with
