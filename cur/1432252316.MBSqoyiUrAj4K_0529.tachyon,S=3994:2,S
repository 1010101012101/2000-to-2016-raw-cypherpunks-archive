Tarring everyone here with such a broad brush hardly seems appropriate.
Just a quick reminder: you're as much "here" as anyone else is, even if you
have fooled yourself into feeling a false sense of distance behind that
remailer of yours. So unless you see yourself as "unsavory and immoral",
you might understand how some people here could be interested in an apology. 
Or at the very least an explicit clarification.

More to the point, I think the parole officers were probably as interested
in depriving CJ of a stage as anything else. Maybe he isn't as florid or
likely to act out if he doesn't have an audience to egg him on. Where else
is he going to connect with people who think there's anything more to his 
case than just that of another pathetic garden-variety washed-up lunatic?
If he ever finds such a place, they'll probably ban it too.  
 
It could be purely punitive, but I think the encouragement factor is worth 
considering.
