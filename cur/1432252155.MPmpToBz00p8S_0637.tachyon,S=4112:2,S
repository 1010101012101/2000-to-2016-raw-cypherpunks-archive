TSA missed 90% of bombs at Denver airport

Undercover agents were able to slip bombs and IEDs past the Transport  
Security Agency checkpoint at Denver airport 90 percent of the time.  
Last time I was in Denver, the eagle-eyed agent was able to spot and  
confiscate my toothpaste, and of course, my suitcase arrived damaged,  
contents filthy, having been pawed at by a TSA goon and then  
improperly closed. These eagle-eyed guardians of freedom are so  
obsessed with making sure that we're all sharing our foot-funguses  
with each other on while our shoes go through the X-ray machine that  
they can't actually find actual bombs.

It's great that the TSA devotes all its energies to stopping the kind  
of ridiculous terrorist attacks that don't work, like shoe bombs and  
moisture bombs. Makes me feel much safer. I sleep better knowing that  
four-year-olds whose names sound vaguely like some terrorist's  
possible alias are kept off our planes.

	In one test, sources told 9NEWS an agent taped an IED to her leg
	and told the screener it was a bandage from surgery.
	Even though alarms sounded on the walk-through metal detector,
	the agent was able to bluff her way past the screener...
	Dzakovic was a Red Team leader from 1995 until September 11, 2001.
	After the terrorist attacks, Dzakovic became a federally protected
	whistleblower and alleged that thousands of people died needlessly.
	
	He testified before the 9/11 Commission and the National Commission 
	on
	Terrorist Attacks Upon the US that the Red Team "breached security 
	with
	ridiculous ease up to 90 percent of the time," and said the FAA
	"knew how vulnerable aviation security was."

	Dzakovic, who is currently a TSA inspector, said security is no  
better today.
	"It's worse now. The terrorists can pretty much do what they
	want when they want to do it," he said.
