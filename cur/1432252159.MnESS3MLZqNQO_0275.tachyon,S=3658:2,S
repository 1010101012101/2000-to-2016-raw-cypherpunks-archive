Well, yes, but so are plenty of urban legends, myths, and rumors.

The only two sightings in any newspaper, magazine, newsletter, radio
station, cable channel, or broadcast outlet archived by Lexis-Nexis
(and there are thousands) were two smallish newspapers. Hardly worth a
serious attempt at debunking. They may even have gone unnoticed by the
Weisenthal Center and their allies.

Not that I'm a huge fan of what the Weisenthal Center has done
in terms of Internet regulation, but I'm also insufficiently 
credulous to accept all extraordinary statements as fact.
