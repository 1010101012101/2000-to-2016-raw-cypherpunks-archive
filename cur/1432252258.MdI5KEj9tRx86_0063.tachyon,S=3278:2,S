Seriously, Tim, are you just going to continue
to fart around here and in Usenet for another
10 years, or are you going to do something to
propagate your views?

I'd suggest a video game.

There would be white trash (liked you), Jews, Blacks...
Some specific personalities: Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton...
For good measure, you should include yourself.

The dialog should be variable, choices of politically
correct, anti-semitic, anti-black ("Welfare mutants" -TimMay).
Anti-Democratic, anti-Republican. Plugins for other countries.

Choice of paintball or bloody death mode.

You get the idea.

Don't you want to profit from a game that allows you
to shoot down Jesse Jackson & Al Sharpton AND cause
a free speech furor (heil!).

Your current attempts ("<they> need killing") are pathetic.
