Seems like if you have code that is both complex and has good performance
characteristics, then this leaves signals in the code that come from the
collective experience of the neural network(s) that created said code.

Obfuscation works by adding noise, and performance overhead.

Now the real question on my mind is how much of what I see in bitcoin's
main.cpp is obfuscation by Satoshi, or is someone going to run this 
analysis on code running at banks and figure out who he really is?
