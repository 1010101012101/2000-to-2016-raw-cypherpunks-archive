Subject: [alg] gpg with gnome clients

Does anyone know of a good gnome email client ( ala balsa ) which has
strong support for gpg ( as does mutt)? I have some people from the
spoonfed MS world who have discovered the need/use for email crypto, and
they are having a horrible time getting pgp to work completely correctly
with anything: eudora/OE, etc. So, I felt that this might be the perfect
opportunity to wean them from the Redmond teat by showing them how that
job, plus all others they usually perform can be handily done in Linux.
Since they are from the Windows world I thought that I would soften the
transition by using gnome. I can't stand KDE; so, don't suggest kmail.
