#    Judge halts certification of Palm Beach ballots
#    
#    The Associated Press
#    
#    West Palm Beach -- Presidential ballots in Palm Beach County 
#    can't be certified by the state pending a Tuesday court hearing, 
#    a circuit judge ruled Thursday.
#    
#    The preliminary injunction means the county, embroiled in a 
#    controversy over punchcard ballots that allegedly confused voters, 
#    could further delay for days the outcome of the presidential 
#    race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
#    
#    The order, issued Thursday night by Circuit Judge Kathleen Kroll, 
#    is the result of one of six lawsuits filed in Palm Beach County 
#    by voters who say they may have mistakenly voted for Reform Party 
#    candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Vice President Gore because 
#    of the way the ballot was designed. Two other lawsuits filed 
#    in Tallahassee allege race discrimination in Tuesday's balloting.
#    
#    The Palm Beach County voters want a new election in the county.
#    
#    In the order, Kroll wrote that based on a lawsuit filed by two 
#    Boca Raton women it appears they would suffer ``irreparable 
#    injury'' if the votes are certified before the case can be heard.
#    
#    ``To preserve the electoral process in this presidential election 
#    and the important voters' rights at stake, there is an immediate 
#    need for a resolution in this case,'' Kroll wrote.
