National Public Radio (NPR) Morning Edition  (11:00 AM AM ET)Thursday, Oct. 18, 2001Beefing up security at America's dams and reservoirsBOB EDWARDS, host: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm BobEdwards.Security is tight at many of the nation's 70,000 reservoirs and dams.There's concern about water contamination from chemical or biologicalagents, and about possible attempts to breach the dams. NPR's HowardBerkes reports. HOWARD BERKES reporting:All across the country now, guards are on patrol and checkpoints arein place in an attempt to keep terrorists away from dams. Hoover Dam,near Las Vegas, has a major regional highway straddling its crest, butroadblocks as far as 20 miles away hold trucks, buses and big RVsback. And floating patrols behind and below the dam keep boats away.Bob Walsh is spokesman for the US Bureau of Reclamation, which managesHoover Dam.Mr. BOB WALSH (US Bureau of Reclamation): You don't want largevehicles carrying explosives,!
 for example, to be allowed across thedam. Gasoline tankers, for example, are prohibited from crossing thedam at this point as well; any type of a hazardous material.BERKES: The September 11th attacks prompted similar security at someof the bureau's 500 other dams in 17 Western states. John Keyes is thecommissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation.Commissioner JOHN KEYES (US Bureau of Reclamation): There is nospecific threat against any of our specific facilities, let me put itthat way. But potential for terrorist activity is being provided for.We are at a high level of security at all of our critical facilities,both to protect against damage to the facilities themselves and to thewater supplies.BERKES: The risk at these facilities is enormous. And it's not justfrom flooding downstream if a dam is breached or fails. Sixty-onemillion people depend on the structures for water, including farmersproducing 60 percent of the nation's vegetables. Bureau dams generate!
enough power for six million homes. They're a tempting target forterrorists, says Tim Brown, a senior analyst at globalsecurity.org.Mr. TIM BROWN (Senior Analyst, Globalsecurity.org): The entire economyin the Southwest is dependent upon the electricity and the irrigationthat the dams afford. And the loss of any or all of the dams along theColorado River Basin would cripple the economy of the Southwest foryears to come, and could have potentially significant effects on theUS economy in the long run.BERKES: That's also true for other regions and hundreds of communitiesin all parts of the country with critical links to the nation's 70,000dams. Most were built long before terrorism was considered a strongdomestic threat, notes Bill Bingham, a dam designer and engineer.Bingham is also president of the US Society on Dams, a national groupfocusing on engineering and safety.Mr. BILL BINGHAM (US Society of Dams): Our dams in the past have notbeen designed for severe!
 blast incidents like we would see with atruckload of explosives across the top a dam, or an aircraft loadedwith fuel crashing into the downstream face of the dam. I don't thinkthat design criteria encompasses those kinds of issues.BERKES: So it's unclear, Bingham says, whether dams can be breached bysuch attacks. He's calling for a national risk assessment to determinedam vulnerabilities and ways to protect them.Mr. BINGHAM: Making sure that you've got the properties as secure asyou can make them; limiting access, and doing regular patrols andthose types of things. And having a current emergency action plan inthe event that there would be some kind of an attack on one of thesefacilities.BERKES: John Keyes of the US Bureau of Reclamations says he's alreadyaccessing the risk at bureau dams, while also bolstering security.Mr. KEYES: Terrorism is nothing new to the security for ourfacilities. We've deal with Earth Liberation Front and theecoterrorism folks f!
or several years. We have prepared forcontingencies involving contamination of reservoir water. We haveemergency preparedness plans for all of our facilities that deal withinundation downstream. We have a comprehensive dam safety program, aswell as a general security program for protection of those vitalinfrastructures.Keyes acknowledges one problem. The bureau has only one armed securityforce at Hoover Dam. The rest of its dams depend on unarmed guards andvoluntary help from state and local police who have limited authorityon federal property. Congress is considering legislation to addressthat. Bill Bingham of the US Society of Dams, worries more aboutstate, local and private structures.Mr. BINGHAM: There are many privately owned or even publiclyowned--non-federal publicly owned dams that do not have emergencyaction plans, or security plans.BERKES: Bingham says some dam owners don't have the money or staff formore security, and he says states have inconsi!
stent requirements foremergency action plans. Still, state, local and private dam managerssay they're bolstering their security with state and local police.Howard Berkes, NPR News.
