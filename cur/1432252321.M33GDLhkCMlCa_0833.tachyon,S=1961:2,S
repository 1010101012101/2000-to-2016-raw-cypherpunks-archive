Which would be a waste of olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Whale tastes 
awful *any* way it's prepared.[1]

Ni!  Garlic, olive oil and lime juice.  Seal in foil and 20 minutes on the 
outdoor grill.  Chicken fried dolphin is an abomination.

[1] Having grown up in rural western Alaska, I've tried a lot of unusual 
food.  Bad as whale tastes, I'd take it over walrus nose anytime.
