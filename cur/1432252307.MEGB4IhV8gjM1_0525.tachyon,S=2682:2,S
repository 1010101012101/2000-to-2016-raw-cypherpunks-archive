One thing that would be really helpful is if somebody sent information
about the CDR to the list once a week.  An explanation of what it is,
how it works, how to unsubscribe, how to subscribe, and a list of
nodes participating would be a blessing.

For each node it would be nice to know:
Operator (optional ;-)
Subscription Address
Help Address
Posting Address
Message Modification Policy
Filtering Policy
Privacy Policy (*)

(*) Is the list of subscribers publicly available?  (And, if so, why?)
