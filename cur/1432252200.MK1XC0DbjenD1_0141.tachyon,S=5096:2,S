FBI makes arrest in movie 'screener' case
Chicago man to be charged with copyright infringementThe Associated
Press
Updated: 9:02 a.m. ET Jan. 23, 2004LOS ANGELES - A man who allegedly
used the Internet to distribute Oscar screener movies sent to him by a
member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been
arrested in Illinois, authorities said.

Agents said the films have been traced back to a longtime Academy
member, 69-year-old actor Carmine Caridi, who was described as a friend
of Spragues.

In addition to the movies, agents said they found an array of
duplicating and illegal satellite television interception equipment in
Spragues home about 20 miles south of downtown Chicago.

Caridi told investigators he sent VHS copies of about 60 movies he
received each year to Sprague. He allegedly told investigators he
received no money for the films, and believed Sprague was merely a film
buff who wished to watch them.
