Perhaps this will clue users into the fact that they need to be vigilant
about monitoring the trusted roots in their browsers.

Perhaps this will clue the browser vendors into the fact that there needs
to be a revocation distribution method for compromised certificates.

Perhaps this will clue the CAs and other trusted root holders into the
fact that they need to protect their roots.

Or perhaps I ask too much from an industry accustomed to doing so little.
