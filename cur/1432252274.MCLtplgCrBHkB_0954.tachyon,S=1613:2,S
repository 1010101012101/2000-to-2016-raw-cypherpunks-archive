Spammers recently adopted tactics of using randomly generated words, eg.
"wryqf", in both the subject and the body of the message. These
"pseudowords" are random, which makes them different from real words that
are made of syllables.

Could the pseudowords be easily detected by their characteristics, eg.
presence of syllables, wovel-consonant sequences/ratio, something like
that? This could shift the balance of force in spam detection again, until
the adversary will be forced to adopt the tactics of generating the random
words from syllables instead of characters. Presence of pseudowords then
could be added as one of spam characteristics.
