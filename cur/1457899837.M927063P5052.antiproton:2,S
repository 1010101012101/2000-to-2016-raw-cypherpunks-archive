	It, of course, dewpends on the court. It would be ridiculous
	to try this case in a state court, especially in a court of
	'justice' owned by, say, general electric and the american
	state. 

	Strictly speaking the guilty parties are the american and
	japanese government and the 'private' mafias that do
	'engineering' for them.

	And that changes the fact that the general electric's design
	failed?

	And what has that got to do with the fact that the containment
	that is supposed to contain material in  case of a meltdown,
	does not contain anything?
