On November 17, 2O04, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 20O,00O 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov

physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such

was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
