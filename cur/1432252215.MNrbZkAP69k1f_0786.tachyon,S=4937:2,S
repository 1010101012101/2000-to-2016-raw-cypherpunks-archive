I dunno...sometimes his racism and child-killing and "fuck them deads" seem 
to be fairly logical consequences of his basic philosophies. In fact, Tim 
May can only be truly free after every other human being in the world is 
dead...

(Fade to wavy fluctuations of the visual field)

The time is 2023, and Tim May finally figures out how to release a plague of 
nanobots that kill every human being in the world but himself.

Now we see Tim May driving a Hummer over the rolling hills of No Cal, on his 
weekly excursion to view the piles of dead bodies on the outskirts of San 
Fransisco. He stops by a 7-11, picking up some supplies, and tosses a 
handful of pennies onto the counter, in front of the skeleton of the counter 
boy. "That's what the market can bare, my friend, and then some," he says 
with a sly grin.

Arriving at the outskirts of San Fransisco he drives up to a tall hill, 
where some bodies are visible in the foreground, and downtown San Fransisco 
is visible in the distance. Complete silence pervades.

Raising his fist in the air he shouts at the top of his lungs: "SODOMITES! 
NEGROS! STATISTS! BOLSHIES! I'M FREE, DO YOU HEAR ME! FREEEEEE!"

Today he needs to re-gas the small powerplant that keeps his server farm 
alive. He decided to open his own Cypherpunks node, to which he posts on a 
regular basis. He's been issuing a stream of posts on "Darwinian 
Implications of Humanocide", and on how Darwinian evolution will eventually 
create a species much more advanced and free than the one he killed off.
