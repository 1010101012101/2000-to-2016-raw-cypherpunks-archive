>WATCHING YOU WATCHING THEM
>New tracking technology in cell phones, interactive TVs, and
>GPS-enabled rental cars is raising privacy concerns. Already,
>several companies are developing software to help track and make
>use of data collected from TV set-top boxes. The Center for
>Digital Democracy, an advocacy group for consumer privacy, is
>currently lobbying for regulations on the use of such technology
>that targets ads and gathers personal data. Aware of the possible
>government restrictions, the Association for Interactive Media is
>trying to outline privacy guidelines for interactive TV operations
>such as Microsoft's UltimateTV and the TiVo recorder. Currently,
>those companies are outside of cable regulations because they
>make use of phone lines. A host of companies are rushing to take
>advantage of a FCC deadline for wireless carriers to be able to
>pinpoint the location of cell phone users. Besides being able to
>locate users in 911-emergency cases, companies will be able to
>send location-specific wireless ads to subscribers of wireless
>Internet services.
