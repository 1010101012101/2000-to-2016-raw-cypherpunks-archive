I've actually seen these devices in operation. The thing
that impressed me most was that the path need not be a
single fiber from end to end - you can maintain quantum
state across a switchable fiber junction. This means
you are no longer limited to a single pair of boxes talking to
each other.

True, the SciAm article doesn't address a lot of issues,
but the fact remains that this technology is interesting
and important.
