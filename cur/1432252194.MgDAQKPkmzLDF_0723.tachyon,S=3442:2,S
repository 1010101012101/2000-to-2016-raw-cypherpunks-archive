It is not. Grass is stuffed full of all sorts of complicated 
chemicals that can cause confusion to creatures that chomp it. Not 
to mention nassty little silica crystals.

Lambs can eat grass because they are toughened and honed 
grass-killers, fitted by millions of years of evolution to survive 
everything the grass can throw at them.  And even then they only 
cope with some kinds of grass. When a cat eats grass it gets sick.

It doesn't take much intelligence to sneak up on a leaf, but it 
takes one hell of a digestive system to eat it.

Us mammals are downstream of a 200-million-year evolutionary race 
between ourselves and green plants - they evolve a new poison, we 
evolve to tolerate it. Then we put it in hot drinks. Why else do 
so many plant compounds have such powerful drug effects on animals?

At the time of writing there is no winner in sight.

It isn't impossible to imagine one side winning in the end though. 
The plants really did beat the bacteria way back in the Palaeozoic 
- wood is about the only living tissue that bacteria can't eat. 
Which is why there is so much coal around.  Fungi got the better 
of them later.

Democracy tries to get the majority of participants through to the 
next round of the game. Natural selection kills nearly everybody, 
nearly all the time. Which is why it is so effective. But, given 
the choice, I'll take democracy.


Trust me, I'm a botanist.
