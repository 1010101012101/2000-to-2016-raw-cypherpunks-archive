Yes Jim, I am one to talk. In my (small) town, there are no video cameras in
the PO. I've looked for them, carefully and repeatedly. (The notion that my
town
PO would have concealed cameras while big city POs expose them is for the
clinically paranoid) Traceback is limited by the memory of the two
overworked 
(at least on Saturday morning) ladies who woman the front desk. Of course, 
if I was worried I would just send cash.

Well, if you're not going to include a note, of course you're screwed. But
why
wouldn't you? Set up an account (U=armadillo, P=roadkill), then put some
cash
in a privacy envelope along with a note saying 'This is for armadillo's
account'.
(Now Jim, don't raise the spectre of handwriting or typewriter recognition -
I think
that's too silly even for you - can you cite a single case where a (B&W)
laser
or inkjet printed document was identified as coming from a particular 
well-maintained printer, as opposed to a typewriter? (I didn't think so)).
If 
you're still worried, get a trusted friend (if you have any) to write the
address. 

What receipt? Sending cash to anonymizer.com relies on something called 
trust (which I realize is a foreign concept to you). If they scam you, you
won't
send them cash again.

Cash goes through the mail all the time, especially around Christmas. 
While a few 'cash sniffing dogs' do exist, the notion that domestic
first class mail is routinely checked for small quantities of perfectly 
legal cash is another sign of clinical paranoia (or of someone who 
realizes he's backed into a corner and is resorting to heroic measures 
rather than admit defeat in an argument).
