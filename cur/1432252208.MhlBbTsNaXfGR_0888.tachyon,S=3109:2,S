Fine. I already write for this mailing list (and my stuff gets forwarded 
to other lists whether I like it or not). And even put in books already 
published or about to be published.

So I'm already a writer.

I'll contact the CFP organizers and ask for one of their hundreds of 
free passes to the panels, talks, and banquets.
