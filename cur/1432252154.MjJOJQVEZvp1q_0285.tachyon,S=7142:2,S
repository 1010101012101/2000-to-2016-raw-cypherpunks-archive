Interesting to note that the system you bash, for the sake of
argument lets call it "timmayism" is really in favor of individual
freedom (Tim, if you are not a libertarian, which is what I believe
you to be, given your writtings, please correct me) so things like
"domination", "exploitation", "profit", etc... are perfectly
acceptable so long as two people consentualy enter into an
agreement. The simple problem with what you are describing is that
is translates into "mattd decides whats is good for everyone else"
The very basic proof of this is that, given what you are writting,
if I enter into an agreement with Mr. May to rent his property, an
agreement I am perfectly acceptable to and that I am perfectly free
to decline to enter into; he is being an evil landlor-profiteer. I
am perfectly happy with the situation, but by your standards that
wasn't a "free" (your definition of free baffles me) exchange.

Hey! I think Lenin might like talking to you, knock on Stalin's door
too, since you just described communism.

| Anarchism is a variant of socialism 

an7ar7chism (nr-kzm)
n. 
The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are oppressive

so7cial7ism (ssh-lzm)
n. 
Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which
the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively

Pick one, stick to it.

cap7i7tal7ism (kp-tl-zm)
n. 
An economic system in which the means of production and distribution
are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate
to the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free
market.

free market
n. 
An economic market in which supply and demand are not regulated or
are regulated with only minor restrictions.

Maybe your read on "free market" is different then mine, but I would
say a worker has as much right to not work at a company as the
employer has to not employ that worker if he chooses not to.


| Anarchism also stands against state socialism and "Communism," because 

Isn't this a little different than what you said earlier?

Hey, enlighten us, show us some background studies, show us some
legitimate writtings and test cases to prove what you say. I would
imagine I am not alone in thinking you are full of shit with nothing
to substantiate what you have to say.

Interesting that you should bring this up. We have seen nothing from
you that falls outside this category. In fact, we have seen nothing
from you that is worthwhile period. But since others might not know
this and because some of us feel bored, we respond. If you really
care about the topics you blab about, then get yourself away from
that computer you must spend hours upon hours in front of, get
yourself into a library and in a few years, come on out and lets
have intelligent discussions. Read up on different political ideas
and systems, different ideologies and pick the one you like best.
The impression one gets from reading what you write (other than,
what the fuck, this list used to have decent shit on it) is that you
have no idea what you are talking about, you musta picked up a
little pamplet somewhere that said "anarchy is cool, we bust up
stores in the name of freedom" and gone with it. If you are just
wasting our time here, which is the more likely explanation, then
well, I just hope you don't actually believe the shit you write,
there are plenty other stupid people in the world, it would have
been nice if this list didn't attract as many as it seems to. --Gabe
