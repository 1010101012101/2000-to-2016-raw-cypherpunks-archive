Hello there,

Listen, I'm putting together a top-notch, offshore 
syndicate/partnership to develop, own & operate The 
World's Best Internet Casino & Sportsbooks.  I'm
writing only to the people I want to be in on this.
I'm aware of your particular experience & expertise,
and I'd like you to be part of our team.

Everyone's getting together informally in Tbilisi, The

Republic of Georgia on February 8th through to the 
14th, 2001, (The Investor/Partners, hardware
management, ISP Host/Owner, software & encryption
developers, the legal, accounting & marketing team,
and the banking partner). We'll be making the final
choices right then and there, determining who's in or
out. The checks will be written, papers drawn-up, and
the project launched.  I'll be serving as the Managing
Director/Pit Boss, and operating offshore. I'll be
responsible!

Please log onto http://casinopartners.bizland.com/ 
Check out the Internet Gaming Industry articles and 
our Offering Documents. Bear in mind that because of
the private nature of our business, and the public
nature of our Offer Information website, many things
that will be revealed & discussed in person during our

meetings, are not discussed on the site. So yes,
there's a little bit of "entrepeneurial paranoia"
about just how we're going to build a vertically
integrated online gaming conglomerate, but I'll be
upfront and frank about everything during our
meetings.

If you'd like to participate, but your schedule 
doesn't permit you to attend, please contact me or our

Investor Relations Director to introduce your 
representative that will attend on your behalf. All of
your questions concerning the Partnership Offer or
your arrangements  can be answered as well (i.e.
hotel, air travel, itinerary, etc.); 
(USA) e-voice/fax  1-425-920-5316 or 1-520-833-3054
