You conveniently edited my post to leave out what I was commenting on: 
your psychobabble about the MMPI and how to present oneself as a 
suitably servile sheeple.

I didn't take issue with your posts about guns, did I?

I've yet to see you add anything to the discussion about ostensibly 
list-related topics. While all of us post off-topic things at times, you 
are almost completely off-topic.

Something I suggested to you last spring bears repeating: read up on 
some of the basics.

Your stories about living as a homeless person but now being paid to 
surf the Net (you say) may be fodder for Oprah's Online Chat Room ("You 
go, girl!"), but this is not that forum.
