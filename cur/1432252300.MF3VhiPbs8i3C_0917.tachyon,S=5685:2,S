The wired-generation issue is that we don't need glib knowitall half-information or reporting that's packaged just like an SUV ad except it's for the socalled digiscenti.  The issue is that we need the best information that we can get and Declan's superficial reportage of the Congressional debate does NOT fulfill the need.  

I don't know how you could interpret my post as being anti-civil-liberty, what my post was about was: back up what you're saying because half-measures, half-thinking, halfway responses are not good enough.  This is not "The Operating System Wars" for christ sake.  Our lives are at stake.


We need reporting that can go to the bone and get real becuase it's all so fucking packaged and showbusiness - and Wired's no better than CNN.  I need data - not someone running around regurgitating the same Chicken Little stuff as last year, or 1993, or 1991.

Show me.  Show me.  Goddamn it I want to know who's saying what so I can get some truth.  Admitted to whom?  When, where?  If we are going to do the job, do it right.  Otherwise don't do it at all.  Otherwise it's just another crypto-jihad sort of madness.

And that again is not all true, from the portions I read in the one transcript.  Ther is debate.  But I need details.  Who's not debating?  Are you sure?  In other words, to perform a service in the interests of the cause of preservation of civil liberty, we need accurate, in-depth reporting and truth, for that is the only antidote to the ignorance and darkness.  And if the people on this list can't belly up to that bar, then you should just admit to yourselves you can't provide anything of value in this battle.  

Tim, you're of independent means, Declan you get paid to think through this stuff.  Some of us have to feed families.  Help us, and own your part in the struggle as others of us must do in ways you may not ever find out about.

IMO a worthless sentiment at this particular moment because it thinks only of yourself and not of anyone else - but I know you're a codger and I expect that sort of response, that's OK.  But there are people with a wider responsibility, or who present themselves as having taken on that mantle of wider responsibility, so I'm hoping they stand up and do the job they have to do.

I'm 'hiding' because the C130s over your place are over mine too.
