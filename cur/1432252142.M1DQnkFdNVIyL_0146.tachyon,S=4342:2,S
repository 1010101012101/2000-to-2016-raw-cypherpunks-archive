The writer above may not "seen this appear," but it's a basic tenet of 
Afghan history, going back decades, centuries, and millennia. The Silk 
Route passed through Afghanistan, the British tried to gain access and 
battled the Russians in what is usually dubbed "The Great Game." The 
Russians wanted a warm water port.

Daniel Yergin's book on the oil business some years back explained in 
great detail how the discovery of huge oil and gas fields in Central 
Asia early in the 20th century highlighted the issue of where to put a 
pipeline to a seaport. South through Uzbekistan and over the Khyber Pass 
into Pakistan and then down through the desert to the Arabian Sea was 
one conceived route. Another was west across Turkmenistan to Turkey to 
the Med was another.

(For those who get their history from James Bond movies, this was 
covered in the last Bond movie, where the French uberbabe Sophie Marceau 
played a Central Asian oil magnate. Scenes were shot in Tashkent.)

So, this is well-trod ground.
