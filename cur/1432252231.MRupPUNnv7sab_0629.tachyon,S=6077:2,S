FBI DITU also playing front-man as of late, it seems.


FBI-DITU + NSA-SSO/TAO + CIA/NSA-SCS
 - this is a trifecta of fuckery!


they're a legislative laundry designed to circumvent any constraints
individually by collectively attaining ends via means so offensive
they must remain hidden lest "National Security and The Future of our
Nation" be at risk...


were i a new age "Citizens for Intelligence Community Oversight" i
would pwn all three, and dump the entirety of their operations to
darknet.  let the public sort it out...
  [exercise for the reader: would it take longer for the world to
digest an entire dump than it would the current Snowden-subset
processing via reporter privilege?]

the use of foreign, military IC tools against domestic targets is
where many interesting stories lay.  you think yesterday's battlefield
exploits don't become today's domestic lawful access? epic lulz!
  what fucking tatters they've left our "Constitutional Rights"...
   [which should be afforded to all citizens of Eath, my over seas
peers fucked harder, longer, in no offensive a manner]

indeed.  IC suffering a deluge of undue oversight and sunlight.  are
you crazy POTUS, you want more potential visibility?  get tha fuck
back in yer hole, servant...
