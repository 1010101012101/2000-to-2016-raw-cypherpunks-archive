No, that won't work either. Simple publishing is no cover at all. Evidence
doesn't have to be secret to be evidence. Even public statements
(equivalent to publishing public keys) can be used against you.

If there is an exchange of encrypted data, that in and of itself is
sufficient to demonstrate communications. That is enough to demonstrate
intent and cooperation. Further, since the public keys are useless in and
of themselves for encryption without the private keys any exchange would
demonstrate that each party had access to the relevent private keys
mapped to the public keys.

It's possession of the private keys that will roast your goose.
