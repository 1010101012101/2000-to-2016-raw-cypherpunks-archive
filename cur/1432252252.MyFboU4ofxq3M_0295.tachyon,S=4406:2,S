Howdy,

I break them into 'unfiltered' and 'moderated'. The distinction is whether
the node modifies the email based on content to their subscribers. The
nodes themselves pass along a back-bone that is supposed to have zero,
nada, no modification. We all use duplicate filtering.

> How bad's the spam?

There is a reason that lne.com is popular. It can on occassion hit
hundreds. It's worth mentioning that even without the spam, the list
traffic is pretty high by most standards that I've ever run across. It can
also be quite heated. If you've got thin skin or can't handle 200 emails a
day (it doesn't run that all the time) in addition to your current load
you might want to stick with lne.com or one of the other moderated nodes.
The policies of the individual nodes are completely up to the node
operator and their individual subscribers. Outside of that I've not kept
up with what each one offers with respect to policy. The SSZ node is
completely unmodified outside of loop detection and adding CDR: to emails
coming FROM ssz.com only, and setting a reply-to: ssz.com for same. This
policy is not based on message content, but message source. I also have an
'anonymizer' account (ie cpunks_anon@ssz.com) which strips all header
information except time and subject. It is intended to provide anonymity
from the list itself (and nothing more).
