Looking out of my fifth floor window I can connect to ~20 802.x nets
*without* directional antennas or high powered cards.  With extra gear, I
can hit almost 50, and in both cases, roughly a third are completely open,
another third are trivially "protected", and the remaining third have done
the best they can under the circumstances :-)

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
