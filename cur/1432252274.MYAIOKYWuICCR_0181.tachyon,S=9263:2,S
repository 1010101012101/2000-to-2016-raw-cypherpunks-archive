Noted.  PGP/GPG is supported, RFC 2015 is not.  Apologies.

The argument's about what it's about.  I'm interested in seeing
arguments on both sides of the discussion:  why is or isn't signing
recommended, why is or isn't RFC 2015/3156 recommended, what is the best
way to secure broader 2015/3156 support (assuming same is a commendable
goal).

False:  PGP/MIME creates a requirement that all mail applications treat
the encoded material as opaque, and not subject to manipulation.
Encrypted messages which are modified by transports are rendered
non-decryptable.  Signed messages which are modified by transports fail
authentication.  I've seen both issues fairly frequently when dealing
with signed/encrypted mails using 2015 encoding.

You haven't made clear (and it's not clear from the RFC) how 2440
protects against such damage.  If I've misread the spec, please
disabuse me.

I'm ordinarially somewhat inclined to agree with you.  I'm not
completely comfortable with my stance here, though I'm going to continue
until an alternative emerges that speaks to the issues addressed in RFC
2015 / 3156.

I generally strongly resist "standards" which deprive the user of
control or discretion over their systems or data, or introduce security
issues, often by way of executing untrusted content.  The Web is rife
with examples, Javascript, Java, and Flash being prime among them.
PGP/GPG encryption and authentication are the opposite of this:  the
user is given more control, more authentication, higher security, and
greater discretion over data and processes.  Full implementation for the
purpose of handling signed data isn't required so long as the underlying
data are cleartext.  I'm also trying to be clear in distinguishing
advocacy for *support* (strongly encouraged) with advocacy for *use*
(encouraged, but not mandatory).

It's not clear to me why clients cannot implement at least sufficient
2015 compliance to be able to display signed messages without issue.
Note that Declan's observation that MIME would create issues using
/bin/mail is largely mooted by the fact that 2015 encoding is
transparent to humans -- the underlying content is comprehend able.  It's
clients that insist on not presenting raw format, but don't render
MIME-encoded formats properly, which cause problems.  There are also new
clients being developed which don't support MIME at all.  A friend's
mobile phone/PDA is an example -- it can't handle _any_ MIME
attachments, let alone 2015 encoded mail.

IMVAO, RFC 2015/3156 have followed the appropriate track of specifying a
standard, demonstrating multiple implementations, and providing a
largely trivial track to achieving compliance.  This is strongly
preferable to, say, modifying a Kerberos implementation and consequently
encumbering the modified specification.

More widespread adoption of an open standard should create broader
pressures for yet more widespread adoption.  When I hear from those who
have issues accessing my mail, I copy them the rant mentioned above.
I'm still revising the document to be informative without being
inflammatory -- a delicate balance.

A similar (but contrary) argument applies to proprietary file formats.
If, say, Microsoft's share of the office / "productivity" application
space falls to, say, 80%, there will be sufficient interaction
inefficiencies that they will be required to, de facto, open and/or
freeze their standards.  User interoperability and Metcalfe effects will
dictate this.  At this point, Microsoft's monopoly on this space will
effectively broken.

Accusing others of not reading while not following your own advice is
hardly commendable.  At 32KB, it's probably not too steep a price.

Thanks.
