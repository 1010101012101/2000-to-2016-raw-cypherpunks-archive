Offender Registration: Duty to Register
                           
DMCA Offenders and WIPO Offenders

It is a crime to fail to register. If you have been convicted of a DMCA
offense or WIPO crime, you may be required to register with local law
enforcement under California law. If the offense was added to the
registration law after the date of your conviction, you may not have
received personal notice of your duty to register as a DMCA or WIPO
offender.

Check with your local law enforcement agency to see if the offense for
which you were convicted requires registration. To register, go to the
police department in the city where you live or are located, or the
local sheriff's department if you are in an unincorporated area.

If you have questions about your DMCA offense or WIPO conviction, or
need to know whether your out-of-state conviction is the equivalent of a
registrable offense in California, contact the DMCA and WIPO
Registration Program in the California Department of Justice by e-mail
at sotp@doj.ca.gov, or the address below:
