Subject: RE: PGP and Speak Freely

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Ok, let me see if I can maybe clarify what the issue is... Speak Freely
offers the ability to encrypt your voice conversations in real time. If you
have the "Crypto capable" version, when you've made a connection to
someone, you both can enter an agreed upon key and your conversation will
be secure from that point forward. This of course creates several problems.
If someone is listening in, monitoring your conversation/traffic or packet
sniffing, if for instance, you were to say in the conversation, lets use
the word "monkey" for an IDEA key and you both typed in the word "monkey,"
your conversation would be encrypted using "monkey" as an IDEA key. The
problem of course is, if someone is monitoring your conversation, they'd of
heard you agree upon a key and they'd simply enter in the same key and
continue to monitor. 

Thus, you need a method of securely exchanging either an agreed upon key or
a generated key - Speak Freely will generate keys that you may copy and
paste into any of the various windows for  the various encryption
algorithms. PGP, Pretty Good Privacy, is one damn good method of securely
exchanging those keys. You may of course e-mail the key in an encrypted
e-mail or file to the intended recipients or you could even send the
encrypted file using several of the Instant Messaging Clients with a file
transfer protocol. These methods will certainly work very well. However,
take this example which happened to me just last evening. A friend and I
were needing to set up a secure conversation. After we couldn't get Speak
Freely to handle the key exchange, we decided to e-mail the key in a PGP
encrypted e-mail. Trouble was, the mail server was down on his ISP. He
could neither receive or send mail. If he hadn't had an auxiliary web-based
e-mail account, things might have been more complex than they were.

If Speak Freely were functioning correctly... let me amend that, IF we KNEW
how to make Speak Freely handle the key exchange as described in the help
file... It would have been a simple matter for us to allow Speak Freely to
handle the key exchange. What is supposed to happen is... in the
"connection" tab, you should be able to type the key identifier for the
person(s), Speak Freely will then launch PGP - which it does - encrypt the
generated key and transmit it to the intended recipients. This would
automate secure communications.

Hi,

I have used PGP with speakfreely on unix. it worked just fine ( in command
line 
mode, not with the GUI ). I did not used a key exhange option, you can just
sent (by e-mail) your pgp public key to te recipient and  ask him to email
you 
his public key.
I don't know of any need for keyexchange within SF itself.
am I missing something ? please give some more detail on the needed key 
exchange option.

Kind regards,
@
