Of course!

BTW, this doesn't mean you can refill your zippo.  Every
year or so we hear about a plane that made an emergency
landing or arrested a passenger for bringing lighter
fluid (in a can) on board and refilling their lighter
en route.  Most of the airline magazines and other 
places that list prohibited substances are pretty 
explicit about lighter fluid being banned (yes, it's
OK if it's inside a disposable lighter).

Ever seen a baseball bat :-)  ?

But smokable plant matter seems innocuous enough.  Next
thing, you won't be able to wear that hemp tie or shirt!
