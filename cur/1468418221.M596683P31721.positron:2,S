Aye true enough. I use Linux and freebsd as other primary OSs but am for instance using the nvidia supplied x11 driver, which has a binary blob in it... Performs so much better than nouveau though!!

Otherwise it's all free - xfce, Firefox and chromium... 

I still remember when Linux journal advertised commercial X11 for Linux that came with motif & cde... heh, I was still a bright eyed kid
