The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing fie|d that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oil and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
slightly, you wi|| stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wil| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
