Damn. I still think its pretty f*cked up that the FBI can grab somebody 
overeseas because Microsoft made a shitty product.

>   trail. The 98-year-old FBI, which has traditionally focused on domestic

>   with other law-enforcement agencies in pursuit of cybercriminals, much 
>as
>   the agency has done in tracking down terrorists overseas.
>
>   The shift reflects the global nature of computer crimes, which include
>   unleashing viruses, worms and other rogue programs onto victims'

>   to disrupt them or steal information. As electronic borders between
>   countries blur, hackers in one nation can easily commit crimes against
>   individuals, corporations and governments on the other side of the 
>world.
>
>   The FBI now ranks cybercrime as its third priority behind terrorism and
>   espionage. Computer-based crimes caused $14.2 billion in damages to
>   businesses around the globe in 2005, including the cost of repairing
>   systems and lost business, estimates Irvine, Calif., research firm

>   The FBI is running into limits fighting international computer crime.

>   their tracks by commandeering computers from afar and routing their
>   activities through machines dotted around the world.
>
>   Even when the agency does find suspects overseas, local authorities
>   sometimes lack the resources or laws to prosecute. In its pursuit of
>   LoveBug, one of the first big international computer viruses, which 
>spread
>   around the world in 2000, the FBI located its creator in the 
>Philippines.
>   But he was never charged because local laws didn't specify the virus
>   writer's activities as illegal at the time.
>
>   "The criminal community is winning," says Nicholas Ianelli, a security
>   analyst at the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, a
>   federally funded group that coordinates responses to computer-security
>   incidents.
>
>   But the agency is making some headway, thanks partly to a diplomatic
>   offensive to enlist help from foreign agencies. It now has about 150 
>agents
>   deployed in some 56 offices around the world, including in Iraq and 
>China,
>   which deal with computer intrusions, as well as terrorism and other 
>crimes.
>   That has grown from about a dozen offices in the early 1990s.

>   During the past two years or so, the FBI has also built up Cyber Action
>   Teams, or CATs -- a group of about 25 people that includes agents, 
>computer
>   forensic experts and specialists in computer code, according to David

>   Earlier this month, the FBI announced the arrest of at least 16

>   without approval from local authorities. Russia hasn't pursued the

>
>   But that wasn't all: Zotob opened a door for other malicious software to

>   into a keyboard -- a way to snatch credit-card numbers and other
>   information that is sold to criminal gangs. Zotob hit some 100,000
>   companies or more, some analysts estimate, including Time Warner Inc.'s 
>CNN
>   division and New York Times Co.
>
>
>   Even before the virus became famous by attacking CNN's computers, FBI 
>Agent
>   Erkan Chase and his colleagues were tracking the code. They discovered 
>that
>   the Zotob computer program had a signature line "by Diabl0". Mr. Chase,

>   that he had started monitoring earlier in the year, called Mytob. That
>   suggested the same person created both viruses.
>
>   Mr. Chase, who was overseeing the FBI's Cyber Action Teams at the time,
>   checked in with the FBI's U.S. field offices and found that agents in
>   Seattle had opened an investigation into Diabl0 after Mytob hit, linking
>   him to an email account at Microsoft in nearby Redmond, Wash. With 
>search
>   warrants served on the software giant, Mr. Chase and his colleagues
>   obtained emails between Diabl0 and another suspect using the nickname
>   "Coder." They also received subscriber information and other evidence
>   indicating the two were using computers in Morocco and Turkey, 
>respectively.
>

>

>   office called to brief Turkish police on the details, including

>   they had gathered on Coder, Mr. Tekeli says. Mr. Tekeli's team soon

>about
>   computers at Internet cafes. Turkish authorities already knew of Mr.

>   from an earlier investigation into a gang of credit-card thieves. Among
>   other details, the FBI provided an email address for Coder that included
>   part of Mr. Ekici's name as well as the equivalent of digital 
>fingerprints
>   that linked Coder's computer with Mr. Ekici's home address.
>
>   On Aug. 21, a week after noticing the virus, Mr. Chase left with a team

>   about a dozen people for Morocco and Turkey, flying in an FBI Learjet. 
>The

>
>   At the sparsely furnished offices of Turkey's cybercrime police, the FBI
>   team handed over evidence they had obtained about the suspects from

>   complete with slides. In Rabat, meanwhile, emails provided by the FBI
>   enabled Moroccan authorities to locate Diabl0 -- Mr. Essebar -- as well

>   an accomplice. Emails typically carry a unique set of numbers, known as

>the
>   Internet. Moroccan police were able to obtain the name and contact 
>details
>   associated with the Internet protocol addresses received from the FBI 
>from
>   a local Internet service provider.
>
>   The FBI's documents also helped local authorities swiftly secure arrest 
>and
>   search warrants. Concerned that the arrest of one suspect would tip off 
>the
>   others, Mr. Chase helped the two countries coordinate the raids. In the
>   early hours of Aug. 25, Turkish police officers surrounded Mr. Ekici's 
>home
>   and took him into custody. About 2,000 miles away in Rabat, police moved 
>in
>   on Mr. Essebar and his accomplice. The FBI wasn't invited to be present 
>at
>   either of the arrests. Turkish and Moroccan authorities say that is 
>because
>   only local police are allowed to charge suspects under the respective
>   national laws.
>
>   Mr. Ekici in Turkey had disposed of his computer hard drive so Turkish
>   investigators weren't able to gather much evidence from his machine. But
>   Mr. Essebar in Morocco only reformatted his hard drive, which wipes out
>   files but let the Moroccan police's computer specialists recover most of
>   them because copies often still exist.
>
>   Among the finds were copies of the code itself and other information
>   identifying Mr. Essebar as Zotob's author. Police also found emails 
>between
>   Diabl0 and Coder discussing Zotob as well as the numbers of about 1,600
>   stolen credit cards.
>
>   In parallel, FBI specialists worked off a copy of the hard drive,

>help
>   them analyze the program. "We were able to use that information from
>   Morocco and give it to Turkish authorities to further [their]
>   investigation," says Mr. Chase.
>
>   In September of this year, a Rabat court sentenced Mr. Essebar, a
>   Russian-born Moroccan national, to two years in prison for 
>virus-writing,
>   illegal access to computers and conspiracy to commit credit-card fraud. 
>The
>   court also sentenced his 21-year-old accomplice to one year in prison 
>for
>   conspiracy to commit fraud. A lawyer for Mr. Essebar couldn't be

>   At the time of the sentencing, news service Agence France Presse cited a
>   lawyer for the defendants saying they planned to appeal.
>
>   Authorities allege Mr. Ekici, whom they believe met Mr. Essebar at a Web

>   Zotob worm and intended to use it to steal financial information. But 
>they
>   say it is unclear whether he had time to swipe any information or profit
>   from it given the speed with which they were able to arrest him, less 
>than
>   two weeks after the worm first spread.
>
>   The trial of Mr. Ekici, whom Turkish authorities have charged with
>   unauthorized access to computers and disseminating a virus, continues in
>   Turkey. He couldn't be reached for comment.
>
>   The Zotob case marked the first time foreign law enforcement has come to
>   Turkey to assist in a cybercrime investigation, says Mr. Tekeli, the
>   cybercrime unit chief in Turkey. Without the FBI's help, the
