BTW John your cryptome.org writeup says: "This decisions appears to be
applicable to TEMPEST technology, the first instance to make use of
this technology illegal."

I'm not sure that's accurate.

First, this is a Fourth Amendment case, and the court only decided 
what limits should be placed on police, not private citizens.

Second, the ruling would allow TEMPEST monitoring by police if they
get a warrant. No reading of it would ban police TEMPEST surveillance
outright, and warrants are not that difficult to get.
