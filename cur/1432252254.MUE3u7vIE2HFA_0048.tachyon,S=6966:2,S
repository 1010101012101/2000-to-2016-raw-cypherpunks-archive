Police target anti-racist activists in Baltimore, Fascists hold hate 
concert in White Marsh
Baltimore city police have visited several locations in Baltimore today, 
illegally searching one and detaining and photgraphing activists at 
another. These incidents occured as hundreds of anti-racists converged in 
Washington to confront white supremecists belonging to the National Alliance.
08/24 11:30 PM: About 25 community members who live near the armory have 
come out of their houses and are standing with the activists. One woman 
from the neighbourhood verbally confronted a cop demanding to know why 
there are Nazis in her neighbourhood. The community members and activists 
have been asked to move by the police possibly to facilitate the concert 
attendees departing without incidents. At last count there were 14 police 
cars, two fbi vehicles, and one secret service vehicle on the scene. 08/24 
10:45 PM: Two activists are across the street from the armory, facing down 
close to a hundred riot police, fbi agents, and secret service. An fbi 
agent asked for an ID from one activist, saying that "we had problems 
earlier with nazis being attacked." There is also a police helicopter 
circling the area with a spotlight. A few local residents have also been 
coaxed out of their houses. The protesters at the scene have asked for 
others to join them. directions: "The nazi concert is in white marsh, not 
Towson. WhiteMarsh is 10 minutes away from Towson. From DC take 95 North to 
695 West to Towson Exit 32B, Rt 1/North Belair Left at the second traffic 
light onto Rossville go to Putt....Ave, the Armory is there." 08/24 10:15 
PM: Fox 45 reported the travel plava incident as a "fight between two 
neo-nazi groups." A call to the station revealed the source for this: 
Baltimore City Police Lt. Harris, of the Center for Public information. 
08/24 9:45 PM: In the armory in White Marsh, 16 police cars and two paddy 
wagons are outside of the nazi show. One media van is also there, and music 
is definitely playing inside the armory. About 20 cars are parked in the 
front, possibly more in the back. Also, food not bombs is at the booking 
center.

08/24 9:30 PM: There are about 15 people outside Baltimore central booking 
demonstrating solidarity with the arrested activists. Support is still 
needed, as those there are fearing arrest or other action by Baltimore 
police. Central booking is located at 300 E. Madison Street in downtown 
baltimore.

Baltimore City Detention Center For Women
08/24 8:45 PM: The 30 activists arrested in Baltimore are being held in 
central booking. Jail solidarity is needed there. 08/24 8:45 PM: Apparently 
everyone has left the PAC without incident. It is not clear if police are 
still there. There is a Hate concert occuring in White Marsh at a National 
Guard armory, with police and news media on the scene. Attendence at the 
concert is apparently minimal. 08/24 8:00 PM: Plain-clothes police 
detectives have sorrounded the Progressive Action Center and are 
photographing and documenting activists and their cars. Several people were 
detained outside, two apparently at gunpoint, and their ID's taken and 
documented by the police. No one is being arrested or detained, but police 
remain outside. 08/24 7:00 PM: Police visited a local community/activist 
space, apparently telling one resident that they were "there for your own 
good." The officers entered the space with no warrant, even after a 
resident told them that they did not have permission to enter, and 
performed a plain-view search of the building. 08/24 5:00 PM: According to 
accounts, about 700 anti-racists were in DC compared to about 500 racists. 
Numerous confrontations occurred. For more info, check dc IMC.
