Was the Florida Ballot possibly confusing ? Yes!
Should it be redesigned for the next election? Yes!
Does it mean those people should get to re-vote ? No!

Life is unfair (a.k.a. Shit Happens). Accept the consequences. Learn from
your mistakes. Get on with your Life.

There are a lot of things in my life I'd like to do over because of
mistakes, circumstances, etc.

Do I get a chance to do them over ? Nope.

Unless they can demonstrate real fraud or negligence on the part of election
officials (refusing to give voters replacement ballots if they screw up in
the booth), the results of the recount should stand. Otherwise we will be
opening a giant can of worms.

As for Gore having more actual votes than Bush, it doesn't matter. If you're
not happy about that, push to have the Constitution amended (Good Luck!).
