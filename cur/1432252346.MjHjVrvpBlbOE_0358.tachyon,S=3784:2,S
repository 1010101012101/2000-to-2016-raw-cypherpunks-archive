Well ZKS should have an interest maintaining a good reputation for
acting in the interests of users privacy.  Companies who use such
services should also have an interest in using services of companies
with good privacy reputations -- as this would tend to give better
consumer confidence in the resulting systems.

I guess the only answers are maintaining professionalism, and
integrity and to maintain a strong stance on users privacy, with clear
long term objectives (avoiding short-sighted small incremental
improvements which may stay for a long time just because of the fact
that built working systems don't get replaced as long as they continue
to function).  Openness would be a guiding principle too I would think
-- so that users and technology critics can analyse and criticize the
systems.  Transparent functioning is a huge win for privacy.
