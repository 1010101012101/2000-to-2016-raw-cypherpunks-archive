Well, since you put it like that, I guess I have to set you straight:

It uses ssh out of the box -- so there's your transport encryption, and
it optionally uses GPG encryption for special remotes (i.e. dumping your
files in Amazon S3, or a USB stick, say), so yes, it does do encryption
out of the box in the places where one might actually want it.

  http://git-annex.branchable.com/encryption/

As for scaling, it depends what you're after, but since (if using the
assistant) you can nudge remotes into attempting to pull from one
another via XMPP, I think it's got quite a few of the real world use
cases covered for scalability too.

The big win for me is that it builds on proven technology, that is easy
to trust.  I know I'd much rather trust the crypto in ssh and GPG than
something alpha from bittorrent.

Git's had a fair amount of testing too (as has git annex).

Bittorrent sync on the other hand is currently in an invitation-only
pre-alpha phase, it seems.

Cheers, Phil.
