Steven denBeste (the captain of U.S.S. Clueless) discussed anti-tank 
weapons and anti-anti-tank defenses at 
http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/08/MoreontheT-72.shtml . The 
HEAT discussion applies to RPGs. It doesn't answer all of Major 
Variola's questions, but gives a conceptual overview without the math.

Note: Although denBeste generally writes good essays on the technical 
subjects he covers, he's been known to make omissions and errors. As 
with everything on the net, read with a grain of salt.
