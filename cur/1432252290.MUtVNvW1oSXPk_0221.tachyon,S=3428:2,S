The difference is that *anyone* can see what goes on inside an Intel or
AMD processor.  Only the key holder of the TPM can see inside the
"protected" code space.  You can't put back doors into the code now
because the code is visible to all users.  The purpose of crypto is to
hide information even tho the attacker can see all the machinery work.
If you don't want to have the machinery visible, then use a sealed
system (like smart card).

Patience, persistence, truth,
