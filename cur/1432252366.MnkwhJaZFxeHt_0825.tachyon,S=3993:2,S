Subject: Special program on _Homeland and International Security_ at
 ICCS

Special program on _Homeland and International Security_
at the International Conference on Complex Systems.

Events over the past few years have altered perspectives
about priorities of national and international challenges.
The scientific community, and particularly the Complex
Systems community, should respond by providing new insights
tools and approaches informing policy, preparation and action.

In particular, international terrorism, pandemics, and natural
disasters are leading to a broad need for strategies to address
national and international security. The science of complex
systems, including network analysis, agent simulations,
and new approaches to systems engineering, provide a basis
for better identification and prioritization of challenges,
developing strategies for addressing them, and executing
the strategies that are developed. The huge investments that
are currently underway and planned in these areas should
be guided by complex systems ideas.

We are planning multiple sessions on the topic of Homeland
and International Security at the International Conference
on Complex Systems. Abstracts can be submitted through the
conference webpage at
http://necsi.org/conferences/iccs06

Key topics include, but are not restricted to:
--Modeling and simulation of attacks, pandemics and disasters
--Critical infrastructure protection
--Network analysis of terrorism
--Social processes of radical movements supporting terrorism
--Analysis of effective and ineffective crisis response
--Network analysis of transnational emergency response

Agencies and organizations that are interested in presenting
funding opportunities or collaborations are welcome.
