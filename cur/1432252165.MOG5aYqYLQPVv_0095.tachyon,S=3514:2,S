I can verify that.  My copy of "O Brother, Where Art Thou" has 2 
trailers that play _before the main menu_.  Fortunately, chapter 
skip goes right by them, but it's still annoying.  I've got one or two 
others with intrusive trailers, but their titles escape me.

As I understand it, DVDs are controlled by a (reputedly powerful) 
script language that allows disabling arbitrary features of the 
player.  (the FBI warning usually won't skip)

I can always tell my player to go directly to a title/chapter.  
Unskippable trailers will probably just lead to my keeping a Sharpie 
near the player so I can make a note on the new discs as to where 
I want to start.  Is that "circumvention"?

Hmmm...  The DMCA prohibits Sharpie markers?
