You can subscribe to Jim Choate's node, which is unmoderated and 
unfiltered. Go to http://einstein.ssz.com/cdr for info.

Be warned: If you've been reading the cypherpunks feed from a filtered 
list (I don't know if Minder is filtered or not), you'll be in for an 
unpleasant surprise. There aren't _that_ many out-and-out idiots 
posting to the list, but what their posts lack in quality they more 
that make up with quantity. And there are lots of ass-wipes who sign up 
cypherpunks nodes for all sorts of spam lists. Before you subscribe to 
an unfiltered list, compare the inet-one cpunks archive 
(http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/) to the archive I maintain 
(http://archives.abditum.com/cypherpunks/). inet-one archives an 
unfiltered feed. I archive LNE's filtered feed. (Note: as of ten 
seconds ago, inet-one's site is temporarily down. It's been a while 
since I visited, so I don't know how temporary "temporarily" is.)
