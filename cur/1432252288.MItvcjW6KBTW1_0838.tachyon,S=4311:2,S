Obviously revealing the key would defeat any useful properties of the 
TPM/SCP. However, unless the machine refuses to run stuff unless signed 
by some other key, its a matter of choice whether you run an OS that has 
the aforementioned properties.

Of course, its highly likely that if you want to watch products of Da 
Mouse on your PC, you will be obliged to choose a certain OS. In order 
to avoid more sinister uses, it makes sense to me to ensure that at 
least one free OS gets appropriate signoff (and no, that does not 
include a Linux port by HP). At least, it makes sense to me if I assume 
that the certain other OS will otherwise become dominant. Which seems 
likely.

Cheers,

Ben.
