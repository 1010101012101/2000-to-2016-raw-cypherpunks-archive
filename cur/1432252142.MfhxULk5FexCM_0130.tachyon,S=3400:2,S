Justice would be no Draconian drug penalities at all, rather than
subjecting the extended ruling aristocracy to the same unfair penalties as
the proles.

I mention this because it doesn't help the goal of getting rid of unfair
laws at all, if people can be made to cheer every time someone they don't
like runs afoul of one.

Jimmy Carter once suggested that a law was unfair of more than 50% of the
pain and suffering was caused by the law, and not by the act being
punished.

By this standard, we would have no laws at all against the casual use or
sale of marijuana, and less stringent laws against the use or sale of
almost everything else.  Heroin is much less addictive than nicotine, and
a good deal less poisonous too.  I don't see many driveby shootings over
cigarettes.
