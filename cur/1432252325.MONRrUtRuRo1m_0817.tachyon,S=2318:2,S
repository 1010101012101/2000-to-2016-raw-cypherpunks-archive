Want to See the World Implode
by Jim Donahue

I'd like to see some real hell unleashed in the upcoming year.

I want a briefcase full of weaponized toxins to explode in front of the
New York Stock Exchange. I want to see political assassinations take place
all over Amerika, melee assassinations, live on television during a press
conference. I want power outages to roll their way through the
countryside, from Boston to D.C. to Miami to Dallas to Los Angeles to San
Francisco to Seattle and back again. I want the economy to collapse into a
pile of green ashes. I want 401(k) plans and IRAs and mutual fund
investments to disappear. I want the twelve Federal Reserve Bank branches
to go up in flames.

I want new laws, more laws, bigger laws. I want laws that prohibit smoking
in public, in private, on the high seas, and on the moon. I want drug laws
that will put a high school student in the electric chair for smoking a
joint.
