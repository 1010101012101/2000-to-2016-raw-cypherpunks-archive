Why is there any need to "figure out how to make the society more 
human-friendly"?

It's up to people to arrange their lives to maximize their own 
conditions. Those who choose not to are in deep shit. Regrettably for 
them, billions of them have done little to improve their lives, their 
governments, their situations, are fucked.

I chose to save my money, invest in high technology, and I retired in 
1986 when I was 34 years old. I've never worked another day at 
something I didn't want to do.

Several billion people, including most in America and Europe, are 
fucked because of their choices. Suits me.

Darwinism is nothing without enough dead bodies.
