Being against 'free market' bullshit doesn't make one an
'anti-cypherpunk', it does make them a 'discriminating cypherpunk'. It
does however mean they at least recognize that the 'Libertarian' view
of 'god money rules' is bereft of any philosphical import and ethically
about as dead as it's possible to be.

Fuck David Friedman and his 'business has only one purpose: make money'
and anyone who follows his brain-dead dronings.

Actually you have to start out being stupid to fall for libertarian
anything.

Freedom for ALL, not just the monied. Libertarians are just another group
wanting to coerce you to their ends - make lots of money for them. And if
you don't have any, well that's just too damn bad. The Libertarian credo
of 'money makes the world go round' is accurate only if you choose to make
it so.

Tell 'em "No thanks".
