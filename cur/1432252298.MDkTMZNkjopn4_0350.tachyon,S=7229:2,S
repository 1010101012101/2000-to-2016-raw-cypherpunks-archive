The xkcd comic doesn't really apply anymore. Dictionary attacks have gotten
to the point where they can crack 'momof3g8kids' and 'Coneyisland9/,'

and apparently have dictionaries breaking 100 million words. As password
attacks get better and better at predicting human patterns (and hardware
gets faster), you are going to need to completely generate your passwords
at random in order to defend against dictionary attacks.

Which means the current password model is broken, as we all know it has
been for a while. Why isn't there a stronger effort to replace it with
something like a universal public key system?
