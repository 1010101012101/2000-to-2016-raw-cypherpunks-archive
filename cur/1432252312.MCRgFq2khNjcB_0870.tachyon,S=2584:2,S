This will make any further use of MD5 very very hard to justify.

What religion, please tell me, tells you as a follower of that religion
to occupy another country and kill its people? Please tell me. Does
Christianity tell its followers to do that? Judaism, for that matter?
Islam, for that matter? What prophet tells you to send 160,000 troops
to another country, kill men, women, and children? You just can't wear
your religion on your sleeve or just go to church. You should be
truthfully religious.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

Subject: PlayStation 3 predicts next US president

Hi all,

We (Marc Stevens, Arjen Lenstra and me) have used a Sony PlayStation 3 
to correctly predict the outcome of the 2008 US presidential elections.
See http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/Nostradamus if you want to know
the details of what this has to do with cryptography.

We also announce two different Win32 executables that have identical 
MD5 hash values. This can be made to happen for any two executable
files.
This implies a vulnerability in software integrity protection and 
code signing schemes that still use MD5.
See http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/SoftIntCodeSign for details.

Grtz,
Benne de Weger
