DUMA ADOPTS LAW ON DIGITAL SIGNATURES
The Duma adopted on final reading on 13 December the bill legalizing the
use of electronic digital signatures and giving them the same status as
conventional signatures, "Kommersant-Daily" reported. However, the bill
recognizes the validation of digital signature only after an original
document has first been signed with a conventional signature. According to
Duma Committee for Taxes and Duties deputy head Ashot Egiazaryan, the bill
is intended to speed up the work of Russian stock exchanges and, in
general, to reduce expenses for mailing documents. VY
