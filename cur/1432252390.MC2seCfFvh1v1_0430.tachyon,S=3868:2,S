As I said, it's not my job to buy plane tickets, hotel rooms, etc. 
and then fill out a government form.

Actually, I remember someone saying during the Parker case that a 
government travel office would make  all travel and lodging 
arrangements.

Not my job to lend money to the government.

I'm watching a lawyer on the stand in the Seminole County part of the 
rolling trial say that he charges $500 an hour to testify in court 
cases. Sounds like a good fee for me to charge.
