amazon.com is one place. see also 
http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/

for an online copy of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography.

I'm not sure what you mean by "a whole system." Do you mean something like
"how do I take a string of letters and represent it as a number so I can
encrypt it?" Then you want to look at ASCII or Unicode and random padding
like Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP). 

I'm not sure what else you mean.
