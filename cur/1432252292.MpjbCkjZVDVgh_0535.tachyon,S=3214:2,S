Let S be the set of all bitstrings.  Let, C, the set of all ciphers, be
the set of all finitely denumerable primitive recursive injections of S
into itself.  Let O, our oracle, associate with each M in C a map M', from
range(M) onto S, such that for x,y in S and y = M(x), x = M'(y).

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt.  While we may without loss of generalization view O as
acting on bitstrings, by encoding the ciphers and their inverses, neither
the domain nor range of O is going to be the set of all bitstrings.  
Ergo, we can not simply "choose" things based on the application of O to
bitstrings we arbitrarily construct.

Your proof can be fixed, of course, but I think you'll find that it boils
down to the usual diagonal argument that we can find a function on the
integers which is not primitive recursive, by ordering the countable set
of primitive recursive functions, and defining a new function that is for
an input of N, something other than the output of the Nth function for N.

As long as we restrict the ciphers to a countable set of "reasonable" 
computer programs which halt for all inputs and don't have neverending 
descriptions, the oracle exists, and your proof does not.
