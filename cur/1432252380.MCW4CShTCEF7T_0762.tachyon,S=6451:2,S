It doesn't matter. While NSA builds their own hardware, you can as well 
think in terms of vanilla Dells.

Dell 1U have three drive bays. Whether it's 200 GB, or 300 GByte or TByte
apiece (such drives exist) or how many U they occupy it doesn't matter, as
this is an order of magnitude estimate.

I would not do backups for raw signint data. (If I would have to do
backups I'd use RAID at disk or mirrored servers). I would do backups for
targeted and destilled data, which is a tiny fraction of the entire sea of
nodes.

The point is not how much you're getting (personal mail, mailing lists are 
redundant, so is spam -- NSA could offer the best spam filtering sources 
ever), the point how much people are _writing_. On the average.

Off-shelf Dells come with twin GBit Ethernet ports. You can throw in other
interconnects which scale better. The traffic is not that high, if you
remember that you can hold entire's day email traffic in your hand.

How much cage monkeys do you need to deal with a hardware failures in a 10
kNode installation which happens a few time in a workday? One. Two, if you 
want to deal with the failure immediately. You should look at personnel 
requirements and failure rate for COTS clusters in academic environments.

Email and fax and telex are easy. Voice might be tight. Dunno about 
videoteleconferencing, not many people are doing it yet.

The system I mentioned was an illustration that you can process entire
world's traffic in a single, not very large hall. On a very unremarkable
budget. Yes, you can centralize the world's traffic (a TBit/s fiber link
can feed one kilonode), but you don't have to. You can just switch the
individual clusters into a grid with dedicated fiber lines, and treat it
like a whole. It's just a database, after all.

I have no idea what the specs are. All I'm saying that it can be done,
now. The capabilities grow a lot faster than the number of subjects to
survey, though threshold countries coming online (see DSL numbers for
Chinese users) will result in a sudden surge of growth. After the world 
has saturated new growth will only come from intermachine traffic and new 
forms of communication (broadband video feeds).

One would hope that by then the bulk of that traffic is encrypted, making 
gathering data largely an exercise in futility.
