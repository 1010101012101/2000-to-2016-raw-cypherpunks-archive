There must be trained and educated people and they
don't even have to lie. Speaking out their entire life
minus the six months to two years at a terrorist
training camp still will not give any useful info to
the questioner.

quickly be able to detect stress patterns and be a
sign of warning. For lesser people,it is a decent
test.
