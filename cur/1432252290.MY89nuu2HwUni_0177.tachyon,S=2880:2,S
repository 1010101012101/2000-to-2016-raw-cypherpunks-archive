If a larger population starts using cryptography, we
can compare it to U.S mail. The govt. any way can't go
through all the snail mails due to its sheer volume.
They rely on other methods to detect and nullify
terror threats. Even if every one started using
encryption, the govt will not spend any money to
decrypt all the messages. The govt will use other
mechanisms(intelligece) to detect which cipher text is
worth breaking. More people using cryptography is good
for the crypto community, in terms of dollars,interest
and development in this particular area.
