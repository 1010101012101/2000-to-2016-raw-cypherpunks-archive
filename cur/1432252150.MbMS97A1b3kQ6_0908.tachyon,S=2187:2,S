hi! i'm working on a project and i need help. my
project is dealing with cryptograpghy and the
different sieves that are used. as of right now i am
trying to understand the quadratic sieve. i have been
looking at different sites dealing with this seive,
but the info there is pretty hard to understand. they
say it almost as if you know what they are talking
about, and i don't. the info they have is not detailed
at all. so can you help me?     from- jenn
