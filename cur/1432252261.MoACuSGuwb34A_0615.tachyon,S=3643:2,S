You mean like your foaming-at-the-mouth denunciations of Declan and 
others? Odd, this, considering how much material you volunteered at Bell 
2.

You mean like your Toto-emulating incomprehensible ramblings?

By the way, calling CJ Parker a "genius" is the strangest thing I've 
read in a long while. He fits the pattern we're now seeing with mattd, 
and that we saw in the past with Detweiler and Vulis. And that we often 
see with your own posts, John. Namely, a mix of schizophrenia, dyslexia, 
paranoia, and Tourette's Syndrome. Some are more dyslexic than others, 
and it's likely that with some the word juxtapositions and malapropisms 
are completely intentional.

I used to thing folks were trying to emulate Detweiler, then Toto. Now 
I'm thinking there's some common miswiring in the brains of these folks.
