(Haven't seen this mentioned 'round these parts...)

Google's released a meta-searching tool -- you can now see who's searching
for what:

    <http://www.google.com/trends>

A quick search for things like 'anonymous' and 'encryption' made me think.
And I'm positive there's data that's been pulled from the engine -- some
search terms show zero results.

Who needs a warrant when you have corporate interest?

(And I wonder how long it will take before there's a meta-trending tool as
well.)
