1. Draft Audiovisual Directive limited to the TV-like services on the web
============================================================
At the EU's Council of Ministers meeting on 14 November a new version of the
Audiovisual Media Services directive has been agreed, that limits
the new regulation regarding video on the Internet only to the TV-like
services (linear services). The video clips on the Internet will not be
subject of this new directive.

The initial version of the Audiovisual Media Services, which is a revision
of the 1997 Television without Frontiers (TWF) directive, has been seriously
criticized by various players - from the UK government to a number of media
scholars that signed the Budapest Declaration for Freedom of the Internet.

The new version agreed by the Council of Ministers, but also by the European
Parliament Culture committee introduces the notion of audiovisual media
services and distinguishes between television broadcasts ("linear" services"
e.g. scheduled broadcasting via traditional TV, the internet or mobile
phones, which "pushes" content to viewers) and on-demand services
("non-linear" such as video on-demand, which the viewer "pulls" from a
network).  In distinguishing between these two categories of audiovisual
media services, both the Commission and the Committee have stressed that
they are seeking to subject providers of "on demand services" to only a
minimum set of rules. Linear services, on the other hand, are more
thoroughly regulated.

One of the main supporters of the reduction of the content were the UK
broadcasting regulator Ofcom and Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. Ofcom will
now have to regulate only the TV Internet broadcast from major televisions,
but will not include the social networking websites - so popular these days.
"Today's outcome is testament to the substantial progress we have made in
persuading our European partners to take our arguments on board," underlined
one of the supporters of the change, the UK creative industries minister,
Shaun Woodward.

Continuing the country of origin principle foreseen in the TWF directive,
the draft Audiovisual directive puts the national regulators in charge of
regulating the broadcasters that operate within their borders. The agreed
text includes also a mechanism allowing a destination Member State under
certain limited circumstances to take measures against a provider
established in another Member State.

2. German draft law on data retention made public
============================================================
On 8 November 2006, the German Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries
presented a draft law aimed at transposing the EU directive on data
retention. The law would override the recent jurisprudence on IP logging by
mandating the retention of traffic data for a period of six months.

Retention requirements are also to apply to anonymization services, making
them practically superfluous. Furthermore anonymous e-mail accounts are to
be banned. Access to traffic data shall be permissible for the investigation
of "substantial" offences, but also for the investigation of any offence
committed by use of telecommunications networks (including sharing of
copyrighted content). The law is to enter into force on 15 September 2007.
Until 15 March 2009 data retention is to be optional for providers of
internet access, Internet telephony and e-mail services.

The draft law was sharply criticised by the activist Working Group on Data
Retention (Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung) for being unconstitutional.
The German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) has
repeatedly ruled in the past that human rights permit the collection of
personal data only where they are needed for a specific purpose. The Working
Group called for the transposition process to be aborted or, at least,
suspended until the ECJ has ruled on Ireland's action for annulment of the
directive on data retention. The Working Group also criticized the German
draft law for going beyond EU requirements in relation to anonymization
services, e-mail services and access to retained data. The EU directive
applies to the investigation of "serious" offences only and does not ban
anonymous or anonymization services.

The activist group presented a class action to be submitted to the Federal
Constitutional Court in case the proposed law is adopted. The Court is to be
asked to provisionally suspend data retention in Germany while examining its
constitutionality. According to the draft application published on the
Internet, the EU directive on data retention is void for violating human
rights and for lacking a legal basis. The planned class action is supported
by several German jurists and is open for all German citizens to join.

3. New law proposal on data retention submitted in Italy
============================================================
Thanks to Italian MP Maurizio Turco (Rosa nel Pugno) a law proposal on data
retention authored by the Winston Smith Project has been recently submitted
to the Italian Parliament as DDL (Disegno di Legge) number 1728.

The proposal, whose title is "Regulations for the collection, usage,
retention and deletion of geo-referenced or chrono-referenced data,
containing unique user identifiers, through automatic devices" aims to limit
the "side effects" of the current "data retention culture", in which - due
to political and technological reasons - logging and retention of all sorts
of data is the norm rather than the exception.

According to the explanatory text of the proposal, ISP connections, web
surfing patterns, mail, news, chats can be logged and stored indefinitely
with relatively small investments, even by small and medium organisations.
The phenomenon is not limited to the Internet "per se": GSM "cell data",
i.e. the list of cells to which a mobile phone connects while the owner
moves, or data resulting from RFID usage are two other examples.

Technological automation allows the creation of huge databases on
activities that are not necessarily considered "personal data" according to
Italian law 196/2003, the main legal source for privacy protection in Italy,
and are therefore not subject to the protection guaranteed thereof.

Such databases can quickly become a privacy nightmare as access controls
tend to be lax either for lack of funding or for a commercial interest into
giving such access in the first place, and as data mining theory and
applications become more and more sophisticated in cross-referencing
apparently innocuous data from different sources.

Three Italian laws regulate the duration of data retention: Legislative
Decree 259/2003 ("Codice delle comunicazioni elettroniche"), Law 196/2003
("Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali) and, most recently,
the so-called "decreto Pisanu", from the name of the former Ministry of
Internal Affairs of the last Berlusconi government.

The law proposal by the Winston Smith Project does not want to negotiate the
current obligations related to data retention; rather, it aims at acting "ex
ante" by reducing the quantity of data that are automatically collected
without any specific legal obligation imposing such collection in the first
place. The law introduces the "duty to delete" principle, according to which
automatically collected data shall not be preserved for longer than strictly
necessary to achieve the goal for which collection took place in the first
place. In a nutshell, the law proposal aims at making deletion of data the
rule, rather than the exception.

4. UK biometric passports project set back by simple cloning possibilities
============================================================
UK Government faces now a big problem related to the introduction of the new
biometric passports as recently it has been proven these passports can be
easily and very cheaply copied by means of a microchip reader that can be
legally bought on the Internet.

As a big embarrassment to the Home Office, a project having led to the
increase of the travel documents by 60 per cent since March 2006, and that
brought about 90 million euro costs for the passport production lines, may
be entirely dropped as the new passports are more a risk for their owners
rather than an improvement to the old documents.

"Three million people now have passports that expose them to a greater risk
of identity fraud than before." said Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home
affairs spokesman.

UK government decided to introduce the micro-chipped biometric passports in
order to make theft more difficult, but an investigation led by the Guardian
has shown the respective passports can be easily read and copied. The data
obtained from three passports were transferred to a PC after gaining access
to the chips by means of a simple microchip reader, purchased from the
Internet for less than 150 euro, and then cloned with photograph included.

Computer expert Adam Laurie, who needed only 48 hours to write a software
capable to copy the information from the passports said: "The Home Office is
using strong cryptography to prevent conversations between the passport and
the reader being eavesdropped, but they are breaking one of the fundamental
principles of encryption by using non-secret information published in the
passport to create a 'secret key'. That is the equivalent of installing a
solid steel front door to your house and putting the key under the mat."

The Home Office commented on that considering the fact as not important:
"The information itself cannot be altered; the photo would still be the same
so the copy would be of no use to an impersonator trying to use it
fraudulently. Other than the photograph, which could be obtained easily by
other means, they would gain no information that they did not already have -
so the whole exercise would be utterly pointless." stated a spokesman.

As Phil Booth of NO2ID said: "The government is clearly derelict in its duty
to protect the privacy and security of British citizens".

5. Microsoft in danger of additional fining from the European Commission
============================================================
Microsoft faces additional fines for not having yet complied with the 2004
antitrust order through which it was ordered to provide the complete and
accurate interface documentation ensuring other companies to write software
that would work on systems running Windows .

The Commission considered in 2004 that Microsoft had abused its position in
the software market as its operation system Windows, used on more than 95%
of the PCs in the world, did not allow sufficient interoperability for other
software producers.

Microsoft had already been fined with 479 million euro and another fine of
280.5 million euro was established by the EC for Microsoft not having
observed the 19 July deadline. Now, the penalties will increase from 2 to 3
million euro per day in case the company does not meet the new deadline
established for 23 November 2006.

After that date, the information to be received from Microsoft will be
supplied to its competitors to decide whether it is enough for
interoperability.

Although Microsoft has said that it is ready to provide the remaining
information, the Commission seems to have lost its patience on the matter.
Commissioner Neelie Kroes stated to the UK newspaper The Guardian: "I am not
impressed if someone says 90% of the information is already there when we
need 100%. It's a jigsaw and some parts are missing. In my opinion, this
information should have been here a couple of months ago."

Microsoft's new operating system Vista that had been initially scheduled for
the middle on 2006 has been largely affected by this issue. Microsoft had to
agree to make changes to Vista as EU threatened to ban it based on concerns
that the software included in the operating system was violating antitrust
laws. This delay in releasing Vista on the market is estimated to have cost
Microsoft about 80 million euro per month and to have caused a drop of 20%
in sales on the PC market. Microsoft is now planning to launch the product
on 30 January 2007.

In case the Commission and other software companies are pleased with the
documents Microsoft is expected to provide, Microsoft will decide how much
to charge for licenses and, in case the Commission finds the cost too high,
it can again fine the US company.

Professor Neil Barrett, the Commission's 'monitoring trustee' will help the
Commission interpret the information provided by Microsoft and will monitor
the compliance with the Commission's decisions.

Microsoft has still not complied with 2004 ruling, says Commission

6. Italian Minister of Justice proposes an authority for violent videogames
============================================================
According to the Italian national newspaper La Repubblica, the Italian
Minister of Justice, Mr. Clemente Mastella, has recently claimed that it
would be advisable to create an "authority" that would "decide on acceptable
standards related to the modalities of sale" of videogames, so that it might
be possible to "find those [videogames] that contain unacceptable levels of
violence".

An "authority", in Italian political lingo, is a theoretically independent
public body that ought to check and control certain subsets of public life.
Examples include the "Autorit` per le Telecomunicazioni" (Authority for
Telecommunications) and the "Autorit` Garante della Concorrenza e del
Mercato" (Authority for Guaranteeing Competition and [Free] Market), both
criticized in the past for their inability to clearly fulfil their mission
due to too much internal bureaucracy and/or a sort of "psychological
dependence" towards the Government in charge and other powers-that-be.

Mr. Mastella's remarks, together with those of Mr. Giuseppe Fioroni,
Minister of Education, according to whom "freedom for videogames must stop
in front of the freedom of sons to live in serenity and without violence",
and those of Mr. Paolo Gentiloni, Minister of Communications, according to
whom "the issues in protecting minors is not limited to television, but must
extend to new media", seem to have been spurred by the videogame "Rule of
Rose".

It is not clear at this point how an "Authority for Violent Videogames"
would be supposed to fare any better than the existing institutions; it is
also not clear whether Mr. Mastella is suggesting the creation of a new
rating system for the videogaming market in Italy - where the European
rating system PEGI, or Pan European Gaming Information, is already in use -
or rather he is proposing the introduction of new tools to control the
circulation of videogames on the basis of existing rating systems.

La Repubblica also quotes Mr. Mastella as adding that "both criminal [law]
intervention and commercial and administrative actions can serve as methods
of deterrence" and that "seizure is possible only when there is the
possibility of a crime such as incitement to commit a crime". La Repubblica
does not report Mr. Mastella explaining in detail how a videogame could
incite to commit a crime, nor the way in which respect of the right to
freedom of expression, as enshrined in art. 21 of the Italian Constitution
would be achieved.

In the same article Mr. Giovanni Maria Pirroni, director of the IIMS, the
Istituto Italiano di Medicina Sociale (Italian Institute of Social
Medicine), is reported as saying that "inhibiting sales of videogames is not
a guarantee, since any kind of content can be downloaded through the
Internet". It is not clear whether this constitutes recognition of the
difficulties that an Authority as proposed by Mr. Mastella would face, or
rather a call for similar regulations to be applied to online as well as to
offline transactions and sales.

This Italian desire for more regulation in the field seems to be finding
listening ears in the European Commission: Franco Frattini, Commissioner for
Justice, Freedom and Security, has recently demanded that the European Union
improve the protection of children against violent videogames. Mr. Frattini
has been quoted as saying that during the meeting of justice ministers,
scheduled for 5 December 2006, he would engage in "a first exchange of views
on this issue with the objective of identifying a possible scope for
complementary, national and European level activities [...] including issues
such as awareness raising, the labelling of such games and the selling to
minors."

7. Logging of IP addresses banned in Germany
============================================================
On 25 January 2006, the District Court of Darmstadt (Germany) ruled that the
German ISP T-Online was legally banned from logging the session IP addresses
it assigned to its customers. German law requires this data to be deleted
upon termination of the connection as it is not needed for billing purposes.
According to the judgement, security requirements do not justify the general
logging of all users' IP addresses. The collection of such data is permitted
only in reaction to specific incidents (faults or unlawful use) on a case by
case basis.

On 28 October 2006 The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof)
dismissed, on formal grounds, the appeal filed by T-Online. The District
Court's ruling has thereby become legally binding between the parties of the
dispute. The legal reasoning of the court applies more generally to all
German ISPs and to all tariff models. A draft complaint for other Germans
willing to sue their ISP was published on the internet. The German Federal
Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar announced that he would take steps
to enforce the ruling in relation to all customers.

The plaintiff Holger Voss was prosecuted in 2003 for supposedly having
endorsed the 9/11 bomb attacks in an Internet forum. Only in court room was
it found that his remarks were clearly of a sarcastic nature. In
consequence, Voss was acquitted. In order to trace Voss' forum post, the
prosecutors had asked the forum provider Heise to hand over the poster's IP
address. Voss' ISP T-Online then told the prosecutor whom the IP address had
been assigned to.

The T-Online case raised voices pointing out that German law also bans web
site providers such as Heise, Amazon and Ebay from logging the IP addresses
of their users. At present such logging is widespread, partly because US
designed software (including open source software) does not take data
protection requirements into account. Data protection expert Patrick Breyer
called for a law mandating commercial software for sale in Europe to be
provided with a standard configuration that conforms to European data
protection requirements.

8. Swiss Big Brother Awards 2006
============================================================
On 16 November 2006, Sudhaus cultural centre of Bble hosted the Swiss Big
Brother Awards ceremony of 2006 organised by Archives de l'Etat Fouineur
Swiss and the EDRI-member Swiss Internet User Group SIUG.

The jury deciding on the winners included 11 people from various
institutions and organizations having acted against control and
surveillance. The winners received concrete trophies, a certificate and were
mentioned on the "Hall of Shame" list.

The trophy for the category "State" was awarded to the Federal Council of
Corpore represented by Christoph Blocher, the head of the Federal Department
of Justice and Police for the application of internal security measures
involving phone tapping, secret search of information systems and
installation of secret microphones in apartments without concrete basis just
under the cover of preventive investigations.

The winner of the "Business" category was the insurance company Assurance
CSS for having given their collaborators large access to their clients' data
that included medical information and even HIV test results.

Other candidates were companies such as Microsoft, Cablecom, Swisscom or
Cridit Suisse as well as many sports clubs and associations and transport
companies who survey their employees and clients.

The "Working Place" category was won by the Dietikon branch of the
Media-Markt chain where the employees were continuously under surveillance
not only at their working place, but even in the rest rooms.

The fourth award for the category "Activity" was received by Hans Wegmuller,
director of SRS (Strategic Information Service), a department created 5
years ago which is actually the military Swiss Intelligence Service, a
service that uses ONYX telecom mass surveillance devices.

Besides the negative awards, a positive "Winkelried" award has been lately
given during BBA ceremonies. This year, the Swiss awarded this to the
Referendum Committee LMIS, made out of groups of sports fans and political
groups that will launch a referendum in Spring against the introduction of
an "anti-hooligan" law.

9. Italian postal codes are again freely accesible
============================================================
At the end of September 2006, after a reorganisation of the postal
codes system (CAP), the Italian Post (Poste Italiane), now a  private
company, as well as the Italian Ministry of Communications have
changed the way in which one could access the postal code online ,
limiting it to just one entry at a time, without the possibility to access
the entire database. A multiple query could be made only by buying a
proprietary software sold by Poste Italiane.

According to the Italian laws, postal codes, together with telephone
numbers, laws and normative acts are public data, but also in the
public domain, and therefore should be publicly available without
restrictions.

Further more, the postal codes, as public information, are collected
and gathered with public money and therefore Poste Italiane cannot
consider itself as the owner of these data and should not condition
the access to a proprietary software that runs only on a single
operating system. Poste Italiane has put out for sale a CD costing 6.9
Euro that can be run only on Windows system. However, also free
software was available for the same purpose, such as Trovocap, a
program allowing the search of postal codes on Linux, Windows and McOS
as well. Caprone, another free software available in Linux and Windows
versions even allowed the arrangement of the postal codes in various
formats.

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) considered that public data
should be universally available without discrimination and drafted
an open letter addressed to the Ministry of Communications asking that
the postal codes list should be available as before. In the meantime,
with the assistance of the Italian FSDE team, it has rebuilt the codes
list from the Poste Italiano site, through a crawler and has made it
publicly available in a SQL format. The list is not entirely complete
yet and those who intend to use it for professional purposes are
advised of this risk.

10. FIPR report on children's databases - likely to harm rather than help
============================================================
The UK Information Commissioner has just published a report on the UK
Government's plans to link up most of the public-sector databases that
contain information on children. The report was written by experts
from the Foundation for Information Policy Research (FIPR), who
conclude that aggregating this data will be both unsafe and illegal.

The report, 'Children's Databases: Safety and Privacy', analyses
databases being built to collate information on children in education,
youth justice, health, social work and elsewhere. Although linking the
databases is supposed to safeguard children, the report's authors
point out that extending Britain's child protection systems - from
the 50,000 children at substantial risk of serious harm to the 3-4
million children with some health, education or other welfare issue -
means that child protection will receive less attention.

The project will also feed information into police systems that try to
identify children likely to offend by scoring various risk factors
(socioeconomic status, medical diagnoses such as hyperactivity, school
conduct reports, and whether the child's father has been in prison).
This carries a serious risk of stigmatising innocent children, and may
also undermine children's and patents' trust in doctors, teachers and
other professionals.

The report's authors also conclude that the systems will intrude so
much into privacy and family life that they will violate European data
protection law and human rights law.
