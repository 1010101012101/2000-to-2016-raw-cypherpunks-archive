So according to this account, for reasons unknown the FBI violated
the most fundamental principles of digital forensics by failing to
make a complete backup of the stored content of the device before
doing anything else with or to it.  Then /also/ quite deliberately
destroyed its evidentiary value by delivering it into the custody
and control of some random idiot.

I find this narrative /very/ difficult to believe:
