Hatch issued a press release yesterday softening his remarks
but not recanting. His statement at the hearing does indeed
raise the national security threat of P2P in which mil and gov
computers using P2P could be attacked by evildoers and grab
nation-threatening information, or damage the machines.

This threat of commingling mil, gov and public users relates to
the recent CIA publication which says the Agency will not use
public networks to gather information in fear that classified
systems will be compromised. Thus, the Agency remains in the
dark about vast amounts of information available to the public,
which in turn likely distorts its intelligence reporting to national
authorities.

It would be wondrous if the Internet gradually turns the spooks
inward to protect their out of date secrets, even more so, such 
that they self-destruct like other historical institutions which
became so obsessed with their secrets they lost touch with
their supporters, indeed came to see their increasingly skeptical
supporters, outsiders, as the principal threats, and so instituted
even more spying among their supporters, meanwhile neglecting
genuine threats more distantly located.

That would fit the DC model of reality, the faith in inside information
no matter how foul just so long as only a few had access to it. Perfect
setup for manipulating the dimbulbs.

Belgium has a good idea to go after war criminals whereever they
hide behind national borders, or as in Congress, legislative
immunity coutured in national security.
