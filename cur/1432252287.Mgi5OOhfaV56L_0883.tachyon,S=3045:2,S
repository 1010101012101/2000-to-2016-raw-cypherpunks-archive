Thanks for the distinction, however it still makes CC folks slaves of
the
State.  Suppose Joe Badcredit finds a blank application and applies?
The State then uses violence to coerce the CC into non-consensual
transactions.

First, no one (but you) mentioned subcultures, which is what TM
typically
referred to (not subraces).

Second, corporations generally welcome anyone with money to buy their
stuff,
even if the corp folks don't condone the culture of the buyers.

Not sure what you mean by 'state corporatism', which sounds like
euphemized
state collectivism.

Freedom is only tested when you find it objectionable.  (And BTW you're
the
one injecting some of Tim's other rants; why?)

Those who use violence against others (deprivation of freedom)
have earned the same.  Especially if its state violence.  Dig?

PS: I saw a bit of news on pills to help people forget.  Eg to help
avoid post traumatic stress.  One of the more objectionable objections
to this was that witnesses might become unreliable.  As if the state had
some
right to force you to remember something.  (And tequila works pretty
well although you need to get inside the consolidation window.)
