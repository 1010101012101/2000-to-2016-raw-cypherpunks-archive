Yeah I've lived in Sydney most of my life.

But this goes back to my original point - despite lots of guns being
quietly hidden around the place, most crimes still don't use them! Which is
not at all an obvious outcome. It implies that most crimes aren't well
planned and premeditated, and that simply making something *inconvenient*
goes a long way toward banning it, even if people have strong incentives to
overcome the inconvenience.

We've seen exactly this with crypto too. Industry grade crypto has existed
for years, but things like PGP being simply *inconvenient* has resulted in
it having virtually no adoption. The big threat to pervasive surveillance
isn't pgp, its companies like apple and whatsapp bringing that technology
to the masses. The UK government only has to outlaw the big players
implementing decent crypto, and 90%+ of communications will still be
visible to surveillance. Even amongst criminals.

We should be worried, but this isn't a play for us.
