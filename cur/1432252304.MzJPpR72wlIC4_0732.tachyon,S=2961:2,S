::Question:: How do I observe/participate in cypherpunks list discussions?

subscription requests consist of a simple text body with the list name
and your email address sent to a special email list manager account.

a subscribe request typically looks like:
"subscribe cypherpunks coderman@gmail.com"
for example.

some popular/common list administration services/hosts are:
majordomo@jfet.org
majordomo@al-qaeda.net
[ maybe majordomo@toad.com ? :P ]

a full example just for clarification:
---begin---
To: majordomo@jfet.org
Subject: subscribe cypherpunks
Body:
subscribe cypherpunks coderman@gmail.com
---end---



::Question:: what can i do to contribute?

anything that would be helpful / interesting to facilitate easier and
most useful conversations via this list:

- more nodes and more contributors, be that code, design or
philosophical tangents of tenuous relation to encryption or privacy.

- a public web based subscription interface for users

- a RSS/Atom/feed based distribution of list contents

- a sister best of / abridged / digest version of list traffic
distributed in daily and monthly digests.

- write secure code to protect your privacy and facilitate trusted
social interactions with your peers and associates.

- SEND ADDITIONAL COMMENTS / SUGGESTIONS TO THIS LIST :)
