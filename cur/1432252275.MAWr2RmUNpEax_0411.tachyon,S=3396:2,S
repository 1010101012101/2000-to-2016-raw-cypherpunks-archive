This implies a pretty easy business model:

      * rent botnet proxies at some cost
      * make google accounts over botnets, farming the captchas out at
        some other cost
      * sell google accounts for bitcoins at cost + other cost + profit
        margin over a tor hidden service
      * profit

You could probably do the account creation on-demand so you had no
inventory buildup, even. If you started getting lots of demand, you
could start pre-registering accounts.

This one's a freebie for anyone on this list with more time than me.

Since I have a Google account, I'd like to say that I will never do
this, as it would be against Google's ToS and as such, criminally
illegal (see
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Lori_Drew>).

Also, nobody else should do this. That would be illegal and therefore
wrong. /fingerwag
