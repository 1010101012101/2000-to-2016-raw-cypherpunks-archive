NSA runs best fab in world
By: Mike Magee
Posted: 03/01/2001 at 13:03 GMT

You might think that AMD's Dresden fab is state-of-the-art technology. You might also suspect that Intel and IBM have some pretty
nifty technology too, lurking in their clean rooms and in their labs.


And you might be right as far as the commercial world goes. But there's a fab, owned by the US government, and run by the National
Security Agency (NSA), which is supposed to knock them into a cocked hat.
