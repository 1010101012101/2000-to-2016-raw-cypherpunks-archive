What's this 'us' bit? Jim, I don't know what 'right wing
extremist hate groups' you may belong to, but don't
confuse such groups with the subscribers to this 
open mailing list, especially to third parties.

This is not a 'group', and includes people from every
part of the political spectrum. About the only thing that
can be said to be in common among subscribers is that
they think that crypto is in some way important.
