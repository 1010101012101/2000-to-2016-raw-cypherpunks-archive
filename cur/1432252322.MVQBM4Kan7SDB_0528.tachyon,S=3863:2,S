X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.1084)

There is some indication that the two journalists killed in Syria were located by their sat phones. While details are elusive and unknown, here are some posts on why and how it's easy to track a sat phone. As @ioerror has repeatedly stated, be afraid. Be very afraid of sat phones in insecure areas. 

This from EFF: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/satphones-syria-and-surveillance  - a good overview 

This from SaferMobile (disclosure: I run the site/edit content) by Anonymous, a contributor to the site who works in the telco industry:  https://safermobile.org/be-afraid-be-very-afraid-of-satellite-phones-in-insecure-locations/  - detail on how location tracking is possible, easy, and cheap

This from David Burgess, fabulous guy and core developer on OpenBTS: http://openbts.blogspot.com/2012/02/some-comments-on-satellite-phones.html - more detail on the technical logistics, nicely complements SaferMobile's post.
