Please describe, how exactly it would be worse. We're kinda curious.

It's a *tiny* *little* bit premature to conclude that, don't you think?
Now your rhetoric does strike me as pro-establishment, if not outright
as a Redmond mole. Kindly go insert your troll stick elsewhere.

Nonsense, my ass. Go ask your nearest friendly biologist and
immunologist/epidemiologist about the value of diversity.

If you don't see that the value of the network increases with its size
what exactly are you doing in that thar Innurnet here? Ah, you just
don't understand this nonlinear metric thing. I see. Just log it, if
it will make you more comfortable.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If it breaks, all will be lost.

Dilute susceptible system with inert (immune) ones. That'll take
care of kinetics (local loop systems are tighly coupled, so there's
a distance even though there's a 95% global connectivity).

Hardly takes a five-sigma egghead to grok it, right?

Disadvantaged? Sure, open source has eaten a few industry branches alive,
and now we've got a monopolist shitting their pants because they know
they can't compete on the middle run. Yawn. Goverments are adopting it,
resulting in fax effect? Good, that will accelerate the inevitable.

Half a decade sounds about right. You'll see a lot more players than
just *BSD derivates in the dominating 2/3rds, though.

Just three systems are not enough diversity by far. Ten would be better.
It'd be nice
to have it run on diversified hardware as well, and offer stack
protection and several iterations of security-conscientous redesign
steps.

However, worse is better, so we'll probably see only a slight improvement
over the status quo. It would sure be nice to see liability for commercial
software products, though.

Bullcrap once again. A fraction of all systems will be taken out, with
a much slower kinetics due to phlegmatizing aspect of dilution (look
up phlegmatization in HE chain reaction context). Moreover, the mission
critical stuff *will* be running hardened systems after a few rounds of
current worm roulette. Everybody else would be taken of circulation.
Let's see how much pressure business need to start adapting rational
strategies instead of the current snakeoil jacuzzi. (Probably, a lot).

I'm distinctly underwhelmed with the logic of the remainder of the
diatribe, so I won't address it.
