Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in

***********************************************************************

Here's How It Works

Unlike many other programs, this three level program is much easier 
and much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate for 
this program is VERY HIGH AND VERY FAST, and you will see results in
two weeks or less!  Just in time for next month's bills! With this NEW 
VERSION, a major objection to participation has been eliminated. NOW 
a BUILT-IN MECHANISM against CHEATING has been introduced!

You only mail out 20 copies (not 200 or more as in other programs).
You should also send them to people who send you their programs 
because they know these programs work and they are already believers 
in the system!

Besides, this program is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER 
RESPONSE RATE!

Even if you are already in a program, stay with it, but do yourself a 
favor and DO THIS ONE as well.  START RIGHT NOW!  It's simple 
and takes a very small investment. It will pay off long before other letters 
or programs even begin to trickle in!

Just give ONE person a $10 gift.  That's all!

Follow the simple instructions and in a few weeks you will have 
THOUSANDS of DOLLARS in your bank account!  Because of the LOW 
INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, this program 
has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! Just one (1) US $10 bill.  That's 
your investment!

***********************************************************************

Follow These Simple Instructions


1) 
E-mail the person on position #4 with the subject header"REMITTANCE 
INQUIRY". In the body of your email, type the information contained in 
position #3.  Then add below the last line the note "Did you receive 
your $10 from the person mentioned above?"


2)  When you have received positive confirmation from the person on 
position #4, then you may proceed as follows: On a blank sheet of paper 
write "Please add me to your mailing list" and "E-mail me to confirm 
your receipt of my $10 remittance".  Write your name and address clearly 
and include your email address for confirmation mailing and courtesy
follow ups.  Fold it around a US $10 and send it to the FIRST name on
the list (#1).

IMPORTANT: Wrap additional paper (black colored paper is ideal) so 
that the $10 inside can not be seen when your letter is held against 
a strong light. This is to prevent thievery! SEND YOUR LETTER VIA 
FIRST CLASS REGISTERED MAIL. Only the first person on the list gets 
your name and a ten dollar gift.


3)  RETYPE only the list.  Move the FIRST (#1)  NAME to the FOURTH 
(#4) position.  Move the SECOND (#2) and THIRD (#3) NAMES UP and 
ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD (#3) position.  NOTE:  Only 
the fourth (#4) name in the original list is dropped.


4)  AFTER you have received the e-mail confirming receipt of your 
remittance (you may make a courtesy follow-up after 1 week if necessary)
SEND out 20 copies of your edited letter.  NOTE: by sending this letter 
via EMAIL, the response time is much faster, and you save the expenses 
of envelopes, stamps, and copying services.  Consider this, MILLIONS of 
people surf the internet everyday, all day, all over the world!

Fifty thousand new people get on the internet every month!  An excellent 
source of names is the people who send you other programs and the 
names listed on the letter they send you.  Your contact source is 
UNLIMITED!

It boggles my mind to think of all the possibilities!  Mail, or should I 
say E-mail, your letter TODAY!  It's so easy.


***********************************************************************

How to EDIT the original letter:

1)  Go to "edit" and select all
2)  Go to "edit" and "copy"
3)  Start (compose) a new Email message
4)  Address your Email and Subject blocks
5)  Go to "edit" and "paste"

After you have pasted this article to your new Email, delete the old 
header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, etc.)  Now you can edit the 
names, addresses and e-mail addresses with ease.

***********************************************************************

THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.  When your name reaches the first 
position in a few weeks, it will be your turn to collect your gifts. The 
gifts will be sent to you by 1,600 to 2,000 people like yourself (average
accomplishment rate is 20 - 25 percent), who are willing to invest US $10 
and a few hours to receive anywhere from US$16,000 to US$20,000 in 
cash. That's all!

I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?

GO AHEAD--TRY IT.  IT'S ONLY US $10!  EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 
6 OR 7 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?  IF YOU TRY IT, 
IT WILL PAY!

Cindy Allen writes:  I ran this gift summation four times last 
year. The first time I received over $14,000 in cash in less than 
two weeks and over $20,000 in cash in the next three times I ran 
it. I can't begin to tell you how great it feels not to have to 
worry about money anymore!  I thank God for the day I received 
this letter!  It has truly changed my life!  Don't be afraid to 
make gifts to strangers--they'll come back to you in ten-fold. So 
let's keep it going and help each other out in these tough and 
uncertain times.

- - - - - - - - CAN I DO IT AGAIN?- - - - - - -
OF COURSE YOU CAN--this plan is structured for everyone to send 
only 20 letters each.  However, you are certainly not limited to 
20. Mail out as many as you can. Every 20 letters you send has an
average return between $16,000 and $20,000. If you can mail forty, 
sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT!

THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT.

Each time you run this program, just follow steps 1 thru 4 and
everyone on your gift list benefits!  Simple enough?  You bet it 
is! Besides, there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), 
and trips to the printer or copier, and you can do it again and 
again with your regular groups or gifters, or start up a new group.

Why not?  It beats working!  Each time you receive an MLM offer, 
respond with this letter! Your name will climb to the number one 
position at dizzying rates.

Follow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE PLAY FAIR.

That's the key to this program's success.  Your name must run the 
full gamut on the list to produce the end results.  Sneaking your 
name higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the results you think. 
The BUILT-IN MECHANISM against cheating will FRUSTRATE the 
cheaters!  So please, play by the rules and the $$$ will come to you!

$$$$$$$ Together we will prosper! $$$$$$$
