It is a tree. I'll give you a hint.  Think of this:

"God is like an infinite sphere, whose center is everywhere and 
circumference nowhere."  Nicholas of Cusa.


It is a tree, but to see it, you'll need to find the root.  The quote above 
is a hint to where the root is.  Replace god with internet, sphere with 
tree, infinite with 2**32 (at least until it goes to ip6.)

So where's the root?  Scroll down for the answer.

Did you see it?  No??? It's actually right infront of you.


Still don't know?  Ok then, keep scrolling down.































The root of the internet is your own internet connection.  Proof: If you 
were to iterate traceroutes over the entire ip4 space (good luck doing that 
by the way), and graph the results, you'd get a tree.  It's root is your 
default gateway.
