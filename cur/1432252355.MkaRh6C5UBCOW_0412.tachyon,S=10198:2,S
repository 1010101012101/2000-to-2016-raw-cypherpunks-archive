This was discussed at Crypto last year - it was a pretty cool result.
Basically it uses "computing on encrypted instances" technology. A
filter site runs (potentially) open-source software which is looking
for certain key words and saving messages that match; but the site
can't tell which exact words are being searched for, and it can't tell
when they get matched.

However it's not quite as amazing as it sounds. There is a long list
of all possible words, that are stored in the clear. Then there is an
encrypted bit mask that tells which of these words the security agency
is searching for. The open software compares each message against each
word and creates a bit mask of which ones match. Then it does some
fancy crypto to compare this bit mask with the encrypted one, and
compute an encrypted 1 or 0 as to whether the message matched one of
the words of interest. It then multiplies this encrypted 1 or 0 by the
message, getting either an encryption of the message or zero, and adds
this into an encrypted buffer. More tricks are used to keep messages
from overwriting each other in the buffer, given that the filter
software doesn't know when it is writing meaningful data or just an
encrypted zero.

All in all it was a clever idea but suffered from two problems. The
first is that it would be computationally expensive; each operation
requires a lot of exponentiations. And the second is that the word
list is public, so even though you don't know exactly which words from
the list are of interest, you (and the bad guys) would be able to see
all the words they might be searching for, which could be a security
leak.
