That war was won (or lost, depending on how you look at it) by the inherent 
failures of communism itself, not because the US Government was some kind of 
champion of freedom. As I've gone to pains to point out, I think a good 
(though not unassailable case) can be made showing that the US probably 
slowed down free market development in certain places. Hell--East Asian 
communism might rightfully be blamed on the outcome of World War I and the 
need to create some kind of anti-western hegemony.

A libertarian might possibly look at the US Government and it's legions of 
"Conservatives" as being a sort of tag-along (at best) or leech, grabbing a 
ride on the back of certain industries and (of course) "championing them" 
against other technologies (eg, defense, oil, autos...). Of course, neocons 
will turn red at the notion that they promote a very strong form of 
government intervention into private industry...

As for...

Don't count it. Capitalism, like communism, will likely take on it's own 
particularly Chinese flavor when hitting the high Refractive Index of that 
culture. China's population will near 1.5 Billion before it starts to shrink 
again, so don't look for real estate to be a perpetual contract for a 
century or two, if ever. Private Property in general (outside of real 
estate) has of course existed in China for decades now.
