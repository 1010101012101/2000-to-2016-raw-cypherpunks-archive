hi,

Anyone likes to comment on this? Forwarded text below.

Sarad.

"The new PGP Desktop 9 is showing some weird
behaviour. 

Even when all intercepting services are turned off, it
will continue listening on port 33333. Every program
that wants to connect to the internet will try to
connect through that port first. 

It seems weird and unnecessary to me, especially since
its a known trojan port. Haven't looked into it any
further, due to lack of time. (this is the purchased
pro edition). 

Andrew"
