Maybe yes, maybe no, but why not carry both then?  A legal knife and a
illegal (misdemeanor) gun rather than just your illegal (felony) knife?

Actually they were previously banned in California (at the time you were
carrying it) as dirks, or daggers.  Since then the legal definitions have
change and a push dagger, open worn is just dandy.  Which only goes to
support my point that one should know which laws one is obeying (or not).
Obviously, you have wised up on this issue because you are now quoting
chapter and verse:

Whoa, I'd like to see a citation on that one.  What really usually happens
in California is that the cops "confiscate" the gun and cut the detainee
loose.  Why?  Hey, a free gun is a free gun.  And they are particularly
useful to loan to guys you shoot who forgot to bring their own.  :'D

I did.  It only takes one.

You didn't teleport there Tim; quit quibbling.

If you want to please the cops, then carry a concealed folder.  Perfectly
legal under most circumstances.  Remember, that's what I was arguing
about--knowing the laws you are obeying (or not).

Good.  I'm glad to see you are now thinking about the legal issues that you
previously eschewed.

Assuming facts not in evidence.  I am not, nor did I complain about your
carrying of an illegal (then) knife.  I tried to tell you that it could get
you into trouble--unnecessarily--when there were better options available.
Your full response was, "I don't care what the law says, I'll do what I
want."

Since you have apparently decided to care what the law says, I have no
current beef.  What annoyed me way back when was your militant ignorance.
If you are ready to put that aside and listen to what Unicorn and others
tell you about your potential legal exposure, more power to you.

Tim, are you on crack or what?  Where do you come off suggesting that I have
brought you to the attention of the cops?  Check the archives of what you
have written and then tell me with a straight face that, but for my
reference to an incident years past, the cops would not have any attention
directed towards you.
