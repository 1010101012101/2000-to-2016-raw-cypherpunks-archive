Journalists have no special rights. None. They are simply those who 
are (usually) paid for their words. This does not exempt them from 
any laws. The First Amendment does not confer special rights to 
writers; in fact, it says that government may not create such 
distinctions by "approving" certain journalists.

A journalist who buys pot or coke for a story on drug abuse is as 
vulnerable to the drug laws as any other person (including cops, by 
the way) who buy drugs.

A journalist who buys stolen material for a story or expose is as 
vulnerable to the laws as anyone else.

A journalist called to testify in court is not immune from answering 
questions that any other person would be required to answer.

We are all journalists. I am a journalist, my brother is a 
journalist, that girl over there is a journalist. Some of us get paid 
for our work, some are trying to get paid, some are donating their 
efforts, some use the Net to publish their works.

The whole machinery of the "shield laws" is about trying to gain 
guild status, or official recognition, that certain journalists are 
exempt from laws affecting the rest of the proles. This is 
wrongheaded and violates the First Amendment of the Constitution of 
the United States.

And, yes, a journalist who downloads or possesses certain images is 
just as vulnerable to laws as any of us is.

As to whether he "has the right to tell his story to a jury," I think 
a judge can instruct a jury that a "reporter doing his research" line 
of reasoning is not legally permissable.

(Judges are responsible for ensuring that bogus legal arguments are 
not given to juries with finite time to consider such arguments and 
finite knowledge of the law.)
