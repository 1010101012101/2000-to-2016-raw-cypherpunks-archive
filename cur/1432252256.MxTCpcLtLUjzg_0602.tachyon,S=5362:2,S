Thank you for e-mailing me.  I appreciate hearing from you and value your
input in developing sound, common-sense policies that benefit working
families and businesses in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.

I have closed this e-mail account and opened up a new one to better serve my
constituents.  Please e-mail me at my new account, which is directly
accessible at www.house.gov/writerep.  

I hope you will continue to inform me of your legislative concerns.  Please
don't hesitate to contact me or my staff at (925) 932-8899 or (202) 225-1880
if we can be of further assistance.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ellen O. Tauscher
