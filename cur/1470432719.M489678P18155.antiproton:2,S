I'm just explaining what Hensen et al. (2015)
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05949> reported. Read the damn paper if you
don't like my explanation. But read
<http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2464> first ;)

The problem with classical mechanics is that it's not consistent with
measurements. Quantum mechanics is. The equations. According to the
Copenhagen interpretation, only the math matters. I don't like it any
more than you seem to. Because I'm not a mathematician.

But many worlds is very cool :) Read Stephenson's _Anathem_.

You must be a local realist ;)
