Six discrete (ISA and PCI) sound cards manufactured before 2008, plus
generic "intel-hda" and "usbaudio" profiles.

That might cover as much as 20% of systems shipped in 2013.

Also, AFAICS the .ctl files do not contain the Q, R, B, and K values
computed in sections 12.1 - 12.8.  There are sample values for a few
(circa 2005) devices in table 4.

The turbid.tgz download is unversioned and unsigned.  Something between
60% and 90% of PCs sold today are not covered, since only one device
that's included is still on the market (intel-hda).

The Turbid paper seems focused on generating a few KiB/sec of
physical randomness, continuously.  The actual problem facing users
today is getting 100 bits of randomness, *ever*, to seed urandom.

This seems like a classic example of engineering building a system
that's far beyond spec for the problem it's actually supposed to solve,
and incapable of adressing the actual problem due to overengineered
complexity.

Turbid fails the first rule:  build systems for people to actually use.
