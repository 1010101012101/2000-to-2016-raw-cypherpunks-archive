Well, I haven't ruled out the possibility that governments will somehow 
evolve to roll with the punches. Some new form of government may arise that 
has characteristics we haven't seen before, or perhaps similar to some of 
the Sci-Fi out there. (Wasn't it in Snow Crash where Stevens pictures 
traditional governments basically in competition with numerous franchise 
governments?)

For a long time now I've been very sceptical of any predictions of the 
future for more than 5 years or so out. Technology and society have a way of 
generating stuff that's beyond an individual's ability to predict, and 
government might be the same.

Or not.
