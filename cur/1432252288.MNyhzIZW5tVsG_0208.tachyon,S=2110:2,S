"The Internet in the year 2010 will be fully anonymous and encrypted. In the parallel world there will be no way to ensure security and order. Even today we only find those that are lazy or stupid. In the future there wont be one Internet, but many small, closed, private networks that are concealed and defended against any intrustion from authorities. Anyone thinking about defending privacy in cyberspace effectively supports criminals and terrorists."

--  Harald Lemke, Assistant Secretary, Hessian Ministry of the Interior
