How about Pond as email replacement?

I'm curious what you (and others here) think about Keybase, which also
seems heavily targeted at normal users. There was some discussion here
in mid 2014, but Keybase has been tweaked a lot since then. I'm quite
impressed with its usability, but I don't have the expertise to properly
evaluate its security. I am uncomfortable with the option of uploading
private GnuPG keys, and counting on symmetric encryption for securing
them. Better I think would be helping users understand how to properly
migrate keys between devices, or perhaps to use smartcards.
