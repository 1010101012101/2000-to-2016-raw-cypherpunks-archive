It is reasonable to guess that if two people have shown signs of
contamination, those two people are the ones who handled the stuff. A
receives the package/envelope, handles it while sorting, picks nose. B
opens package gets heavy dose on hands and hence keyboard, enough is
around for him to inhale it. Terrorists overestimated ease of
distribution and had some misconceptions about risk of contagiousness -
they may have thought mailing it to one guy would infect the whole
workplace. Lack of positive tests on other locations/mail : xlow
concentrations, things thrown in trash over past week.
