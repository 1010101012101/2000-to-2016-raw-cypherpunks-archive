November 2001: Hush Communications are pleased to introduce HushMail
Professional(tm), for Outlook 2000, the latest addition to its suite of easy
to use secure solutions.

HushMail Professional is a secure desktop solution that offers maximum
strength security (2048 bit), easy-to-use functionality including digital
signature facility, and other exciting features without the user having to
change their existing email provider.

Whether communicating a private opinion, business critical data, or a
negotiating strategy, the HushMail Professional user is able to send
encrypted email to any Hush user in the world, as well as digitally signed
email to anyone with a valid email address. With HushMail Professional users
can communicate in confidence, knowing that our state-of-the-art encryption
engine is protecting and authenticating the data.

Furthermore, HushMail Professional is just one of the solutions Hush
Communications offer with OpenPGP compliancy.  Using HushMail Professional
in conjunction with HushTools (www.hushtools.com) users can now communicate
securely with PGP and other member company applications, creating a
universal interoperable platform for secure digital technologies. PGP is the
most widely used email security protocol and this new version opens up
HushMail Professional users to an estimated 8 million PGP users worldwide.

Support for OpenPGP marks a major breakthrough in widening the appeal and
usability of Hush solutions, as it has achieved interoperability for
personal privacy and business security.

Overview:
The explosive growth in e-commerce has created a battleground for secure
digital communications solutions, offering a multitude of products and
services. PKI is the only technology that provides for all critical network
security needs. These are authentication, confidentiality, data integrity,
non-repudiation, flexibility, and scalability. However, to many users, PKI
solutions are difficult to use and complex to implement. In addition, most
PKI products are not interoperable and this problem needed to be addressed
before secure services can be widely accepted. Digital organizations need to
have a common PKI system, since the various systems cannot communicate with
each other.

Hush Communications, a leading provider of managed security services and
encryption technology, is committed to the development of the Internet as a
safe and trusted business channel by delivering security technologies that
overcome interoperability problems.

In addition to HushMail Professional for Outlook 2000, other offerings
include solutions for small businesses, large enterprises, data storage
security, a Web-based tool kit for communications and a software development
kit that enables companies and developers to integrate seamless encryption
into their own business applications. Hush Communications are inviting
interested parties to review HushMail Professional immediately.

Interviews by phone or by appointment are welcomed.

Phil Zimmermann, one of the world's leading encryption experts, joined Hush
as chief cryptographer. His appointment strengthened efforts to establish
Hush as the de facto global standard of encrypted email. Zimmermann is
regarded as one of the fathers of modern encryption having created PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy), a premier email encryption program and currently one
of the world's leading encryption standards.

Phil is available to discuss the new product, our solutions range and other
issues such as:

7	The Open PGP Alliance.
7	Interoperability - the issues.
7	PKI - how it works and how it is used.
7	Creating a de facto standard for secure messaging.
7	Securing the Internet - reality or pipe dream?
7	Digital Signatures and legislation.
7	Hush Communications products and services line.
7	Outsourcing PKI.

Hush is a founding member of the OpenPGP Alliance (www.openpgp.org/), an
organization dedicated to promoting compatibility among private electronic
communications systems. The company's solutions are patented and are bought
by companies in the financial, medical, and legal markets, among others.

We welcome all inquiries and review requests and we look forward to hearing
from you.
