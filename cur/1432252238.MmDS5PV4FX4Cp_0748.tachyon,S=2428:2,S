Quite simply, because there are many other ways to perform effective 
intelligence work without requiring key escrow.

A few relevant points:
1. It would be hard for the government to force people to use their key
escrowed system.

2. With whom you communicate is often more interesting that what you
communicate.

3. Humans are bad at storing cryptographic keys. They tend to write them
down somewhere, exposing them to various attacks (sneak and peek
warrant, installation of covert camera, keylogger, TEMPEST).

4. Cryptography is very, very rarely the weakest point of a system.
