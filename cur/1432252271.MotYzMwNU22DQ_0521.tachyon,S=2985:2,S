I notice this bullet point in there:

"U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft calls on Congress to amend federal 
laws so that people convicted of helping terrorists would receive 
sentences similar to convicted spies."

How might this apply to people hosting crypto code on their webservers, 
or running remailers or mojonation and freenet nodes?

Scary.
