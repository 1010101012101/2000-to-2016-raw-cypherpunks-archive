Ever since I heard that manufacturers were cleaning assembled boards with
soap and water I have wondered just how much you need to protect electronic
circuits from water.  You obviously don't want to allow them to stay damp
so they corrode, but immersion for a time (up to weeks) followed by a fresh
water rinse and drying might not be so bad.  Do any hardware experts have
an opinion?

Cheers - Bill
