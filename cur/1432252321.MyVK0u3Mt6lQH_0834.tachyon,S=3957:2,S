market and sell "LoveMagic(TM), their new a|| n@tura| herba| pr0duct to 
the booming herbal supplement market. "LoveMagic(TM) is anticipated to 
hit the market in 2 weeks. 

"LoveMagic" is a proprietary formulation of natural ingredients known

In compliance with FDA regulations, Gulf Biomedical has informed the 
Food and D r u g Administration of its intent to introduce and market the 
product, and has submitted its proposed label for FDA approval. 

The new product is the second in the projected "Magic" line. The first 
was "HairMagic(TM)," a proprietary formulation of ingredients known to 
help restore scalp health and help re-gr0w h@ir, with no known side 
effects experienced as compared with chemical pharmaceutical drugs such as 
Min0xidil. 

"HairMagic" is in its third week of medical trials to support anecdotal 
evidence of the effectiveness of the product. That evidence involved 
the 100% success rate of the product re-growing hair on 70 early users of 
the herbal supplement. 

"HairMagic," which takes a unique "dual approach" to h@ir |0ss, has 
been creating a stir among interested distributors in the US, Australia, 
Argentina and Europe. The company cites evidence that certain bodily 
deficiencies are a major cause of h@ir l0ss. The product addresses these 
deficiencies and restores the health of the user, with the restoration 
of hair growth. 

Meanwhile, development proceeds on a third proprietary product which is 
designed to fight depression and restore an optimistic outlook in 
users. Currently there are millions of individuals within the United States 
who experience depression. The anti-depression product will be the 
third of six which the company hopes to have on the market by early 2006.
