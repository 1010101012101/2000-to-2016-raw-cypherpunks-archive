Been there, done that, have the law degree on my wall to prove it.  My views on
contract law could conceivably be incorrect, but they are not uninformed.

How do you know?  It was never litigated.  I have an opinion on what the

than you can prove yours.

By the way, thanks for the good reporting on the Bell trial.  I have found it a
fascinating if dismaying read, and I appreciate the effort you've put into it.
