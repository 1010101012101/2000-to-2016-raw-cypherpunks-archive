He probably did, along the lines of Sir, it didn't work.

Personally, I think we should INCREASE crypto over this.  Put a crypto 
imbedded radio in the planes control electronics, with the key known only 
to the FAA, and existing only for that flight.  If there are flight 
problems, hit a switch from the tower and take over the plane from the 
ground.  Either instruct the autopilot to land at a pre-determined 
contingency location, fly it by remote from a simulator, or blow it up 
before it can be used as a battering ram.  The former two useful for 
on-flight emergencies too, such as an unconsious pilot.  Something else to 
consider.  Knockout gas in the passenger compartment and a solid door 
between passenger compartment and cockpit.

Also, why are we putting so many clerks in a handful of offices 
anyway?  Isn't this supposed to be the age of the paperless office?

Shoot, this time next week, 3-inch pocket knives are going to be on the 
proscribed list for commercial flights, when the opposite should be true.
