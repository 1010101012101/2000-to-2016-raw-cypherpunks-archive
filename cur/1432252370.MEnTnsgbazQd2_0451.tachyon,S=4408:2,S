The Energy Department stopped access to some of its Web sites containing

nuclear site information, citing concern over unusually heavy traffic.

The Department of Energy (news - web sites) has shut down
access to some of its public Web sites, citing concern over
unusually heavy traffic to online information about U.S.
nuclear sites.

Federal officials shut down the sites on Monday to try to
protect information that had been available to the public but
could be used by terrorists to launch an attack on U.S. nuclear
facilities.
