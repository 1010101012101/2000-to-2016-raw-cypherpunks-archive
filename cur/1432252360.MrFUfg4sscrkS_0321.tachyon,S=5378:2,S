SOMERSET, N.J. -- More than 75 percent of survey respondents believe that 
browser-based SSL (secure sockets layer) VPN (virtual private network) 
technology is “somewhat” to “highly” likely to replace IPSec-based VPNs for 
remote access to enterprise resources over the next two years, according to 
the latest survey on enterprise network security trends from The Tolly 
Group, a premier IT testing and consulting firm. Netilla® Networks, Inc., a 
leading provider of SSL VPN solutions for secure Web-based access to any 
corporate application, co-sponsored the survey along with Check Point 
Software, Nortel Networks, Ingrian Networks and Enterasys Networks.

Survey respondents also projected that the most likely future uses for SSL 
VPNs will be for securing Web services (67 percent), followed by securing 
extranets and e-business services (54 percent), providing remote access for 
business partners (50 percent) and enabling remote access by mobile and 
teleworking employees (48 percent).

SSL-based VPN appliances use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption 
engineered into today’s Web browsers to provide simple, browser-based remote 
access to centrally hosted corporate applications. Unlike traditional remote 
access solutions based on the IPSec standard, SSL-based VPNs do not require 
application or VPN client software to be configured and maintained on remote 
PCs, which reduces IT support costs while increasing usability.

“Overall, respondents demonstrated a significant surge in the usage of 
SSL-based VPNs,” said Kevin Tolly, president and chief executive officer of 
The Tolly Group. “Just two years ago, SSL VPNs were nowhere on the map, but 
now interest in the technology is starting to mature. However, these same 
users also cited a lack of general understanding on how to deploy SSL VPNs 
as a potential roadblock. Vendors must step up SSL education to help users 
better understand the benefits of this technology.”
