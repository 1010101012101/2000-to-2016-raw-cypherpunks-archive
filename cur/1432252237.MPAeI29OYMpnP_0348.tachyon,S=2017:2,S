The Hague has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in the past 
due to the "Henry Kissinger" clause insisted upon by the US. 
Saddam's guilt in a smaller number of deaths is being pushed 
hard to justify the exercise in the Mid-East so the outcome is 
certain and will be dressed appropriately I'm sure. My guess is 
that a suitable Iraqi court won't take note of the number of 
civilian deaths due to bombings and economic sanctions by its liberators.
