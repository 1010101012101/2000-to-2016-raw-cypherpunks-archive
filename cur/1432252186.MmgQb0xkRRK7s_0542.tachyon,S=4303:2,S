Really-From - Well Known Cypherpunk

I'd be happy to be wrong here, but the bet ain't over till the
fat lady ships the books.  Amazon's promised to accept orders before,
and while we're closer to the promised "this time for sure" date

Meanwhile, if you want to see articles by Tim May, Dorothy Denning,
Duncan Frissell, Hakim Bey, Eric Hughes, and Other Well-Known Cypherpunks and fellow-travelers in print, there's an interesting collection
