Greetings!

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving 
information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please 
accept my most sincere apology. To remove your email from this list please hit 
reply and place "REMOVE" in the subject line and this will be done instantly. 
Please accept my sincere apology if by receiving this email offends you in any 
way at all.


If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, 
then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever 
landed in your Inbox.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their 
fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning 
that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell 
you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through 
the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something 
so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 


I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will 
call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. 
Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type "Send 
Info" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 
24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 
John Doe

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, 
financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that 
you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!
