#    "This was leading up to the Columbine time," Young said, referring to
#    April 20, the two-year anniversary of the Colorado shooting. "So any
#    type of rumor, any kinds of threats of joking, jestering or kidding, we
#    were following up on. This was one of those cases. If the kid makes any
#    type of threat with a weapon, and he has access, whether (it) belongs to
#    the parent in the home or not, they are automatically takeninto
#    custody."
#    
#    School police also found in Joseph K.'s locker and backpack more
#    "evidence:" a class report he'd been writing about the Holocaust, he'd
#    written for another class, answering the question: What's the biggest
#    problem facing schools today? Joseph K.'s essay focused on school
#    violence.

#                 KANGAROO COURT
#    
#    During a family court hearing the next day, Joseph K. and his
#    grandparents were only told that the teen was being charged with
#    "harassment." They received no paperwork detailing what prompted  the
#    charges: They weren't even allowed to have a copy of the paper that
#    listed "harassment" as the charge.

Sorry about any dup emails, that'll be fixed soon.
