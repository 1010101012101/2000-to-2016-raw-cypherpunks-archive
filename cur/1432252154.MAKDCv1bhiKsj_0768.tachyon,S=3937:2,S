No need to wait at all.  There was never any serious reason to license the 
Chaum blinding patents upon which eCash rested. They applied only to the 
client and their use was or could be made invisible to the mint. Software 
patents, including Chaum's, are not enforceable in a number of western 
nations (e.g., Australia, South Africa and New Zealand). Therefore, the 
development and release of client software with user selectable blinding, 
with appropriate UI warnings regarding possible patent issues depending 
upon client jurisdiction, from these locales should not run afoul of 
international patent laws.
