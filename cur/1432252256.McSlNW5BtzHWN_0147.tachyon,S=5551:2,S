I don't know why Tim makes me out to be such a bitch. I'm pro-crypto and
pro-privacy.

Anonymity and encryption can assist with intelligence collection efforts,
and grease new intelligence flows. An OSINT "Intellagora," a WhiteHat
BlackNet, is zero-risk/zero-contact, and might assist in counterterrorism
intelligence collection -- there are arguments it's built for it (Steele).
It's technical, but it is a HUMINT solution. Such a solution could be used
not only for intelligence collection, but also for intervention. Another
prime example is in regard to "cyberterrorism," where companies have shown
great reluctance to share information with the government.

They are complaining about a lack of human intelligence, and the difficulty
of penetration. There are strong arguments that crypto can assist the
government in combating the very threat they complain of, and surmount
obstacles to intelligence collection and analysis. (And, as many here have
stated, legal prohibitions are only effective on law-abiders.)

Like THIS.....this was a natural response. Kudos.

SAN DIEGO, September 12, 2001 - Anyone with information pertaining to
Tuesday's terrorist attacks who wishes to communicate anonymously
with U.S. authorities can use an Anonymous Tip Web Link now located
