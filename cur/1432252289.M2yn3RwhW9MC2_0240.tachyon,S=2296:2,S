It seems intuitively like the EDR ought to be about as valuable to the 
defense as the prosecution, right?  E.g., the prosecutor says "this guy was 
driving 120 miles an hour down the road while being pursued by the police," 
but the EDR says he'd never topped 70.  There are creepy privacy 
implications in there somewhere, but the basic technology seems no more 
inherently Orwellian than, say, DNA testing--which seems to be a pretty 
good way of actually locking up the right guy now and then, rather than 
someone who looks kind-of like the guy who did it, and was seen in the area 
by an eyewitness and picked out of a police lineup.
