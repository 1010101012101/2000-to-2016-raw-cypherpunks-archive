I don't recommend this method, because converting most pdfs into
images will cause loss of text. You can delete entire pages in the pdf
format by deleting the "stream" objects and modifying the xref table.

Most text in a pdf document is "semantic", surrounded by pdf markup
that can be directly deleted. I can imagine there might be one or two
cases where publishers are adding an image to a pdf with your ip
address, in which case you can delete that single image. However, if
the page content is an image itself (no selectable text), then they
might have chosen to add the image into the page, in which case the
only way to remove the watermark would be to use imagemagick as you
say, and draw over the offending image. So far I haven't seen this yet
in any of the documents I have read over the years.

right..

How would you whitelist content you've never seen before?
