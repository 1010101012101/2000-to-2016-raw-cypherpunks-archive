As predicted so many years ago, America is now racing faster than its 
feet can carry it toward being a  high-tech police state. Polls are 
being taken, Congresscriminals are proposing new draconian laws, and 
courts have yet to be heard from (will require a few dozen court cases 
before they are heard from).

Unencumbered by any Bill of Rights or true Constitution, the Brits are 
way ahead of us. Arrest on suspicion, detainment without charge, 
outlawing of entire classes of organizations.

The U.S restrictions shutting down various alleged terrorist groups 
would seem to be a slam dunk First Amendment violation. Freedom of 
association means freedom from government shutdown. Freedom to join an 
anti-ZOG group, for example.

Reading the Bill of Rights aloud is now a terrorist act.
