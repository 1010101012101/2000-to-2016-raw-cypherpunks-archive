> The evolution of cooperation among nonrelated individuals is one of
the fundamental problems in biology and social sciences.
> Reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are
not repeated often enough or groups are too large. Punishment
> and reward can be very effective but require that defectors can be
traced and identified. Here we present a simple but effective
> mechanism operating under full anonymity. Optional participation can
foil exploiters and overcome the social dilemma. In
> voluntary public goods interactions, cooperators and defectors will
coexist. We show that this result holds under very diverse
> assumptions on population structure and adaptation mechanisms, leading
usually not to an equilibrium but to an unending cycle of
> adjustments (a Red Queen type of evolution). Thus, voluntary
participation offers an escape hatch out of some social traps.
> Cooperation can subsist in sizable groups even if interactions are not
repeated, defectors remain anonymous, players have no
> memory, and assortment is purely random.
