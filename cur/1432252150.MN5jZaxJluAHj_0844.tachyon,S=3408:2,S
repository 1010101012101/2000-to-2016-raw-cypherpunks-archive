Aside from the deep moral and constitutional problems it poses, does  
anyone think the US Govt could have that even from a practical perspective?

* Some of the largest supercomputers in the world are botnets or are held 
by strategic competitor countries. This precludes the old key shortening 
trick.

* The Sony PS3 and HDMI cases show just how hard it can be to keep a  
master key secure sometimes. Master keys could be quite well protected,  
but from a policy perspective it's still a gamble that something won't go 
wrong which compromises everyone's real security (cause a public scandal, 
expose industrial secrets, etc.).

* Am I correct in thinking that computing additional trapdoor functions to 
enable USG/TLA/LEA decryption is not free? Mobile devices are becoming the 
primary computing devices for many. People may be willing to pay XX% in 
taxes, but nobody wants to pay a decrease in performance and battery life 
to enable such a misfeature.
