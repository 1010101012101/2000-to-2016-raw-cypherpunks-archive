of course.  it's also expensive, relative to other options. i'm saying
NSA spends money carefully.

never said either thing.  i'm also long on the record advocating for
the next generation of low latency anonymous networking that _does_
provide strong defense against traffic analysis.  turns out the
details are, um..  complicated ;)

i'm glad that is not, in fact, my reasoning.

of course there are more sophisticated means available to them; that
will always be the case.  they've got BILLIONS and BILLIONS every
year, for their projects.

the point is not making something "NSA proof", which is an ill defined
and open ended venture.  the point is increasing the cost of their
efforts and narrowing their scope.

the more money they spend getting less and less in return, the better!
