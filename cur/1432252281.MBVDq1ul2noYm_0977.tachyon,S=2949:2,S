I'd heard stories of collapsed dot-coms' keys being auctioned off, that being
the only thing of value the company had left.  It makes the title of Matthias'
paper even more appropriate.

(However, I do think that anyone wanting to compromise your security will use
 this morning's MSIE hole to do it rather than buying a CA key.  OTOH it'd be a
 great universal skeleton key for government agencies charged with protecting
 the world from equestrians).
