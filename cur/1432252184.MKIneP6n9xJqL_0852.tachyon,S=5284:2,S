I think this is the central key problem.

To establish any medium of exchange, one faces an enormous
critical mass problem, as the stupendous expenditures by
paypal and its competitors demonstrate.

One also faces legal obstacles, due to both money laundering
laws,and the fact that the banks everywhere have a government
enforced cartel.

Finally, one enormous factor that we all failed to appreciate
-- habit and trust.  Note the curious success of e-gold,
presumably because of the mystique of gold and the mystique
of full reserve banking.   This enormous obstacle means that
people will pick up very slowly on digital currencies.  Thus
paypal and arguably e-gold have both achieved critical mass,
but, contrary to our expectations, this has not led to
explosive growth.

I am unaware of any micropayment scheme that made it
convenient, private, and safe, to buy images by the image and
video by the minute.  Indeed digicash seemed to attempt to
specifically prohibit such use of their technology.   A
number of schemes were floated that would have and should
have made such capability available but I am unaware of any
of them that actually worked.  All seemed to focus on
uncontroversial -- and thus unsaleable -- content.

Again, the 911 laws would not prohibit a micropayment program
-- dirty pictures by the nickel, and large payment programs
have always been illegal.  Any attempt to deliver a large
payment program would always have had to have been haven
based.

Yes.
