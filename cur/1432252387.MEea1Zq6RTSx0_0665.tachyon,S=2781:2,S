Just wait 'till they integrate GPS, and GPRS or 802.11.  Much of this
can be seem in the OnStar systems, which haven't yet featured in

You can call up and find out where your car is.

PS: Bob Blakely once defined privacy as the right to lie and get away
with it, which fits into some of what many people mean by privacy.
