Well, I never use "Cypherpunks" to mean anything other than "those
presently subscribed to the list."  It's just shorter to type.

It's much like saying that some.newsgroup needs to stop gratuitous
crossposting.  It is not implied by that statement that some.newsgroup is
a collective entity defined by anything more than readership, or that
everyone in some.newsgroup is engaging in the problematical behavior.

Fine, change the motto to "Cypherpunks anonymously write code."
