I never liked Joe Nacchio, back when he and I used to work for the 
same company.
I didn't know him personally (he was probably a VP by then, in a 
different organization);
he was an aggressive sales guy who liked to brag about his Porsche.
But he was also insightful about the state of the business even in the mid-80s,
and anybody in 2000-2001 who didn't have a clue that the telcos were in for a
world of trouble had no business running one.

He might have had more specific knowledge
about the specific troubles Qwest was having, but besides the overall 
crash that
the DotCom boom was going through, the telcos had just done a huge round of
overbuilding on fiber, there was a glut of the stuff because everybody
was doing it, and DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing) meant that
you had to pour a huge amount of new capital into optical hardware on 
the endpoints
just to keep up with the Joneses, because the price per bit-mile of the
actual fiber you had in the ground was dropping rapidly.
