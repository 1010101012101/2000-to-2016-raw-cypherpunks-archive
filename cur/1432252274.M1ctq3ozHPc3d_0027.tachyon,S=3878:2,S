does it matter?

the point is that almost everyone even here is not willing to go to jail
or worse for "another tiny bit of privacy". we don't draw a sharp
boundary. we don't say, for example, that knowing my street is ok, but
knowing my house number is over the line.
and the total population is even worse. the vast majority of internet
users would give you pretty much anything for a minimal return ("one
hour free surfing"), and everything else for a larger one ("$100 for my
political and sexual preferences? sure.")

the muslim veil, on the other hand, IS a sharp boundary. as I understand
it, it is NOT permisable to lift it in public under ANY circumstances.

rounding that up, I'd guess that if we were religious about our privacy,
things may be different (possibly just more ugly, but who knows).
