>From the article:

"ZeoSync said its scientific team had succeeded on a small scale in
 compressing random information sequences in such a way as to allow the
 same data to be compressed more than 100 times over -- with no data
 loss."

Now of course it's possible they were horribly misquoted.  Still, it is
worrisome that so many people quoted in the article think such algorithmic
gymnastics are mathematically possible.
