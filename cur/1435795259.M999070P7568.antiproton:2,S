The Intercept doesn't sign Snowden files, just posts them on DocumentCloud.
Best would be for Snowden to sign them if to be signed, journalists do not
have capability to do it, and most could care less except to blow smoke
about certification. Their lawyers advise to not certify anything leaked to
them, too risky.

Same procedure by all the journalist-publisher users of DocumentCloud; it
is restricted to journalists-publishers, whom it is well known are quite slack
about comsec, infosec and their customers's privacy in order maximize
profitability of user data for advertizers.

DocumentCloud, now hosting over 700,000 documents of millilons of
pages, is rather easily penetrated and tampered with, but that's to be
expected of anything hosted on the cloud which has the world's worst
security. Worser: logs of accesses are kept and shared to authorities.

Cloud may be the most grievously harmer of privacy today, soon to be
surpassed by the IoT to exploit user's gullibility with promises of oh so
popular faulty security measures and irresponsibly shady privacy policies.
