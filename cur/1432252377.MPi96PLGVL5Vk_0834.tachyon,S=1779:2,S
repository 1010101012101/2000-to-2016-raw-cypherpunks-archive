Could your political beliefs determine how long you live? New research from 
sociologist Dr William Cockerham and colleagues from the University of 
Alabama in the United States has found that differences in attitudes to 
looking after your body and your health are predicted by your political 
allegiances.

It seems those who believe the state should take responsibility for most 
aspects of life also tend to eschew personal responsibility for taking care 
of themselves. As a result, they are more likely to engage in lifestyles 
hazardous to their health, including drinking to excess and not exercising.
