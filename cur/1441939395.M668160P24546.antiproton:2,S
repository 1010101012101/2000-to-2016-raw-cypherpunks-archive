Russia has two huge problems. One is alcoholism. Not as bad as Finland,
for sure, but worse than the UK. The other is the Jewish exodus to
Israel etc. Back in the day, it was sober (relatively speaking) Jews who
mostly did the technical stuff. Hell, Lenin was a Jew, along with much
of the early Party. And by the way, he was funded by Kaiser Wilhelm's
government, to create chaos and keep Russia out of WWI ;)

Actually, they're all Nazis. Maybe not literally, but they're all
national socialists. The US is a national socialist state that pretends
to be a representative democracy. The CCCP was a national socialist
state that pretended to be communist. Now it pretends to be a
representative democracy. Nazi Germany at least let its national
socialism hang free. Also, many Nazi intelligence officers, scientists
and propaganda experts ended up in Russia and the US. So bottom line,
it's arguable that they all cooperate far more than most folks think.
