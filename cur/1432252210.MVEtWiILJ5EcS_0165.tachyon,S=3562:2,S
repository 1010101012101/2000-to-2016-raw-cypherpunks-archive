   Crypto Op-Ed: Privacy No Longer an Argument
   posted by admin on Thursday September 20, @11:39PM

   M. W. Guzy has a provocative and not entirely coherent essay
   in Wednesday's St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Excerpt: "(Then-Senator
   John) Ashcroft wrote that mandating deciphering tools was tantamount
   to requiring 'individuals to surrender the keys to their house... to
   the FBI just in case they are someday suspected of breaking the law.'
   Somehow, that argument rings a little hollow when viewed through the
   smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center... Now, the landscape has
   changed. National sovereignty is at stake, and defeat is not an
   option..." Note that Guzy's essay is part condemnation of modern
   capitalism, part criticism of business for its support of market
   liberalism, and entirely inspired by wartime rhetoric.
