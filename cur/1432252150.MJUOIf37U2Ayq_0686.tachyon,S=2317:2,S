Because markets have no interests, the participants in them do. The
argument is exactly the same as that advanced by biologists against the
idea of group selection.

NB in a real famine (as opposed to temporary shortages, which a place
like Belize can probably get through with less hassle than a richer more
efficient economy with all our "Just in Time" suppliers) food prices go
*down* at first... strange but true. It is due to farmers unloading
stock to get money in as quickly as they can.
