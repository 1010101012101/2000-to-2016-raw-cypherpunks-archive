Certainly.  Head down to the local hardware store and buy 
yourself a very large axe.  

Now find something you want to hack, lift the axe over your 
head, and bring it down edge first.  You may need to hack 
three or four times before you break all the way through. 

It's easy once you get the hang of it.
