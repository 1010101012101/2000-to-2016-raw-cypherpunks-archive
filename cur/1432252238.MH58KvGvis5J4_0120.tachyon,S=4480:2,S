Thanks to Mark Klein, we know that the NSA wiretaps in the US are
passive in nature, not active. But who knows what they do to overseas
links and specific high-value targets...

I have to agree with the Raccoon here. I actually don't think Murdoch's
work demonstrated that sampling adversaries can adequately correlate
web-sized traffic.

It seems pretty clear to me that the typical sampling rate of 1/2048 did
not become effective until you were around O(100MB) in transfer. He
wrote that 1/500 became effective at around O(1MB) in transfer, but that
is still a bit above most web page sizes.

There is also the question of an extremely low concurrent flow count
compared to reality today. He used only 500 flows/hour to correlate,
where as at any given *second* O(10k) TCP connections are opened through
every gbit Tor node in operation today. He also used an artificial prior
distribution on connection sizes. Both of these properties alter the
event rate and thus the overall accuracy in the experimental results as
compared to reality.

I think we can agree that large video uploaders stick out like sore
thumbs (due to relative lack of upload traffic frequency), but I don't
think The Man can correlate millions of simultaneous web page views and
expect to have certainty over who is viewing what at all times. At some
point, you simply run out of differentiating bits to extract from size
and timing information to properly segment the userbase.

And as far as I know, no one has really considered the full impact of
userbase size on correlation in the research community (aside from the
Raccoon).
