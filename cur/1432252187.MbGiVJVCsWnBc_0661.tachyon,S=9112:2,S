	No, it isn't.

	Since the rise of terrorism as a common practice among the worlds 
political underclass, what percentage of passengers died or were injured 
in such incidents?

	I'd bet (I don't have the relevant numbers at hand) that it 
approaches (but of course does not reach) 0.0 percent.

	And even further, I'd be that if *no* checks were done, that the 
number would drop even further, airline costs would drop (no need for 
expensive x-ray machines and expensive security guard payrolls (yes, I 
know they aren't paid that well, but to maintain the numbers of security 
personnel, support personnel for the security personnel etc. is 
expensive).

	The vast majority of people are not terrorists, are not willing to 
die for a cause, and are generally too afraid of the Law to commit 
dangerous levels of violence on an aircraft.

	While the above is relatively true, there are not, and would not be 
"Airline Hackers" as you have "Computer Hackers" today. The marginal 
cost of compromising a computer system is fairly small for the gains 
received, you don't have to leave home, you rarely get caught, you can 
get scripts which all you to try thousands of systems an hour etc.

	None of this applies to the Airline sphere. The costs are massively 
greater, as are the risks. You cannot "anonymously" hijack a plane 
(although planting a bomb could still be done) (side note, how hard 
would it be to bomb a US Postal service plane using several small 
packages all mailed to the same town, all set with a pressure sensitive 
switch what would cause the explosion at a certain air pressure?) you 
have to be there in person to wave the weapon around, and you expose 
yourself directly to a bunch of people who really don't want you to 
succeed. If even one of them is armed, you are going to fail miserably.

	How many people who have a "history of violence" (i.e. beat the 
shit out of a drunk pawing their date) fly routinely and never cause a 
problem?

	An efficient police system would have 92% if the population behind 
bars.

	Resources are sufficient to give each passenger a .41 derringer 
loaded with 2 .410 shot shells.

	No more planes will be hijacked. Guaranteed.

	They are also the most likely to have the resources and connections 
to spoof the system.

	They are generating the public demand.

	I don't want to fly on an airline who treats any passenger as a 
fucking criminal, who insists on a background check before boarding.

	And I'm putting my money where my mouth is. In december I plan on 
riding to the midwest to see my daughter, 2000-2500 miles each way in 
winter on a rather small bike *just* so I don't have to deal with the 
airlines and give them even more of my money.

	If no one is in a position to issue such a thing, then no one is in 
a position to institute the kind of data-gathering you would need for 
your scheme.

	Really? how many have "fallen" in the last 30 years?

	And how many of those were mechanical failures as opposed to 
terrorist acts?

	"Planes are falling from the skies" is rhetorical fecees. Our 
government, and our country got the military equivelent of a black eye. 
Yes, it hurts, yes it's embarassing as all hell, but it's being used as 
an excuse for all the police state bullshit that the fascists under 
Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and Bush wanted.

	And you're at the trough lapping it up.
