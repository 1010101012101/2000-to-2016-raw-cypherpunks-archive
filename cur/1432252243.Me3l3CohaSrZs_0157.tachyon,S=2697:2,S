I've looked into the Pirate Party but, at least from the American side
of things, they seem like a 'one hit wonder' who's nearly solely focused
on IP law reform. Perhaps this isn't the same in other places (I can't
imagine they would have won major elections with a single issue
platform) but here in the States, where they exist, it seems to be the case.
