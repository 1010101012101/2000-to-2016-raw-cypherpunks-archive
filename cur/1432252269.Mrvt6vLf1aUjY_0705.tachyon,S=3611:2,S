Just as we're forced to obey gun, drug and tax laws, why do you think 
"paranoids and individualists" will be any more successful in 
stopping some government forced electronic voting system?

As Josef Stalin so aptly remarked- "Those who cast the votes decide 
nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything"
