Yes I remember the introduction of a 2nd blinding factor, your other
post in the thread where you reposted the remaining issues with
taggability jogged my memory; just the terminology threw me.

(Probably more proper to call it the introduction of another blinding
factor -- the result is just more effectively blinded -- Brands
constructs use 3 blinding factors in some scenarios for example and
that is still considered blinded not "triple-blinded") 

Brands has an optimization of his scheme where (as the user receiving
a coin) you have the option of not bothering to perform one of the
verifications, the weaker assurance being you are still assured that
the bank can't distinguish between tagged coins, though it can
distinguish an untagged coin from a tagged coin.

However as with Lucre I don't find this very convincing because the
bank can still tag one person at a time.  If you add in the general
lack of connection anonymity, it could certainly be used to confirm
suspicions and probably to effectively tag multiple users at once.

So I would consider the lucre two blinding factor approach still
flawed.
