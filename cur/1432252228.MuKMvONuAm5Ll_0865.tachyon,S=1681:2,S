Hi.

Email is more or less like sending a post card. Anyone inbetween can 
take a 
peek if they have the knowledge. (And not much knowledge is required). 
This 
is why cryptgraphic signing and encryption is preferable to 
communicate 
through EMail. So the answer to your question is: Always assume 
someone has 
looked at it.

Regards
  Ola
