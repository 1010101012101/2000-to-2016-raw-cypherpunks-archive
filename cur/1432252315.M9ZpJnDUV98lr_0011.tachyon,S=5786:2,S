Yea, but aren't they impossible for that type of typical email user?

Aliases for every company? Most providers don't offer aliases. Or they 
do it Yahoo style with one or two options. + addressing it's also badly 
supported. Thus the primary address is the only one. Having a whole 
subdomain is not available from the major services, not if it's an @work 
address. And it's not foolproof as I started noticing spam for generated 
addresses (say RandomString@user.domain.com)

How could one find out the spammy services other than by experience. 
This is precisely how I found out about linked in. And that's just 
because there's no other way to reach that data. And bugmenot was 
crippled before taking off.

DNSBL? I don't have a plugin for that in Thunderbird. And I can control 
what the provider does. Sure, most go for spamassassin as it leads to 
less false positives than a bayesian filter, but there's nothing the 
user can do.

In the end, what one can do to teach people of «e-mail hygiene» and 
«spam fighting»?
