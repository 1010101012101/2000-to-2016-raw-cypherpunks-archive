Shell providing and VPS providing is a cut throat business.  It might take 
a few contacts (with a throwaway yahoo email you create through Tor) but 
you _will_ find someone to take your money (in cash).  Lifetime or 
multi-annual payments in advance usually do the trick.

The previously mentioned Simon gift cards could fit into this, but why 
bother.

Never touch the account, save through Tor.  So it's the same model you use 
with a nym-server, but whereas all of your obfuscation is after your email 
account, all of this obfuscation is prior to the email account (through 
Tor).

I don't know that this even rises to the level of a "protection 
methodology" - it's more along the lines of "survey the current landscape 
and choose an available, and obvious route".  As for robustness, either 
Tor is broken/vulnerable or it's not.

Sorry - I was obtuse there.  What I meant was, in addition to the 
technical unknowns that grow over time, and the predictable and visible 
social pressures, there are also the acute unknowns - like french 
revolutions and bolsheviks and "year zero" folks.  Those are the unknowns 
who could just as easily be after anyone that advocated net neutrality, or 
supported Tor or spoke on behalf of anonymity as they are after obvious 
bozos who blatantly threaten public figures.

That's why _I_ keep a firewall between my real self and my nyms - year 
zero types don't need a good reason, they just need fuel, period.

Of course.  Goes without saying.  But I think there is actually a lot less 
distance (in terms of danger) between assassination politics and "just 
talking about Tor".

Or maybe the future revolutionary just fat-fingers the database query.

Either way, your name comes up.
