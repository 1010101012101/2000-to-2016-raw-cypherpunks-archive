The hell of it is, this provides a useful function.  The only thing 
that makes it invasive is that it communicates with people OTHER than 
the one whose poop it's analyzing.  

I'd actually pay a substantial amount of money to have a "health monitor" 
system in place -- to alert *me* to any problems or parasites in my gut, 
so that *I* could take appropriate action (or not, as I choose).  Why 
the hell does this guy want it to talk to people other than the one 
with the health interest?
