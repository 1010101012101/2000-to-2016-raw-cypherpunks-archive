I find those lists useful because i find that a number of them I have not
read.  I prefer recomendations from sources that might share my interests
than those that might be just a paid shill for a the book publishing
company. (Like, say, the New York Times Best Seller List(tm).)

Not all of us have the free time to research interesting book, or the
exposure to the same sources.  The lists are helpful. 


I also recommend a list of books that piss people off while reading.
Things like "The ICSA Guide to Cryptography". (The most pro-GAK crypto
book I have ever read. I keep it as a reminder of which libraries and
products to avoid.)
