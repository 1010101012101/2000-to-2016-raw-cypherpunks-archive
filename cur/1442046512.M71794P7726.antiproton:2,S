It looks to me like they have just taken snippets of info from various other texts (probably legal/law enforcement relates sites) to use to raise their profile on search engines.

They seem to be advertising a service for doing background checks on people so these bits of text may help with matching the search terms used by people who are looking for that kind of service.
