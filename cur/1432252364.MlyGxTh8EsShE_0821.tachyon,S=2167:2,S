They chose the space too small? I don't really know which
algorithms Bitcoin uses. CUDA isn't that much, for many
problems we've got at work it only provides a 10x speedup.
Presumably for brute-force searches it could do a 100x
speedup. Why is Bitcoin vulnerable to only a couple of
orders magnitude faster systems?
