=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Don't bother. =C2=A0It was somewhat of a joke for me to menti=
on the "story royalty" line. =C2=A0 Since having spent thousands of hours i=
n Federal prison law libraries, I studied many different areas of law, far =
beyond criminal law and appeals, including copyright law. =C2=A0I am not aw=
are that copyright law would protect such an idea. =C2=A0If I had written a=
 play or a script for a movie, THAT would be my own under copyright law. =
=C2=A0But not merely the underlying idea. =C2=A0Now, nothing would prevent =
one of these studios from giving me some sort of credit on a line at the en=
d of the show, but they wouldn't owe me money legally. =C2=A0I am much more=
 upset that they took TWENTY FUCKING YEARS to steal the idea, than the fact=
 they 'stole' it.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I should also take the opportunity to point out that I wrote =
my AP essay independently from, and completely unaware of, the previous dis=
cussions by Tim May and Robin Hanson. =C2=A0(I didn't even have Internet ac=
cess, except as a portal, until mid-1995, and was entirely unaware of the C=
ypherpunks list; =C2=A0AP part one was actually published here by somebody =
else.).
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 The major differences included: =C2=A0Tim May and Robin Hanso=
n both referred to the idea, the one that would one day be seen as "assassi=
nation markets", as being "abhorrent markets". =C2=A0See Cyphernomicon 16.1=
6.4. That they were repelled by the idea, presumably, is one reason they di=
dn't rhetorically follow the concept out to its ultimate, logical outcome. =
=C2=A0I, on the other hand, and totally unaware of their work, thought that=
 assassination markets would actually be a truly wonderful idea, precisely =
because of their capability to destroy governments, make militaries unneces=
sary and indeed impossible to maintain (critically, including nuclear weapo=
ns), and completely replace the current 'criminal justice system' with a fa=
r-fairer alternative. =C2=A0THEY merely stuck their big toes into the cold =
pool, whereas I did a belly-flop. =C2=A0(With the accompanying pain, <sigh>=
). =C2=A0
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 They probably started out by thinking something like, "If per=
son A can anonymously hire person B to kill person C, that could lead to mi=
schief." =C2=A0Sure it could. =C2=A0But I approached the problem differentl=
y: =C2=A0I saw that very few people would want to pay, say, $10,000 to buy =
someone else's death. =C2=A0But I immediately also saw that 10,000 people m=
ight want to pay $1 each for that outcome. =C2=A0That amounts to a crowdsou=
rced decision, with its accompanying advantages and benefits. =C2=A0And I a=
lso saw that such a functioning system would deter virtually everything whi=
ch we call wrong in today's society. =C2=A0Anybody who is trying to argue a=
gainst an AP-type system is inherently attempting to defend the hugely flaw=
ed status quo, even if they don't realize that.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I also solved David Friedman's "Hard problem", see his book, =
"The Machinery of Freedom", =C2=A0the previously-assumed difficulty or impo=
ssibility of providing for the defense of a fully libertarian or anarchisti=
