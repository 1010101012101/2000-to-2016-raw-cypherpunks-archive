Come now, surely justice, right, and wrong are lurking in there
somewhere?

The word "justice" is used frequently by the legal crowd.  For
examples, "the Justice Department", "The Justices of the Supreme
Court", and that blindfolded lady with the scales, all suggest to the
general public that the idea is to somehow provide justice.  Nearly
everybody who is not a lawyer believes that's a service a legal system
is intended to provide.

Perhaps I miss your point.  Is your statement intended as a
condemnation of the U.S. legal system?  Which legal systems do you
believe are about justice, right, and wrong?
