High LEO launch costs are just down payments. It's literally true, 
energy-wise, that LEO is halfway to anywhere in the solar system. What's 
needed is a group of intelligent people and a "seed stock" of technology on 
the Moon. Teleoperation is great technology, but what's the point in these 
endeavours without a human component? Besides, teleoperation and AI and 
everything else breaks down, and the more complicated a thing is the easier 
it is to break it. Wheras humans... well, Scott Carpenter's description of an 
astronaut was roughly something like "A nonlinear computer with over 1 
billion binary decision elements, weighing less than 200 pounds, and capable 
of being produced by unskilled labor". A large enough human presence is 
self-repairing, self-replicating, and self-controlling. The perfect world for 
rapid expansion.

Backwards. Higher orbit == lower velocity. As each component is added, you 
increase the mass of the station. You increase the energy of the total 
structure because the new component carries with it kinetic energy realized 
from the decrease in altitude, but rendevous and docking will probably waste 
all of that advantage in braking burns. 

Your chief advantage is that it takes much less energy to get from the Moon's 
surface to LEO than it does to get from the Earth's surface to LEO.

Why would you want to? If it's the size of Wales and solar maximum begins to 
drag it lower, how in the hell would you boost it again without throwing away 
all of Swansea as fuel? Easier and cheaper to use lunar material to build 
stations and equipment in High Earth Orbit, GEO, and at the LaGrange points. 
Especially at L4 and L5, you could build your station as large as you want 
(O'Neill designed them as large as 30 km, IIRC) and never worry about the 
mass because it won't ever go anywhere.

More like "11". Salyut 1 through 7, Skylab, Mir, and ISS or whatever the hell 
they're calling it this week. In terms of habitable volume, the Salyuts are 
the smallest, followed by Mir before expansion, then Skylab, then Mir after 
expansion, then ISS-as-designed. ISS-as-built is, I believe, somewhere 
between Mir and Skylab, although to be fair they aren't done yet.

And for serious-but-light reading on the topic, look for "Colonies In Space" 
by Heppenheimer, "The High Frontier" by Dr. O'Neill, and more recently 
"Entering Space" by Zubrin. The first two are wildly optimistic, the last is 
actually rather pessimistic - I could argue with the numbers of all three, 
and reality is probably somewhere in the middle. The three also increase in 
technical detail and decrease is "fun" as you go down the list.
