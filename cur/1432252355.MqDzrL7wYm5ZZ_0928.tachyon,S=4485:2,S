Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewab|e Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards of $12O
mi||i0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 170,O00 Mw of electricity annually for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,0OO homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,O0O tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $45O mil|i0n for a

development of renewable energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of

its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
