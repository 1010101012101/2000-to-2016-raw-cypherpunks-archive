No, you forwarded *my* message responding to the spam-solicitation to 
UUNET, and asked them to take action against *me*. I have the complete headers.

The reason I wrote about it is because it shows, as an online society, how 
hypersensitive we've become to spam. It requires all three people in the 
spam-complaint chain to overreact: You (accidentally, you say), uunet 
(intentionally), and my provider (intentionally, probably). Different 
actions by any of them would have derailed the spamcident. Frankly, I've 
also been meaning to send out my econlib.org column for a while, and this 
gave me an excuse to mention it.

Better ways of dealing with spam can avoid this in the future.
