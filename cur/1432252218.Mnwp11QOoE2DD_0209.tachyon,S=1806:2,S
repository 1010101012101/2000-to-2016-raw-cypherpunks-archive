http://www.azstarnet.com/news/151826 has an article saying that
the Arizona State Attorney General's office is
seizing wire transfers over $500 to "block human- and drug-smuggling rings."
They've taken over $12M from over 11,000 interstate transactions,
and claim to have arrested over 100 people smugglers.

"Assistant Attorney General Cameron Holmes said
prosecutors use a computer algorithm to review
every money transfer sent into Arizona.
He said these tend to be in amounts between $800 and $1,500,
usually in final payments to smugglers for
ferrying people into the United States. "

The stolen money goes into a special fund where
victims who can prove their money was legitimate
can sometimes get it back, if they don't mind
spending more money than the transfer was worth on legal costs.
