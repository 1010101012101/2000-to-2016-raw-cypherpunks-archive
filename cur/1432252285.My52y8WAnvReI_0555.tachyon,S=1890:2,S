You are misusing the term "cash". What you are describing are essentially
"internet debit cards." While it is attractive to insert word "cash" into any
harebrained "net money" scheme, exactly because of positive associations with
CASH, it is misleading and deceptive.

Cash means off-line clearing and anonymous. If it is complicated to understand,
open your wallet, take a banknote out of it and ponder what it is for a minute.
