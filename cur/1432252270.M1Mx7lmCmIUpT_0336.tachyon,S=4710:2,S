I disagree.  If some judge were to make a ruling that went against 
the constitution, even if the case law in question was entirely 
within common law, his ruling would be unconstitutional and thus null 
an void (after it was filtered through the appellant process and 
invalidated of course...).  However, in practice I can think of no 
situation where this could occur- civil law (the primary area where 
common law rules) simply does not involve anything the constitution 
says anything about.
