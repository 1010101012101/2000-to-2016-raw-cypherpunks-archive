(Guys, this has drifted out of crypto into finance, so I
have a feeling that it will disappear of the crypto list.
But the topics that are raised are interesting and important
enough to carry on, I think.)

An excellent description;  I was unaware that the system
could be used in a non-credit fashion.  Thanks for correcting
me.

There are many definitions of "banking" and unfortunately
they are different enough that one will make mistakes
routinely.  Here are the most useful three that I know of:

1.  borrowing from the public as deposits and lending those
deposits to the public.  This is the favoured definition for
economists, because it concentrates on the specialness that
is banking, which is the foundation for its special regulatory
structure.

2.  Banking is what banks do, and banks do banking.  This is
the favoured definition of banks, and often times, regulators,
because it gives them a free hand to exploit their special
franchise / subsidy.  It was codified in law in many countries
as just this, but I believe it is out of favour to write it
down these days.  However, the Fed and other US regulators have
from time to time resorted to this definition, when convenient.

3.  Banking is what the regulator says is banking.  This is
the favoured definition of regulators, and sometimes of banks.
It means that there is little or no argument or discussion in
protecting the flock.  This is the much more prevalent in
smaller countries, where the notion of "sending in the lawyers"
is simply too expensive.

4.  There is a popular definition that says something like,
if it is to do with money it is banking.  That's not a very
useful one, but it's prevalent enough to need to be aware of
it.

Right!  (Although, I'd suggest that the "payment systems
regulatory" question is polarised between the Fed and
the German model.  In the German model, payment systems
are part of banking, and are subject to heavy regulation.
I've not heard of the Germans and their followers accepting
the Fed model.  This debate is played out in the EU over
and over again, and there it can be loosely characterised
as the Germans + supporters versus the Brits plus supporters.)

Well, one could speculate on that and many other things.
Perhaps an anecdote would illustrate that better than I
can in more speculation:  in the very early days, e-gold
did go to the Fed and ask them if they considered e-gold
to be ... within interest.  The Fed said, "gold is not
money and therefore it is not of interest."

This would have been back in 97 or so.  Now, that's what
the Fed said then.  Obviously they are using definition #3
above.  And, just as obviously, things can change...

If the separate party were to hold and create credit
based on contracts of deposit, using e-gold as the
money and as the accounts system, this would be doing
banking according to definition #1 above.  However,
note that it would have both the advantages of both
a hard money - 100% reserved digital gold - and the
advantages of fractional reserve.  The bank could
only lend out what it had attracted in deposits,
which would result in a stable multiplier.

The trick is to separate the payment system from the
bank!  The easiest way to do this is to ban payment
systems from being near or related to credit systems,
which is what we espouse in our unregulated finance
systems governance models.  (This is why e-gold is a
payment system in Nevis, and G&SR is a seller of e-gold
for dollars in Florida.  On paper at least, G&SR can
go bankrupt and e-gold carries on.)

The offerers of credit and loans were all third parties
that more or less had nothing to do with e-gold.  Such
separation, in theory, allows the creation of a stable
credit expansion system which is only limited by the
efficiency of the players.
