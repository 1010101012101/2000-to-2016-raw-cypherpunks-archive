Why is this reminding me of some of the activities of local Law
enforcement?

All of this talk of multiple shots fired, but no mention of what happens
to those that miss or continue on past the target after hitting it.

I expect that if they ever do test this thing in low earth orbit or any
other space bound platform, we may see a few "accidents" that were not
counted on.  

"Oops! Accidently hit that communications satilite. Sorry!"

"Oops! Accidently hit that densely populated urban area!"

Oops! "Accidently" hit Tim May's house!"
