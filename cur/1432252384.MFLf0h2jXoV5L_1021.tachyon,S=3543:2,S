"subpoena manager"? What in Tacoma is a "subpoena manager"? Do subpoenas
need managing? 

It sounds like they employ someone just to get sued.  Presumably that
means she is a PR clone or a lawyer. Why should a PR type know anything
about DNS & SMTP, any more than I (or Choate)  should be an expert on
the law?

If I was a grumpy judge and a company sent me a "subpoena manager" I
would be very tempted to send them right back & get someone who knew
what they are talking about.
