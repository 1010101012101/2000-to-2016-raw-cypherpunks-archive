I think Tahoe fits either use case of a shared file repository or a
distributed backup system. There are two levels of credentials you can
share: the introducer furls, which grant access to your grid, and the
rootcap for a particular directory on the grid, which grants access to a
specific set of files. By Tahoe's design you should be able to give the RIAA
the introducer furls to your grid. They can then create directories and
store data on your grid, and will accept encrypted chunks of files from
other peers. However, unless they actually have a rootcap for directories
containing infringing content, they have no way of knowing whether or not
the chunks they receive from other peers contain this data or not, since
it's encrypted.

I'm envisioning a system where there wouldn't be an encrypted introducer URL
to gain access to the grid, instead additional methods to provide a web of
trust and collaborative filtering of particular peers would be used to
prevent abuse. However, I think Tahoe's rootcap system is still essential.
Cryptographic credentials would be required to access any data on the grid.

To my knowledge Tahoe doesn't log which nodes are responsible for the
creation of content on the grid. Instead there are rootcaps which control
read and write access to directories on the grid, and anyone with the
"writecap" can add content to a particular directory. I may be mistaken as I
have just started using Tahoe. In the system I'm envisioning, the anonymity
of who created a particular file would definitely be preserved.

I'd certainly agree BitTorrent could be the underlying technology underlying
this system, layering the discovery and crypto on top of a BitTorrent-based
system underneath, although I'd prefer it has more filesystem-like semantics
like Tahoe. Perhaps BitTorrent with an "earliest-first" instead of
"rarest-first" chunk selection mechanism would work.
