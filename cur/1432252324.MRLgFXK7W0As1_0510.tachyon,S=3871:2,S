I need to find some relatively widely deployed applications which have
frequent user interactions (rapid clicking on links, from as large a
population of links as possible, and also form filling and such).

(it should be pretty obvious what this is for)

I'd like:

0) *rapid*/frequent user interactions; fast clicking on things (like every
second, no more than 5 seconds)

1) "sticky"...long interactions with a given site (on the order of hours)
(also all links need to be under the same url/same server)

2) large number of potential links for users to click on, with
desirable properties for click distribution (I *think* I want them to
be nearly equally likely, but I might just want a defined
distribution, or I might even want the opposite of that)

3) relatively small data sizes for downloaded data, UNLESS downloaded
data is generated unique and "randomly"

4) widely deployed already on the internet, or compelling enough that
there would be a decent number of potential server operators.
Obviously I could *create* an app which has the desirable
characteristics, but I'd like something which can deal with existing
data or apps served over the internet)

5) good data on how likely users are to click on things, how fast they
click, etc., so one could easily operate within those parameters.

So far, the best ideas:
1) Porn
2) Mailing lists with lots of internal links (next, reply, etc.)
3) Sites with search engines with lots of linked data (encyclopedia,
etc.)
4) html games (or flash, maybe) -- either imagemaps, or just tables,
things like chess, or puzzles, or whatever

I'd definitely appreciate any suggestions on possible web apps which
meet these criteria; reply to lists or ryan@venona.com.

I'll post when it's ready.

Thanks,
Ryan
