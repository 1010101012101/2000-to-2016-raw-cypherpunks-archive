"I'll bet the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has 
contacted (or will contact) the winners of Oscars..."

There are stock market implications for who gets (and who does not 
get) the winning AES pick. So it is unlikely that the winners will be 
announced prior to the public announcement.

I'm not saying wink-and-nod leakage has not now occurred.

There is no need to alert the winner to be there, given that _all_ of 
the contenders are likely to have paid lobbyists and staffers there.

I may be completely wrong on this. Maybe word got out. Maybe this is 
why RSAS fell $2.80 today. Maybe not.
