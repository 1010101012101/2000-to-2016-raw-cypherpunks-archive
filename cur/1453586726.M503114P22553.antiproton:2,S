I did not say a single word about victims. But hey, let's play: if a ma=
fia=20
outlet kills a member of this very mafia outlet (due to some internal=20=

business), does that make that (dead) mafioso a victim?

If so, does that suddenly make the mafioso a "non-voluntary" mafioso?

Also, I would say that Wikipedia became a "victim" of Internet Watch=20=

Foundation's Internet censorship. I am perfectly happy to agree that Wi=
kipedia=20
was not a "voluntary" victim of it. However, does that make IWF suddenl=
y not a=20
civil society organisation?

Or, perhaps, we can actually have civil society organisations that (sad=
ly)=20
show signs of being corrupted by the power (over *something*)?

Well, at what point a voluntary organisation stops being voluntary? Whe=
n they=20
commit their first crime? I am confused about your usage of the word=20=

"voluntary" here. Are you not actually looking for "non-criminal"?

If that's your standard for "equating", then I have to ask... Why are y=
ou=20
equating civil society to mafia? After all, you just "listed civil soci=
ety and=20
mafia in the same sentence".

Here it is again, for your distinct viewing pleasure:

That's actually a valid point. Your default answer will be "Teh Gubmint=
", and=20
in the particular case of IWF, you'd actually be right.

Thing is, does that mean that we have:
 - a civil society organisation
 - that *you agree* has been to some extent corrupted by power they got=
?

It's a "yes/no" question.

And yet they are a civil society organisation. My point stands: *even* =
civil=20
society can be corrupted by power. Do you not agree?

Governments are not good in and of themselves. But seeing *everything* =
that a=20
government touches as evil/bad/criminal/your-word-here is akin to seein=
g=20
everything that contains mercury (the element) as toxic. If that doesn'=
t ring=20
a bell, let me help you with that:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal_controversy

So basically, yes, I am now calling your anti-Tor bullshit akin to the =
anti-
vaccine crowd bullshit (or, as I prefer to call them, "pro-disease").

> =09Or is it, "power actually good" when your team uses it?

Power bad always, needs to be checked, *regardless* of whether or not i=
t=20
(power) happens to be in the hands of a government, mafia, private sect=
or,=20
civil society, or pixies and unicorns.

Problem is, there are many, many different power structures. Government=
s are=20
one kind of these. But there are many more, and they emerge on their ow=
n, all=20
the time. Looking *only* on governments (and mafia) and missing the bro=
ader=20
picture is just plain silly.


Still, sometimes I would love to have your simple "gummint bad, private=
 sector=20
good, remove gummint and the free market will cure cancer" view of the =
world.=20
One can dream...
