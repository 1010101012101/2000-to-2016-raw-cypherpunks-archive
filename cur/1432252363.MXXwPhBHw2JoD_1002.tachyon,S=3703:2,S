Well, if you're not averse to stirring up trouble (:-),
see if you can find the contact for China's proposed
.[Chinese-Unicode-Character-for-Commercial] TLD,
which they announced would be competing with ICANN's .com
for Chinese-language domain names.
I don't know what the phonetic equivalent of the name is,
but maybe they'd also want somebody to run ".chicom" mirroring it...


				Thanks!
