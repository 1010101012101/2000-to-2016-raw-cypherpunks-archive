Hillary was in good company: Richard Gere got booed for
suggesting tolerance not vengeance, and the NYC Fire 
Commissioner got booed the loudest by firemen for being
a publicity whore and Guiliani flunkey who has been trying
for years to cut back on firefighting services under Rudy's
orders. The Fire Commish is the one who agreed with
the Port Authority to lock the roof doors of the Twin Towers
to prevent access by suiciders and antenna thieves, and
lately hot-footing hamburgers.

Two hovering police choppers waited for people to come
to the roof, rescue hoists ready, but none made it past the 
locked doors -- a couple of the doorbangers cellphoned 
home to scream bloody murder.

The Fire Department's response: the point is moot, time
to move on to the future, recalling the exculpation of the 
Holocaust IBM Excuser-Investors.

This is not to say that fist fights between NYC police
and firemen at disaster sites over who is the bravest
in union negotiations is not to be cheered. Rudy alternates
caps emblazoned with NYFD and NYPD until contract
renewal time then he hops to W$.
