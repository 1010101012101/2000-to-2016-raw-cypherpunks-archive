What's funny is how fast this would change if we were just to get a few more
bodybags back...


http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/15/ret.assassination.poll/index.html

(CNN) -- A majority of Americans support giving government agents the power
to assassinate terrorists despite a U.S. policy forbidding such actions,
according to a Newsweek poll released Saturday. 

In addition, more than three-quarters of 1,003 people surveyed -- 78 percent
-- said they favored using military force against Saddam Hussein's forces in
Iraq, with 75 percent supporting operations against terrorist targets in
other Middle Eastern nations and 66 percent backing those in countries
outside the region.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
