Laura Poitras: Surveillance Teach-In
with Jacob Appelbaum & Special Guests
Friday, April 20, 2012  7:30 PM
Lower Gallery

Award-winning filmmaker Laura Poitras explores issues of war,
justice, and power. Her current film trilogy, focusing on America
post 9/11, documents the Iraq War, secret state surveillance, and
the suspension of the rule of law in the "war on terror." For this
evening program, she is joined by Jacob Appelbaum, computer
security researcher, privacy advocate, hacker, and human rights
activist. Together they will reveal elements of their own work to
investigate methods of surveillance as well as tools of circumvention.
Join them as they invite the audience to explore the Museum through
the lens of a Panopticon observation system.

Free with Museum admission, which is pay-what-you-wish on
Fridays from 69 pm; there are no special tickets or reservations.
