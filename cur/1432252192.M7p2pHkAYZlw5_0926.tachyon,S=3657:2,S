faulty implementations meaning side channels leaking key material.  i
know that Glenn at Centaur/VIA is concerned about perceived pressures
to keep crypto out of processor cores.   consider this rumor but i'd
love to see someone follow up on this story.

with cache/memory timing, differential power analysis, even acoustic
side channels weakening software cipher implementations (and hardware
to a lesser degree) i can't help but wonder why Intel and AMD have not
deployed entropy, digests, block ciphers and Montgomery multipliers in
their cores - it takes very little die space and provides a huge
return.  makes my inner paranoid twitch...

</VIA whoring>

with that said, i think it's clear that a properly designed crypto
system could be considered secure.  the government still uses AES256
for their top secret datum, and the NSA license of ECC could be
interpreted as a vote of confidence in that PK system.  (or is this
just another ruse? :)

with ciphers and protocols maturing is the next frontier for
cypherpunks decentralized reputation and trust metrics applied to
process, persons, and systems?

the world around these theoretically secure ciphers is full of holes
as you describe.
