AFAIK, not true in the US.  You are from the UK, according to your
address,
and you haven't even freedom of speech, so its not surprising you're
assumed
to be guilty, and fined, without evidence.

Were it true here, copyright "infringement" would be *more* than
justified morally,
since we'd have paid for it, under threat of violence, without even
having done it.
