"The pilots' union is calling for the TSA to create a new airport badging 
system using a biometric component, such as iris scans or fingerprints, to 
verify the identity not only of pilots but also of any armed federal agents 
who may be on a flight.
Meanwhile, Luckey has sent pilots tips on counter-surveillance techniques, 
such as how to sneak a photo of a suspicious person. Stalking incidents, 
like thefts of uniforms, are "demonstrably a very viable threat and 
something we need to guard against," he said."
