Subject: Drawing A Blank -- ACLU Report on the Failure of Face
  Recognition in Tampa

Dave,

The use of the biometric facial recognition technology, along with video
surveillance on the streets of Tampa, Florida is an overhyped failure that
has been seemingly abandoned by police officials, according to a report
released today by the American Civil Liberties Union.

System logs obtained by the ACLU through Florida's open-records law show
that the system never identified even a single individual contained in the
department's database of photographs. And in response to the ACLU's queries
about the small number of system logs, the department has acknowledged that
the software -- originally deployed last June, 2001 -- has not been
actively used since August.

The report  entitled "Drawing a Blank : The Failure of Face Recognition in
Tampa",  can be found at http://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy/drawing_blank.pdf.

Our announcement can be found at http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n010302a.html.
