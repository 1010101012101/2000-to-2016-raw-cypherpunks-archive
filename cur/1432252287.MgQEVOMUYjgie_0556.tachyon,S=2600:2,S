I usually convert a Google Groups URL to a query using only the 
Message-ID: before posting it publicly. E.g. in the case of the message Tim May referred to, that'd be
http://groups.google.com/groups?oe=UTF-8&as_umsgid=%3C220820032357238678%25timcmay%40removethis.got.net%3E

Then the URL won't be _too_ long, and if Google changes the URL 
scheme or is replaced by some other archve, you've got the original 
Message-ID, the best identifier you could hope for.
