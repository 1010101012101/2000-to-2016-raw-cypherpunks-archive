I understand your point, but the fact remains that the socio-economic
populations that produce people capable of making homebrew nuclear
weapons and the socio-economic populations that get attacked by drones
are mostly distinct. My earlier point stands if you replace "terror
groups" with "extra-legal terror groups."

It's possibly a sad fact, in the same sense that if the USSR didn't have
nukes, and thus MAD didn't exist, most of Eurasia might be an atomic
wasteland by now.
