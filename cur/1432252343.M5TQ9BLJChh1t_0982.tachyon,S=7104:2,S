	Yep.

	You quoted and refuted (a part of) Stallman's more general
	theory. 

	What first caught my attention though was that somebody who's
	allegedly concerned with freedom, is an advocate of, among other
	things, public education and 'national' 'defense'. 

	Also, all the rest of 'free' socialist programs he favors
	require high levels of taxation. But of course, robbery is
	freedom.

	Well, the copyright notice looks like a US government copyright
	notice. But that's not what I was getting at anyway. 

	The thing is, as Rysiek pointed out, Stallman's position
	doesn't seem fully consistent.

	And Mirimir, you've just violated Stallman's copyright! It says
	"verbatim copying" but you added a comment of your own inside
	Stallman's text. Brace yourself!
