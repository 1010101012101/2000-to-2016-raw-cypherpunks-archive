--- crypto platforms ---

unknown if others relate to it this way, though i think DMX lighting
systems (somewhat like MIDI for lights, fog machines, electronic
billboards) has potential as a communications system beyond strobes and
laser projections, LED light patterns and various colors and special
effects (disco-ball to various atmospherics: water-like filters, shapes,
etc.

DMX512 standard for lighting
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512

what is quite interesting about the existing technology besides the
potential for lasers, is fully automatic controlled lighting systems,
robotic or remotely servo-driven, that can be coordinated and synced with
other events. so, for instance, you could have 8 different LED lights
around a perimeter that on cue could together reorient themselves and shine
different colors on a central object, though that involves a lot of cable,
infrastructure, and enough know-how to figure it out. and still, that could
just involve entertainment versus using the same functionality to, say,
change the way something appears via these potential influences.

instead of examining lighting as just a utility or as decoration, it also
could open up or unlock other meaning or hidden structures or qualities or
characteristics latent yet unexpressed or unhighlighted. the lighting of
the 2oth century World's Fairs were notable for the art of light via
electrical infrastructure which brought about a different awareness. and
then this related to the Great White Way of electrification, electrical
lights and electrical signage that changed the landscape and the way people
relate to the city, home, nighttime, movement, etc.  three books offer
insight into these dynamics in differing ways:

context:  History of electric power transmission
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electric_power_transmission


now what does this have to do with lighting gear usually related to DJ rigs
and night clubs and entertainment venues... beyond that lighting
technology, perhaps techniques have advanced over decades and now are a
major form of expression - including of information - via active 'light
signs' and even computerized, animated lighting technologies tied with LED
diodes, in terms including: longevity, size, energy-efficiency,
color-spectrum, economy, and inexpensive -in many scenarios-, mass
manufacturing.

so the illuminated sign outside the store and the billboard have been
transformed via LED lighting arrays that exist somewhere on the edge of
beings screens, where the pixels are usually mapped to a visible array of
lights, versus the microscopic pixels of higher resolution computer display
screens. and yet these electronic signs and billboards as "communication"
appear as a mundane functionality, versus a potential realm of exploration
(i.e. Jenny Holzer) and thus this same boundary condition of use, the
ordinary or standard approach versus other possibilities  also could be
extended into lighting innovations beyond the realm fo signage, that also
could function as a communications medium, for signal conveyance, yet not
used this way in default configurations of cycling colors or lighting
synchronized to music and thus providing sound-&-light atmosphere, as if
lighting flashes within thunderstorm clouds, versus other kinds of signals
beaming out of the fog, outside of the nightclub scene.

in other words, lighting systems as signage, communications platform,
potentially signal systems for cryptographic content in the realm of the
semaphore, symbolic comms, etc.
here are a few introductions to the technology available...

// notice array ~35 sec. (sectional control allows pixel mapping)

[video]  COLORbar=E2=84=A2 SMD by CHAUVET=C2=AE DJ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3lLkFZGalCE

info:  COLORbar=E2=84=A2 SMD
http://www.chauvetlighting.com/colorbar-smd.html

(basically, in a combined array using DMX and software, patterns could
potentially be programmed onto the device as a display or communications
medium, including abstract signs or other language variations, within an
aesthetic context or as signage/semaphore)

[video] CHAUVET COLORbar SMD Overview
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DC7i-TAa4mUU

(note: light patterns could be video captured by mobile phone, decrypted)

this is perhaps the most promising, most applicable to 7- and 16-segment
display issues though in the dot-matrix approach, scaled to signage versus
circuitboard component... again a massive array would be needed though
definitely, if programmable, an 3|E animation and other calculations could
occur, the larger the grid, more space for symbols and words, though that
would be room and wall-sized and a huge investment to start, versus smaller
scale...

http://www.chauvetlighting.com/mvp-12.html


then there are 'lines' known as colortubes, by different manufacturers
which could be used to create segmented alphanumeric characters or blocks,
or vertical or horizontal arrays. in addition, this technology is
potentially particularly well-suited to /\|\/ type dynamics...

Category=3DL.E.D
.

[note: in Minneapolis there used to be a giant ball on a building downtown
known as the 'weatherball' that changed color to indicate the weather
forecast and could be seen for miles. thus when snow was imminent it would
change color and people would know it would soon be snowing, etc. in this
way a simple mundane orb could function as a signaling device via what
color it is on, and what this may relate with. perhaps more could be done
with this, such as adding an info-dimension or that it is a sensor system
or a marker for geolocation or geocaching even, data point, whatever. what
if it synced with a ring or keychain, etc. or went into mood ring territory
based on proximity electrostatic charge, else like gunshot sensors, if
sharp noise or yelling detected turns red. what is the potential... is it
inert or does it tend towards interaction, is it a mirage as a crystal ball
or may it involve key exchange, etc.]

Mr. Weatherball

Weather beacon // see history: empire state bldg & coca-cola decoder
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_beacon

"A weather beacon is a beacon that indicates the local weather forecast in
a code of colored or flashing lights. Often, a short poem or jingle
accompanies the code to make it easier to remember."

(example of potential use: modify for site-specific use, perhaps with UV or
IR lighting, invisible to normal sight. someone goes into a space,
instructed to take photo, and light illuminates dust pattern on wall that
later shows up on photograph. else, takes photo in area of others, pattern
lights up on clothing via matched wavelength thread, etc. perhaps unique
sensor in camera and light to bound other observations. thus: secret
communications, reading/writing. thus, what equipment can do this...
leading to consideration of existing DJ technology as an innovative medium
that could be explored for its potential as signage and for signaling in
various abstraction, beyond only color, into patterns, icons, movement,
animation, etc. quite a large canvas of possibilities to explore, beyond
networked PCs)


--- high abstraction pattern-match ---

e.g. what if this sketched a pattern in fog that was recognizable
via pattern-analysis of video // likely would require lasers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D6IZ1va8azFM

e.g. say binary pattern or sequence via on/off, hi-lo

sweeper beam //  lighting system language... #X/V|
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D5E_bomUKOW8

American DJ Tri Gem LED // gears, rotational syncing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DxMWqNcIiQKE

the value would be in programmability, shaping output
to particular pattern-based if transformative parameters,
in terms of randomness or calculation or AI-behaviors...

// and last but not least...

DMX bubble machine as the ultimate short-term RNG!!!
[video] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DBAxhXivVaTY

(what, you don't like soap? think of it, floating bubbles, light,
movement, captured on video, using pattern match engine
to search reflections and colors on bubbles surface, as if
hundreds of crystal balls a second, changing each moment
to the next via lighting and wind and inter-bubble relations)

<br>[note: in Minneapolis there used to be a giant ball on a building downt=
own known as the &#39;weatherball&#39; that changed color to indicate the w=
eather forecast and could be seen for miles. thus when snow was imminent it=
 would change color and people would know it would soon be snowing, etc. in=
 this way a simple mundane orb could function as a signaling device via wha=
t color it is on, and what this may relate with. perhaps more could be done=
 with this, such as adding an info-dimension or that it is a sensor system =
or a marker for geolocation or geocaching even, data point, whatever. what =
if it synced with a ring or keychain, etc. or went into mood ring territory=
 based on proximity electrostatic charge, else like gunshot sensors, if sha=

may it involve key exchange, etc.]<br>

 in camera and light to bound other observations. thus: secret communicatio=

ration of existing DJ technology as an innovative medium that could be expl=
