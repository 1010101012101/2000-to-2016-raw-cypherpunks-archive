Presumably these are the Nigerians who have only $80 for food that 
month, yet somehow can still afford to bulkspam thousands of inboxes 
each day, process bank transactions and take part in international phone 
calls.

doesn't make a noticable dent in a $80/month income, I definitely should 
move there myself!
