ISTR some solid "yep, we parallel construct" facts at some point...

Well, may be not.

Actually, so you have 20 operatives in say North Korea and you need to
contact them urgently so they know their holiday picture taking is
over and must return post haste, since their holiday cover is about to
be blown - how do you contact them without personally contacting them,
to maximise their safety?

Is a daily Tor sign in the best idea for operatives in other
countries? Of course for those who do their daily Tor duty, they
presumably will be notified.

So perhaps just reading the daily newspaper from the country from
which you're officially on holiday from? "Oh, there's some
international spy scandal going on, think we better leave now dear,
since we foreigners might be targetted regardless - how about an
opportunistic trip South?"
