A moment ago you were arguing maximum utility (your public good 
argument)  Now you concede utility, and argue rights, but 
copyright, unlike real property, is merely a conventional right, 
created by the will and power of the state, not a natural right.

If that convention ceases to be convenient and useful, ceases to 
have utility, we should not continue it.

And if you are going to argue from long established conventional 
rights, copyright has been extended by twenty years every twenty 
years, so it is not a long established conventional right.

Returning to your public good argument.  As more and more stuff 
piles up, the production of new stuff becomes a less and less 
valuable public good.  At the same time, as with any "public 
good", congress (being in the pocket of state created interest 
groups) creates greater and greater incentives to produce more and 
more of this public good.

If an anarchic free market underproduces public goods, government 
subject to interest groups overproduces public goods, a problem 
that is particularly serious with such dubious public goods as 
"defense", cultural or racial purity, and so on and so forth.
