And was HP a *successful* business once it appointed a female CEO?

Businesses appoint female CEOs for political reasons, and it usually
has a bad outcome.

Compare photos of men of 1950, with photos of men today.  We *are*
being forcibly feminized.  It is unpleasant, distressing, humiliating,
degrading, and contrary to our natures.  Either that, or something in
the water is making testosterone levels and sperm counts drop like a
stone.  You might blame evil pollution by evil capitalists rather than
forced feminization, but undeniably something really bad is happening.

And the fact that no one is paying attention suggests that the problem 
is forced feminization rather than some mystery pollutant.  If it was 
likely that it is plastic softeners in the drinking water, we would have 
more official scientists making a officially big deal about it than 
about global warming.
