Well, maybe.  As I recall,  one of the things mentioned in the
complaint is that he violated the click-through license agreement
by publishing his results.  My understanding is that it has not
been thoroughly resolved how binding these things are.  I think it's
only in Dilbert that you can click on one of these without reading it
and wind up as Bill Gates' towelboy,  but IANAL.

ObPuzzle: You are in a room with three monkeys.  One has a 
banana, one has a stick, one has nothing. Which primate is the 
smartest?
