   No, the point is that a lot of fairly old machines won't be obsolete for a
long time, at least running a decent OS.

     Nope, I run gnome 4.0, and, I should say, I run it with 4 workspaces --
first one always has 4 gnometerminal sessions going, second has the latest
mozilla with at least 6 windows open, often acrobat reader as well, third one
has three gnometerminals and opera, which usually has at least a dozen sessions
open, and the fourth workspace usually has openoffice running. 
    I don't notice anything particularly slow. Compared to a 700mhz AMD at work
and a 1ghz I've played with, it's not bad. Oh, and also it's always running
apache, postfix, and usually mysql. 
    It would be nice to compile kernels faster. But even compiling them with all
the above running isn't that bad, and doesn't seem to seriously slow down the
rest.

   No, mozilla and opera.

   Well, this box (the tower case itself is about 10 years old) recently got
upgraded from a 200mhz to a 266 (actually it a 350 but the mb won't go that
fast, so one of these days I'll upgrade the mb, but I'm in no hurry), and it has
256 megs of RAM. DIMMS, of course. It also has a 16meg Matrox video card which
helps. 
    I suppose if you're a gamer or doing a lot of big graphics, you'd need more
power, but for what I'm doing. Heck, I can recall running a web server for a
fairly big library and a mail server for over 400 accounts on little 200mhz
boxes. Worked fine -- still would. 
    OTOH, if it looks like DRM is going to get mandated, I'll probably go out
and buy a dual AMD mb and a couple of 2ghz cpus, just so I'll be set for the
next decade.
