Quite. 

This doesn't seem like some 'minor' legal dispute, however. 

We have the makings for a nice constitutional crisis with the
supreme court justice most known for siding with defendants
out of the picture.

This really seems like Clipper Chip 2.0, but instead of the NSA,
which seems to at least understand the fundamentals of crypto and
spycraft, we have the FBI engaged in a *public* battle for legal
precedent, vs what appears to be an ever-expanding number of 
companies who are starting to recognize the potential negative 
impact and risk to their business if a little forum-shopping
can find your competitor a judge that will make you hand over
the keys.

As for public demand... Well, we used to think the public demanded
the defense of marriage. When I see that only 51% support the FBI
in the demand for unlocking, that's a number well worth investing
in a marketing campaign for extending the 4th amendment devices 
and their cryptosystems, if for no other reason than to lower long
term 'compliance' costs of having to hand over keys to every 
lokel yokel sheriff who wants to see what their ex-wife's been up
to.
