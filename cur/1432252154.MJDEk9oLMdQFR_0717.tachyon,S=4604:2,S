    New Copyright Bill Heading to DC
    By Declan McCullagh (declan@wired.com)
    4:19 p.m. Sep. 7, 2001 PDT

    WASHINGTON -- Music and record industry lobbyists are quietly readying
    an all-out assault on Congress this fall in hopes of dramatically
    rewriting copyright laws.

    With the help of Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of the
    Senate Commerce committee, they hope to embed copy-protection controls
    in nearly all consumer electronic devices and PCs. All types of
    digital content, including music, video and e-books, are covered.

    The Security Systems Standards and Certification Act (SSSCA),
    scheduled to be introduced by Hollings, backs up this requirement with
    teeth: It would be a civil offense to create or sell any kind of
    computer equipment that "does not include and utilize certified
    security technologies" approved by the federal government.

    It also creates new federal felonies, punishable by five years in
    prison and fines of up to $500,000. Anyone who distributes copyrighted
    material with "security measures" disabled or has a network-attached
    computer that disables copy protection is covered.

    Hollings' draft bill, which Wired News obtained on Friday, represents
    the next round of the ongoing legal tussle between content holders and
    their opponents, including librarians, programmers and open-source
    advocates.
