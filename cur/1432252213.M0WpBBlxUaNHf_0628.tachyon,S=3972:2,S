My personal recommendation for purchasing software would be 
SuSE Linux.  It will nearly double the speed of your Win98 
machine, and comes with word processors etc having greater 
functionality and reliability than those you cite below. 

At US$55. it's not a bad deal at all. Should be available 
in a shrink-wrap box with support at a Circuit City, CostCo, 
or other brick&mortar store near you.  

It's also available for free download, but it's honkin' 
large (neighborhood of 6GB if you get all the bells & 
whistles), so I wouldn't try it unless you have broadband 
and a CD burner.
