Exactly.

A pity we can't easily draw pictures here in mailinglistspace. If we 
were at a blackboard, we could easily see that the issue of 
encryption is clearly partitioned thusly:

* Alice's files, stored on her local computer or file repository. 
Maybe in plaintext, maybe in encrypted form.

* Files in transit between Alice's site and Bob's site. These should 
at the very least be link-encrypted, and possibly end-to-end 
encrypted with PKS tools. Forward secrecy is also good, so that the 
transit keys can't be recovered.

* And then of course the files at Bob's computer, in plaintext or encrypted.

Or, more simply, files at sites and files in transit.

Alice may have partners or bosses who have rules about how she leaves 
the files on her machine, encrypted or not encrypted, backed-up or 
not backed-up. But her storage is SEPARABLE from files in transit.

There are companies doing exactly this kind of document control for 
large and small companies, for hospitals, for schools, etc. They 
offer services for back ups to vaults and repositories, for key 
control, for distribution, and tools for collaboration. Mentor, 
Oracle, Adobe, and many others are in this market.

If ZKS plans to enter this market, good luck to them.
