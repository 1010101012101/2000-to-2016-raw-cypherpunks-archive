National security religion current world malware leader. Consecrated
in 1947, fastest spreading global cult of carnage fed by stupendous
growth of spying and armaments industries. Bloodthirsty, vicious,
insane with maximum killing machines against infidels who refuse to
tithe, obey, excuse, honor and applaud worst earth and human destructors
ever. Nobody exempt from sacrifice at the altar of stand-off scripture of
privileging laws and economics. And condoned by gutless humor,
idiotic cynicism, flacid critique.

This Halloween lick the spookily sacred Arlington gravestones, the
spooky stars on the sacrificial hero wall.

"Amen, inshallah, fuck you, me, the leering pumpkins and off."  - Anon
