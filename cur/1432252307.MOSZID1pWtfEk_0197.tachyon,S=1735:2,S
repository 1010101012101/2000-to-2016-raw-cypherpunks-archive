Well, there you have it, why loft your own satellites when you
can Crypto AG those of others and let them pay you to screw
them.

Who cares who owns and feeds the cows in the sky so long as you
can suckle the backdoored data for free.

No doubt NSA is happy with this piggish arrangement too, 
piggybacking on the Russkies' porgy and bess to keep aloft the 
urgent need for more US  natsec billionish boondoggles out of 
the NASA, NRO and Space Command.

Meanwhile the spook boots on the ground get all the gash 
cash to pry the sat software out of the adnoids of dick-led and
pussywhipped cipher coders who once believed they'd rule the
world with unfathomable primes.
