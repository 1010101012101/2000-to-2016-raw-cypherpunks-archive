But James, it is a no-brainer to refute an argument with
selective use of an opponents words, phrases, quotations,
arguments and beliefs. Debaters are trained and hired to 
do just this as are propagandists, spin doctors, psychiatrists,
journalists, scholars, historians, pr pros, courtiers, literary critics,
philosophers, logicians, priests, lovers, indeed most of
language and discourse is made up of such mongrelian
fabrications.

Chomsky, the linguist, knows this better than most, and
certainly more than you, an amateur by comparison. 

He makes no apology for his attacks on apologists for the 
powerful, he is merely better at it than they are. Not much
is worth doing more than helping lance the giants' scrota.

You could learn from his linguistic studies and his prowess
at detumescing opponents surely more than you can learn by 
attempting to ramrod him, for you are sure to do so at a
level much more superficial than his multi-level critiques
and in the process miss the bulk of his argumentative
substantiation -- as demonstrated by the biased, blind,
vacuousness posted by Dr. Hettinga.

Dr. Hettinga is having his fun posting a cornicopia of
light-weight straw-men disputation, aw shit call it what it 
is, lazy-minded inarticulate like that spewed all across Blueland
by preachers of blind faith in yelling the same old.

Chomsky is one smart SOB, his serious critics readily
agree he is surely the intelligent man in the USA, and they
learn from him far more than they learn from those who 
think as they do: beware the adoring choir's roundheels.
