The fact that you need a lot of ID to open a swiss bank
account, and very little ID to open a pecunix account
ultimately has everything to do with transport of FRNs

Bank accounts have value because this stuff gets moved between
the outside and the the inside of the bank.  When it gets moved
between inside and outside, the form matters.

And the ultimate holder of those marks is the federal reserve
-- whereupon you are screwed.

Reality is that you can do stuff with a gold demoninated
account that you cannot do with a federal reserve dollar
demoninated account, and you really should ask yourself:  Why
is it so?

Indeed, you can do stuff with an australian dollar demoninated
account that you cannot do with a federal reserve dollar
demoninated account, which may explain why so many internet
gold currency dealers are located in Australia.

Reality is that gold denominated accounts are different.
Observe this difference, then ask yourself why is it so.
