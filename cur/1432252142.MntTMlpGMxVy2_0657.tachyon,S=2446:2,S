I understand there is this thing called a black budget. The production
rate limit of plain text is human fingers. If you want to keep it all
online, your burn rate is a kilobuck/day for hardware.

Filtering traffic to extract relevant parts is going to cost a bit more,
especially if you're using centralized taps and not server clouds in the
periphery.

For those of you who have worked at major ISPs, can the fact that traffic is
routed through a few "customer" boxes be hidden from employees?
