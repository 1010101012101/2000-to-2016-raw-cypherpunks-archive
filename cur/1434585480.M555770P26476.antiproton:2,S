I concede to that point.

Dude, that is racist. I think. Calling all Americans cunts. Such a big

So, I happen to know a few people that are marines. They don't like

Basically anyone you actually get to meet and say hello to. What do you 
think they are? Big bad bulky continuously angry men?

Okay, lets try Bakunin, because for a guy who does not no anything about 
Anarchism I sure know about him. He claims to "organize from below, 
through local structures interlinked on a federalist basis". I agree 
with Bakunin on this point. It also happens to be a form of direct 
democracy.

Can also be considered to be a government without stretching the term in 
any way.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism

Oh, crikey, federalism is a form of government.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy

Oh fuck, it is mainly used by a horde of anarchist writers :D

No no, I'm not dishonest. It's just that you're polarizing. You can't 
find an individual to blame like a proper anarchist. So you blame a 
group. Like a fucking Nazi.

Well, that's a stretch since, well I can type my fingers raw with 
anarchist examples of governments, either in literature or in actuality.
