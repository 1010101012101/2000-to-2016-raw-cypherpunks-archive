Exactly. There are _many_ ways to vote. The polls are open for 13 
hours, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Claims that "working people" can't get to the 
polls are ludicrous. If anything, in fact, it's the Silicon Valley 
programmer who may have a hard time getting away from the office 
during those hours.

In any case, the claim that St. Louis  needed to have its polling 
hours extended into the late evening because Latisha LaFonda was 
incorrectly registered and couldn't vote at 10 _a.m._ is what makes 
it all so ludicrous.

"We want the polling places to be open until at least 2:30 a.m. a 
half hour after the bars close. We gots to be thinkin' 'bout our 
con-stit-a-ents!"
