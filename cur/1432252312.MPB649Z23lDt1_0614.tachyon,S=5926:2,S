Have you experimented with doing that drill under stress or 
simulating a hand injury?  I think you'll find the design lacking.

You bring up one of my other objections to the design- The fluted 
chamber is tough on the brass.  If you don't reload it isn't a 
problem however, but the fluting puts striations on the brass that 
weakens it for subsequent use.  I've heard that certain loads 
(Silvertips) foul up the gas system on the P7 quicker than other 
designs.  If the P7 works and if your particular gun works for you 
and your happy with it that's great.  Personally I'd stack up my 
Sig226 or Beretta 92FS against the P7 anytime.
