Well, May seemed to try to make the case that all of those "useles eaters" 
were in large part responsible for the very existence of the state, and that 
collapse of the state meant the inevitable downfall of huge numbers of 
minorities (why he focused on them as opposed to white trailer trash I don't 
know).

But he was definitely advocating that racist viewpoints fall naturally out 
of a crypto-anarchic approach.
