Perhaps I killed my point in editing.  

Laws exist as a result of people using their property to advance their agenda 
and/or to protect their property.  

That companies decided not to fight the passage of harassment laws was a 
decision they made about how they used their property.  That companies today 
give in rather than fight them is also their decision.

Corporations tend to value their own property over the free expression of 
their employees.  Should this be surprising?  Is it wrong?  Should property 
owners be compelled to value the free expression of their employees higher 
than they do?    

I don't like the current result any more than you do, but it's not the result 
of living in an unfree society, it's the result of living in a society with 
different values than our own.  

In other words, to get the freedoms we want, we have to take away other 
freedoms.

Well, I'll always miss the point of people complaining about not living 
in a free society/economy when they use reasons that indicate they don't 
really want to live in a free society/economy.  

I want to keep this short, but there's something to be said for a free society 
being either impossible or a truth.  In a free society, you're free to do 
something, and others are free to try and stop you.  Either this makes a 
free society impossible because of conflicting ideals or it's a truth because 
people are always free to attempt changing society.  Laws and governments 
you don't like are an indication that the other side currently has the upper 
hand, but you're still free to try changing them.  Until you give up or 
die, you're free.

Perhaps it's not a free society you want, but a society with a higher value 
on private/personal freedoms.  Perhaps you even want a society that values 
private freedoms higher than private property.
