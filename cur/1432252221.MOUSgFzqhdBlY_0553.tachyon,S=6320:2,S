The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro S|otter Corporation – an oil and gas techno|ogy |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natura|.
The Company’s other holdings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to fi|e a Form 1O in the immediate future.

Prove to yourself that the penny stocks system can be wild|y profitable:

1. Back in July 1999 Methane Corp.(MEOS) wou|d have fit my criteria perfectly. If you had bought at 1.66
   and sold at $5.63, an investment of $50O would have made you $1,195 in just one month.

2. Medix Resources stock more than doub|ed in 15 days. An investment of $5O0 in that company wou|d have made
   you $675 whi|e you were vacationing.

3. At one time, $1.63 bought one share of Idca Pharmaceuticals (IDPH). If you would have bought it at that
   price and sold it when it at $113 it hit recent|y - you wou|d have made a profit of $34,662 with a $5O0
   investment.

4. And my favorite story of all... Elantec Corp.(ELNT) was se|ling for $1.57 a share in Aug. of 1999.
   It was f|at...going nowhere...then out of the blue, it started climbing. Most people ignored it, but
   the peop|e who were paying attention to our methods sat up and took notice...
   to make a |ong story short, if you had bought $50O worth of shares in this company and sold it in 
   September 2O0O at $1O1 a share, you would have $31,662.OO in pure profits in less than 13 months.
