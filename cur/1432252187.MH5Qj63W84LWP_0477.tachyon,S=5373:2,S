I agree, I did say 'amusing'...

I'm not one of those 'you people'. Arguments from authority are of no
worth. Past performance is not a reliable metric for future performance.
The ends never justify the means, each step must self-justify.

Actually both. The 1870 law which created the modern monster of a
'corporation' should be thrown out. Corporations, and other business
organizations, should be able to sell to their like type across the
relevant 'big pond'. A corporation should not be able to exist in two
different countries as a single organization.

So what solution(s) have you thought of? Quid pro Quo...

Business is an expression of individual rights. Business should not be
able to contribute in any way to the democratic process (there is a reason
that business/commerce is mentioned the way it is in the Constitution...

An observation that is sure to piss some C-A-C-L's off, but the reality is
that in 'free market' economics ala Hayek or Von Mises the potential for
'Bill Gates' wealth is nil. A 'free market' system isn't about getting
filthy rich. It's about participating in a 'community'.

Bottom line, the world is the way it is because people make it that way.
It is not an inviolate law of nature (or if you accept that then some
other precepts become questionable; free will, rational, responsible,
pre-meditation, etc. ).
