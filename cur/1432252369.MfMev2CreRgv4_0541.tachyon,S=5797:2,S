Have you ever been in a brawl where one side (or both) has friends?

Sucker punching tends to violate the norms of honorable conduct.  If you
down the first guy, but have to deal with three of his friends, the
issue becomes a bit less clear cut.  Concepts of "unfair advantage" tend
to escalate:  sucker punches lead to friends, knives, back alleys,
and/or heat.

That's more or less where the perps of the 9/11 attacks find themselves
at the moment.

The other side of the argument is the bee'n'the bull theory.  Sure, the
bee can get in the first lick, but you've now got one pissed-off bull.
If your sucker punch *doesn't* land the fellow, you've got consequences
to deal with.  I'd say the US is currently stung, but by no means
hurting in any diminished-capacity sense of the word.  This doesn't
strike be as good strategic thinking on our oponents' part.

I did make a halfhearted attempt to search through TAoW looking at
strategic guidelines.  I'll give it another shot and see what I turn up.

Peace.
