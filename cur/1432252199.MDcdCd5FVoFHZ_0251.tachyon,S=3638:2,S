I'm reminded of something from the bad old days of the Soviet Union.
Refuseniks and other protestors in Red Square used to earnestly plead their
case to the KGB agents as they were being arrested.  It was as though the
logic, morality, humanity or whatever of their arguments would somehow
penetrate the conscience of the thugs who were hauling them in.  It didn't.

It won't be any more effective on the Cypherpunks list either.  Any
Federales who might still have some shred of decency, respect for the Bill
of Rights, or even just a sense of fairness, are way outnumbered by immoral
careerist who have no compunctions about cheating, lying and destroying
innocent lives on their way to retirement and a fat government pension.

The three most important things good people can do are:

* "Write code"--for real and metaphorically.

* Refuse to take the bait when the Federales troll.

* Realize and embrace your moral superiority to the thugs of the world.
