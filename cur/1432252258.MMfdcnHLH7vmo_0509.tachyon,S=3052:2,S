Byrd has stolen vast amounts of money to support his cronies.

The number of "slave-lives" (via taxation) to build the "Robert Byrd  
Memorial Memorials" is in the  high tens of thousands. according to  
Tribunal Watch, the watchdog group keeping tabs on the high crimes of  
everyone in government.

Byrd dislikes the Bush War because he couldn't get in on any of the  
Halliburon, Bechtel, Zapata, and Wackenhut largesse. His hopes were  
dashed when West Virginia was passed-over for the site of Camp X-Ray  
and when, worst of all, WVa was not selected as the processing center  
for Iraqis to pay their taxes through. He'd been counting on his usual  
rakeoff.
