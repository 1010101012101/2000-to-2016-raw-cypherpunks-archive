Borrowing from a private comment from Bob Jueneman, whatever the technical
community decides that non-repudiation means, it probably isn't what the legal
community means.  So be it.  Certainly the legal profession uses ordinary English
words to mean other than their ordinary meaning in a particular context, and so
do other professions.

BTW, consider the word "impregnable".  Everyone knows what it means, right?

Wrong!

Consider the sentence "Alice is impregnable."  It has two diametrically opposite meanings!

Of course not, and we agree this much. That is why I wrote earlier that
non-repudiation is not a "stronger" authentication or a long-lived one.
In my view, a non-repudiation proof could be disqualifed by an authentication
proof. Non-repudiation does NOT trump authentication -- which is what this
original thread (First Monday  article) proposed, based on some mythical
"trusted systems".

Regarding the word prevent, Merriam-Webster teaches that PREVENT implies
taking advance measures against something possible or  probable
<measures taken to prevent leaks>.  This is the first meaning -- after this
comes ANTICIPATE and, at last, FORESTALL.  So, while you say that Random
House teaches that FORESTALL is the first meaning, I do not see as this as the rule.
And, in this specific case it does not even make sense to use FORESTALL because
there is nothing to be interrupted -- but it does make a lot of sense IMO to take
advance measures against a probable or possible denial.

So, non-repudiation is a service that take advance measures against a probable
or possible denial of an act. In other words, PREVENTS the denial of an act.

This is the standard meaning in cryptography applications.  Maybe it is already
similar or becomes similar to the meaning used by lawyers, or by banks.  Good for
them!

OTOH, some lawyers and lawmakers are oftentimes the first ones to use the term
"identifty theft" -- which simply is not a theft, it is impersonation.  I hope we
in crypto don't have to use "identity theft" as well. And, they can continue to use it.

Cheers,

Ed Gerck
