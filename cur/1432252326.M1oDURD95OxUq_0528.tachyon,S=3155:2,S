It's symptomatic of the age gap on the list -- you, me, RAH (now there's a
combination) and others are *way* beyond the 20-something party crowd.  Even
if I lived in the area, there'd be lots of stuff I'd rather do than go to
the party.  I hope they have lots of (age-appropriate) fun, though.  A new
(minor) era dawning and all that...
