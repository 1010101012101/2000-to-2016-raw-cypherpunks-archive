"The remaining communists have made some
psychological recovery - see for example Tyler Durden's
peculiar version of recent history, where in his universe the
communists actually won and are still winning,"

Again, you live in a world that's evenly divided between black and white. 
Since I'm not white you figure I must be black.

To reiterate a point your world view does not seem prepared to understand, 
communism (like Whabism these days) is a fleeting ideological counter-pole 
to the perceived evils of America and capitalism. To make an analogy, let's 
say someone on the street tried to force-feed you the most healthy food in 
the world at gun point. There's a good chance that, after that, you will not 
eat that healthy food any longer because you perceive it to be "evil". 
Likewise with Imperliasm and free markets: The more we try to shove it down 
the throats of the Islamic world the more they will reject both us as well 
as whatever we're trying to give 'em.
