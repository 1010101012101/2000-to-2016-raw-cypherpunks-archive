But it does, in fact.  It costs you the effort to look at it (and
distinguish it from desired mail) and that might mean you have to physically
open it up.  Then, you have to dispose of it, and that involves not merely
tossing it into the trash, but setting it out to be picked up once a week.
(Of course, those who burn their own trash may actually see "Uncle Spam" as
BTU's  (excuse me, calories or joules.))

A few years ago I proposed that email senders should be given the option of
including a small amount of digital cash along with that email, as
compensation for the inconvenience.  Email programs could be programmed to
sort the email in order of "tribute" sent:  I could very easily ignore an
email that gave me 1 penny, but I'd be intrigued by an email that included
$1.

"Spammers" who actually had an offer that a large fraction of the recipients
would be interested in could easily afford $1 per email, or more.
