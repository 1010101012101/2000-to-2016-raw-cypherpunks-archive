No Open Source license has that big a penetration into the market when
compared to non-Open Source. Half a smidjen and a smidjen, when faced with
a dump trunk...

In addition, the Open Source movement is less than 20 years old, approx.
ten years old with respect to providing real alternatives to closed
source. That's a pretty short period as things go to be making claims of
stability of any sort, including licenses.

No, they're concerned with making money. They have to live with licenses.

Sure didn't slow down the Open Source folks.

By this argument you should be a real proponent of the Closed Source model
;)

ALL license speak to ghosts in the closet. If somebody didn't have some
sort of goal involved they wouldn't license the software in the first
place (it wouldn't even be written). The distinction between some group of
teenagers or college kids and your favorite corporation is specious. The
only difference is the number of marbles in the bucket.

Which is a major disadvantage in my book.

But it doesn't preclude them via other channels. To say that simply
because the water got dirty when we washed the baby we shouldn't keep the
baby just doesn't work for me. Hint, the software is not the point, ever.

The reality is that simply because the 'standard corporate model' doesn't
work with Open Source is an obvious consequence of understanding the
intent of Open Source and should surprise nobody.

Which simply demonstrates why these failed efforts simply support the
rule. Open Source is a totaly different head.

No users, no point in doing the software. I have to disagree. Irrespective
of intent or scale the customer must come first in all situations.
Developers don't buy products (or services as a consequence of use) at
anywhere the scale of consumers. Developers also don't do service.

Of this I agree.

That's fine if you can deal with the 'inertia' of the 'escrow'...it's
actually counter productive to all concerned in the vast majority of
cases. One of the hopes (admittedly not realized to a great extent to
date) of Open Source was one of innovation. Of providing a forum for
experimentation that was low cost but high quality.

For users the compatibility they care about is, will the product co-exist.
Outside of that most users couldn't care less. Distributors want to sell
whatever will solve customer issues and increase their ROI, $.

If you want to understand a situation; follow the $$$, not the lawyers.
