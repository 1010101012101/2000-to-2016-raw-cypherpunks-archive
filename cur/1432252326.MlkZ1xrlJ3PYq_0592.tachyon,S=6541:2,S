It is an issue similar to the issue of trust when you walk into a bazaar - a
free market with *many* of two kinds of people: *buyers* and *sellers*.

By requiring everyone to have an "identity" card from the Queen of England**
herself, it just makes the Queen more equal than anyone else. Soon, you cannot
do business selling tomatoes grown in your backyard without a special license
from the Queen - to ensure that you only used "approved" seeds... and on it goes.

Grow up people - you have to do the work of learning to trust - all by yourself.

You better learn quick that trusting your friends is better than trusting the
Queen of England herself - for neither you nor I know the Queen, and it seems
she is a prisoner of certain people.

If, on the first visit, you are using a poisoned DNS system, or on a compromised
operating system, then foo on you. The future will have neither, except at the
option of the losers who wish to be losers.

Cheers,

---Venkat.

** Just picking a familiar Head of State, it could very well be your CA, a petty
government official, the Drivers License bureau, or some Wizard from the Land of
Oz. It does seem though, that the Queen of England is herself a prisoner to
certain powers, so how do you know that Fairysign is not?
