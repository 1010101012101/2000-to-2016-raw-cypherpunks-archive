Congress does not have to follow any constitutional directives.

The congress of the united States of America was ajourned sine die in the mid nineteen century.

What sits in washington is an entity named "congress" that is there only to implement Admiralty 
Jurisdiction (Roman Law) on the land (i.e. despotism).

The constitution, even if questionnable, applies only to men and women, not to "persons" under 
Admiralty-type "laws".  In facts, they are not laws but legislations...

M'dears, you've been under Martial law applied by the corporation called "United States) since 150 
years...  What do you think that gold fringe around the flag means, exactly?  What do you think the 
lance tip or the round ball (signifying the last cannon ball shot) means exactly?

You are either a *C*itizen of the united States of America or a *c*itizen of the United States.

The former has unalianeble rights, the later only has privileges.

Duh!

And the second you accept the court's juridiction, you tacitely accepted the contract that makes you a 
"person" (from greek "persona", a theatre mask, an assumed identity) under Admiralty law.

So, why the big surprise and revolt?  As you slave, you have only one duty: shut up and obey!  Any 
shit stirring would be akin mutiny or slave revolt.

As long as you don't claim your rights under Anglo-Saxon Common Law, you have no rights but only 
priviledges.
