Well, a secure H.323 is certainly better than nothing, but as of right now 
the world looks like its going to remain circuit switched for a long time. 
That means most standard telephone calls will potentially be under scrutiny, 
unless encryption is used at the end points. And I guess that's where one 
would ultimately want to do that anyway...
