Am I wrong or is there a latent idea here that the list members are in a
position to choose whether or not these ( yes, Virginia, they're
morality neutral ) privacy enhancing technolgies come to be? While the
participants here may represent a large portion of those interested and
capable of producing PETs they aren't the whole club. If there is a
privacy and untraceability sweet spot why suppose that it is not already
exploited by those with large financial gains to be made from it? 

Were a major drug cartel ( or a large corporation ) to decide that
developing communications systems was a key factor in their continuing
success it seems to me that the resources to do so would be easy to come
by. Hell, they were making a pretty decent sized submarine not so long
ago. I think a SW/HW product effort would be far easier to hide. There's
probably a shop full of busy Russian engineers somehwere in SA right
now. I don't believe that a whole battalion of  Gordons could ever stop
them.

All that you can choose is whether you participate in creating PETs or
not.

Have the GRU list-watchers ( your handlers! ) demonstrated their power
adequately by shtomping a few punk heads?

Has speech here been sufficiently chilled that nobody will answer?

Or is it just a dumb question? 

Create a real project with real rewards ( both financial and idealogical
but mostly financial ) and see what kind of response you get. Why should
anyone answer a dishonest question for free?
