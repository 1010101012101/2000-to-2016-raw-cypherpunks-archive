This does not sound nearly as much like a "computer upgrade" as 
a "security downgrade".  When you make top-secret files easier to 
move around the network, you make them easier to steal.

No matter what the precautions are, wider access to people within 
the organization means more access for people who want to 
supplement their civil-servant incomes by selling secrets. 
Even if the technology is perfect, the people are a weak 
link and the more of them you put on a list the likelier it 
is that there's a broken link. 

On the other hand, we could see some interesting things if the 
technological solutions to this set of secure communications 
problems is ever made public. It amuses me to think they may 
wind up using off-the-shelf solutions like kerberos and PGP.
