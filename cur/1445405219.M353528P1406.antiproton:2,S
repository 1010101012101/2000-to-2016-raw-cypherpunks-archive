De nada :) As I recall, it's also true for IPs, but I didn't find a
source. One could sumif the blockchain data by IP, and then get country
from MaxMind etc. There aren't too many Tor or VPN exits in China.

Right. I was taking "the chinese" more as the Chinese people. Or
whoever's buying Bitcoin, anyway. But regarding the thread overall, I do
believe that the Chinese government is divesting US bonds. They don't
want to fuck up the US economy by doing that quickly. But they also
don't want their investments to be devalued as the US prints money, ever
faster and faster.

Long term, as I understand it, they plan for yuan to replace dollar as
global fiat. They do own lots of gold, but I don't recall anything about
going gold standard. If you have cites, that would be cool.

It's my impression that Chinese people are generally very into saving.
But judging by the stock craziness, they aren't very sane about what
they invest in. Gold has always been popular. Bitcoins were a fad for a
while, but that's cooled off since the Mt Gox bubble collapsed in early
2014. The current ~70% share maybe just reflects population.
