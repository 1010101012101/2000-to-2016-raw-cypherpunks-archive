"The VSPA (Video Surveillance Protection Architecture) is a completely 
voluntary arrangement whereby video cameras must be installed by 2003 in 
all new and remodeled homes, apartments, places of business, libraries, 
and other such places. These cameras and microphones can be used 
voluntarily by parents and other concerned persons to monitor children, 
pets, and domestic workers. Under the VSPA, the video feed will be sent 
to a centralized location where homeowners and parents may then access 
the feed, strictly voluntarily.

"While installation of VSPA will be mandated by law in all new and 
remodeled homes, the use of VSPA features is strictly on an opt-in 
basis, except as authorized by law (*).

"* Note that VSPA features may be accessed by court order, by 
presidential emergency order, by authorization of an employee of the 
Justice, Defense, Interior, or HomeSec departments who is above the 
grade level GS-7. During periods of Domestic Emergency, the President or 
the HomeSec Commissar may enable the VSPA on a regional or state or 
national basis. Additionally, Child Protective Services, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and other selected agencies may be 
granted access, all subject to strict oversight by government officials.

"Remember, VSPA is a completely voluntary system. The installation of 
the VSPA cameras and microphones will assist us all. The legitimate 
needs of law enforcement will be subject to careful oversight.

"Best of all, a substantial tax credit will be granted to those who 
voluntarily install the VSPA system prior to the mandatory phase-in 
time. To pay for the voluntary VSPA system, taxes will be raised for 
those who fail to volunteer."
