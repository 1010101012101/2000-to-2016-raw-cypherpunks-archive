TODAY'S NEWSLETTER LOOKS AT LEADING CLASSIC-GROWTH STOCKS FOR THE 
LONG-TERM INVESTOR

Classic-growth companies, which have grown steadily for years, have 
predictable earnings and stock prices that perform well over time. 
Many classic-growth companies also have household-name brands that 
have become classics in their own time. These companies earn high 
marks for profitability, financial health, and valuation--three key 
measures that investors should consider before purchasing any stock. 
In today's newsletter, we look at the strongest firms that fit into 
the classic-growth category.
