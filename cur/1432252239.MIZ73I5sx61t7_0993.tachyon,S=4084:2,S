1. You should not rely on their encryption alone, you should use your
own crypto on
whatever you store there.   You can carry your whole environment --incl.

copies of tools, digsigs,and keyrings -- with you.   You do, of course,
have
to trust the hardware/OS you use it with.  "If you don't know the
socket,
keep your dongle in your pants"

2. If you use your 'nose' you need to borrow other noses to do a signal
detection study ---tally hits, misses, false alarms, false positives.
Then
get back to us.  We can even characterize and compare the performance
of say human sentries this way; even measure their fatigue, perhaps.  If
the
FAA/TSA has half a clue they've done this for their x-ray snoopers.
