But unlike stego, where the issue is faking the noise, personal fingerprints
can be removed from the message more reliably. You just need the right gloves.

One way is to use automated translators. They all have an "internal language"
and modules that translate to and from it. The internal language is far more
restricted than the natural one, so it doesn't leak many aspects of the
linguistic fingerprint. Going to the internal form is "lossy" compression.
There is no way to recreate the original.

The simplest method is an englih-to-english translator. Better method, and
thicker gloves, can be used by going through several from/to modules for
different languages. In commercial engines the meaning starts to suffer after
3-4 steps but just before that happens the word ordering and use gets
completely skewed.

Of course, you have to buy the translator and not use the online
google/babelfish access. It's the small things that get you ...
