on AA, if you look down between the seats, on the
armrest base, there is a little connector there that
gives out 12V and looks remarkably like the cigarette
lighter plug in your car!  Use that people..and
pressure your airlines to install more (First class
gets the AC plug to boot), or threaten them that as
you refill your fuelcel in flight, that the bumpy ride
will make you spill some and people will think you are
trying to start a fire.
