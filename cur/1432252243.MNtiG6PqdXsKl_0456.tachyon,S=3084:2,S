Depending on how good your local library is, they may be able to get you a
copy on interlibrary loan. I managed to get ahold of a copy of X9.19 that
way.

If ITU works anything like the ABA, they'll charge you about $4/page to get
one of these from them (at least that's the rate X9.19 came to). PKCS and
other online sources seem your best bet for this by far.
