Verifying US-UK concordance, with FBI head, Director of NSA said
much the same as GCHQ to the US Chamber of Commerce on
October 28, 2014:

https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/speeches_testimonies/28oct14_dirnsa.shtml

These heads of spy and LE agencies are proposing that companies
and citizens continue to serve and become spies, agents, informers,
coverts in mirroring their enemies of their security states. And not only
are asking for patriotic volunteers by sticks of fear and aiding
the enemy but contracting for services by carrots of privileged
briefings, access, profits and tax write-offs. No wonder oligarchs
are increasing and are rushing to aid and abet spies in all
countries.

Will First Look's Racket magazine come to life to join
The Intercept, so buzzworthily named to fit what they
do: front for First Look Media's invention and distribution
of comsec products which if true to the ancients' practice
will spy on the populace with everylasting panoptic look.

This is hardly new, indeed is as old as governments and their
precursor "lawful" rulers of the populace which cannot be
trusted with anarchic self-rule, much less armed with treasonous
cryptoanarchy for absolute right to privacy from rulers.

Even this list of rogues was founded and struggles to survive on
its impossible mission to resist this ancient history and current
fervor of duplicity and dual-use of the ever growing family of
securities -- personal, home, clan, region, nation, global,
religion, ideology -- deployed to simultaneously attack and
protect the populace by declaring who is insider and who
is outsider, take your pick, save your life. Us or them. Divide
and conquer. Praise and smear. Lop heads and drone. Imprison
and exile.

Significantly for this clan, comsec remains an essential tool
for attacking and protecting. It annoys the masters of comsec
no end for rogues to mess with their command and control
communications and ubiquitous civic spying operations.

It requires recruitment of comsec rogues to mess with rogues,
as amply demonstrated here and other security fora where
coders and hackers are prime candidates for quietly switching
sides, remaining in place, covertly informing, sabotaging,
implanting, faulting, I/O erroring, pretending opposition to the
state, stashing their fees, teaching cryptology, advising NGOs,
counseling dissidents, whistling Dixie for media and audiences,
advocating openness, disclosing shallow vulns to hide
the deeper.

This list goes on, as evidenced here and on the gobs of
freedom of information outlets which have spread as widely
as the Internet, black net, deep net, chats, OTRs, Tor, and
now cellphone webs and swarms of earnest instigators
indistinguishable from TLAs taking 100% and giving back
at best 50%, with bountiful support from freedom-loving
oligarchs, soliciting volunteers, paying overseers of
volunteers, accruing profits by shifting taxation to the
populace for their protection and spying on it to assure
system security, oiled with bounties, bonuses and
Sabu-grade walk-frees awards for whistleblowing on the
whistleblowing, and not least, enduring legal fees for ACLU-
grade justice tipped against oppostion to civil liberties
racketeering aided and abetted by backdoored comsec
also known as rule of law.
