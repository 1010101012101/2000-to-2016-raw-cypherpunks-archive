While the recount of the FL ballots is going on the Democrats are now
complaining about the format of the ballot and threating legal action. It
seems that the ballot is "confusing". The complaint is that the double
sided ballot contained 2 columns on each side rather than one.

I personally used the FL ballot. It was large, well printed, and quite
legible. Anyone who was "confused" by it's format is just too dam stupid
to vote.

I am starting to get the feeling that the SC is going to decide this
election before it is all over. :(
