It occurred to me that this would be a good topic for an organized 
online debate.  The results of which could be posted around.

Jim Warren <jwarren@well.com> or "Jonathan Wallace" <jw@bway.net> 
would make good and fair moderators-  Jonathan especially so since he 
has already participated in a similar debate on my mailing list and 
on his online zine The Ethical Spectacle http://www.spectacle.org/ . 
In that debate-  Both participants were lawyers so they wrote rather 
extensive and good ground rules for the debate.  But any trusted 
third party would work.

A debate such as this will remove any "heat of the moment" commentary 
and might provide more light than heat?

What do you think?

Regards,  Matthew Gaylor-
