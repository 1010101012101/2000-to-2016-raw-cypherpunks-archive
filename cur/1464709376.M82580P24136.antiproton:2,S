*All your disk image are belong to us, says appeals courtCourt says your

*by David Kravets - May 31, 2016*

The government can prosecute and imprison people for crimes based on
evidence obtained from their computers=E2=80=94even evidence retained for y=
ears
that was outside the scope of an original probable-cause search warrant, a
US federal appeals court has said in a 100-page opinion paired with a
blistering dissent.

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
<http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/d1aa55fc-fb04-4abd-a9c6-f1=
9955449fc9/1/doc/12-240petcomb_opn.pdf#xml=3Dhttp://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/de=
cisions/isysquery/d1aa55fc-fb04-4abd-a9c6-f19955449fc9/1/hilite/>
that there was no constitutional violation because the authorities acted in
good faith when they initially obtained a search warrant, held on to the
files for years, and built a case unrelated to the original search.

The case posed a vexing question=E2=80=94how long may the authorities keep
somebody's computer files that were obtained during a search but were not
germane to that search? The convicted accountant said that only the
computer files pertaining to his client=E2=80=94who was being investigated =
as part
of an Army overbilling scandal=E2=80=94should have been retained by the gov=
ernment
during a 2003 search. All of his personal files, which eventually led to
his own tax-evasion conviction, should have been purged, he argued.

But the appeals court said the authorities' behavior was acceptable and
didn't reach the constitutional question of whether the Fourth Amendment
rights were breached for accountant Stavros Ganias, who was sentenced to
two years in prison. That's because three years after the original search
of the accountant's files in connection to the Army scandal, Connecticut
authorities got another search warrant for Ganias' own tax files that were
already in the government's possession, the appeals court ruled in a 12-1
decision Friday written by Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Gerard Lynch.
Ganias had subsequently deleted those files from his hard drives after the
government had imaged them, according to court records:

Defendant-Appellant Stavros Ganias appeals from a judgment of the United
> States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Thompson, J.)
> convicting him, after a jury trial, of two counts of tax evasion in

round

*The case is clearly nuanced, but it has huge ramifications for the public
because many people keep all of their papers and effects co-mingled on
their hard drives.*

In his 40-page dissent, Judge Denny Chin blasted the majority opinion and
said the authorities wrongly seized files from Ganias that were unrelated
to the Army overbilling investigation. "The government did precisely what
the Fourth Amendment forbids: it entered Ganias' premises with a warrant to
seize certain papers and indiscriminately seized=E2=80=94and retained=E2=80=
=94all papers
instead," Chin wrote.

This is not the first time the appeals court entertained the case. Last
year, the court sided
<http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-ca2-12-00240/pdf/USCOURTS-ca2-12-002=
40-0.pdf>
(PDF) with Ganias in a 2-1 ruling. But the government asked for the full
appeals court to rehear the case en banc, and the court agreed to do so
with all 13 judges. The court's original ruling for Ganias said
investigators had a right to image Ganias' three hard drives at the center
of the Army overbilling dispute. But the majority concluded that the law
did not allow "officials executing a warrant for the seizure of particular
data on a computer to seize and indefinitely retain every file on a
computer for use in future criminal proceedings."

Ganias' lawyer, Stanley Twardy, urged the government to set aside his
client's conviction.

*"The seizure and two-and-a-half year retention of every file on Ganias'
computers violated the Fourth Amendment,"* Twardy
=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B
wrote <http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/twardy.pdf>.
(PDF) He told the New York-based appeals court that "at a minimum the
Fourth Amendment requires prompt completion of an off-site review and
return of files outside the warrant's scope."

The government countered, "Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the
government may obtain a search warrant for nearly any person, place, or
thing if the government establishes probable cause for the search and did
not engage in an illegal seizure of the item to be searched," Assistant US
Attorney Sandra Glover wrote in the government's
