If you're willing to sacrifice some performance and power efficiency, you
can always use an FPGA. The tools aren't open, but it seems like it would
be a lot harder to make an FPGA or FPGA tools to backdoor arbitrary
circuits. You could potentially do the "reflections on trusting trust"
thing and detect and backdoor each of the major open source processor
cores, but it seems pretty unlikely that such a thing wouldn't leak.

On the other hand, I also seriously doubt Intel CPUs are backdoored, so
maybe my paranoia isn't properly calibrated. Even if you generally trust
Intel, though, FPGAs could still potentially protect you from all the
investment the NSA has undoubtedly put into finding bugs and side channels
in the widely used CPUs, though. And being much simpler, something like
OpenRisc or J1 or SPARC v8 probably has far fewer places for such
flaws/side channels to hide.

On the gripping hand, none of those processors gives you an equivalent of
Intel's TXT mode, and I'm not sure but it's probably much easier to dump
internal state from an FPGA, so you could be more vulnerable to cold boot
and evil maid attacks.
