Given the prevalance of password sniffers as early as 1993, and given 
that credit card number sniffing is technically easier -- credit card 
numbers will tend to be in a single packet, and comprise a 
self-checking string, I stand by my statement.

Given what a small percentage of ecommerce goes to those sites, I don't 
think it's really noticeable.

Sure -- but setting up WEP is a nuisance.  SSL (mostly) just works.  As 
for your assertion that no one is listening, I'm not sure what kind of 
evidence you'd seek.  There's plenty of evidence that people abuse 
unprotected access points to gain connectivity.

Sure -- that's certainly the easy way to do it.

I meant precisely what I said and I stand by my statement.  I'm quite 
well aware of the difference between network sniffers and keystroke 
loggers.

They're using cache contamination attacks, among other things.

I agre completely that virtually no one checks certificates (or even 
knows what they are).
