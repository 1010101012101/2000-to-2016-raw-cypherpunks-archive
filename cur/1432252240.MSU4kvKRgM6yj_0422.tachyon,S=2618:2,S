The same consensus as runs the international human rights 
commission that condemns Israel while blessing Sudan?

The ICC and the world court have a track record that resembles 
the lowest common demoninator of the governments that sponsor 
it - They support tyrrany, terror, and slavery, and shattering 
confiscation of property.

For all that is wrong with the US government, remember the 
condition  of people under the great majority of the world: 
poverty and fear, where the political privilege of a few 
shatters the economy and forces the vast majority into poverty, 
for example India, Burma, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan, Cuba 
Indonesia, and all the rest.

If we were subject to the power of those governments that 
compose the majority of the world's governments, we would be as 
poor, unfree, and frightened as the subjects of those 
governments.
