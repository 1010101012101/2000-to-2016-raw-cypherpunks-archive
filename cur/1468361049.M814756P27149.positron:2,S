I call these "Network Security Axioms."  You will recognize most of
them, I am sure.  A couple are originals.


Everything is under control; your control or someone else's.

A trusted system is one that can break your security model.

A hardened perimeter is easily broken; a hardened system, not so much.

The laws of nations are easily broken; the laws of physics, not so much.

In God we trust, all others provide full source code for peer review.

Given enough observers, all bugs are shallow.

To make a system stronger, attack it.

Physical access can compromise any network security model.

A failed data backup may cost more than a successful break-in.

An unexamined assumption is a ticking time bomb.

User refusal is the principal barrier to secure networking.

Three years old, but holding up fairly well:
