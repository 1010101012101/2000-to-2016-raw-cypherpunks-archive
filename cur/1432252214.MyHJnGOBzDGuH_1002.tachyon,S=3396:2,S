No, and neither are corporate customers, to a large extent.

Accountability is, in fact, a treasured property of business computing.
 

Lack of accountability creates things like Enron, Anderson Consulting,
Oil-for-Food scams, and the missing 9 billion dollars or so of
reconstruction aid.  It's the fuel that propells SPAM, graft, and
identity theft.

What I've not seen is much work providing accountability for anonymous
transactions.

It's a shame people persist in thinking a single solution will satify
everyone, as though computing was somehow different from everything else
in life.
