"With Iraq's judicial system in disarray after the end of the war, Paul Bremer
said a special criminal court would be set up.

He said the court would try people, "in particular senior Baathists... may have
committed crimes against the coalition, who are trying to destabilise the
situation"."

   So you invade a country, and the patriots who resist you are no longer
soldiers, even guerillas, but "criminals" to be tried in the US's weird new
courts, probably secretly with no representation. 

   Velkomen, to ze New Verld Order. Sieg Heil! And may Jesus bless you.
