*slap* Now I'm doing it. It must be osmosis or something. I'm also
aware that I'm nitpicking in both these posts.

I should have added "and 'no; in intermediate cases such as dusk or
dawn."  Either way, the point is that English and most, if not all,
languages I'm aware of have this particular problem. Some artificial
languages, such as Lojban, tend to discourage this by, among other
things, requiring or encouraging the respondant to restate the true
portion of the statement.
