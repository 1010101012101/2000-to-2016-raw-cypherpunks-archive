   "Irrational" is what I call junkies so desperate for a fix that they don't
care how it affects anyone else.

   That's their perogative, they just can't force others to indulge along with
them.

   Oh, another one who either can't read or is just too clueless to get
it. Nobody, but nobody, here has suggested outlawing tobacco (although,
actually, now that I think of it, maybe it should be until such time all other
drugs are freed -- boy, would that be fun to watch all those nic junkies
murdering one another to get a fix). If you'd read the thread, what part of
"forcing others to smoke" don't you understand?
