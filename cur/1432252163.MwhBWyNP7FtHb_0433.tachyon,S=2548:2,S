Condit was apparently caught throwing stuff out before
the search of his apartment. Specifically, a box that
held a pair of glasses. Someone saw him throwing it
out, reported it to the DC police, they retreived it
from the trash, tracked it down to another adulterous
affair.

And the [black] minister who said his daughter had
an affair with Condit but wouldn't admit it because
of threats, has now recanted, saying he made it up.

Cheeyeah, right.
