Any speculations on which half?  My guess is that he agrees on
affirmative action and gun control (opposing both) and probably the
Iraq war (a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged, and many
people took 9/11 personally).  He certainly disagrees on prayer in
school, probably on capital punishment (opposing both, while Limbaugh
supports them), and probably supports abortion rights, which Limbaugh
opposes.
