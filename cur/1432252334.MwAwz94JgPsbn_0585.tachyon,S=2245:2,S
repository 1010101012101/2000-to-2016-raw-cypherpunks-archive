   Trust has *never* worked in that sense - the WoT only really works 
inside strongly connected sets (less than one in five of keys I have 
obtained from the pgp keyservers have a signature from someone I would 
trust to introduce people to me) and commercial CAs have always been 
both lax in their checking (although a *little* more than "the check 
clears") and happy to "co-operate" with law enforcement requests.

   However, in a more limited sense, trust *does* work - I can rely on 
keys I have checked myself, and have a limited number of people spread 
across the world whose signatures I will trust to indicate they have 
done the required checking themselves. Of course, now that the commonly 
accepted hashes are suspect, I have to wonder about the viable lifespan 
of a signed key...
