"Several versions of self-encrypting hard drives from Western Digital are r=
iddled with so many security flaws that attackers with physical access can =
retrieve the data with little effort, and in some cases, without even knowi=
ng the decryption password, a team of academics said.
The paper, titled=C2=A0got HW crypto? On the (in)security of a Self-Encrypt=
ing Drive series, recited a litany of weaknesses in the multiple versions o=
f the My Passport and My Book brands of external hard drives. The flaws mak=
e it possible for people who steal a vulnerable drive to decrypt its conten=
ts, even when they're locked down with a long, randomly generated password.=
 The devices are designed to self-encrypt all stored data, a feature that s=
aves users the time and expense of using full-disk encryption software.
"After researching the inner workings of some of the numerous models in the=
 My Passport external hard drive series, several serious security vulnerabi=
lities have been discovered, affecting both authentication and confidential=
ity of user data," the researchers wrote. "We developed several different a=
ttacks to recover user data from these password protected and fully encrypt=
ed external hard disks."
Most of the disks studied encrypt and decrypt data using a USB bridge that =
connects a computer to the external drive's=C2=A0SATA interface. The interf=
ace is supposed to be off limits until after the computer user has entered =
the correct password, and to prevent cracking attacks that try billions of =
password guesses each second, the plain-text passcode is cryptographically =
salted and subjected to 1,000 iterations of the=C2=A0SHA256 hash function.
But a constellation of errors makes it possible to crack the password in a =
short amount of time. In one case, the underlying key was predictable becau=
se the random numbers used to generate it was derived from the current time=
 on the computer clock. That flaw was fixed last year, but it's likely many=
 people with vulnerable drives have no idea they're at risk. In other cases=
, it was possible to extract the hash off the drive and load it onto a comp=
uter so it could be subjected to off-line cracking."
