Perry left because we were not staid enough. He formed his own moderated 
group.

Sandy posts in bursts, vanishing for several months, then returning.

Harry Shapiro/Hawk I have never seen on this list. Maybe a couple of 
posts in the early days, but I doubt it. I think you are confusing this 
list with Extropians, where he was once a frequent poster.

John Gilmore was also never a frequent poster, as any check of the 
archives will show. He posted infrequently in 1992-4, and almost not at 
all since then. Occasionally he forwards articles he's published 
elsewhere.

Longing for the good ole days is one thing, but longing for a past that 
was never there is just silly.

As for Detweiler and Vulis, they contributed little of use, and reams of 
noise. Someone told me recently that Detweiler has surfaced in another 
forum, ranting about something weird. Vulis seems to have vanished from 
the face of the earth.
