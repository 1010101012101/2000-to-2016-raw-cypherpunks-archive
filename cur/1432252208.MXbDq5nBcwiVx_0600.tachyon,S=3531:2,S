The mechanism Steve suggested probably needs to be applied before you ever see a court order.

Actually, frequent prosecutions could work to the advantage of a select few who choose to become martyrs.  Since it would make it much more likely supplicants would be called upon.

Maybe we could piggyback on religion and use some kinks within Christian 
doctrine, selected for having wide user base within Western civilization? 
Eg, finding a believable and theologically coherent explanation how 
operating a Darknet node helps undermining the reign of Satan (a voice 
suggests me that the Book of Prophecies, or how that horsemen thing is 
called, could contain enough of material to build on)? That could provide 
a decent amount of node ops using existing infrastructure of likely-minded 
religious organizations. Faith is a big motivation for undertaking risk, 
and while Westerners currently tend to be less radical than 
Middle-Easterners, this kind of mission is far from suicidal.

I posted a few months back offering an alternative to religion in recruitment: the terminally ill.
