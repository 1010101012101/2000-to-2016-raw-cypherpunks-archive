Juan:

"Tor is criminal garbage created by the pentagon to serve their ends."


Sorry he's a troll, and as I've claimed repeatedly he's simply fishing
for info to catalog responses. His irrational extremism gives him away.
He's looking for extremists to stalk by acting like one.

Just because he can make some sort of argument to support a position
doesn't mean he isn't a federal troll doing socio-psychlogical
profiling. Most of his shorter posts could be written by an AI robot.
