"Standard"?  It was more than that; it was the *right* thing to do.  On 
a diskless workstation, there was no other identity to the machine; if 
you didn't swap the ID prom -- which was used for the low-order 24 bits 
of the Ethernet address -- your machine wouldn't receive the proper 
boot image, etc.  Add to that the number of machines in the mid-to-late 
80's that didn't have ARP, and it was utterly necessary.
