Dear Mr/Ms Ponnavolu -

The cypherpunks mailing list runs on multiple servers.
There are several subscribers around the world who maintain archives
of the list, plus anything that's ever been on the web tends to
be copied in google.com's caches, even if it disappears off the
original site.  

While you can't change the past, if you would like to change
the future's view of the past, you'll need to contact the
administrators of the actual archives.

Also, your request to be removed from the archives
was mailed to the list, and it will therefore appear in the
web archives of the list, and be cached at google and other places.


				Thanks! 
					Bill
