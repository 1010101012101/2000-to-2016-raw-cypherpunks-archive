[ standard Nigerian bank transfer scam elided ]

     For those of you who enjoy learning the details of these scams:

          http://superhighway.is/iis/index.html

The basic idea is to get the gullible to send the scam artist details
of their bank accounts.  A variation involves requiring the payment of
"documentation fees" before the money can be transfered.
