tor does not apply to an NSA threat model; your low latency mix/onion
== p0wn3d by NSA, sorry.

from the FAQ they say as much: [6.7
http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ ]

"As mentioned above, it is possible for an observer who can view large
portions of the Internet (called a 'global adversary') to be able to
correlate timings of all traffic entering and exiting the tor network,
and thus link arbitrary users. Tor does not defend against such a
threat model."

that said, i think IPsec is a great idea in as many places as possible
assuming your key distribution/exchange is well implemented.
