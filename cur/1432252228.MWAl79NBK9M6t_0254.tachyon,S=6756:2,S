On CJ (Carl Johnson) and Jim Bell:

There was a time when the greatest terrorist threat to the
US was located in the northwestern part of the country,
Idaho, Washington State and Oregon, some of California.
Militia the infidels were called.

The US Attorney's Office in Tacoma, WA, was a center
of counterterrorist activity, aided by FBI, Treasury, IRS,
US Marshals, DEA and others.

Jim Bell was twice busted, tried, convicted and jailed, by the
Tacoma USA, for alleged acts against the USG, primarily 
the IRS, but knowledgeable citizens presume the assault 
was the result of his essay, Assassination Politics (AP), 
which descibed a system for anonymous killing of varmints, 
government officials especially, but not limited to those.

CJ defended Jim with a series of online statements on his
behalf, and for allegedly running an online version of AP.
For this misbehavior he was busted, tried, convicted and jailed,
also by the Tacoma USA.

Jim served his first term, allegedly misbehaved again,
and was sent to jail again, where he remains and continues
to file appeals of his railroading. CJ served a term and is 
now free, pursuing among other wonders his career as
the King of Country Porn.

Bell and CJ posted regularly to cypherpunks during their
days of pre-jailing, and some of their messages here were
used against them during trial. An agent of the IRS, Jeff
Gordon was a known subscriber of cypherpunks for
the purpose of surveilling members and stashing useful
email evidence to advance his career -- Jeff was indeed 
awarded honors for his investigation and jailing of the 
heroes of the revolution. Here's a US Marshal report on 
Jeff's snooping:

   On November 25, 1997, Inspector Jeff GORDAN with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Portland, Oregon, contacted the U.S.
Marshals Service, Tacoma, Washington, regarding an internet
posting he had obtained on this day (see attached).

[http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.97.11.20-97.11.26/msg00274.html]

   On the same date, Deputy U.S. Marshal STEPHENSON contacted
Inspector GORDAN in an attempt obtain further details regarding
the individuals mentioned in the internet posting. Inspector
GORDAN related the following:


   On May 17, 1997, the IRS in Vancouver, Washington, arrested
James Dalton BELL (#26906-086) for threats, assaults,
obstruction, and intimidation of employees and officers of the
IRS. During IRS's initial investigation of BELL, the IRS
discovered that BELL was associated with the Multnomah County
Common Law Court as well as the author of "Assassination
Politics", an essay that describes and advocates the development
and use of a system to reward people who kill selected Government
employees. BELL was also known to transmit his beliefs via
internet services (see W/WA case #CR97-5270FDB).

   Inspector GORDON indicated that since BELL's arrest his office
has been monitoring internet postings by the Cypherpunks, one of
the groups BELL was known to be communicating with. Many of the
postings are simply communications between members of the group
regarding their dissatisfaction with the Government. Inspector
GORDAN related that this posting was a concern due to the
statement made by the author, indicating that Tim MAY announced
he would be murdering Jim Bell's judge (known to be U.S. District
Judge Franklin BURGESS or Magistrate J. Kelly ARNOLD) on Friday,
at 4;00 p.m.

   Inspector GORDAN indicated that he is not familiar with the
author of the posting, Bad BobbyH, however he was familiar with
Tim MAY. Inspector GORDAN described MAY as being an
anarchist/survivalist who seems to spend much of his time
communicating his beliefs via the internet. According to
Inspector GORDAN, MAY is retired and fairly "well off", making
his fortune years ago by developing computer programs. May also
has a tendency to attempt to "goat" or "bait" law enforcement
officers into taking action and has repeatedly stated he would
shoot any law enforcement officers who attempted to arrest him.

   Inspector GORDAN provided the following information regarding
the individuals mentioned in the posting:

   Timothy C. MAY (DoB: 12/21/51 & SSN: XXX-XX-XXX)
   XXX
   Corralltos, CA 95078

   Robert HETTINGA
   XXX
   Boston, MA 02131

   Inspector GORDAN disclosed that his office is unable to trace
the posting because the address, Robert Heidegger (rh@dev.null),
is false/untraceable.

   On November 25, 1997, U.S. District Judge Franklin BURGESS and
Magistrate Judge J. Kelly ARNOLD were notified by Supervisory
Deputy Glenn WHALEY and Deputy STEPHENSON reference the internet

posting.

   A copy of the internet posting was forwarded to FBI Special
Agent Ron Stankye (360) 695-5661.

   Attached is a copy of another posting by the Cypherpunks
previously received on June 23, 1997 regarding Magistrate J.
Kelly ARNOLD.

   If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call
Deputy STEPHENSON at (253) 593-6344.

Several cypherpunks were subpoenaed for the three trials
for eithering hosting the list, being named as correspondents
with Bell and/or CJ, reporting about the two, or allegedly 
having information about their seditious activity -- then 
known as tormenting officials eager to boost counterterrorism 
funding long before the field went ballistic with Homeland
Security golden windfall, praise Allah's generosity.

Here are some files on the trials of the two:
