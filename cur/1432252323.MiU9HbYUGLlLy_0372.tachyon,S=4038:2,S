If they listen to the press, they have only themselves to blame.

acquire new friends, or use the frigging search engine instead of the
game/Bud afternoon, for starters.

If they tolerate it, it isn't hurting bad enough.

Why don't you let Darwin sort them out? If they think NT in naval hardware
context or Outlook on the ISS is a smart thing to do, why don't you let

you can always find a few sensible folks, or an entirely new field.
