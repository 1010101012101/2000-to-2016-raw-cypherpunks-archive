We would appreciate information the sites the Air Force is
using for remote controls of the drones in AFPAK.

As noted earlier, there are reports that CIA built
"quonset huts" at its HQ in Langley to remotely
control its killers. These huts, actually quick-built
rectangular structures, can be seen on Bing.com
adjacent to the vaulted dining rooms.

Drone pilots -- AF, Customs, CIA, whoever -- are
trained at Cheech Air Force Base, NV, a small base
north of Beale AFB, but it has not been reported that
long-range remote control is being done from Cheech,
by the AF or anyone else. But could be.

We understood the AF was contolling closer to the
targets.

For long-range, we saw AF photos today of:

"The U.S. Navy's first operational Global Hawk flying
from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md., to an airbase
in Southwest Asia."

Locations of remote control were not described.
