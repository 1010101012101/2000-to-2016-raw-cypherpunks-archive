	Not at all!! They have full 'freedom of speech'. That doesn't
	mean they have any freedom of hearing. See, that's the logic of
	western 'liberals'. 

	Think about people in 'solitary confinement'. Are they free to
	say whatever they want? Of course! (as long they are not
	literally gagged). Whether other people can listen to them is a
	different story. But anyway, that's the beauty of liberal 
	anglo-american freedom!

	Yes. Well. You know the saying "a broken clock is right twice a
	day" 

	thing is, stallman remains his own sorry parody

	https://stallman.org/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html

	the guy is a good programmer and a fucking totalitarian asshole
	who laughably fancies himself a 'master' of 'ethics' 

	Let me connect a couple of dots : 

	"We need a state for...defending the nation;" <--- war cry of
	american fascim. 

	https://taler.net/

	"Electronic payments for a liberal society!"   <--- 'liberal' 


	insert here web search for "liberal democrats obama"
