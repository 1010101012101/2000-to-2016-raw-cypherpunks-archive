public keys can be used to provide some degree of trust propogation w/o the
problems associated with shared secrets ... independent of key-exchange for
session confidentiality.

certificates were designed to provide for offline trust propogation (i.e.
trusted 3rd party generating
paper credentials in the days of sailing ships ... for things like letters of
credit).

two possible online scenerios for online trust propogation was online domain
name infrastructure providing public key as part of online hostname resolution
response ... and licensing/certification agencies providing public key as part
of a trust lookup.

Trust propogation also works going from highly authenticated environment ...
which might register a public key with a relying party;  to a quickly
authenticated environment remote, non-face-to-face transactions with digital
signature (the digital signature would be a mathematical encapsulation of the
authentication business process that occured as part of public key
registeration) . Asymmetric algorithms have some advantages over traditional
shared-secret algorithms in that there can be  lower maintenence expense at the
relying party (i.e. security exposure associated with divulging a shared
secret).

And the annoying thing about this is that once we go to
needing an online trusted third party to allow us to have
secure communications, we may as well chuck the public key
stuff and just use symmetric ciphers and the key exchange
protocols worked out ten or fifteen years ago.  Which makes
me suspect that we're just not using public key mechanisms
very intelligently yet.  We've realized that screws are
better for many jobs than nails, it's just that they're so
damned hard to hammer in....
