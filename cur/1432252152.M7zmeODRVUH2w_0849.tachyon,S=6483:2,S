This is the nub of our argument.  I believe the terms we use 
influence how our technology will be interpreted in a societal and 
legal context and we therefore have an obligation to be as clear as 
possible. This is particularly important with technology such as 
digital signatures and certs  which may profoundly alter the way 
individuals interact with the economic system.

To the extent we agree here, I would urge you to help insure that 
this message is crystal clear in all specs and documents whose 
content you can influence. And don't rely on which dictionary's 
definition of "protect" is correct.

The problem goes beyond simple impersonation in that the victims 
subsequently find it difficult to convince large institutions that 
they are who they say they are.   My understanding is that the term 
comes from victims' statements that they felt as if their identities 
had been stolen.  See http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/. The question 
is relevant here, not as just another parallel question of semantics, 
but because exactly how the legal system treats "non-repudiation" can 
make the identity theft problem much better or much worse.

For what it's worth, when Congress responded to this problem by 
passing the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, it 
did not define "identity theft" as a new crime, but merely amended 18 
U.S.C. § 1028 "Fraud and related activity in connection with 
identification documents and information." The act includes 
provisions that appear to protect private keys, though they are not 
explicitly mentioned, while biometrics are (see 1028(d)(3)(C)).
