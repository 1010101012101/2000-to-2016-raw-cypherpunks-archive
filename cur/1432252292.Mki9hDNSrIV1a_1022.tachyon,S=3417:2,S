But you don't believe these Bombz d00dz are actually seeking to make 
bombs, do you? It seems clear from the consistent language and the 
attempts to look like gangsta niggaz that these are _cops_ attempting to 
entice people into sending them bomb-making instructions.

Sending them the usual stuff jokesters here send them, about eating 
beans and whatever, will be recognized even by THEM as jokes.

Sending them actual documents on Astrolite, with more details than "mix 
fuel oil and fertilizer," may actually send them into a feeding frenzy. 
This is the idea, right?

And if they are real gangsta niggaz, or real Neo-Nazis, maybe they'll 
blow something up.
