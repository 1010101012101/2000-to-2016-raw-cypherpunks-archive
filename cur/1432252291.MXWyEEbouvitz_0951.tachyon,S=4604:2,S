If you pick something heavy up from the ground, and intend to throw
it, it is extremely difficult to do so without having it in front of
you, at least for a moment. If Giuliani intended to throw it overhand
over his head, or shot-put style over one shoulder, the extinguisher
would have been in the position shown in the photo at least
momentarily. It is also possible that he intended to throw the
extinguisher, and then saw the pistol pointed at his head and tried
to hide behind it at the last moment. Regardless, if I had been in
the vehicle, I would have shot the bastard. Several vehicle windows
had already been broken, and most rational people would accept the
notion that a group of people using large, heavy objects to smash the
windows out of an occupied vehicle in a riot situation usually do not
have the health and welfare of the occupants of the vehicle foremost
in mind. In some states, this sort of behavior is called car-jacking,
and occupants of the vehicle who use deadly force to repel the
window-smashers are not prosecuted.

If you look at the Reuters image of Carlo holding the fire
extinguisher, 
he's holding it below head-level. In my opinion, that leaves three
options: 
Carlo was going to chuck the extinguisher underhand (and sideways to
the 
vehicle, so it would've bounced off) at a low velocity, or Carlo was 
holding the fire extinguisher out in front of him as DEFENSE, or he
was 
merely holding a fire extinguisher.
