Nope.

Just trying to give proper representation to the techno-paranoid. The
scenario looks too easy. Obviously the meeting was arranged via an AOL

BTW, in the scenario the female is not a mercenary, just a pawn trying
to meet the terms of her plea bargain.

I have yet to see much on CP that isn't either spam or performance art.

Mike
