   Obviously you don't realize how pissed off librarians would be about it.
There would very quickly be a court challenge, just as there was a court
challenge to it back in the 50's, and just like there has been a court challenge
to everything else like this -- the filtering acts, etc.
   How would they serve this order? If they came to me as the sysadmin, I'd have
to talk to my boss, the director about and also to an attorney, before I did
anything for them. And if I changed the settings on the database to keep all
records, everbody in the library would know about it very quickly, and there
would be a some real pissed off people demanding to know why I had done
it. Furthermore, most libraries these days have joint databases with a bunch of
libraries in the area, and they would notice the change and would be jumping up
and down, demanding public meetings, etc. 
   So the only way they could have it done is to approach someone to have them
look at the system day by day and write down what the victim of the warrant was
checking out. And what if he didn't check it out, just read it in the
library? So much for that data, there'd be none. Or would the Feebs just have
one of their own come into the library each day and access the staff side of the
software -- people would certainly notice that too. People would talk, believe
me. You can't get people to do something that pisses them off and expect them to
really cooperate. 
   I'd be willing to bet that in most libraries if they didn't file a court
challenge the victim would get an anonymous phone call from a pay phone some
night.
