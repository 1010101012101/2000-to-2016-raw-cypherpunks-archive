ATM Stolen in Third Such Theft in a Month
An automated teller machine was stolen from a gas station early Sunday,
the
third such theft in Orange County since mid-August, police said.

The machine was stolen from an Arco just before 4 a.m., using the same
method as in the earlier incidents, sheriff's Lt. Ted Boyne said.

"They come, and in 30
seconds, they have the
ATM in back of an
SUV."

Moral of the story: do the math.
