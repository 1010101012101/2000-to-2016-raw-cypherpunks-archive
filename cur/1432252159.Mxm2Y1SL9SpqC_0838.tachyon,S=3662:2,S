I've pointed this out before, but many randoms (esp females) wear false hair
and facial camo.  Add some Jackie-O accoutrements and you've got your
'religious worshippers' (and some *are* religious about wearing this,
tithing significant fractions of their income) on the streets already.

The red-light-camera folks don't send a ticket if they can't make out
your face (judges demand it); one of their staff commented that they toss
out pictures with
low baseball caps (etc.) obscuring the faces, but they didn't think people
do that *intentionally* to beat traffic cameras.  (LA Times story last week
or so)

.....

Personally I like Subcommander Marcos's Subgenius/Terrorist look... pipe
and ski mask..
