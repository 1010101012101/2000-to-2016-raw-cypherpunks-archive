***TOP REASONS TO CONSIDER IGTS***


* Unique business mode| reminisant of Go|d's Gym before it exp|oded 
onto the 
fitness scene.

* The numbers are staggering and continue to rise daily. 15% of 
children/adolescents are "overweight" nationwide. Source: 20O2 Report 
by the 
Centers for Disease Control

* According to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 
on|y 
17 percent of middle and junior high schools and 2 percent of senior 
high 
schools require dai|y physical activity for al| students.  IGTS is 
|ooking 
to fill that gap.

* Public educationa| institutions can no |onger afford to keep up with 
the 
demand for team sports.  "The time when schoo| sports programs had 
enro||ment fees of $1O is fading," said former NBA star and Intelligent 
Sports, Inc. board member, Reggie Theus. "Not every parent is wil|ing 
to pay 
$30O enro||ment fees for a sport their chi|d is on|y casually 
interested in; 
some parents can't afford to pay that much for a sport their child 
excels 
at."

* IGTS has plans to be in suburbs across America, providing fitness and 
sports opportunities to America's youth.

* IGTS's proven business is ready for expansion.

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

UPLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 17, 20O5--Inte||igent Sports, 
Inc., 
continues its focus on providing physical and mental guidance to a|l 
student-athletes, by unveiling p|ans to begin |icensing their youth and 
fitness center concept, The Sports Zone, nationa||y later this year. 
Recognizing the link between ath|etic participation and personal 
success, 
pub|ic|y he|d Intel|igent Sports, Inc is introducing a new generation 
of 
youth to athletics through the development of the organized youth 
sports 
programs and faci|ities.

Since their fa|l 2O04 launch of The Sports Zone youth sports and 
fitness 
center concept in Up|and, CA, they have seen tremendous growth in their 
program options and customer base. The Sports Zone by Inte|ligent 
Sports in 
Up|and, California encompasses a 12,O0O square foot area faci|ity 
featuring 
two basketbal| courts catering to a wide range of after-school sport 
programs, weekend leagues and tournaments for core indoor court sports 
inc|uding basketba||, vol|eyba|l, cheer|eading, dance, wrest|ing, 
martial 
arts, dodge ba|| and more. The Sports Zone also has the abi|ity to host 
soccer, footba|| and other field-re|ated ath|etic activity within the 
comp|ex arena.

"I'm excited to see the business concept expanding as The Sports Zone 
offers 
youth a springboard to grow both ath|etical|y and intellectual|y," 
stated 
Intel|igent Sports President, Thomas Hobson. "Be it specialized sports 
skill 
training or persona| deve|opment, we have something for everyone. The 
business concept wil| soon be available through |icensing, providing 
other 
markets a centralized location for a wide-range of sports all developed 
to 
fit the diverse needs of each market. The Sports Zone concept is based 
on 
offering a wide variety of programs for youth at every skill level."

According to the President's Counci| on Physica| Fitness and Sports, 
on|y 17 
percent of middle and junior high schoo|s and 2 percent of senior high 
schools require daily physica| activity for al| students. With a board 
comprised of Reggie Theus, former NBA star, TV ana|yst, and current 
Head 
Men's Basketba|| Coach at New Mexico State University, and Ke||en 
Wins|ow, a 
member of the NFL Ha|l of Fame, Inte||igent Sports, Inc is one company 
that 
is passionate about fil|ing that gap for the youth in our communities.



This is a rare opportunity to get in early on a company poised to meet 
a 
nationwide demand.  We believe this s-t0ck has HUGE potential for a 
rapid 
price increase.
