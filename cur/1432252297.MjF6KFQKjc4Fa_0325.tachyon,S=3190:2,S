Apparently there was an unanticipated meteor shower last evening visible from New York to Virginia.  According to the story on Yahoo:

"A Reuters reporter saw a tapered object shaped like a trumpet bell falling diagonally through the western sky near West Chester, Pennsylvania, 20 miles from Philadelphia at about 6:20.  The object emitted a lustrous rainbow of colors ranging from bright yellow on its downward-pointing flared end to light green and finally rust-colored red at the upward pointing tapered end."

Admittedly off topic, but did anyone see any of the meteors?
