Accepting playment of this dodging game seems largely irrelavent
(and harmful) to the real issue at hand... your right to speak. At
least in the US...

http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html

Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people ... to petition the
Government for a redress of grievances.

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated; and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.


It's frankly appalling that in the whole US, with its millions of
warrants (and fewer unconstitutional NSL's) per year, that no one,
not even the idealists or other types, seem to have the balls to
speak and publish a single one of them (or even the simple castrated
fact that you received one)...
 "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech"...

And that the abhorrence of Mass Surveillance is somehow...
 "upon probable cause" against your person, and the people...

Some would say that any interpretation (fiat) of the original
Charters text created subsequent to, and without sole dedication
to exclusive analysis of, the thoughts of those who wrote them...
is bogus, unless so amended. Lots of bogus laws based on flawed
interpretation (or on flawed interpretation of good interpretation)
out there... and no one testing them. Slowly stacking up, harder
to revert with each additional one layered on and woven in tight.
A fine day to be a lawyer and a citizen perhaps. Or perhaps there
are none that good...
