The same thing we did in the old days.

Install an IBM mainframe.

https://www.techwire.net/the-mainframe-lives-on-an-industry-perspective/

The only place the 'cloud' makes sense is if you are Amazon or Google
and you want to sell your excess computing capacity to suckers who can't
afford to buy their own computers.

If you actually do capacity planning and maybe do something like apply
modern devops to mainframe platforms, you can actually get some economies
of scale running your mainframe on-site.

It will probably cost less than what that CxO's got paid under-the-table
in a rigged altcoin pump-and-dump orchestrated by the cloud service
provider.
