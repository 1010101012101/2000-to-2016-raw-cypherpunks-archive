In a socialist nation, the government will own the critical
infrastructure, and that is that.

In a state capitalist nation, the government will own the critical
infrastructure through straws.

In a capitalist nation, the private sector will own the critical
infrastructure.  Therefore, the government of same will simply
and quietly deputize the private sector against its will.

Above some threshold level of deputization plus regulation,
free-enterprise capitalist and state capitalist are operationally
indistinguishable.  By that analysis, the U.S. and China are destined
to look more alike day by day.
