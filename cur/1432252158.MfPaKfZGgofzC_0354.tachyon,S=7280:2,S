So fucking what?  I'm sure he also uses toilet paper and soap, cellphones,
pens and paper. Hey, let's ban those too.  If a terrorist uses such items,
heaven forbid should anyone else be allowed to lest they be likened to a
terrorist!

Oh, you mean like Hiroshima or Nagasaki?  Oh well, let's just shit on
Uncle Sam for inventing the nuclear weapons before Germany could.  Nah, we
should have idly stood by while Germany built their own nukes, that way
you couldn't blame "our technology"

I think at this time, and I don't speak for most people - I'm simply using
my own views and extrapolating, that most people are glad they are alive
and breathing.  Most people are pissed and want retaliation.  Most people
aren't thinking "Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't use crypto, the telephone, mp3's
or the radio because they can also be used by terrorists."

Hey two way radios, cell phones, pen and paper, ink, cutlery can be used
against freedom.  Do you see Gerber, the knife makers volutarily going out
of business?  Or whatever company made the plastic knives used in this
attack because they were used by terroists?

Did Ryder, the company whose moving van McVeigh used to bomb OKC shut down
because their "technology" could be used by terrorists?

Get a fucking clue you troll!

Perhaps, but I think terror is the ultimate goal, not a supression of
freedom.  Fear, uncertainty and doubt, not a loss of freedom are the aims
of terrorists.  After all if they were worried about freedom being such an
important thing, their countries would have freedom, rather than the
extreme religeous bans.

DMCA and SSSCA have to do with mp3's and videos. Not crypto.  Now I'm
100% certain that you are a troll sent to demoralize this list against
cryptology.  Go fuck yourself.

Ok Mr. Troll, go and dig out the proof that said terrorists were
cypherpunks.  Go and dig out the proof that Diffie, Hellman, Rivest,
Shamir, Adelman, Schneier, and Zimmerman were on those planes holding
plastic knives.  

Fucking troll!  If anything, you have a lot more in common with those
responsible for this atrocy than you do with any freedom loving citizen of
the USA.  Or for that matter any cypherpunk.

This was an attack against our liberty.  Against our freedom.  Perpetrated
by those who hate liberty and would love to enslave their countries under
severe religious laws.  They hate us most of all because they believe our
freedom is what makes us "The Great Satan"

And you sir, are spewing the very same agenda they are.  I suggest you
turn yourself in to the FBI this moment for the terror monger that you
are!
