I don't have a clue about JYA, but what I have seen on the bitcoin lists
about address re-use and stealth addresses pretty much confirms that 
lots of people are getting paid, and many are getting manipulated into
developing and promoting 'privacy and anonymity' systems that come
pre-hacked with a feed to the highest bidder.

The only real defense normal people have is transparency. The only 
people who can afford privacy are the ones shouting the loudest that
we all have an inalienable right to keep shit secret, while they 
quietly tap our phones, bank accounts, cryptocoin wallets, and new
media.
