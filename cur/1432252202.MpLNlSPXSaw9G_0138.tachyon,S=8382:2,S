Seems like their standard is from Barak & Halevi, =93A model and =
architecture for pseudo-random generation with applications to =
/dev/random.=94

=96 Resilience: an adversary must not be able to predict future PRNG =
outputs even if he can influence the entropy source used to initialize =
or refresh the internal state of the PRNG;
=96 Forward security ( resp. backward security): an adversary must not =
be able to predict past (resp. future) outputs even if he can compromise =
the internal state of the PRNG.

Seems like a lovely defense-in-depth goal, but I'd really like to read =
the original paper to figure out why I should care.
