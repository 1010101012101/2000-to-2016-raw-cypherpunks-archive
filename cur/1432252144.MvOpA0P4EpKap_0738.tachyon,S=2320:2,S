indeed; they vastly understate the difficulty of the difficult part
they mention in the article.  i'm mostly poking fun - the stability of
lots of qubits together is independent of the manufacturability of
these individual qubit holders using existing tech.

i'll get imminently worried when the RSA challenges start dropping like mad...
