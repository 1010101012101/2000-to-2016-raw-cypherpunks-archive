Same here.

Another rather unsavory aspect of the software I discovered after about a  
week of running it, was that by default, your computer is an exit node.  
[1] (this may have since changed)

This meant that people abusing the Tribler service to share child  
porn/whatever could spew the filth through any number of unsuspecting  
Tribler users Internet connections and with most of them being none the  
wiser until their door got kicked in.

This is an unacceptable mega-blunder in my book and was enough for me to  
uninstall the app and never look back.
