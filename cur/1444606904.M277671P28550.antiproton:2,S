Reviving this thread. Where's the altruism in "how to minimize one's
damage"? Why's the model here for resisting economic oppression a
survivalist hiding in an encrypted bunker, rather than the people of
Burkina Faso using sticks and rocks (not cryptography) to force
oligarchs out of their country? In Mexico they were recently burning
polling stations, but we were discussing hoarding Bitcoin to ensure our
self-interest? Where's the idealism in such selfishness?
