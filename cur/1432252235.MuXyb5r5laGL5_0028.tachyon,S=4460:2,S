Garden variety "civil disobedience." The Feds love it because it shows 
why more gun laws are needed. And they don't have to do the jail time, 
or pay for the trial (taxpayers do), or face any threat of imprisonment 
no matter how the trial verdict turns out.

More interesting would be:

"Rick Stanley says he intends to defend his rights by shooting anyone 
who tries to disarm him."

Yet more interesting:

"Rick Stanley will be backed up by snipers around the Capitol building, 
who will shoot to kill anyone who approaches Mr. Stanley with the intent 
of disarming him."

Even more interesting:

"A Colorado person has placed a $20,000 ecash reward in escrow for 
anyone who can prove he killed a Fed attempting to violate the Second 
Amendment rights of a Colorado resident."


But a garden-variety "I will be arrested" gig is not interesting or 
useful.
