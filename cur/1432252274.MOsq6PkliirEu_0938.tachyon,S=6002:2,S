Leveraging Social Media for Early Indications and Warnings of Instability and
Unrest

Date: Thursday, June 23, 2011

12:00 PM ET / 9:00 AM PT / 16:00 GMT (Duration: 1 hour)

The ever-increasing availability of Internet connectivity is redefining
open-source intelligence analytics. Online social media is not only
reflective of population opinions and dynamics, but may also provide public
venues to actively influence others and garner support for organized
movements. In fact, in some situations like the recent protests in the Middle
East and North Africa, top social networking sites have been shown to report
events and dissatisfaction with leadership prior to traditional news sources.
On the one hand, the rapidity of information spread renders the Internet a
valuable real-time source of intelligence on population behaviors and
sentiment. On the other hand, this rapidity is precisely the challenge with
effectively exploiting this data source.

This presentation will discuss how Lockheed Martinbs software suite, called
bWeb Information Spread Data Operations Moduleb (WISDOM), is breaking new
ground in online social media collection and analytics. WISDOMbs innovative
algorithms are integrated with, and indeed govern, existing technologies
(e.g., crawling, tagging, agents, visualizations, etc.) to provide near
real-time monitoring and analytic exploitation of the Internet as a
socio-cultural data source. With its suite of capabilities, WISDOMbs
automated collection, processing, and analytic visualizations save the
analyst time generally spent on collection so they may devote the majority of
their effort toward analysis; and discover trends, sentiment shifts, and key
influencers in online communities to alert the analyst to indications of
unrest that may lead to instability events.
