Interesting. also, like how phrenology was discredited yet when
recontextualized via neuroimaging it seems a similar paradigm, just
different territory and cartography.

noting for completeness: connection of TENS and other such electronic
devices with kinky sex culture...

Erotic electrostimulation
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_electrostimulation

The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices is also in town here...
http://www.museumofquackery.com/

all of this reminds me of Alvin Toffler, (perhaps book Futureshock) who
advised taking company tours such as of manufacturing facilities to learn
how industry ecosystems function as another route to education, literacy,
learning. there is a quackery devices, Bakken, and also a broadcast museum
in town, though the advice extends towards visiting old mines, e.g. (MINOS
Detecter) [0] or other facilities. in Berkeley i had a tour of their
participle accelerator, fascinating to learn that a particle can be
suspended by magnets, held in a stationary position prior to being merged
with the other accelerating beam, or perhaps for being smashed into, i
forget. though in a security-paranoid environment even these basic
pleasures of learning seem off-limits in terms of ideas, on lock-down
potentially, perhaps most so the threat of reinterpretation challenging
ruling ideology. like every observer is a security threat and social
relations and ideas tunneling inside that.
