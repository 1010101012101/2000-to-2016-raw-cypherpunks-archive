Someone with a little knowledge of R/similar could visualize the decay
of cpunks much better than this, but here are some people who wrote
code/built things/were real cypherpunks, versus fucking Mr. "Autism and
Racial Strength" (first post 7/3/2014) over here with this thread and
Juan "You're just an agent of the American Fascists" Garofalo (first
post 9/09/2013)  with the follow-through:

 * Cathal Garvey (last post 10/16/2015)
 * Eugen Leitl (last post 10/26/2015)
 * Peter Gutmann (seems to only troll now, but still posts)
 * James A. Donald (last post 01/24/2016)
 * John Young still posts, but substantially less
And now we're left with the above two concern trolls and company who
never even sent email to al-qaeda.net.

It's an abject falsehood that raising the noise to totally drown out
any signal and alienating the entire rest of the list is somehow not
harmful to the list.=20

Nobody who A.) has no concrete contribution to the community and/or B.)
never posted to al-qaeda.net has any business posting more than, say,
John Young. This isn't censorship, this is the continuity of the
community. Just because you CAN spam cpunks with autism and racial
strength doesn't mean it's necessarily cypherpunk to do so.=20

Maybe submit to /r/DarkFuturology, guys? You'd probably get more
engagement.
