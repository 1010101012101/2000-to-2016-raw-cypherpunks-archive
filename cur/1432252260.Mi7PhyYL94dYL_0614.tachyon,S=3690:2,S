I can tell you it is not true. I have a less than reputable brother (drugs),
and he was recently accused of running a small meth lab within whatever the
distance is of 2 school, so it's is a very serious accusation. The computer
that sits not 20 feet from the alleged location of the alleged meth lab
(sorry I honestly don't know the truth, all reports I get are at least
second hand) has not been notably touched by law enforcement officials of
any kind. So while I'm sure it is commonplace and perhaps standard protocol
to confiscate the computer with most crimes, there are exceptions.
