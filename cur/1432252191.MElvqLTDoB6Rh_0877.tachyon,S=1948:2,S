Everyone who buys a mobile telephone will be forced to register their
identity on a national database under government plans to extend
massively the powers of state surveillance.

Phone buyers would have to present a passport or other official form
of identification at the point of purchase. Privacy campaigners fear
it marks the latest government move to create a surveillance society.

A compulsory national register for the owners of all 72m mobile phones
in Britain would be part of a much bigger database to combat terrorism
and crime. Whitehall officials have raised the idea of a register
containing the names and addresses of everyone who buys a phone in
recent talks with Vodafone and other telephone companies, insiders
say.
