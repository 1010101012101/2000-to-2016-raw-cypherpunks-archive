Markets are anarchy. I think a lot works. What sells in a pitch, however, is
a different matter. So are the needs and concerns of respective
marketplaces. An intelligence marketplace, especially one such as I "threw
out" falls in the "special needs" category.

I was not disparaging your ideas, merely trying to envision a live funding
opportunity so that these ideas could be developed and toyed with. How could
this be construed as anything but a vote of confidence?

I use a lot of elicitation tactics. (i.e., pissing Tim off is a great way to
find out things. Tim's "talky" button is provocation. So, I punch it. Good
threads often result.)

I agree with Tim. I still want to find money to apply what you have been
talking about - for untold centuries - in a real-life transactional
environment, under current realities.  I don't expect that it would meet
your standards, or even support your ideals, but it would explore some of
the technology and mercantile dynamics that have been bounced around here.

I think Tim took my questions as questioning the "value proposition" of
his/your ideas. This was not my intent. I meant "value proposition" in terms
of getting some bank to test and develop some of these concepts, nothing
more.

There are several futuristic societies and think-tanks exploring virtual
corporation/organization alternatives...  Forum-shopping is purely a legal
and tax-related question, and has been for a long time, as we all know. Many
futurists predicted the rise of the virtual sovereign - citing offshore
havens, but this theory seems to have been placed in question of late.

Which is all I was doing.

I don't disagree with this statement, ...how could I?
