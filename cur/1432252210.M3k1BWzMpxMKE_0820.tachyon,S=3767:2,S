Isn't what is new here is that the man did not publish this material
as was the material of Joyce, Miller, et al? Nobody saw it except
him and the cop who discovered it. It was the Man who published,
converted private scribblings into illegal material, not the man.

Neat trick, the drooling officials building private collections, like 
the story today of the Soviets amassing a huge stock of erotica, 
now and then visited by officials who, the porno librarian claims, 
always expressed shock and outrage, then purloined a few samples 
for private use. "What could I do about the stealing," the librarian
is quoted, "they were officials."

If officials possess gobs of kiddie porn, as many confessedly 
brag, and claim to be shocked, shocked, and eagerly exhibit 
the stuff to judges and juries and court attendants who are 
shocked, shocked, what is wrong with that?

Thank Buddha the FBI is working closely with the Red Chinese,
reported in the WSJ yesterday, in US-Chineses criminal 
investigations to balance the US promoting anonymizers to 
bypass Chinese clampdown on the Internet. What is Carnivore
called in the PRC?

There will be no peepholes in anonymizers trusted by the
citizen users. A bit of loose code, hardly noticeable, but
thankfully no moral code, why that would be consumer/
customer/voter/dissident/reputation/gosh my editor,
my boss did it, I couldn't have known, I'm only human,
the pressure was incredible/here are my private
scribblings trust me betrayal.
