You have no right to trespass simply because you once worked there.

Neither does anyone have a right to unreasonable force.

Who gives a rat's ass about what someone does in a foreign land?
US law only applies in the US, despite the current US Regime's
behavior to the contrary.

And BTW, what is wrong with hired police ("mercs") esp. when the local
police don't work?   Do you have a problem with private security guards
in the US, as long as
they don't involve you in unconsensual transactions?  Do you have a
problem
with weaponsbearing citizens, again, if they don't involve you in
unconsensual transactions?

Note that if some company makes enemies overseas, its not the US as a
whole
that has earned the airplane-in-the-skyscraper feedback.   Its the
official US regime behavior that Gen. Washington warned about: Trade
with all, make treaties with none, and beware of foreign entanglements.

Anyone who abuses the power of the (gullible) State to coerce others
deserves killing.

The fact that some corporations may leverage existing thuggery to

Its not thuggery to protect your own property or freedoms.  If someone
is guilty of true thuggery --ie coercion-- then the State is obligated
to act to protect the thuggees.  The State only gets involved when a
transaction is not mutually consensual; if the State gets involved in
mutually consensual transactions the State deserves killing -er,
preemptive regime change.
