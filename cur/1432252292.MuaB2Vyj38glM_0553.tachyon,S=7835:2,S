            Financial Cryptography '04
                9-12 February 2004
              Key West, Florida, USA


              Call for Participation

Financial Cryptography is the premier international
forum for education, exploration, and debate at the
heart of one theme: Money and trust in the digital
world. Dedicated to the relationship between cryptography
and data security and cutting-edge financial and payment
technologies and trends, the conference brings together
top data-security specialists and scientists with
economists, bankers, implementers, and policy makers.

Financial Cryptography includes a program of invited
talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations,
and panel discussions. These explore a range of topics
in their full technical and interdisciplinary complexity:
Emerging financial instruments and trends, legal
regulation of financial technologies and privacy issues,
encryption and authentication techologies, digital cash,
and smartcard payment systems -- among many others.

The conference proceedings containing all accepted
submissions will be published in the Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series after
the conference. A pre-proceedings containing preliminary
versions of the papers will be distributed at the
conference.

More information on the invited speakers is available
on the web site, as well as the list of accepted papers
and the preliminary schedule (see below as well).

Registration for Financial Cryptography 2004 is now open;
details and online registration can be found at
http://fc04.ifca.ai along with information about
discounted hotel accommodation and travel.

Financial Cryptography is organized by the International
Financial Cryptography Association (IFCA). More
information can be obtained from the IFCA web site at
http://www.ifca.ai or by contacting the conference
general chair, Hinde ten Berge, at hinde@xs4all.nl.
