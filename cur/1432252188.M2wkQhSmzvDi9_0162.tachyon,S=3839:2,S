All that technical stuff is in the Friedman's books, and where there was a
conflict between sound economics, and the politically correct fashions of
the day, Samuelson tended to cringe before whatever was PC fashion, until
the fashion changed and he could get away with more accurate and realistic
economics.

Most infamously, when many observers noticed that the Soviet Union was
imminent danger of collapse, he assured us the Soviet economy was working
just fine.
