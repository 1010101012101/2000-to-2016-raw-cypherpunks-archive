Good point. 

A Russian cryptographer was grabbed, unable to talk to his consulate 
for at least three days, and the Russians don't say anything?

I smell a rat.  Perhaps Dmitry was sold down the river.

(Note for non-USA readers: "sold down the river" is an americanism 
for betrayal.  It dates from the days of slavery, where the conditions 
for slaves were worse the further down the (Mississippi) river they 
were.  It was common for slaveowners to promise to sell their slaves 
upriver to gain their goodwill, and then sell them downriver for more 
money than they could get upriver.  Since slaves' communication was 
tightly controlled, lying to the ones left about where their buds had 
gone was also common, and usually undetected.  Parallels to the current 
situation are left as an exercise for the reader.)
