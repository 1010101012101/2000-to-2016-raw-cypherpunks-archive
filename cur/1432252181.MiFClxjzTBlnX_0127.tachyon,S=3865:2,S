Apparently, I confused the events in Munich in '72 with another "rescue"
operation in which civilians were obliterated by the rescue team, and
their deaths were later attributed to the hostage takers.

After some refreshing of my memory from the news coverage of the events, I
will correct the account to read as follows.

Palestinians took 11 Israeli athletes hostage and two of them were killed
during the hostage taking.  The Mossad, the Israeli secret service,
requested to bring in a hostage rescue team into Germany, and was refused
by the German government.  With the head of the Mossad, Zvi Zamir, acting
as an observer and adviser in Germany, a rescue was attempted by German
police, which resulted in the killing of the remaining 9 athletes.

I will still stand by my points about Israeli policy towards Israeli
civilians held hostage, settlements, and Sharon's "The Jewish people
control America" comments before the Knesset.

The Munich festivities were apparently later immortalized for history in a
Michael Douglas film, which now serves as peoples public recollection of
the events, rather than the coverage that took place at the time.
