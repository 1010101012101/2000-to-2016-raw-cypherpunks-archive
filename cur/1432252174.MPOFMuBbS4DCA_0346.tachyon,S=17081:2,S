<P><H4>Note on Logical Systems</H4></P>

<P>For those of you with an introduction to logic, formal mathematics or =
computer science, you
will undoubtedly have heard of Kurt G&ouml;del. The Austrian mathematicia=
n
indelibly left his mark on 20th-century science and philosophy with his 1=
931
paper &quot;<B>On Formally Undecidable Propositions Of Principia Mathemat=
ica And
Related Systems</B>&quot;. His proof of the Undecidability Theorem, summa=
rized and=20
translated herein, is much spoken of but little read. My goal is to make =
this work
available for personal and academic use to all who are interested. The au=
thor
frequently refers to <A HREF=3D"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/princip=
ia-mathematica/"><I>Principia Mathematica</I></A>
by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. The major contribution of
<I>Principia Mathematica</I> is its notation and rules of inference, whic=
h can be
grasped with a little effort.</P>

<P>Even if the reader has only had high-school Geometry or Algerbra II, i=
f persistant he or she should
be able to make sense of the logical formulas in the proof. Every stateme=
nt in logic
can be represented by a letter: <B>A</B>, <B>B</B>, <B>C</B>, etc. A sing=
le
statement <B>A</B> may be attached to a phrase such as &quot;Socrates is =
a man&quot;.
<B>A</B> when used in a formula represents the <I>truth-value</I> of the =
statement
behind <B>A</B>. A statement may be determined true or false by observati=
on - or it may
also by deduced from an initial set of <I>axioms</I> within a system. <I>=
Theorems</I>
are simply statments deduced from the initial axioms, or any theorems alr=
eady proven.</P>

<P>The operators in logical notation are not very numerous:
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">~</FONT></B> is the <I>NOT</I> operator;
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=DA</FONT></B> is the <I>OR</I> operator (disjun=
ction);
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=D9</FONT></B> or <B>&amp;</B> is the <I>AND</I>=
 operator (conjunction);
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=BA</FONT></B> means &quot;equivalent to&quot;;
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=AE</FONT></B> means &quot;follows from&quot; or=
 &quot;implies&quot;;
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">"</FONT>x</B> means &quot;for all <B>x</B>&quot;=
;
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">$</FONT>x</B> means &quot;there exists <B>x</B> =
such that&quot;.
Some elements from set theory are also used by the author:
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=CC</FONT></B> means "subset of" (subsethood);
<B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=CE</FONT></B> means "element of" (memberhood).
And finally, the author sometimes uses the operators <B><FONT FACE=3D"Sym=
bol">=AE</FONT></B>
and <B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">=C9</FONT></B> interchangeably.
</P>

<P>Given below are examples of laws (or tautologies) in a 'consistent' sy=
stem:</P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3D3>
<P>Double Negative: <B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">~</FONT>(<FONT FACE=3D"Symbo=

<P>Law of Noncontradiction: <B><FONT FACE=3D"Symbol">~</FONT>(A <FONT FAC=

'immediate consequence of'):</P>

<P><H4>Note on Typography</H4></P>

<UL><P>
<LI>You must have the <TT>Symbol</TT> Truetype font properly installed;</=
LI>
<LI>And your internet connection must handle 8-bit transmissions properly=
 --</LI>
<LI>If you are using Navigator&#153; or Internet Explorer&#153;, you shou=
ld have no problems.</LI>
</P></UL>

<P>The actual proof is quite 'typographically complex' and I have formatt=
ed this
document to utilize the <TT>Symbol</TT> Truetype font for the logical sym=
bols
needed to convey its meaning adequately. If the above logical statements =
are readable
in your browser, then the proof will be also. I have made a tremendous ef=
fort to
preserve the original look of the text in HTML format. All 'strings' and =
'numerals'
are in <B>bold</B> type, as the distinction is explicit in the <A HREF=3D=
"godel2.htm">Introduction</A>
and implicit in the context of <A HREF=3D"godel3.htm">G&ouml;del's paper<=
/A>. Every
reference in the texts has been replaced with a hyperlink to the appropri=
ate location
in the proof, if possible.</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The symbols G&ouml;del uses for metamathematical con=
cepts or their
G&ouml;del numbers are mainly abbreviations of German words. Although the=
 concepts
themselves are carefully defined in the text, the following alphabetical =
list of the
more important of these symbols with their etymology may be helpful to th=
e reader:</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><H4>Conclusion</H4></P>

<P>As you may have read in <A HREF=3D"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/I=
SBN=3D0394756827/"><I>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</I></A> by Douglas Hofstad=
ter,
<A HREF=3D"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=3D0140145346/"><I>The E=
mperor's New Mind</I></A> by Roger Penrose, or any number of other contem=
porary works, the
conclusion of 'unprovability' that G&ouml;del proves for a general arithm=
etic
has broader consequences for humanity. One cannot reasonably expect a leg=
al system,
a set of physical laws, or a set of religious commandments to have the sa=
me rigor
that characterizes a recursively enumerable arithmetic. Nevertheless, one=
 can expect
examples of logical statements (ex.: 'Is seccession constitutional?') to =
arise
that are neither provable, nor disprovable, within a complete logical fra=
mework.</P>

<P>Even more interesting, the reality of Platonic 'forms' - ideals contem=
plated by
the human intellect - is questioned by some simple corollaries to G&ouml;=
del's
Theorem. His <A HREF=3D"godel3.htm#PROP-XI">Propostion XI</A> states that=
 the consistency of any formal deductive system
(if it is consistent) is neither provable nor disprovable within the syst=
em. A quick
leap of logic interprets this corollary as such: 'Any sufficiently comple=
x,
consistent logical framework cannot be self-dependent' - i.e., it must re=
ly on
intuition, or some external confirmation of certain propositions (specifi=
cally, one
that proves internal consistency).</P>

<P>I now leave to the interested reader the following exercise, attribute=
d to
Bertrand Russell<SUP>&#135;</SUP>:</P>

<P><UL>You are trainee at a very formal library in London. Every book mus=
t be
indexed in one of two giant catalogs. Catalog A contains the citation of =
every
book that makes no reference to itself. Catalog B contains the citation o=
f every
book that does contain a reference to itself.</UL></P>

<P><UL>The elderly librarian, who is assigned to your group of trainees, =
now asks the
group: &quot;In which volume would you index catalog B?&quot; A perceptiv=
e student suggests
placing a reference for 'Catalog B' in volume A, since B does not make an=
y reference
to itself. The librarian asks again: &quot;Then where would you index Cat=
alog A?&quot;</UL></P>
