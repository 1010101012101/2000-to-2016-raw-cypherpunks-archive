Some people don't wish to use Tor for a variety of reasons, whether a lack of
trust, or simply because they don't want anyone to see Tor traffic on their
connection.
I see what you're saying, mind you. Perhaps even better would be to combine
the two, and run Tor from some Asian/off-shore server you own which you tunnel
into.
Either or, Tor is better simply because it eliminates the upstream camping,
which would probably be the main problem; eventually, your proxy servers would
be enumerated, and then, you'd be vulnerable.
There's the cost, too. 100 dollars a month, which would need to be reasonably
anonymously transferred, otherwise someone already has a list of your shells.
This kind of method would work against someone who has limited resources, but
then, so does vanilla Tor, or simple proxy chaining.
