They were not "ratting" on him

A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.

And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.

If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.

The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
phenomenon.

One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz
failed the conspicuous arrogance filter before being granted tenure,
so suddenly found himself no longer ruling class.
