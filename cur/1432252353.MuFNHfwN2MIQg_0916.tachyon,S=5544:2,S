	No, for several reasons:

	(1) Armies and police forces are expensive to maintain, 
especially given that for corporations they are needed in 
geographically diverse areas *occasionally*, and that by buying the 
government they get access to them, but *only* when they need them.

	(2) Private armies/mercenaries tend to be dangerous 
tools--they have the guns, and loyalty to the paycheck. They also can 
easily turn on you, or be bought.

	(3) If one engages in warfare, one takes the risk of getting 
shot. If companies were to engage directly in actions involving 
force, they would risk having some of their targets bypass shooting 
at the foot soldiers and go straight for the top of the chain of 
command. By buying themselves a government, that risk is averted.

	Try thinking outside your box a bit. When the rules are gone, 
there are no rules, and there are interesting ramifications there.

A quote from Petro's Archives:   **********************************************
Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
