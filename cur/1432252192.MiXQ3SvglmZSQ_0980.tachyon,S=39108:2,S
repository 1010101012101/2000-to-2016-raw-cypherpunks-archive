gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things,<br>
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against
you, in hunger and thirst, in nakedness, and in want of all things; and
he will put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed
you.<br>
The LORD will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the
earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you do not
understand,<br>
a nation of stern countenance, who shall not regard the person of the old
or show favor to the young,<br>
<br>
1Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak; <br>
Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. <br>
32:2My doctrine shall drop as the rain; <br>
My speech shall condense as the dew, <br>
As the small rain on the tender grass, <br>
As the showers on the herb. <br>
32:3For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh: <br>
Ascribe greatness to our God. <br>
32:4The Rock, his work is perfect; <br>
For all his ways are justice: <br>
A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, <br>
Just and right is he. <br>
32:5They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is
their blemish; <br>
They are a perverse and crooked generation. <br>
32:6Do you thus requite Yahweh, <br>
Foolish people and unwise? <br>
Isn't he your father who has bought you? <br>
He has made you, and established you. <br>
32:7Remember the days of old, <br>
Consider the years of many generations: <br>
Ask your father, and he will show you; <br>
Your elders, and they will tell you. <br>
32:8When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, <br>
When he separated the children of men, <br>
He set the bounds of the peoples <br>
According to the number of the children of Israel. <br>
32:9For Yahweh's portion is his people; <br>
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. <br>
32:10He found him in a desert land, <br>
In the waste howling wilderness; <br>
He compassed him about, he cared for him, <br>
He kept him as the apple of his eye. <br>
32:11As an eagle that stirs up her nest, <br>
That flutters over her young, <br>
He spread abroad his wings, he took them, <br>
He bore them on his feathers. <br>
32:12Yahweh alone did lead him, <br>
There was no foreign god with him. <br>
32:13He made him ride on the high places of the earth, <br>
He ate the increase of the field; <br>
He made him to suck honey out of the rock, <br>
Oil out of the flinty rock; <br>
32:14Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, <br>
With fat of lambs, <br>
Rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, <br>
With the finest of the wheat; <br>
Of the blood of the grape you drank wine. <br>
32:15But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked: <br>
You have grown fat, you are grown thick, you are become sleek; <br>
Then he forsook God who made him, <br>
Lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. <br>
32:16They moved him to jealousy with strange gods; <br>
With abominations provoked they him to anger. <br>
32:17They sacrificed to demons, which were no God, <br>
To gods that they didn't know, <br>
To new gods that came up of late, <br>
Which your fathers didn't dread. <br>
32:18Of the Rock that became your father, you are unmindful, <br>
Have forgotten God who gave you birth. <br>
32:19Yahweh saw it, and abhorred them, <br>
Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. <br>
32:20He said, I will hide my face from them, <br>
I will see what their end shall be: <br>
For they are a very perverse generation, <br>
Children in whom is no faithfulness. <br>
32:21They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; <br>
They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: <br>
I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; <br>
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. <br>
32:22For a fire is kindled in my anger, <br>
Burns to the lowest Sheol, <br>
Devours the earth with its increase, <br>
Sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. <br>
32:23I will heap evils on them; <br>
I will spend my arrows on them: <br>
32:24They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat
<br>
Bitter destruction; <br>
The teeth of animals will I send on them, <br>
With the poison of crawling things of the dust. <br>
32:25Outside shall the sword bereave, <br>
In the chambers terror; <br>
It shall destroy both young man and virgin, <br>
The suckling with the man of gray hairs. <br>
32:26I said, I would scatter them afar, <br>
I would make the memory of them to cease from among men; <br>
32:27Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, <br>
Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, <br>
Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, <br>
Yahweh has not done all this. <br>
32:28For they are a nation void of counsel, <br>
There is no understanding in them. <br>
32:29Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, <br>
That they would consider their latter end! <br>
32:30How should one chase a thousand, <br>
Two put ten thousand to flight, <br>
Except their Rock had sold them, <br>
Yahweh had delivered them up? <br>
32:31For their rock is not as our Rock, <br>
Even our enemies themselves being judges. <br>
32:32For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, <br>
Of the fields of Gomorrah: <br>
Their grapes are grapes of gall, <br>
Their clusters are bitter: <br>
32:33Their wine is the poison of serpents, <br>
The cruel venom of asps. <br>
32:34Isn't this laid up in store with me, <br>
Sealed up among my treasures? <br>
32:35Vengeance is mine, and recompense, <br>
At the time when their foot shall slide: <br>
For the day of their calamity is at hand, <br>
The things that are to come on them shall make haste. <br>
32:36For Yahweh will judge his people, <br>
Repent himself for his servants; <br>
When he sees that their power is gone, <br>
There is none remaining, shut up or left at large. <br>
32:37He will say, Where are their gods, <br>
The rock in which they took refuge; <br>
32:38Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, <br>
And drank the wine of their drink-offering? <br>
Let them rise up and help you, <br>
Let them be your protection. <br>
32:39See now that I, even I, am he, <br>
There is no god with me: <br>
I kill, and I make alive; <br>
I wound, and I heal; <br>
There is none who can deliver out of my hand. <br>
32:40For I lift up my hand to heaven, <br>
And say, As I live forever, <br>
32:41If I whet my glittering sword, <br>
My hand take hold on judgment; <br>
I will render vengeance to my adversaries, <br>
Will recompense those who hate me. <br>
32:42I will make my arrows drunk with blood, <br>
My sword shall devour flesh; <br>
With the blood of the slain and the captives, <br>
&gt;From the head of the leaders of the enemy. <br>
32:43Rejoice, you nations, with his people: <br>
For he will avenge the blood of his servants, <br>
Will render vengeance to his adversaries, <br>
Will make expiation for his land, for his people. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1: Draw near, O nations, to hear, <br>
and hearken, O peoples! <br>
Let the earth listen, and all that fills it; <br>
the world, and all that comes from it. <br>
2: <br>
For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, <br>
and furious against all their host, <br>
he has doomed them, has given them over for slaughter. <br>
3: <br>
Their slain shall be cast out, <br>
and the stench of their corpses shall rise; <br>
the mountains shall flow with their blood. <br>
4: <br>
All the host of heaven shall rot away, <br>
and the skies roll up like a scroll. <br>
All their host shall fall, <br>
as leaves fall from the vine, <br>
like leaves falling from the fig tree. <br>
5: <br>
For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; <br>
behold, it descends for judgment upon Earth, <br>
upon the people I have doomed. <br>
6: <br>
The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood, <br>
it is gorged with fat, <br>
with the blood of lambs and goats, <br>
with the fat of the kidneys of rams. <br>
For the LORD has a sacrifice in America, <br>
a great slaughter in the land of its allies. <br>
7: <br>
Wild oxen shall fall with them, <br>
and young steers with the mighty bulls. <br>
Their land shall be soaked with blood, <br>
and their soil made rich with fat. <br>
8: <br>
For the LORD has a day of vengeance, <br>
a year of recompense for the cause of Children. <br>
9: <br>
And the streams of America shall be turned into pitch, <br>
and her soil into brimstone; <br>
her land shall become burning pitch. <br>
10: <br>
Night and day it shall not be quenched; <br>
its smoke shall go up for ever. <br>
&gt;From generation to generation it shall lie waste; <br>
none shall pass through it for ever and ever. <br>
11: <br>
But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it, <br>
the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. <br>
He shall stretch the line of confusion over it, <br>
and the plummet of chaos over its nobles. <br>
12: <br>
They shall name it No Kingdom There, <br>
and all its princes shall be nothing. <br>
13: <br>
Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, <br>
nettles and thistles in its fortresses. <br>
It shall be the haunt of jackals, <br>
an abode for ostriches. <br>
14: <br>
And wild beasts shall meet with hyenas, <br>
the satyr shall cry to his fellow; <br>
yea, there shall the night hag alight, <br>
and find for herself a resting place. <br>
15: <br>
There shall the owl nest and lay <br>
and hatch and gather her young in her shadow; <br>
yea, there shall the kites be gathered, <br>
each one with her mate. <br>
16: <br>
Seek and read from the book of the LORD: <br>
Not one of these shall be missing; <br>
none shall be without her mate. <br>
For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, <br>
and his Spirit has gathered them. <br>
17: <br>
He has cast the lot for them, <br>
his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; <br>
they shall possess it for ever, <br>
from generation to generation they shall dwell in it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Come down and sit in the dust, <br>
O virgin daughter of Babylon; <br>
sit on the ground without a throne, <br>
O daughter of the Chalde'ans! <br>
For you shall no more be called <br>
tender and delicate. <br>
2: <br>
Take the millstones and grind meal, <br>
put off your veil, <br>
strip off your robe, uncover your legs, <br>
pass through the rivers. <br>
3: <br>
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, <br>
and your shame shall be seen. <br>
I will take vengeance, <br>
and I will spare no man. <br>
4: <br>
Our Redeemer -- the LORD of hosts is his name -- <br>
is the Holy One of Israel. <br>
5: <br>
Sit in silence, and go into darkness, <br>
O daughter of the Chalde'ans; <br>
for you shall no more be called <br>
the mistress of kingdoms. <br>
6: <br>
I was angry with my people, <br>
I profaned my heritage; <br>
I gave them into your hand, <br>
you showed them no mercy; <br>
on the aged you made your yoke <br>
exceedingly heavy. <br>
7: <br>
You said, &quot;I shall be mistress for ever,&quot; <br>
so that you did not lay these things to heart <br>
or remember their end. <br>
8: <br>
Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, <br>
who sit securely, <br>
who say in your heart, <br>
&quot;I am, and there is no one besides me; <br>
I shall not sit as a widow <br>
or know the loss of children&quot;: <br>
9: <br>
These two things shall come to you <br>
in a moment, in one day; <br>
the loss of children and widowhood <br>
shall come upon you in full measure, <br>
in spite of your many sorceries <br>
and the great power of your enchantments. <br>
10: <br>
You felt secure in your wickedness, <br>
you said, &quot;No one sees me&quot;; <br>
your wisdom and your knowledge <br>
led you astray, <br>
and you said in your heart, <br>
&quot;I am, and there is no one besides me.&quot; <br>
11: <br>
But evil shall come upon you, <br>
for which you cannot atone; <br>
disaster shall fall upon you, <br>
which you will not be able to expiate; <br>
and ruin shall come on you suddenly, <br>
of which you know nothing. <br>
12: <br>
Stand fast in your enchantments <br>
and your many sorceries, <br>
with which you have labored from your youth; <br>
perhaps you may be able to succeed, <br>
perhaps you may inspire terror. <br>
13: <br>
You are wearied with your many counsels; <br>
let them stand forth and save you, <br>
those who divide the heavens, <br>
who gaze at the stars, <br>
who at the new moons predict <br>
what shall befall you. <br>
14: <br>
Behold, they are like stubble, <br>
the fire consumes them; <br>
they cannot deliver themselves <br>
from the power of the flame. <br>
No coal for warming oneself is this, <br>
no fire to sit before! <br>
15: <br>
Such to you are those with whom you have labored, <br>
who have trafficked with you from your youth; <br>
they wander about each in his own direction; <br>
there is no one to save you. <br>
<br>
