I realized that I should just go to court for every ticket or other
opportunity.  If the alternative is that you certainly have to pay, then
you
might as well learn, get comfortable protecting yourself in court, say
your
peace, and try whatever legal argument you can think of.  I have about a
50%
win rate.

Few people realize how easy it is to push 50% on tickets even if
all they do is plead not guilty and wait for the cop not to show up.
And that's before feigning/posturing that you actually have a case
thereby driving your own bargain. Prosecutors hate risk.
You making a case in front of a judge is a risk they'll bend over
backwards to avoid. Find their weak spots, play to win, go for the
dismissals, prepare for the not guilty battles, punk the state,
have fun with it :) After all, it is your right. And entire forums
exist to help you do it.

One of the most significant benefits - learning to face one of your
fears. Think you're tough, strong, emotionally balanced? Get up in
front of a Magistrate and facing down the prosecutor, and see what
your knees do then :)

Do that a few times, and start to feel awesome! Self esteem fast track...
