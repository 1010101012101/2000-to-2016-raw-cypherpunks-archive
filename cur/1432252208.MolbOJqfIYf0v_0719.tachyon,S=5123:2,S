Actually, many people do. What planet have you been living on?

(I'm not arguing for "universal health care," or "socialized 
medicine," or Nathan Saper's "soak the giant corporations" scheme. 
I'm just disputing the point above, which is patently false.)

Many do not have insurance, and do not receive care for various 
ailments until it's too late.  Many do not have insurance and do not 
have annual physicals, or mammograms, or prostate exams, or pap 
smears, or any of the hundreds of such things.

Some hospitals offers limited free services, some free clinics exist. 
But clearly many Americans are not receiving such care. And of course 
these "free services" are often a huge distance from _good_ 
healthcare. So much for "nobody dies without healthcare."

This is not true. Again, I have to question your connection to 
current events. Surely you have heard of folks being turned away at 
emergency room entrances and shipped off to the "public hospital"? 
There are many cases in many cities where people died in ambulances 
that had been turned away at the _nearest_ (or _better_) hospital and 
sent off on a 30-minute ambulance or taxicab ride to the "public" 
hospital in town.

Again, I am not advocating that medicine be socialized or that 
hospitals be forced to treat those they choose not to treat.

(Were it my hospital, I would not think highly of Men with Guns 
telling me I must give $10,000 worth of ER services to someone who 
won't pay me back and who has no insurance.)

Yes...so?
