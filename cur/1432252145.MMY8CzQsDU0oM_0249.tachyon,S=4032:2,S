Assume the below bill becomes law. Would anyone care to write a program 
that violates this law and send it to me in the next 10 hours? I would be 
glad to give you full credit in my weekly column, which is why I'm writing 
this. Heck, maybe a procmail-formail combination would do it.

This might be the easiest to code for:
''(i) is designed or produced primarily for the purpose of concealing the 
source or routing information of bulk unsolicited electronic mail messages 
in a manner prohibited by subparagraph (D) of this paragraph;

SEC. 2. PROTECTION FROM FRAUDULENT UNSOLICITED E-MAIL.
Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in subsection (a)(5)—
(A) by striking ''or'' at the end of subparagraph (B); and
(B) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:
''(D) intentionally and without authorization initiates the transmission of 
a bulk unsolicited electronic mail message to a protected computer with 
knowledge that such message falsifies an Internet domain, header 
information, date or time stamp, originating e-mail address, or other 
identifier; or
''(E) intentionally sells or distributes any computer program that—
''(i) is designed or produced primarily for the purpose of concealing the 
source or routing information of bulk unsolicited electronic mail messages 
in a manner prohibited by subparagraph (D) of this paragraph;
''(ii) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than 
to conceal such source or routing information; or
''(iii) is marketed by the violator or an- other person acting in concert 
with the violator and with the violator's knowledge for use in concealing 
the source or routing information of such messages'';
