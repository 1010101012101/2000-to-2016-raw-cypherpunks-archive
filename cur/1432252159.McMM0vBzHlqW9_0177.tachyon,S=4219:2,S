The counter to this perspective is that its been considered 'reasonable' to
look at someone's face (in the optical) for a long time.  It is not
considered 'reasonable'
(ergo, not constitutional in the US) to ask folks to remove their camoflage
and attire, so the IVth protects citizens.  Wear the groucho glasses as a
protest.

Whether active or passive observation using extra-optical radiation is a
'search'
is currently a hot topic.  (Passive, and typically civilian, observation
includes 
checking out folks' underwear using IR sensitive cameras; Pol/mil observation
includes active mm & xray irradiation and reception, and the recently
disallowed
passive IR observation of homes.)  Would face-surveillance cams that
snarfed IR
and got your facial blood vessel patterns be unreasonably searching?
