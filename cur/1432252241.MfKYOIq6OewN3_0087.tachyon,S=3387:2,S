Ottawa to try to freeze terrorist funds: Tougher rules and changes to 
criminal code expected to make it easier to track monies
By ELIZABETH THOMPSON

OTTAWA -- Canada will move to follow the American lead and shut down 
funding for terrorists, Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions Jim Peterson said yesterday. [...]

Peterson said the government plans to adopt tough new weapons to combat the 
financing of terrorism, possibly through an omnibus bill. Among the 
possible measures is extending the system that combats money-laundering to 
tracking terrorist funds, he said. While Peterson said the new rules are 
almost ready and should be introduced soon, neither he nor Justice Minister 
Anne McLellan could pinpoint a date. [...]

McLellan said the legislation she is preparing will also deal with such 
issues as lawful access, encryption, decryption and electronic 
surveillance. [...] McLellan said she will meet with a number of European 
counterparts today and
U.S counterparts next week to try to co-ordinate Canada's legislation with 
theirs. [...]
