 This looks like a college essay prompt, and because most if not all colleges use your S.S. number as an ID#, the poor sucker had it released.

>         If an American has turned on a TV in the last few years, they should have noticed that school shootings are on a rise.  A plausible explanation could be that todays youth do not have the ability to release aggression on a day-to-day basis.  Children need to have the ability to vent their anger and now see gun related violence as a more spectacular form of violence.
>         When I was young most children exhibited hostility through fighting or watching others fight.  Today the punishments for fighting are suspension or expulsion, while in the past the children we forced to complete an activity to waste their time or energy.  With the severe pressure to get along children are holding in their aggression more.  Most children are able to handle this or let their anger out through sports or active hobbies.
> Look at the children of two recent shootings.  One was a young child who was not involved in sports and was constantly picked on, the other was a four or five member group who were said to be outcasts in their school and were also not involved in sports.  In both these cases the youths had active friends, but were not involved in any active activities.
> Youths are also going through a stage in their life were they need people to pay attention, yet today society is trying to turn children into robots and statistics.  Looking at the rule books for a local grade school you would think they are supposed to replace a bible.  Children today are even restricted in what games they play, who they talk to, and how to dress.  At the same time children are hearing about how to their community they are just numbers.  They spend over a month preparing and taking tests so they can show the authority how much they know.  Children desire to be involved and paid attention to.
> A third factor to the rise in school shootings could be that before youths would try to commit acts of extreme violence by suicide, small bombs, or destroying property.  Today children see that shootings and gun related violence are a huge media hype events.  They feel that by shooting another kid they could gain an extreme amount of attention to themselves or their situation.  They know that people will remember their actions.  Their horrible acts are more easily recalled then state capitals.  Where was the last shooting?  What is the capital of Alabama?
> Society must learn that children will be aggressive.  They will release their anger, but it does not have to be in such a spectacular fashion.  Parents need to talk to their children and play a ACTIVE role in their life.  Society needs to stop treating children as a collective group of autonomous beings, but as a diverse group of individuals.  And we as a nation need to show then that yes, we care for you as an individual.
