Probably alot less stupid than you.

Let me explain it to you again, using small words so you can understand.

It is from different people whos systems are infected by a virus.

The virus forges the From: e-mail address.

These people are using an e-mail client that is vulnerable executing
attached executables (like Outlook 2000 with preview mode) or have clicked
on the attachment and have infected themselves with the virus.

The infected people have a cypherpunks address(es) in their address book.

The virus sends to everyone on the address book.

Thetoad.com address is depreciated.

Understand now?

I didn't think so...
