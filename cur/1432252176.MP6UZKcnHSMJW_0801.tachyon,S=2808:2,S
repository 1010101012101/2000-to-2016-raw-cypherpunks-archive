I do not think so.

Lenin surrounded the cities to keep people and food from going in 
and out.   This was the first step in a program to reintroduce 
serfdom, binding the peasant to the land.

Lenin, and later Stalin, were waging war on the countryside to 
extort food without supplying goods.  This produced a flight from 
the countryside, that they immediately met with terror.
