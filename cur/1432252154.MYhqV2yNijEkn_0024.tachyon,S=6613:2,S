Journalists Shill Sources and Secrets

http://sourcesandsecrets.com/

Advertised with $20,000 full-page vanity ad in the New York Times, 16 
March 2014.

Coordinated with the NYT's release of its Snowden files series and 
books by Greenwald and Gellman, and video by Poitras, as well as 
capacious media roll-outs, conferences, celebrity profiles, movies, 
awards, prizes, law suits, mock threats, and phony investigations.

Also coordinated with the rise of billionaire and corporate-funded 
"non-profit" journalism like ProPublica, The Intercept and The 
Marshall Project which pay over $500,000 top salaries, some with over 
$1M in total compensation packages. http://cryptome.org/2014/03/npj-14-0314.pdf
