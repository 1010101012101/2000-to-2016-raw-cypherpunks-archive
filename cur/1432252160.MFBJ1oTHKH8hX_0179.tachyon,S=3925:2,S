It's been a slow politics and cryptography year.  The list is
full of spam, and vandals keep subscribing it to other mailing
lists.  

Perhaps next year will be better.  I'm almost begining to feel
that Cryptology has achieved the status of a "Mature Science."

I'm currently amusing myself on DetweilerPunks.  Also known as 
Theory-Edge, moderated by Vladimir Z. Nuri.

http://www.egroups.com/group/theory-edge, if anyone wants to visit.

Yes, a tasteful .sig designed not to cause public alarm, until 
the Shrub Administration's interpretation of our Constitution
is clarified. 

I suspect we are entering an era in which even vague hints 
concerning a sticky end for tyrants can get one arrested.

You need to moderate your views on non-producing eaters in the same
way you moderated your .sig file.  A new Tim for a new decade.

So, when's the next Jim Bell trial?  Anyone know?
