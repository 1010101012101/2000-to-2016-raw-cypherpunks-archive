Germany has recently deployed a Toll Collect system which has license plate
OCR mounted
on many points (hundreds to thousands) over highways. It reads all license
plates (missing out some 5% or so currently), supposedly discarding
everything but the truck's. Currently.

It is sufficient to create movement profiles of individual vehicles with a
rather good resolution (but then, mobile phones are even more useful for
that).
