I reply:

Unlike you, I am not under the delusion that I will ever see any of my 
SS contributions back.  I'm not interested in government unemployment 
benefits.  I was unemployed for a few months back when.  It never even 
occurred to me to seek unemployment benefits.  Even if it had I 
wouldn't have bothered.

"Large donations to the government."  I have a hard time understanding 
that.  Social Security is a TAX.  Period.  If you believe otherwise 
it's because some good salesmen (spin doctors) have told you so.  It's 
not voluntary- therefore not a "donation" and I'd barely make 2% on it 
if I bothered to make a claim in 20-40 years.  Who cares?  I prefer to 
file for 17 dependent exemptions, put the extra money from my biweekly 
paycheck in a fund and then pay the principal back in April and keep 
the interest for myself- that's a little naughtier though.  I get far 
more out of that then I ever will from Social Security.

It's a TAX.  Period.  I'm not looking to commit tax fraud.  I'll pay it 
like my other taxes.  Still, I'm not going to let someone destroy my 
privacy because I am under the delusion that I somehow will see my SS 
contributions some undefined day more than two or three decades hence.
