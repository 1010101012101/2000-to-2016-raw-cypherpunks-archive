I think whether the 2nd is enforceable against states and municipalities 
will depend upon the SC deciding to apply the 14th Amendment.  The Supreme 
Court has long held that the 14th Amendment does not make all of the Bill 
of Rights applicable to the States. Only those rights the Court finds to be 
"fundamental" apply. To this day, several portions of the Bill of Rights, 
including the right to indictment by grand jury, to a jury trial in any 
common-law suit over $20, and to the rules of the common law in judicial 
review of jury fact-finding, have not been held to be fundamental and to 
this day are not applicable to the states.

Is the right to keep and bear arms a fundamental right? Obviously the NRA 
would argue that it is. But the Supreme Court would be well within 
precedent if it were to hold that given modern conditions, a right to keep 
and bear arms, like a right to a jury trial for a 20-dollar dispute, can no 
longer be said to be so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty as to be 
fundamental. If it so held, the 2nd Amendment would remain applicable to 
the Federal Government, but would not apply to the States, which would be 
free to use their militia regulatory powers to regulate guns as they see fit.
