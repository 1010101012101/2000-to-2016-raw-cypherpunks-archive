we've got a proof of concept build of an internet privacy appliance
for windows users built at:
http://public.peertech.org/jvm/

there are some known issues / deficiencies in this release:
- DNS leaks due to transparent proxy. transparent DNS proxy when in
anonymous mode is in progress (using tor-resolve and a python DNS
server)
- http traffic is identified by outgoing port (80, 8080, etc) rather
than traffic type. L7 matching is also in the works.
- https (SSL/TLS) traffic is passed through and not proxied.
- this runtime has not been hardened against malicious peers on the
same internal network and chroot's and other techniques are not yet
implemented.

we're trying to work out logistics for torrent seeding before
distributing the build tools to remaster your own vmware installers
and customize the privacy appliance.  we're working on fixing known
issues and anticipate a

how it works in a nutshell:
- start the vmware instance with 128M ram and 200M disk (image is 38M
compressed)
- a public SMB share is provided with a Run.BAT install script
- script installs a MS PPTP VPN connection to forward all traffic
through the appliance
- privacy (privoxy) and anonymity (tor) is enabled by default.  you
can select privacy only for a faster browsing experience with ads and
popups filtered.

a note on auto updates:
remove the /etc/janus directory to prevent the automatic update check.
 we intend to use this to deploy security critical patches, filtering
updates to privoxy, and other maintenance.  you can apply these
changes by hand or disable them completely as desired.
