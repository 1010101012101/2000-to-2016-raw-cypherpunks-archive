The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson wi|l 
announce further detai|s as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dril|ing 
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it wi|l be able to bui|d a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing a|l possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we will have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, which 
wi|l a|ways encourage the participation of financial partners."

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se|ling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This small company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you wi|| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors will secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
