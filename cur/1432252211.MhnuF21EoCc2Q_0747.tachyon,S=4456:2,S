Subject: NOWAR - Showdown in Texas, Teach-ins, and More

Hello, all. More information about the Showdown in Texas, which will happen
this weekend. Also a correction on the location of tonight's event.

On Wednesday, April 30, at 7:00 pm, there will be a teach-in on "Enhancing
Democracy? Why the U.S. Military Won't Bring Democracy to the World."
Speakers include UT History Professor Geoffrey Schad, speaking on Syria;
Communications Professor Dana Cloud; and Rahul Mahajan of the Nowar
Collective, author of the forthcoming "Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power
in Iraq and Beyond"
(http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100353810).
Location: UT Campus, Gearing 105 (Gearing is at 24th and University.
http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/gea.html).

On Saturday, May 3, the Showdown in Texas commences (other related events
will already be in progress -- see
http://www.showdowntx.com/html/schedule.html). The Showdown rally is a
demand for human security, not "homeland" security: funding for healthcare,
housing, education and jobs; environmental sustainability; protection of
civil liberties for citizens, immigrants and indigenous peoples, a
moratorium on the death penalty, and an end to US military interventions
and war at home and abroad.
Starting at 11:00 am at least 6 issue marches starting in different
locations (see http://www.showdowntx.com/html/schedule.html for details)
will converge at the Capitol at High Noon for an opening rally. This rally
will be followed by a mass march past some of the top defense industry
contractors located in downtown Austin and end up back at the Capitol for a
Festival of Love and Resistance.

The main events are at the State Capitol:
12:00 noon. Opening rally with a large slate of national speakers,
including Lucius Walker of Pastors for Peace, Medea Benjamin of Global
Exchange (http://www.globalexchange.org), Cheri Honkala of the Kensington
Welfare Rights Union, and Rania Masri.
1:15 Military Reality March - participants will march past some of the
downtown corporate and military defense contractors and back to the Capitol
building.
3:00-5:00 pm - Festival of love and Resistance. More speakers, music, and a
special guest star. Also poets, breakdancers, low riders, and much more.

On Sunday, May 4, from 6:00-8:00pm, there will be a teach-in on "The Texas
Military-Industrial Complex: Profiting from War and Occupation." This event
is associated with the Showdown. Speakers will talk about Lockheed Martin,
Dyncorp, the role of oil in the Military-Industrial Complex, and the
connection of Texas to the occupations of Palestine and Iraq. Speakers
include Rahul Mahajan of the Nowar Collective, author of the forthcoming
"Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power in Iraq and Beyond"
(http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100353810), Stefan
Wray (http://www.iconmedia.org/mdp), and Quent Reese.
Location: UT Campus, Jester Auditorium, 21st and Speedway, across Speedway
from the Perry-Castaneda Library.

All events are free and open to the public. Please forward where appropriate.

In Solidarity,

the Nowar Collective
