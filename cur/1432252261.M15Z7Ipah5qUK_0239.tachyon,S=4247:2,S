Absolutely.. People make mistakes... People also do things on purpose.. I am
just not the kind of person that automatically assumes someone does anything
on purpose... I have been in alot of intense situations in my career as a
firefighter in the Air Force and I can honestly say people will do the most
stupid things you would have ever imagined in intense situations. I would be
interested to find out what the investigation turns up after this..
