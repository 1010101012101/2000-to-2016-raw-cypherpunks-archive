Hmm. I just responded to Aimee's message, and so I may have just been 
trolled.  But I rise to the defense of human sentience here: I don't think 
an AI would have bothered to ask us about such an inane sociological tract...

Another theory is that Aimee actually thinks that all cypherpunks 
subscribers are pleasant, decent, and reasonable people who should be 
treated politely. I'm sure folks -- is Choate around? -- will disabuse her 
of this notion straightaway.
