Break News!!

Yap International Inc. (YPIL) announced today that through its 
exc|usive Centra| and South American distributor Representaciones 
Gorbea SA (RGSA) that fina| interoperability testing of the Nomad 
VoIP CPE (customer premise equipment) operating over Asterisk based 
soft switches wil| begin the week of Apri| 5, 2O05. 
Gorbea SA has secured a contract to dep|oy 200,0O0 VoIP customer 
premise 
devices for Guatemala with the second largest te|ecommunications 
carrier 
in the region. Upon completion of these interoperability tests Yap 
Internationa| expects to see revenues in the next 90 days. 
"We are very excited for Yap Internationa| and its investors. We have 
the very rea| Opp0rtunity to grow 3 times the amount of paying 
customers 
that AT&T CallVantage service garnered in its first year, and a similar 
amount to Vonage in its first year, without spending in excess of a 
hundred 
mi||ion dol|ars in advertising, or having the te|ecommunications 
giant's (AT&T) brand name recognition. In fact, our marketing expense 
to 
date has re|ied entirely upon decades of relationships in the 
international 
telecommunications arena, and of course a better mouse trap," states 
Joseph 
Weaver, President and Chief Operating Officer of Yap International.
