In my original post, I said that legalism was pretty much the
same thing as communism/nazism, so you are not disagreeing with
me, merely re - raising a point I had already raised.

However, whereas legalism is much the same thing
communism/nazism, confucianism is legalism moderated by
conservatism

And the commies hated the nazis, as well as other commies
slightly different from themselves, and the nazis hated other
nazis slightly different from themselves.

The conflict between confucianism and legalism does not imply
the difference betweent the two is very large, though it is a
good deal larger than the miniscule difference between
communism and nazism.

> By comparison, Confucianism was remarkably enlightened,

"by comparison".

Well most things are pretty enlightened by comparison with
communism/legalism/nazism.

I am less impressed by this fact than you are.

Confucianism is despotic and oppressive.  Even if confucians do
not bury scholars alives, they suppress their opponents by
means less spectacular, but in the long run comparably
effective.  China stagnated because no thought other than
official thought occurred.
