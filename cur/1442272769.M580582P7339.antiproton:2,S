I think that the best privacy respecting laptop around would be a Libreboot computer that has the camera, microphone, and harddrive physically removed and runs Tails on a DVD so that neither the operating system nor the BIOS can be altered without physical access to the computer. The version of Libreboot on the laptop must be write protected, which would mean that updates would need to be externally flashed to the BIOS chip, but this prevents any attempted BIOS alteration from happening via software. Tamper proof stickers or glitter nailpolish could be applied to detect whether the device has been opened while out of your possession. There's no way to flash the Bios chip without opening the device. Preferences and files that the user wants to keep across amnesiac sessions would be saved on a LUKS encrypted USB thumb-drive.

Libreboot will soon have reproducible builds which would allow users to compare the Libreboot ROM on their device against the reproducible build of the ROM.

I would suggest that all Libreboot supported motherboards should be x-rayed and the x-rays should be published online under creative commons licenses so that users could have their own motherboards x-rayed to provide some sort of hardware verifiability which is currently very much lacking.

Here's more info about Libreboot, which is a Coreboot fork that takes out all of Coreboot's proprietary blobs: http://libreboot.org/faq/

Here's the Free Software Foundation's announcement that the Libreboot x200 earned their Respect Your Freedom certification https://www.fsf.org/news/libreboot-x200-laptop-now-fsf-certified-to-respect-your-freedom

Laptops that run Libreboot with operating systems that don't comply with the GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG) https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html don't have FSF's RYF certification. https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom

So until Tails creates a version that complies with the GNU FSDG or until someone creates an operating system forked of a Free Distro https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html that has all of Tails' security features included we are all stuck with having to chose between security and freedom in our operating systems. We can code our way out of this false dichotomy though, if we want it.

https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5393
https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009023.html
https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009024.html

If you believe that the security features in Tails aren't worth the trade off of having fully free software or if you believe that Tails running as a DVD instead of a USB stick isn't necessary, it is important to also note that Libreboot's GRUB payload allows you to boot fully encrypted harddrives and USB live systems by decrypting them within the GRUB instance on your Bios chip and then booting the decrypted OS. This means that the boot sector on the operating system or USB live system can now also be fully encrypted when not in use.

Does anyone on this list think that Librem+PureOS is more free & secure than Libreboot+Tails as I described it here?

Peace & Blessings,
Jah Love
