The _real_ news was, of course, that no one delivered the Sato Solution 
to that den of statists.

Granted, delivering a fully-loaded 767 through the roof of the Capitol 
dome has become harder than it was when Clancy first proposed it 
(ironically, Clancy remained a vaunted consultant while those on 
newsgroups who speculated similarly reportedly got visits from the SS). 
But each year I keep hoping that my CNN coverage will suddenly go blank 
and Aaron Brown and Judy Woodruff will say "We seem to have lost 
communcation with the Capitol...Judy, what's that bright orange glow 
over towards the Capitol?"

Of course, a true nest-cleaning detonation would probably take out most 
of Crystal City as well, so Aaron, Lou, Dan, Peter, and Oprah would 
probably be "having the vapors."

There's always next year...
