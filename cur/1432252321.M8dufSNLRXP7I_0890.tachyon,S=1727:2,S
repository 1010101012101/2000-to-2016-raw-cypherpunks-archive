Since when did a few remote Al Q boot camps piss people off?

Religion-based initiation of force pisses people off, just as the
Xian right will discover should it start beating women in the

Don't confuse the govt (eg Taliban, a faith-based organization) with
NGOs which may attract cruise missiles, but not hostility from the
populace, who probably enjoyed the extra commerce.
