ABCnews.com has a story and a streaming video segment concerning Osam Bin 
Laden's use of Steganography.

http://abcnews.go.com/sections/primetime/DailyNews/PRIMETIME_011004_steganography.html 
(Link to video on page).

My problem is in the video segment. The segment "demonstrates" the use of 
steganography buy showing 3 examples: 1. The floor plan of an aircraft 
hidden in an image of the Mona Lisa; 2. A satelite photo hidden in a Web 
Site image; 3. A Flight Schedule hidden in an MP3 file(Whitney Houston's 
renditon of "God Bless America" no less).

The way the video is edited impiles to a casual observer that these are 
actually images from from Bin Laden. Only a couple times do they mention in 
passing that it is a "Demonstration".

The slickly produced segment's only purpose seems to be to spread FUD about 
the use of Cryptography and Stegnaography.

Shame on them.
