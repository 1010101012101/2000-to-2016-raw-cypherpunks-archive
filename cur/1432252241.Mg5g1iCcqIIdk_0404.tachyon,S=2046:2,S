hi!
I am a gentle, smart, calm and romantic young woman who has a
wonderful sense of humor. You will never feel bored with me. I'm a
very sporty lady and I always try to keep fit. I also like meeting my
friends and spend time with them outdoors. I like being on the nature
very much. Swimming in the hot weather is perfect time spending for me.
I would like to find here a man who would be very purposeful, who
could reach his goals and would know how to reach success in
everything. But the most important for me is his ability to love and
to understand. He also should love children and try to be a good
father. The most important thing about my future husband is that he
must be faithful as I'm.
I also have some questions for you if you really want to get aquatinted
with me:
1) What are you looking for in relationships with a woman?
2) Are you going to visit Russia someday?
3) What do you prefer best - to write messages or to talk by the
phone?
4) What is the most important thing for you in creating a family?
5) Do you think that we can match each other?

I am looking forward to your reply to

Wait for your letters.
Irina
