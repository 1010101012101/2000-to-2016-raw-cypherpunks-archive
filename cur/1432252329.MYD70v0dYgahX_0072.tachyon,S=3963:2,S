I've been thinking about Carnivore for days. I can't really see the data
that it collects/spews forth being anywhere near uncontestable.

These are probably obvious points but..

Is Carnivore going to be simply a software/OS specification, or all round
including hardware? What's to stop the provider being in collusion with
whoever's being monitored, and 'unplugging' the UTP whenever sensitive
data is being sent out? Worse still, what's to stop spoofed packets/data
being injected (by your friendly law officers) into carnivore to
incriminate those being monitored. Likewise, is there some sort of
protocol to on similar situations (well same ball-park), say
voice-wiretaps, that prevents evidence tampering?

Is there some sort of specification for this thing, or was the so called
research performed on this thing done under complete NDA?

I don't see how it holds up in any court.
