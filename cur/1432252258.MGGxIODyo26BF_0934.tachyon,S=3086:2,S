The Armory is Shutting Down

The owner and operator of Silk Road, aliased as Dread Pirate Roberts,
announced on August 2nd, 2012 that bThe Armoryb, an extension of Silk Road
focused on allowing users to anonymously buy and sell munitions, will be
closing.  Roberts cited a low and continuously declining number of
transactions b enough that the 10% take of Silk Road wasnbt even enough to
keep the servers paid b as reason for discontinuing this particular arm of
the Silk Road marketplace. Some users explain user dis-interest with high
prices on The Armory, and too much competition from local dealers, who can
still retain customer privacy while conducting legal transactions.

The Armory is not yet closed b a countdownhas been initiated. Roberts warns
users to finish up their current business and withdraw any lingering funds
before the countdown is reached.

Many Bitcoin users have expressed joy over the closure, either for personal
anti-gun reasons, or for the removal of a potential derogatory connotation of
Bitcoins with the illegal sale of firearms.

Despite this closure, there may be hope in the future for those interested in
anonymously pawning and procuring guns online.  Roberts states, bif we are
going to serve an anonymous weapons market, I think it will require more
careful thought an[d] planning,b indicating the possibility of a future
restoration of the service after some additional forethought on the design.
