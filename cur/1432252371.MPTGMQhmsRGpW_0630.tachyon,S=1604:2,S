I caught the rerun. I have John's appearence as an mpg;
13 Mb at VCD qual, ~65 at DVD qual. I think <2 minutes
of a 30 minute show counts as fair use.
 
If someone can take that much as a mail attachment,
or has an acessible ftp site, I'd be happy to send it.
I'd prefer someone who can post it for others.
 
It's funny, but not deep.
 
Peter
