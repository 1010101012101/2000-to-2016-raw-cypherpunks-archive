If things get utterly intolerable, and fighting makes no sense since
you're in a minority you can always emigrate. My parents did it more than
twenty years ago when leaving Evil Empire; some of my best friends are
expats unwilling to go back to Merkinland for political reasons.

Don't count on EU, we're just as fucked, albeit with a slight delay.
