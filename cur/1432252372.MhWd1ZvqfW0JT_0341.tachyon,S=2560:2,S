If that was the plan, the US would do Sudan, not Iraq.

What happened was that when the conscript armies collapsed,
Saddam threw his highly privileged non conscript police forces
into battle, so naturally the US army smashed them.  Poof.  No
police.  No police in a nation of twenty million welfare bums.
Result, loot and burn.

The US army was not expecting this.  Remember Narisaya.  US
army defeated the regular Iraqi army, thought Narisaya done.
Proceeds on its merry way, advancing far past Narisaya.
Police attack, seriously impairing US ability to supply troops
at the front -- people at the front run alarmingly short of
food, fuel, and water.  Disaster looms.  Result.  US army wipes
out all police everywhere in a nation of welfare bums.   That
was not the plan, that was an extremely violent reaction to a
close brush with disaster.
