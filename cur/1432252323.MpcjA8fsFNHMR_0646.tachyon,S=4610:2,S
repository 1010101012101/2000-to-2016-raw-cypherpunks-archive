              New Jersey Student Posts 'Hit List'
              on Internet 

              MIDDLESEX, N.J. (Reuters) - An eighth grader was
              suspended from a New Jersey middle school this week
              after posting a ``hit list'' of fellow students on an
Internet
              Web site, school officials said on Thursday.

              The list was found on Tuesday posted on a Web site called
              ''People2kill.'' It named several students of the Mauger
              School and showed their pictures, school superintendent
              Patricia Johnson said.

              Police in the central New Jersey town are investigating
the
              incident. Middlesex Police Capt. Gregory Sharkey said no
              charges have been filed but had no other comment.

              ``I'm horrified and very disturbed by this. It's a sign of
the
              times,'' Johnson told Reuters.

              The student, a girl, was immediately removed from school
              and is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.

              School officials do not believe the girl was going to
carry
              out the threats but searched her locker and personal
              belongings for weapons. None were found, Johnson said.

              The student has no prior disciplinary record. School
              officials said interviews with the girl indicated the
posting
              may have been a prank, Johnson said.

              The incident is one of the latest in an epidemic of
              shootings and threats in the nation's schools and
              workplaces, reminiscent of the 1999 Columbine massacre
              in which 15 people died, including the two teenage
              gunmen.
