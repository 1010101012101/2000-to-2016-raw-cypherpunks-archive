Your corrections notwithstanding, do you really find it rational to expect the
fate of a few citizens to change national policy? Why should it.

So? Only the weak-minded would sit around fretting and crying over what happens
to a few people who are likely going to be killed anyway. If I--or anyone I
ever cared about--were hostages, it wouldn't change my mind on this in the
least. The terrorists are the ones responsible for rendering me "expendable",
not whomever they're trying to pressure.  Absolutely despicable, get a spine.

Fuck negotiation, fuck capitulation. Give in once and you're setting yourself
up for more of the same for eternity. Someone says they're going to slaughter
my family unless I do what they want? Go right ahead and see what it gets you.

The sentimental don't have a snowball's chance in hell against the ruthless:
wallowing in the finer points of conscience is a luxury those on the wrong side
of a gun just can't afford. Initiating force and responding to it in kind are
two entirely different issues: just because the Palestinians have a legitimate
cause for complaint doesn't mean they (or Israel, or the US) should get a free
pass. Nobody gets a free pass.

"Critics frequently refer to the icy rationality of the Hudson Institute, the
RAND Corporation and other such organizations. I'm always tempted to ask in
reply, 'Would you prefer a warm, human error? Do you feel better with a nice
emotional mistake?' We cannot expect good discussion of security problems if we
are going to label every attempt at detachment as callous, every attempt at
objectivity as immoral. Technical details are not the only important operative
facts. Human and moral factors...must never be missing from policies and public
discussion. But emotionalism and sentimentality, as opposed to morality and
concern, only confuse the debates. Nor can experts be expected to repeat, 'If,
heavean forbid...', before every sentence."
