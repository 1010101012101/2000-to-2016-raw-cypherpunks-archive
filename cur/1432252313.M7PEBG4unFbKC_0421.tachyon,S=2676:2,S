If you were innocent of any crime and were thrown in the slammer with bad
people and given no opportunity to contact friends or lawyers, what would
you consider "a decent timeframe of investigation" before they cut you
loose?  If/when they did cut you loose would you say, "Hey, no hard feeling,
I know you have a job to do," or would you seek some sort of compensation?
