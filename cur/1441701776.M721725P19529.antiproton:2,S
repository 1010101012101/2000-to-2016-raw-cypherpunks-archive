There's two categories or buckets here if you're playing to win; One is 
a list of extensions you can install on *anyone's* computer without them 
even noticing the privacy/security boost they're receiving (because if 
they notice, you lose because they blame the new *ware for all their 
trivial problems). The other list is the power-user stuff that really 
works, but which n00bs will reject out of ignorance, blaming the 
protective software instead of the buggy websites it exposes.

My short-list for install-on-everyone's-computer is:

* Disconnect
* HTTPS-Everywhere
* uBlock Origin (don't change default settings)
* Disable 3rd Party Cookies

NoScript, Cookie-killers, RequestPolicy etcetera are too prone to 
creating problems for browser users; to an enlightened user, blame the 
website, work around, or make an exception and move on. But to a n00b, 
exposing errors in tracker-rich sites is unacceptable, sadly.
