Each depends on the situation, and whether or not fair use applies. If
there are mechanisms in place to sell or license the content, fair use is
less likely to apply.

So far, I haven't had any big problems with IA despite 100k+ items, several
TB of data and 1% their text library. Will somethings be an issue? Maybe,
but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it and not worry about it until I
know what chasm I have to cross and where.

Provenance etc. is situation dependent, no categorical answer exists that
isn't a bald faced lie.
