Nah...it wasn't half a million. It was a hell of a lot more, I suspect. Even 
a standard SC or APC connector cost $50 in those days, and from what I 
suspect this would be MUCH much more than that, and probably formed just one 
piece of a larger contract.

The odd thing about this case was that the judge ruled in favor of 
Lucent...the government wasn't even directly involved. Lucent made a ton of 
profit which this poor bastard didn't get dime one from. That's a lot 
different then allowing the government to use your IP.
