What's this nonsense about "keeping black folks quiescent and so on"/

I saw "minorities" practically float under the Golden Gate Bridge in 
inner tubes, coming from Vietnam. A few years after arriving, they were 
opening small shops and restaurants, then leading the way to opening 
"screwdriver shops" for building white box PCs.

As with most past "minorities"--Irish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, 
etc.--they buckled down and worked their butts off, often living 5-10 
to an apartment, saving for the day when they could buy their own 
house. Huge parts of Sunnyvale and Cupertino, to name just a few of the 
communities where this happened, became largely Asian during the 1980s.

Meanwhile, the "black folk" kept listening to Rev. Jess Jackson and 
Rev. Al Sharpton tell them that they were owed reparations, that they 
were owed a series of "entitlements." No suprise that a large fraction 
of negro teens subscribe to the view that "reading be for whitey." In 
fact, negroes have invented a whole series of insult terms for those 
who study too much, for those who break out of the "field worker" 
status: Uncle Toms, Oreos, etc.

Imagine where the Asians would be if Asian kids who did well in science 
and math were taunted as race traitors?

Today, Intel's engineering staff is about 75% "minority," mostly 
Indians, Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Pakistanis, and assorted other 
"minorities." More than half of all entering students at Berkeley, in 
all majors summed together, are Asian.

At Intel, we had very, very, very few blacks apply for engineering 
jobs. I recall three of them, and one of them was from Sierra Leone, 
not the U.S. All three left after various problems of their own making.

When I was interviewing candidates for engineering, I interviewed a 
bunch of Asians, about the same number of whites, and no negroes. Not 
by my choice, but because the negroes had largely ghettoized themselves 
into Black Studies, Sociology, and Yoruba/East African languages, or 
had not made it to graduation.

There are no negroes in senior high tech positions at any of the 
companies I am in investor in for some very obvious reasons.

"Math be for whitey. Reading be for whitey. We be owed repa-ations for 
diskiminashun!!"

Nonsense. The chip companies were NOT "payed for by somebody else's 
taxes." (Nor was the invention of the IC or the microprocessor paid for 
by DARPA or anyone else in government, despite factually incorrect lore 
to the contrary. I was there, at least for the onset of the micro, and 
I can say precisely what role government contracts played: none.)

Engineers and scientists who work an estimated 8 months out of each 
year to pay their taxes (Federal plus state plus local plus payroll 
plus property plus sales plus.....) see the minority layabouts working 
not one _day_ for their "entitlements" and "benefits" and "social 
services."

Do the math, unless you think math be for whitey.

You are contemptible.
