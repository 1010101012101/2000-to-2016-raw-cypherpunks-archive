I think in ZeroHedge's case their goldbuggery goes beyond your belief in
gold's superiority (which I share) and into the realm of irrationality. It
starts sounding like a long-term pump-and-dump scam, if there were such a
thing.

Indeed, though I think Bitcoin and related research have provided the
necessary building blocks. ZeroCoin/ZeroCash, for example. As far as
decentralized, it's not clear to me that Bitcoin is really worse than gold
has proven to be in practice, with governments cornering the market on
mining & minting.

Indeed. I'm just hoping it proves to be too little, too late.

And I agree with you that they will probably try to coopt Bitcoin or at
least blockchain technologies. If not to build their "cashless society"
then at least to try to crowd out potential uses for anonymous transactions
by ensuring that all the "legitimate" players are playing on a controlled &
tracked blockchain.
