There may be advantage to the security of your own traffic if you
also handle the traffic of others.

Economically, it's probably not right to expect 'free' transport in
such a system. Though perhaps at minimum you should be
expected to provide benefit to the network an equivalent of what you
consume, including the extended cost to the net of your consumption.
ie: in a multi-hop network your impact is not just over your own interface.

And in an anonymous network it's most assuredly not right to
force users to pay using non-anonymous payment methods.
Though they may optionally do so if they wish.

How close is the research on these issues to being codeable
into actual p2p transports (whether anonymous (preferred) or not)?
