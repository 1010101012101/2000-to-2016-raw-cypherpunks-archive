>perhaps the proceedings were better; Schneier was there after all,..

Schneier is a leader of the monetizing pack, never
crosses the line, sits among the stellars of institutional
control, incessantly promotes his wares, spoon-feds
fans. Predictably for self-promoters, like other stellars,
he is security chief for a principal telecom spy. Impolitely,
a security flack, which may be redundant.

Self-reportedly he is helping skim, cherry-pick, sanitize,
ass-cover abetters of NSA, shoveling insider tips to outlets.
Warns must not go too far in response, merely securitize!
the net. Which is the scam comseckers have been running
in cahoots with the officials since the birth of government
networks.

>... is there anyone you approve of John?

Snowden and Manning, the brands and fans, let others off the
hook, when more like them are needed to avoid sacralization of
the crucified.

Just hope there are a lot more doing truly good behind and
below the media and crazed followers tampering down of
dissent with adoration, gratitude, attitude and hyperbolization.

Leaks should be done without fanfare, which contradicts the
very term.
