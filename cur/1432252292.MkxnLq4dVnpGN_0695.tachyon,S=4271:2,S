Yes, i agree, we can find a common point.
We just all need to move in the same direction, with conflicts and
constructive criticism, but in the same direction.

Let's try to sketch down on a etterpad or trac ticket an idea on how to
implement something like this in order to:
- evaluating and pushing hardening of system/network security of Tor nodes
- avoid/mitigate alerts and risks for Tor Operators

That way we can try to match the needs perceived by all different
parties, balancing the risk/return of the initiative.

I'm gonna dump in this email a set of useful links collected during
browsing to do that.

We are probably not interested in Nessus & Metasploit AutoPwn, but it's
important to know that anyone can just aggregate everything into a chain
of automatic portscanning + vulnerability scanning + vulnerability
exploiting.
