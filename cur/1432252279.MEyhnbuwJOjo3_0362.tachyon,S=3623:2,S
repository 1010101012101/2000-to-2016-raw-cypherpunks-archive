But 'porn' is no more speech than 'murder' is. What makes porn so
offensive isn't the pictures, but the ACTS that had to be commited to
create the speech. No where in the 1st does it say that you can say and do
anything you want as long as it contains 'speech'. While the 'speech' part
is really irrelevant (and a wrong-headed way to resolve the issues
relating to the acts) there is still the component of the acts against
minors that needs to be dealt with. Those acts are in no way 'speech'.
