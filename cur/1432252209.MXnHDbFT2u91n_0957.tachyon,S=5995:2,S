I think you are confusing a weak potential for a technical ambiguity
of identity under attack conditions with anonymity.  (The technical
ambiguity would likely disappear in most practical settings).

Anonymity implies positives steps to avoid linking with PII.  With
anonymity you want not just technical ambiguity, but genuinely
pluasible deniability from an anonymity set -- preferably a large set
of users who could equally plausibly have established a given
connection, participated in an authentication protocol etc.

We don't after all call TCP anonymous, and your system is cleary
_less_ "anonymous" than TCP as there are security mechanisms involved
with various keys and authentication protocols which will only reduce
ambiguity.

Practically, knowing the IP address conveys a lot.  Many ISPs have
logs, some associated with DSL subscriber and phone records, for
billing, bandwidth caps, abuse complaints, spam cleanup etc etc.

The IP may be used for many different logged activities and some of
those activites may involve directly identified authentication.
People go to lengths to hide their IP precisely because it does
typically convey all too much.

If one wants this to be true in practice it has to propogate up the
stack.  (Not the problem of ANONSEC, a problem for the higher level
app).

But even at the authentication protocol level one has to be quite
careful.  There are many gotchas if you really do want it to be
unlinkable.  (eg. pseudo random sequences occur in many settings at
different protocol levels which are in fact quite linkable).  I'll
give you one high level example.  At ZKS we had software to remail
MIME mail to provide a pseudonymous email.  But one gotcha is that
mail clients include MIME boundary lines which are pseudo-random
(purely to avoid string collision).  If these random lines are
generated with a non-cryptographic RNG it is quite likely that so
called unlinkable mail would in fact be linkable because of this
higher level protocol.  (We cared about unlinkability even tho' I said
pseudonymous because the user had multiple pseudonyms which were
supposed to be unlinkable across).

I would say if your interest in fixing such pseudo random sequeneces
is not present you should not be calling this anonymous.

But if it is part of your threat model, then you may in fact be using
anonymous authentication and that would be interesting to me at least
to participate.
