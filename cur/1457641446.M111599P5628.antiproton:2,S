The Register quotes Microsoft:

"As many of you may have just noticed, our system just generated a
bunch of emails informing many of you that you are subject to
removal because Microsoft does not have evidence of a qualifying
audit on file. This is likely an error on our side, but we need
your help.

"Our CRM system suffered a data loss, and it looks like it rolled
back to an old backup. As a result, we lost audit data for about
147 roots. If you received a message, please don't panic. Instead,
please just send Microsoft your most-recent audit data, and we
will update our records. Sorry for the confusion.

The Register says:

"As part of Microsoft’s Trusted Root program’s compliance
requirements, Certificate Authorities must provide a courtesy copy
of their audit data to the company annually. We’re reliably
informed that Microsoft stores these internally in a standalone
tool. An error occurred with the tool, so Microsoft contacted some
CAs and requested they resubmit a copy of their latest audit data,
sources confirm.

"Microsoft is a player in backup and the cloud, through Microsoft
Azure. Asking third parties for data on themselves in the wake of
a back-up bungle is not the biggest disaster in the world, but it
doesn’t look good either.
