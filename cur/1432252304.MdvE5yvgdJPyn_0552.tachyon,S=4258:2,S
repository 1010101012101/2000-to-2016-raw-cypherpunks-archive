What a fuck-up.

Alexa, for Managed by Association Management Solutions,
is eager to slip this pernicious "management" spy tool into
the event under guise of making things easier for participants.

What RFID does is spy on participants, a sneaky practice promoted
by the RFID industry working through senior executives who love
to monitor underlings.

Surely the IETF membership is not clueless about the well-founded
villainy of RFID. Has there been negative feedback to Alexa's
management subterfuge?

Subject: Important Information about IETF 76 Meeting Registration

Registration for IETF 76 will open in the next several days and we
want to alert you to some exciting changes coming your way.

1) New Meeting Registration System
We have moved to a new meeting registration system. The first time you
use the new system (called ARO) you will need to create an account.
Your account will be password protected and only you will have access
to it. Your contact information will be saved, making registration in
the future much simpler, and you will be able to update your contact
data, registration information, etc at any time.

2) RFID Tagging Experiment at IETF 76
The hosts for IETF 76 are organizing a RFID tag experiment for the
meeting. The tag will be affixed to the underside of your meeting
badge, as a sticker, and will contain only your full name and any
listed affiliation. The experiment will allow us to explore the
possibility of electronic blue sheets (though we are still using paper
blue sheets as the official blue sheets of record). We also hope that
the RFID tag will improve the experience for remote participants,
since speakers will be identified through the RFID tags.

While you will be given the option to "opt out" of this experiment
when you register for the meeting, we sincerely hope you will
participate.

3)  One-day Guest Pass Experiment
For IETF 76 we are also offering a one-day guest pass for $200. If you
only plan to attend one day of meetings, you now have the option to
select which day (Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs or Fri) when you register.
After the meeting, we will solicit your feedback on the one-day pass
option and evaluate to see if it makes sense to offer at future
meetings.

Please contact me if you have any comments or questions. And I look
forward to seeing you at IETF 76 in Japan!

Regards,
Alexa
