I consider DRM systems (even the not-secure, not-mandated versions)
evil due to the high likelyhood they will be used as technical
building blocks upon which to deploy mandated, draconian DRM systems.
DRM systems inevitably slide toward being more mandated, and more draconian.

DRM-capable TCPA-type systems are evil by the same argument, even if
not used for DRM.

The primary reason they are evil is not the stated goal of DRM systems
(copy protection in various forms), but the ease with which they could
be used to eliminate cypherpunk applications.

If DRM systems were truly general purpose themselves, capable of being
used for good and bad purposes, I would agree they are not inherently
evil.  However, because they never do anything but remove power over
bits from people who would otherwise have complete control over them,
I can't think of any good they could possibly accomplish.

Taken in the context where if a technical solution exists, lawmakers
will mandate it even if it isn't necessary, sometimes technologies
which are not innately evil are so dangerous as to be necessarily
rejected to avoid a legislative consequence.  If, for instance, a
perfect control chip were possible so that firearms could never be
used to kill an employee of the US Government, even if this technology
were optional, I would consider it evil, as it both prevents a
possibly-acceptable use of the technology, and removes power from
whoever controls the technology at the time.

I wouldn't consider an electronic payment system which prevents
counterfeiting of currency to be "evil" in the same way as a DRM
system is, because the electronic payment system technology is not
trivially transformed into a gatekeeper on the use of secure private 
computation.

Copyright is legal enforcement of restrictions on the possessor of
bits.  As such, I consider it morally bad.  Additionally, it has
outlived its practical utility (which I agree it had at one point).

I support technologies which enable end-users to defeat restrictions
placed on them by content creators, governments, or others.

Defeating legislative solutions to problems also serves the useful
social purpose of reducing confidence in people's minds that the
government can control anything at all.

Defeating purely technical restrictions on how you can use something
is hacking at its most pure form.  This is not really on the axis of
good vs. evil; it is simply an example of man's desire to control the
world around him.  Admittedly, defeating fundamental physical
limitations on what something can do is a lot more rewarding than
defeating restrictions artificially imposed by another person, but
it's still a worthwhile challenge.

I think those who create should be free to use technical, social, or
other non-coercive means to accomplish their goals.  However, creating
technologies which can be easily legislatively mandated, or relying on
legislative solutions to business problems, is wrong.

While I'd certainly prefer a world where creation of worthwhile
content is rewarded and encouraged, I would far prefer if every artist
starved rather than a world where general purpose computing is
restricted at all.  The "military" applications of computing are far
more important than art or culture.
