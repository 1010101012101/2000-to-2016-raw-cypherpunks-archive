Maybe you have some validation packets looping around and
coming back to you on other [virtual] path. Maybe peer does not
know traffic from you is from you as an endpoint. Maybe you're
doing nothing and he wastes time.

If all nodes are multiply connected and independantly reclocking
and jittering their output packet streams and your data passes
through at least one good node besides yourself, it erases all
the bad signals perturbed up to reaching it.
Encryption also thwarts picking out some given user.

Yet, again, what is trying to be defeated?
- strict GPA  (I only ever said this type)
- traffic manipulation at internet layer
- evil nodes doing whatever

Fill is more obvious applicable to strict GPA.
It gets harder for latter two, for which fill traffic
may not be as simple benefit, and maybe start playing
with packet switching / mixing / spreading / reassembly.

What is adversaries non sunk cost and reach and
odds of seeing given user traffic for each type?

That's potentially a social knowledge / friendly situation.

- [peer] nodes wherever in the overlay network.

Paper titles were quoted in this thread, some had such appendix
references. And in tor-talk / tor-dev whenever fill traffic comes up.
