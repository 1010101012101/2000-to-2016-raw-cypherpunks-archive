Err, how? The bill gives powers to require some backdoors [1], but it
doesn't ban encryption in any form.

Or do you think some types of mandatory backdoors and banning encryption
are the same thing?


[1] The HS doesn't control the backdoors, the "relevant operators" do.

The HS can require "relevant operators" to maintain the capability to
decrypt encryptions which they apply - but it doesn't say anything about
banning encryption which other people apply, or banning encrypted
communications where other people have done the encryption

As for doing the impossible and maintaining the capability to decrypt
encryptions other people have applied, if you can't do it, you can't do
it. There is no need or duty to do the impossible.

You are not *providing* a service. You may well be using one, but you
are not providing one. Therefore you are not a "relevant operator", and
that part of the Bill does not apply to you.

You have to read these things carefully.




You might argue otherwise, that maybe you are providing a service to
yourself. Stranger things have happened, but I very much doubt any  UK
Court would agree with you.

And even if by some dark and unlikely miracle a Court decided you are
providing a service, and are therefore a "relevant operator", what might
happen? The Home Secretary serves a Notice (which she signs with her own
withered hand) on little old you, personally, requiring you to maintain
the capability to decrypt your own comms.

At some later point, after you have returned the Notice for
reconsideration and she has consulted the relevant committees, Judge
etc, and then sent it back to you, she might require you to decrypt some
comms.

If you failed to do so because you have not maintained the capacity, she
could then institute civil proceedings for an injunction to make you
maintain that capacity in future.

But she can't send you to jail, or fine you, for having failed to
maintain that capability.


However the last four paragraphs are just fantasy, because you are not
providing a service, and therefore you are not a "relevant operator".



If you don't get it, I think the Bill is ugly, evil, stupid, invasive,
disproportionate and generally sucks big time - but it has fuck all to
do with banning encryption.
