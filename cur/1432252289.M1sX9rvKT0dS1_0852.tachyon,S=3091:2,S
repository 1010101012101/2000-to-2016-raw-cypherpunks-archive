In the FBI stats that came out the majority of police officers killed are
killed with their own gun? They'd probably been better served by a
stun-vest...

Perhaps we should take guns away from them, then those fine officers would
probably have lived longer.

If you can't trust a weapon to a individual, how can you trust it to a
group of individuals?
