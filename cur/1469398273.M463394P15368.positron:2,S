My dear Lauren  (bcc),

Did I mention how much I love you today?  It's a strange coincidence, but I
love you even more when I can use your messages to annoy Putin fans in
public lists!  :D

Lots of tender kisses, hihi!  :*

Ceci  (yep, always a troll, but I am a very cute troll, less boring than
Putin fans, hihi!   *-*)
