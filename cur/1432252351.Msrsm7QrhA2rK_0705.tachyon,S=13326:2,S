Hi Steve,

Jeremy has already answered your questions well from a Serval
perspective, but I offer my perspective as well.

Absolutely agree here.  Indeed, Serval has worked from the outset to
make mesh telephony insanely simple to use, and I think we have made
significant advances on the state ease of use and management of mesh
networks in the process, with more innovation in the pipeline.

We agree heartily.  Pure mesh networking fails in the way that a lot
of other pure pursuits fail.
But some judicious symmetry breaking can yield large dividends, and
this is the approach we are already
pursuing, e.g., by using the internet for backhaul when it is available.

We have some early work on very fast converging mesh networks in
certain circumstances that we expect to map across at the right time.
Basically, I have confidence that this can be substantially worked
around.
Also, the use of UHF/TVWS spectrum, low bit-rates and simple waveforms
offers great potential to work around much of the problem in other
creative ways, for example by switching voice calls to a
very-long-range but very-low-bit-rate circuit, that would be capable
of carrying a call over a single hop that would otherwise require
perhaps half a dozen hops at higher bit-rate.  Frequency hopping to
make interference statistical is also a great help here.
I am still writing up our initial plans in this space, and will make
them public once we have a decent draft.

As Jeremy has said, we have, and BATMAN has performed quite poorly.
Part of this is really easy to fix, in that the link score calculation
is slow to reflect lost links, and not fast enough to grab new good
links.  But we expect other interesting effects to emerge as we work
on this.

I think I am inclined to agree with Jeremy that we see a common
technology that is able to address all three fairly well.  For
example, (3) needs fool-proof deployment and management-free
operation, but so does (1) and (2), but for different reasons. So we
see the solution as requiring:

- zero-configuration
- tolerance of partitioning of the network
- ability to scale, and maintain local operation when scaling beyond
the bandwidth-limit event horizon.
- security
- use of existing phone numbers

What differs for each use case is in some ways limited to how people
use this platform, but fundamentally they all depend on the common
ability of a phone to make/receive calls,sms,mms other data without
recourse to infrastructure, and offering individuals the degree of
privacy and security, and to some extent, the reliability, that people
expect from a telephone network.  Our Rhizome store-and-forward
approach is a key element in all this, because it allows for almost
insect-like persistence of retrying delivery, so that the instant a
passage through the network becomes available it can be exploited.
Also, Rhizome solves the nasty exponential bandwidth and arrival
probability problem that otherwise hamstrings multi-hop wireless
meshes.

In fact, I would say that the fundamental reason why we think we (and
this includes Village Telco) are able to make mesh networking work, is
because we have focussed on a telephony-oriented model, where data
volumes are lower, and where the user interface is simplified to
telephone-level, which people understand, and which equally
importantly, hides all of the mess underneath.

It is also why we are not afraid of our planned overlay mesh network
not being backward compatible for use by non-Serval-aware
applications, as it will keep them from making inefficient and
inconsiderate use of bandwidth, while allowing the use of the various
innovations we have prototyped and have on the drawing board. On this
note, we hope to be able to share a technology roadmap for the next 12
months in coming days.

Paul.
