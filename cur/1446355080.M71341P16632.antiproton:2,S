Doesn't sound like you're saying anything useful.

consider that competition can never reach a solution at which full
cooperation will arrive.
I disagree.

I disagree with your vague conclusion.

this is the great divide:
do we carry on with cruelty?
Who is "we"?

By whose definition?

Sounds like a contradiction in terms. =C2=A0"A collective best end" implies=
 that theinterest of individuals is ignored. =C2=A0People don't work that w=
ay; never have.AP will cause "without centralized authority", but nobody ne=

I disagree that "competition" causes any undesireable "destruction". =C2=A0

I disagree. =C2=A0Simple example: =C2=A0Communist 'logic' would tell us tha=
t we would only=C2=A0need 3-5 kinds of cell phones or cordless phones. =C2=
=A0It certainly sounds likehaving the world manufacture 50-100 kinds is was=

 products, and selection of products, even in the=C2=A0face of this seeming=
 "waste". =C2=A0Evidently, your assumptions are quite false.

Wacky 'logic'.

You haven't found it yet. =C2=A0Keep trying. =C2=A0You are just spewing vag=

You can "proclaim" anything you like. =C2=A0That won't make it true, howeve=
r.

Have you ever heard the saying, "The perfect is the enemy of the good"? =C2=
=A0One wayto sabotage the search for 'the good' is to claim that there is '=
the perfect' still out theresomewhere. =C2=A0You seem to be doing that.
