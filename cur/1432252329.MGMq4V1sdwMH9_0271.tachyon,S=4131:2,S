Cheney had heart device partially disabled to prevent a terrorist from
sending a fatal shock

Olivia Harris, Pool, File/Associated Press -  In an interview with CBS’ ”60
Minutes,” former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.

By Associated Press, Saturday, October 19, 1:34 AM

WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.

Cheney has a history of heart trouble, suffering the first of five heart
attacks at age 37. He underwent a heart transplant last year at age 71.

In an interview with CBS’ ”60 Minutes,” Cheney says doctors replaced an
implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007. The device can detect
irregular heartbeats and control them with electrical jolts.

Cheney says that he and his doctor, cardiologist Jonathan Reiner, turned off
the device’s wireless function in case a terrorist tried to send his heart a
fatal shock.

Years later, Cheney watched an episode of the Showtime series “Homeland” in
which such a scenario was part of the plot.

“I found it credible,” Cheney tells “60 Minutes” in a segment to be aired
Sunday. “I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting
my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.”

Cheney and Reiner are promoting a book they co-authored, “Heart: An American
Medical Odyssey.”

In the “60 Minutes” interview, Reiner says he worried that Cheney couldn’t
stand the pressure that came on Sept. 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked
the U.S. Medical tests seen that morning showed Cheney had elevated levels of
potassium in his blood, a condition called hyperkalemia, which could lead to
abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest.

Reiner says he watched news coverage of the day’s events on television and
thought, “Oh, great, the vice president is going to die tonight from
hyperkalemia.”
