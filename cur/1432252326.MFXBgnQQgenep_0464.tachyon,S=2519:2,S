Yes, but the cryptanalysis of symmetric ciphers involves
exponentially-expanding "back trees".
That is the whole point of "avalanche".  If, somehow, "for any NP
algorithm there
were an equivalent P algorithm", then the block-cipher backtracking
would
be solvable in poly time.  You could find the plaintext ASCII needle in
the haystack
of possibilities in poly time, no?

....

Rambling Aside: RSA encryption is equivalent to spinning a marker on a
modulus-sized wheel until it wraps,
and decryption is equivalent to spinning the marker more until it points
to the original message.
"Spinning" is actually exponentiating, ie, advancing the marker some
number of positions which depends on
its current value.  Beautiful stuff, only glimpses visible to this
knave.  Like IDEA, multiplication is avalanche.
