It's amazing what you see in financial circles. Though I've never claimed to
be an IT security jock, I easily know enough to know that practically no one
I've ever heard talk about the subject seemed to know -anything- about how IT,
security, or even risk management work.
I've asked things like, "What ports does s-ftp use?" And gotten completely
blank stares or fudges, such as, "depends".

I keep thinking that it would be interesting to send an (encrypted?) message
between bank HQs with a subject such as, "The horrendous losses we'll be
announcing next week" and see if the stock either drops or is shorted
big-time. I'd bet that a thorough investigation reveals NSA or other TLA front
organizations doing the shorting.
