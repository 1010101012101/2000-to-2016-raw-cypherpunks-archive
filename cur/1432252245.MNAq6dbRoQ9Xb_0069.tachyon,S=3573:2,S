Does this work now, Tim?  It seems that Mutt insists on changing the
content-type of messages when it signs them.  My choices were
multipart PGP/MIME (the one I used up until now, which seemed to
disagree with Eudora Pro) or application/pgp (which broke nmh, the
mailer most people here use).

In any case, I modified Mutt to give the option of sending PGP signed
messages as content-type text/plain, so this should work for you.  In
fact, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know if it does, and I'll
assume that no response means my attempt at fixing this problem was
unsuccessful.

By the way, if anyone wants my patches (against Mutt 1.2.5), e-mail me
privately and I'll send them to you.
