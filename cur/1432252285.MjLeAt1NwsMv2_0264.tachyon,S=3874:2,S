Thank you for helping me see the light. I have pondered adding Choate to
a killfile recently, but it is not worth the trouble, just move on to
next message when I see something from him...But it sure is fun
sometimes to point out how ignorant he is or acts or tries to come off
as being. Besides, I am bored alot. :) --Gabe
