Declan reported on 1999/08/12 that Starium planned to sell them "by
early 2000" for under US$100.
(http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,21236,00.html)

A Google search on "telephone encryption" yields:

http://www.tccsecure.com/csd4100.htm - no price
http://www.thespystore.com/telefax.htm  - $249
http://shop.store.yahoo.com/spytechagency/telscram.html - $260
http://www.tscm.com/stu.html - several models, over US$5000

And others in the over-US$1000 range.

Few details on the devices, though some of them mention an algorithm.
(Including one which claimed 128-bit triple-DES. I'm not sure what to
make of that.) There were several other statements on some pages which
may have indicated either security holes or cluelessness on the part of
the writer, but more likely indicate cluelessness on my part.
