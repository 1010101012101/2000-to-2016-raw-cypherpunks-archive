Senate Democrats Trying To Torpedo Pro-gun Judicial Appointee
  -- Calls needed to Senate to help break upcoming filibuster

  "As a law enforcement official, I know crimes are caused by
  criminals, not by the gun industry.  Indeed, by providing
  good-quality firearms at reasonable prices to law-abiding citizens
  and lawmen, the gun industry helps reduce crime." -- Bush nominee
  to the federal bench, Attorney General Bill Pryor (AL)


(Tuesday, June 24, 2003) -- As you read that quote above, you can
see why Democrat Senators Charles Schumer (NY) and Dianne Feinstein
(CA) don't want Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor confirmed to the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Simply put, Bill Pryor is way too pro-gun for them. 

You may remember U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft stated in 2001
that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and
bear arms.  Well, it was Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor who
mobilized attorneys general in 17 other states to sign a letter
commending Ashcroft for his position.

The Pryor letter cites different scholarly law review articles and
Supreme Court opinions that substantiate the true meaning behind the
Second Amendment.  The letter also quotes gun-hating constitutional
scholars (like Laurence Tribe) who have reluctantly concluded that
the Second Amendment does indeed protect an individual right to bear
arms.

Finally, the Pryor letter references the work of John Lott which
shows that putting guns in the hands of good people is good public
policy.  Why?  Because "more guns [means] less crime."

President George Bush nominated Gen. Pryor to be a judge in the
federal court system, but the Democratic leadership has stonewalled
his confirmation -- just as it has done with so many other
appointees.

The Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to vote on Pryor's
nomination this week.  But minority party delay tactics have pushed
back that vote until sometime in July.  (Democrats have submitted an
unprecedented number of questions for General Pryor to answer before
the Judiciary Committee acts on his nomination.)

Please contact your Senators and ask them to support the Pryor
nomination.  He is unabashedly pro-gun, and deserves the support of
gun owners nationwide.


ACTION:  Help get pro-gun Attorney General William Pryor confirmed
to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  You can contact your Senators
by visiting the Gun Owners Legislative Action Center at
http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm and sending them a pre-written
e-mail message.  Or, you can cut-and-paste the text below and fax it
to your two Senators (fax numbers can be found at the above URL).


------ Pre-written message ------


Dear Senator:

I am very disturbed that the U.S. Senate is dragging its feet in
confirming pro-gun Alabama Attorney General William Pryor to the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Make no mistake, General Pryor is more than qualified to assume a
position on the federal bench.  Not only does he have a "qualified"
rating from the American Bar Association, he has spent years
distinguishing himself as a top-class public servant.

He has served as the Editor in Chief of the Tulane Law Review.  He
has personally argued a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.  And he
has been elected to the position of Attorney General in the state
of Alabama.

Even partisan opponents have heaped high praise on him.  Dr. Joe
Reed, the chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference, says that
William Pryor is a "first-class public official" who "will be a
credit to the judiciary and will be a guardian for justice."

I support General Pryor's nomination because he is pro-Constitution
and pro-Second Amendment.  And I will consider ANY vote to delay or
filibuster his nomination as an anti-gun vote.

I hope you will oppose any stall tactics and vote to CONFIRM William
Pryor to the federal bench.  Gun Owners of America will report to me
how you vote.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
