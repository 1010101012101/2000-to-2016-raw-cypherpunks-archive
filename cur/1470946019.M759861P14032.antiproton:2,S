	True. The ruling faction of the tor mafia, a US military
	contractor, settled some score with one of their 'ex'
	employees/accomplices. 

	And they did that by means of a feminist anti-sex lynching,
	which of course suits the military/american 'culture' of the tor
	corporation. 

	I didn't mean it was an 'ordinary' SWJ lynching only motivated
	by 'social' 'justice'. If that's what Mirimir thinks then I
	don't agree with him.
