I forwarded this to Roger Dingledine who heads up the FreeHaven project.
His answer is below.

Subject: free haven status

At this point, Free Haven has 3 major flaws, and I'm putting it on the
back burner while I address them:

* The reputation system is tricky and won't work. We need to replace the
gossip/credibility system with a mechanism for verifiable transactions.
See http://freehaven.net/doc/cfp02/cfp02.html for more details.

* Retrieval is currently broadcast, which is insane. I'm letting other
projects work on solutions here (eg Chord), and I'll pick my favorite
when the time comes.

* There is no anonymous communications infrastructure. This is the area
we're focusing on currently. See http://mixminion.net/minion-design.pdf
and http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/tarzan/
