"Railroading" is the John take on it.
He is right.

"Fishing Expedition" is the Declan take on it.
He is right.

"Prosecution Friendly Journalist" is the Seth take on it.
He is right.

John has put the court documents up. The real truth.
This is as much of a railroading as Gotti got. In fact,
maybe even worse.

Jim Bell hasn't many friends here. Then again neither do I.
But I have learned a thing or two about cryptography. How
and why I sign this message is my testament to that. 

Few folks around here even sign messages anymore. So can
you know for sure? Probably? Yes. Likely? Yes. For sure? No!

I have a heck of a background to witness all this action.

I was North Dakota's first convicted stalker.
18 days was all I got.
I have been arrested near the Kennedy Compound with a loaded weapon.
That was 'assasination politics' firsthand.
No jail time.
I have testified for the Feds.
I still to this day talk to the DA, who's now a U.S. Magistrate
I was in the witness protection program.
Had a nym before most of you touched a computer.
I've also escaped federal custody more than once.
Never been charged or convicted.

I know both sides of this fence.
I don't like Bell. I don't like idle talk of
'assasination politics'. It wastes too much time.
He was 100's not a few miles away from where something
was 'supposed' to take place, at a future time. He can't
even get at his defense records. He gets my sympathy vote.

Now along comes poor little Declan, who finally got his
motives challenged by Seth. Simply put, if Declan was not
"prosecutor friendly" he would not have taken their money.
The Wired editors would have put it up for him. Put the 
shoe on the other foot, would he have taken the same course
of action had the defense called him in as a witness? Is there
a reason you are arriving at the 'party so late?'

Has he even tried to find out what questions the defense is gonna
ask? I don't recall having heard an electron particle about that.

That is not responsible journalism and at its even more base
level it is not even responsible citizenship. Haven't heard
much about citizenship with this case. 

I never have been accused of being a snitch.
My direct testimony usually results in people being freed.
The Feds still love me as a witness.
I could have, but don't want access to any president.
I don't need to see anyone killed. I know how to use 
paint, a paintbrush and canvas pretty well. It works better.

Oh, did I forget to mention, I write for the sixth biggest
website there is. I have this little tiny corner called
eastvillage.about.com. I'm just one of 900 or so sites
there. We have all the crazies in NYC there. They make
this list rather tame at times.

Journalist McCullagh
vs
Citizen McCullagh

I don't think anyone has hit the nail on the head
just what the Bell case is all about yet. The outward
charges have some sort of underlying psychology to them.

And Declan, if you can get off your high horse for a
minute, you might just have a seat in the witness box
and "sing" to your hearts content. You might do everything
but name a source. Heck, you might even spend a day in the
cooler or something. But then again you might not, and as
I see this coming down, I suspect your confidants might not
be so forthcoming in the future.

Blaming your plane trouble on Gordon is pure irresponsibility.
Taking the Feds money is worse. 

And Seth even reminded us you have a strike or two against
you already. 

Think.
Think think.
Think think oh think.
Think Declan think.

Before the rest of the list gets into character assasination.
