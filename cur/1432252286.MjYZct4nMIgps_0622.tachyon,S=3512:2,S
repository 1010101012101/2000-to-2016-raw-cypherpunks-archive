ID cards are another feel-good measure, nothing more.  As you correctly
point out, they won't add any real security against terrorism unless
taken to very impractical lengths.  But the people think they will help,
just like the poorly-trained national guard troops in airports.


Worse, the people have been sold the ideas that increased
security means giving up freedoms and therefore anything
that reduces freedom must be increasing security.
