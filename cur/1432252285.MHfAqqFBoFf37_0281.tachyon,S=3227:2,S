   from the are-you-ready-for-your-closeup? dept.
   [1]Roland Piquepaille writes "In the UK, where the recent Queen's
   speech about national identity cards generated lots of -- mostly
   negative -- coverage, another potentially invasive technology is being
   tested with very few criticism. For example, several police
   departments are now testing a 3D biometric facial recognition software
   from [2]Aurora, a company based near Northampton. The use of facial
   recognition 'is rapidly becoming the third forensic science alongside
   fingerprints and DNA,' according to a police officer who talked to BBC
   News for '[3]How your face could open doors.'" (More below.)

   "The company claims its software is so sophisticated it can make the
   distinction between identical twins. And if the civil liberties groups
   continue to be neutral, this technology could also be deployed in
   airports or by private companies. Even banks are thinking to put
   cameras in their ATM machines to identify you. The good thing is that
   you will not have to remember your PIN. On the other hand, as with
   every new technology, is it safe for your privacy and is it possible
   to hack the system? [5]Read more before making your decision."
