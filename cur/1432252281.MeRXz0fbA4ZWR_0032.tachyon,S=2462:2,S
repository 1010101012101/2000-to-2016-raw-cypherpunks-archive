Ex-General Stanley McChrystal:

And although to the United States, a drone strike seems to have very 
little risk and very little pain, at the receiving end, it feels like 
war. Americans have got to understand that. If we were to use our 
technological capabilities carelessly -- I don't think we do, but 
there's always the danger that you will -- then we should not be 
upset when someone responds with their equivalent, which is a suicide 
bomb in Central Park, because that's what they can respond with.
