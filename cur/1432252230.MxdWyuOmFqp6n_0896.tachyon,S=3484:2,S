I think that would depend on the banker.  "Bob spent this hundred 
dollars three times," muses Alice.  "Check and see if he's got 
overdraft protection for the extra two hundred...  if he doesn't, 
then put it on his credit card with a fifteen dollar loan orignation 
fee and charge him two percent a month...."  Jail time, in most 
cases, probably just isn't profitable for the bankers.  After all, 
how are you going to soak the guy for fees and interest if he's 
behind bars?
