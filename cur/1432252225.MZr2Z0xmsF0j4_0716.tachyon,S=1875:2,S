But the despots are still months away.  The joke used to be 
that it took a Russian six months to organize a date with a 
girl because he had to clear it with the Kremlin.

When Vietnam attacked Cambodia in 1978, it took the left a year 
to suddenly come up with a venemous denunciation of Khmer Rouge 
Cambodia - they could not react until the Soviet Union reacted, 
and it took the Soviet Union near a year to react.
