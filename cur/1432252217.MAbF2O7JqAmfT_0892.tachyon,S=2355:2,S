EMP?  Could be tuned, even, since the RFID is resonant at a known
frequency.  There's a standard for excitation field strength, so all one
should need to do would be hit the chip with 50-100x the expected
input.  Unless the system is shunted with a zener or some such, you
should be able to fry it pretty easily.

Now put that chip-cooker in a trash can right by the main entrance to an
airport and perform some public service.
