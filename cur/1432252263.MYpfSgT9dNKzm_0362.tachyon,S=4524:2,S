	Simple fix is to add a "Decrypt using this key" header (or 
prepend to the body, which is "wrong" in that a MTA shouldn't screw 
much with the body).

	It should stop spammers since their targets usually won't be 
expecting encrypted messages etc. and would be much less likely to 
bother decrypting them. It could still be used as a terminal to a 
mailing list or newsgroup, just with a bit of extra hassle.

	Additionally, remailers could advertise selective use of 
this--i.e. they have certain addresses (mail to news gateways, 
mailing lists that don't mind anonymous traffic etc.) that they don't 
encrypt to.
