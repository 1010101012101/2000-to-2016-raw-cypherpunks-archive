Two stories here.  First, a judge rules you can't ban 'violent'
videogames, and orders city to pay $$ to video arcades.  Second,
a Brit is charged for running a site offering training to members
of his religion.

We await the Al Qaeda Video Sim/Training Series...

Man Accused of Running 
    Terrorist-Training Internet Site Pleads Innocent
                       The Associated Press
                      Published: Jan 4, 2002

      LONDON (AP) - A man accused of offering terrorist training over the 
 Internet in the "Islamic art of war" pleaded innocent Friday to weapons charges.

 During a hearing at London's Bow Street Magistrates' Court, Sulayman Balal 
 Zainulabidin denied charges of inviting others to train in firearms or explosives and 
 of possessing a rifle without a certificate.

 Prosecutors said Zainulabidin, a 43-year-old kitchen worker from south London, 
 was the founder and chief instructor of a group offering young Muslims training in 
 martial arts, weapons and "the Islamic art of war."

Video game judgment to cost city

Indianapolis is ordered to pay $318,000 in legal fees industry spent fighting  local law on violent games.

                WASHINGTON -- Indianapolis' failed attempt to be the first U.S. city to
                keep minors from playing violent video games in public arcades is costing
                taxpayers more than anticipated.

                In a consent judgment approved this week by U.S. District Judge David F.
                Hamilton, Indianapolis has agreed to pay the video game industry $318,000
                for lawyers' fees and other costs.

                            

                The heads of the industry groups that successfully challenged the law's
                constitutionality said they have been "totally vindicated" and hope the penalty
                will discourage other governments from trying to enact similar bans.

                "To recover more than $300,000 in legal fees from the city is the icing on the
                case, especially since the city threatened that we would not only lose, but also
                pay its legal fees," said Jack Kelleher, executive director of the Amusement
                and Music Operators Association.
