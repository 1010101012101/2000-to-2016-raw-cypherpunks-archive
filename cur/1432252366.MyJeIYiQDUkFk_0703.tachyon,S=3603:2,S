Oh, it goes far beyond that - it creates a system where, upon a governor's 
declaration of a public health emergency, the public health authorities get 
control of all food, guns, medicine, fuel, clothing, medical facilities, 
doctors, and human beings within the affected area - they're entitled to 
immediate possession of   whatever useful private property they want, which 
can be redistributed, held, or destroyed as they see fit - and they're 
empowered to use public safety agencies to force doctors perform 
examinations, tests or vaccinate/immunize similarly uncooperative 
individuals, and to create quarantine or exclusion areas as they consider 
useful.

It's pretty much a police state implementation act.

5000 dead in NYC? National tragedy.
1000 detained incommunicado without trial, expanded surveillance? National 
disgrace.
