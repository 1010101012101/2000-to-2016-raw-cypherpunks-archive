If a non-expert may interject.. while I can't judge how realistic it 
would be to repeal laws or to do some of the other things 
mentioned in this thread, it seems to me that "making parole cost 
less" would be defeated by the simple economics of spending x to 
house someone, and not spending x not to. Like I say, I'm not 
intimate with the details of costs of prisons or of monitoring 
parolees - is there more to it than that? It seems like it would be 
too artificial to simply add costs where there aren't any.
