Just make it bigger by adding redundancy and padding, before you
encrypt it and store it on your disk. That way the attacker who wants
to steal your keyring sees a 4 GB encrypted file which actually holds
about a kilobyte of meaningful data. Current trojans can steal files
and log passwords, but they're not smart enough to decrypt and
decompress before uploading. They'll take hours to snatch the keyfile
through the net, and maybe they'll get caught in the act.
