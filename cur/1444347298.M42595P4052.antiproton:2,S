	Exactly. And the western side is composed of very big and
	corrupt business that sometimes quarrel with their eastern
	(states) partners in crime.

	and they 'help' the car mafia even to this day

	Exactly.

	Well, OPEC doesn't even pretend to be a 'private' cartel. OPEC's
	members are all states/governments.

	Criminal organizations - the government - can always use
	violence and extortion to rule. That doesn't change the fact
	that a free society is a voluntary organization, by definition.
	That a government is a criminal organization, by defintion. And
	that historically the government is the prime accomplice of the
	'entrepreneurs' they pretend to 'regulate' for the 'common
	good' 

	From the horse's mouth

	I wrote to him a couple of weeks ago. Stallman has come to
	argentina to promote his software projects more than a few
	times. 

	He's even come to rosario (where i live), and he's been rather
	friendly towards the worthless sacks of shit known as the
	'socialist party' that has been ruling the city for more than
	15 years, and among other things raised taxes ~ 2000%.
	
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI_GiVEVZ4c

	^^^^^^ stallman with his socialist friends of the city's
	government. 


	(there was another video that I cant find now in which he was
	literally embracing the fucking mayor of rosario)

	
	Now the reason why that is relevant and why I wrote to stallman
	is that his socialist friends have been installing SPY CAMERAS
	all over the fucking city. Oh, the socialist party also
	controls the state government and the police. 


	Yep. It's not  'evil corp' doing the surveillance. It's the
	state that stallman loves so much, and a state controlled by
	fucking commies like him, to boot.

	Do you think stallman showed a shred on intellectual honesty
	and acknowledged that he supports these shitbags because they
	allegedly use his 'free' software, while turning a blind eye to
	the fact that they are totalitarians who favor a police state?
	Of course he didn't. 

	
	I also remarked to him :  

	"One of your arguments for free software is that users
	have the right to control their own computers. 'Freedom' means
	you and your hardware are not being controlled by other people.
	And yet you are no anarchist. I find that really puzzling. " 
	

	Here's stallamns, recursive, content-free, hypocritical reply 

	
	"See stallman.org/articles/why-we-need-a-state.html for why we
	need a state. Who should control your computers, and my computers, is a different
	question."
