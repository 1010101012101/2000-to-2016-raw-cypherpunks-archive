It's interesting to consider that Wired may have deliberately published as 
much as it could about AT&T in order to defuse the claim that a public trial 
would compromise national security--if the details are already publically 
available then that argument fails.

A very cypherpunkly action. I nominate Wired for the 1st annual Cypherpunks 
award. We should also have a "Needs Killing" AP award...
