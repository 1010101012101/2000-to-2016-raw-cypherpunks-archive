I'd absolutely agree with everything Bill said, but would add the
following:

Based on your question, what you're asking about is how to secure SMTP
traffic. This doesn't really even equate to needing a current crypto
reading list. Rather, what you need (in addition to hiring a
professional) is a good understanding of the fundamentals of
information security, of which cryptography is only one small
part. (Bill hinted at this but I wanted to make sure it was very
explicit.)

Still true today. However, for someone trying to gain an understanding
of information security (risk assessment, threat analysis,
countermeasures, etc.), his most recent book is probably more suitable
(and equally indispensable). Anyone who doesn't *thoroughly*
understand the principles outlined in _Secrets_and_Lies_ is *not* a
security professional.


P.S. Get off the toad node.
