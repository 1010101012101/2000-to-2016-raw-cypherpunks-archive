	"America Has Been At War 93% of the Time – 222 Out of 239 Years
	– Since 1776"

	It does tell, for starters, that the US is anything but a 'free
	society'.

	"not to mention that much of the rest of the world would be
killed or imprisoned leading my kind of  life in another jurisdiction" 

	I don't know what kind of life you lead but it is  obvious that
	under US 'juris' 'diction', not obeying the nazis in charge
	is likely to land you in jail and of course the police will
	execute you on the spot if you resist.

	I really can't tell if you're joking or not but my overall
	impression is that you aren't?

	Anyway I'm glad that Snowden denounced the corrupt government
	of Haiti and now lives as a hero in The United States of
	America. With Assange. Or something like that.

	Looks like a sensible and practical solution, so yes.

	That is exactly what it is.

	The fact that the government sometimes follows some
	'procedures' to commit their crimes, such as say mass
	incarcerate people, is pretty much irrelevant AND
	is exactly what makes the system a farce.

	Oh wait. Insert slogan here about 'rule of law'.

	What do you mean by redemption? The system works exacly as
	designed.
