Valid points, though I open for discussion the following logistic issues:

Though the various new policies of various political bodies may have
fluctuated recently, historicly there has been a loophole for which an
attacked entity can respond with due intent to cease the attack via
appropriate means.

In this case, I see random IIS servers "attacking" my server, as do others.

With this being the case, and their initiation of transaction, it should be
appropriate to cease their inappropriate activities.

This would dictate a mechanism capable of ceasing the origin of the attack,
in this case, defective code in the IIS servers.

My impression, is that direct isolation of an attacking facility for
disabling purposes only, with intent to maintain the stability of the
attacked host/subnet is well within historic legal bounds.

Inversely, has there been any alteration of this policy recently? What is
the current situation?

... 

On the other hand, I wouldnt be contrary to the development of a
breach-utilizing derivative of the TSADBot systems and their fed-protected
recon capabilities and transparent m$ security, combined with various inlet
portals in typical security faults, and capable of directed and automated
"Cleaning" of dysfunctional machines. Basicly, the ultimate breach system
with intent of eliminating future braches. (We've done this for high
security networks, server arrays, etc,) however a mass implementation with
intent to fix or replace defective product code would be highly effective.

What say the world to doing things right for once? "Baaah."

Oh well.

Again, response regarding policy issues would be appreciated.
