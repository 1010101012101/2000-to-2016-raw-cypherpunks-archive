Well good for you.  Do you post on Cypherpunks often?

I mentioned what charges he was being held on.  Before the charges, he was
simply being held at a federal gulag as a material witness, with nothing
being produced by the government that he could defend himself against.  
The charges are an upgrade to his situation.

And you know this how?  Shouldn't the validity of such charges be
determined by a trial, or has Shrub changed the Constitution to permit
them to simply be stated as fact on the Internet by persons such as
yourself?

You know, I really love this new form of character assassination, in which
a laundry list of people someone is allegedly "linked to" is recited, and
then their misdeeds are enumerated as if they were the deeds of the person
being smeared.

Perhaps someday we'll find who you're "linked to," Dr. Sanchez.

Officially, at least.  This is your second repetition of this Red Herring,
as I never stated that the charges involved the website.

I don't think your arguments are bolstered in the least by suggesting that
African-American males have a monopoly on criminal activity, are excused
their misdeeds because of their race, or are able to do nothing useful
without the support of affirmative action and other peoples tax dollars.

Or at the very least, visions of booting the Zionist Entity out of
Palestine.

According to the charges, all of the illegal discussions he is accused of
participating in years ago, relate to actions to be taken outside of the
United States in various conflicts involving the mistreatment of
indiginous Muslem populations.  I find it unlikely that an author of books
on entrepreneurship for poor inner-city kids, and an individual who has
worked hard to improve his community, secretly wishes to poison everyone
in it, regardless of his distaste for AmeriKKKan foreign policy.

> If you want to defend civil rights, pick a different poster boy.

This must be the Clinton-esque redefinition of "rights" as something
deserved not by all, but only by those who "work hard and play by the
rules."

I've always felt that if something is a "right," then it can't simply be
taken away if ones neighbors do not like ones politics.

Obedient little suckups rarely need their civil rights defended, and I am
more than happy to go on the record as defending the civil rights of Mr.  
Ujaama, no matter how strongly you feel he shouldn't have any.

That's very non-Black non-affirmative-action non-taxpayer-funded of you.

Oh, and we're the "Cypherpunks."  The "Cyberpunks" are a different outfit. 

Thank-you for visiting.  Please come again.
