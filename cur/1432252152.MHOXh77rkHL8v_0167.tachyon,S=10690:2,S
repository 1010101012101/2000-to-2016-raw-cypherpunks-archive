Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a |eading supplier of VoIP techno|ogy including the fo|lowing 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real problem that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any ce||u|ar or |andline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2OO,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 20O5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months |eaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a g|oba| scale. We expect our mi|estones to be
