The purpose is to prevent forgery of documents. Actually, even more
fundamentally, it is a way of saying "I was at this place at this time" - I
don't believe there is any system which can do better than that (any kind
of device-based fingerprinting would be a DRM scheme, and therefore flawed
from conception.)

I don't believe that these documents could be made to be self-verifying,
although this is the sort of attempt being made with J3M.
CitizenMediaNotary<https://github.com/Miserlou/CitizenMediaNotary>proposes
to make documents network-verifiable against retroactive forgery,
but this is actually a different problem ("have we seen this before" rather
than "where in spacetime was this created").

Let's suppose a use case. Seems like we're about to have a nice little war
in Syria, so let's use that. Suppose a citizen reporter creates an image of
a bombed-out orphanage for impoverished nuns. Al-Jazeera wants to run with
it, but can it be trusted? How do we know that this is actually an image
from 2013 Syria, and not a previously-unpublished image from 2011 Libya,
uploaded by a military agent?

A geokey system would use network properties to assure that regions of
spacetime have unique identifiers. These identifiers could then be tied to
media, with a network protocol or J3M or something similar. Ideally, the
handing out of these cryptographic identifiers would actually be done via
satellite and not IPv4, as spatial IPv4 allocation isn't always accurate,
especially with mobile phones. Also, the thought of there being
geostationary microsats for the sole purpose of providing cryptographic
spacetime assurances just gives me the sci-fi tinglies. Imagine little
crypto robot oracles wizzing through space, beeping out random zeros and
ones back down onto the planet!

I guess the best we can do with this system is just narrow the "forgery
surface" to people who are at a certain place at a certain time who have
also preconspired to construct forgeries based on the keys generated by the
oracle. This is not perfect, but it's better than nothing - assuming that
we keep this limitation in mind.
