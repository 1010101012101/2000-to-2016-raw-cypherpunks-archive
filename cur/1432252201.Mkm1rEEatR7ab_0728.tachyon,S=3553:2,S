Police arrest teen for obscene Web site

            By Associated Press, 01/13/01
http://www.boston.com/news/daily/13/obscene.htm

            SALEM, N.H. -- Salem police have arrested a teen
            they say created several obscene Web sites that
            mocked the Salem Police Department.

            Christopher Hemmah, 19, was arrested Thursday
            night after a month-long investigation. He is charged
            with misuse of computer system information, a
            felony.

            In Hemmah's home, police say they found seven
            computers and how-to books on computer hacking.

            One of the obscene Web sites took information from
            the Salem Police Benevolent Association site and
            parodied it by changing words and downloading
            pictures from the site, police said. A second site
            mentioned the department and had random
            pornographic pictures attached to it, they said.
