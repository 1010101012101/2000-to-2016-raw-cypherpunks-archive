Maybe, maybe not. I'm the first to agree that porn *should* be treated as
equal to other speech, but considering the strength of the opposite view
nowadays, I would not be surprised if the First was gutted in this regard.
And I think if you look at the history of the Bill of Rights (which
Americans naturally know far better than I ever will), one does have some
reason to believe the "speech" in 1A is mostly targeted at political speech,
even if the meaning is implied.

So how about the "prevailing community standard" part?

The question is, are there enough sensible people around to stop precisely
that from happening?

Agreed. But I do think self-labelling is a nice gesture, and may even afford
one a direct means of targeting a site specifically for the kind of people
most vocal about banning online speech.
