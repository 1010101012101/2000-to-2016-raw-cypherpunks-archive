FBI Believes Anthrax Strain Manmade

By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI (news - web sites) believes the strain of
anthrax that killed a tabloid newspaper editor in Florida was manmade,
and tests of the 19 hijackers' possessions have found no trace of the
deadly bacteria, law enforcement officials said Tuesday.

Investigators so far has found no evidence linking the Florida
incident to terrorism, although the manufactured nature of the
bacteria suggests criminal activity may be involved, the officials
said, speaking only on condition of anonymity.

U.S. officials, meanwhile, said there was evidence that Osama bin
Laden (news - web sites) sympathizers have been performing
surveillance of U.S. buildings overseas. That information and other
evidence have prompted continued warnings for Americans overseas to
use caution, the officials said.

President Bush (news - web sites) was preparing to visit the FBI on
Wednesday to announce the creation of a list of most wanted terrorist
worldwide. Officials said the initial list would include 19 names,
some whom are believed to be connected to Osama bin Laden's network.

Overseas, anti-terrorist detectives in Ireland arrested three Libyans
and an Algerian at their Dublin homes on suspicion of fund raising and
providing logistical support to groups linked to bin al-Qaida.

More than $13,000 in cash, documents and financial records were
seized, detectives said. They were also investigating the four men's
various bank accounts.

Police refused to identify the detainees, but authorities said they
included:

-A 39-year-old Libyan who has directed two Islamic charities in
Ireland that detectives suspect have been used to pass funds to
al-Qaida members.

-A 26-year-old Algerian who arrived in Ireland illegally two years ago
and was previously been suspected of involvement in abortive plans to
attack U.S. cities during millennium celebrations.

In Florida, there were growing signs that the appearance of anthrax at
a tabloid newspaper office may not have involved terrorism, but would
be treated as an isolated criminal act.

Tests so far had not found any other workers at the location who were
infected, or additional spores of the bacteria except those found on
the computer keyboard of the victim who died last week, officials
said.

Robert Stevens, 63, a photo editor at The Sun newspaper, died from an
anthrax he inhaled, and high-tech tests were being performed to help
determine the origin of the bacteria. He died on Friday, the first
such death in the United States since 1976.

Dr. Jean ', director of the Palm Beach County Health Department, said
officials could not say whether someone genetically manufactured the
bacteria or they occurred naturally because test weren't completed.

``We're open to the possibility of anything,'' she said

But law enforcement officials in Washington said the strain that
infected Stevens does not match any known naturally occurring version
of the bacterium and was believed to be manmade.

The FBI was still investigating how the anthrax was introduced and no
one has been charged.

A sweep of items belonging to suspected hijacker Mohammed Atta, who
flew planes near the sight of the anthrax case, and a screening of all
the hijackers possessions, cars and hotel rooms turned up no evidence
that they came into contact with anthrax or other biochemical agents,
the officials added.

A tiny amount of anthrax was found on a keyboard at the newspaper
offices, but tests on the building's air systems and areas frequented
by Stevens have turned up no further evidence of the bacteria, the
officials said.
