What's the big deal? A polished, greased metal thorn, spool of carbon
and/or kevlar tape, epoxy resin, electrically ignited pyrocharge (crushed
minibulb with intact filament), trigger switch with a cover slip, maybe
coded if you want to get real fancy, lithium cell, capacitor.

There's not enough metal in the thing to trigger the metal detector, it
can look as about anything (flashlight preferrable).
