OK, I can buy that.  But would it be wild speculation to predict that 
the online identity eventually gets tied to the Windows user login?  
This still doesn't prevent nymity (barring biometric logon and 
prevention of multiple accounts using the same biotoken, but I don't 
want to go too far afield), but it makes it less convenient.  By the 
time J. Random Luser realizes he wants (needs?) to nymify, the 
barriers to entry are in place. The third 'E'.
