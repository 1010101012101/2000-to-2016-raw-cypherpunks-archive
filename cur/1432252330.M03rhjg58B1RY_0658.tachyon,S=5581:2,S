Your quoting software (?) is still broken. You have the order wrong.

You asked for an example, I gave a good one. As for who is asking for 
this, this is hard to say. Is the security of a bank vault being "asked 
for" by "commercial interests" or by "customers"?

This was done _extensively_ by the PGP/NAI people and by others. They 
had staffs of people designing products, designing boxes for sale at 
computer stores, etc.

You keep showing your basic unawareness of the past.

Then contribute something more than saying that other people are not 
doing what they should be doing.

Companies have been trying to convince the home computer user that they 
should be encrypting for years. Doesn't wrok. And for not very 
surprising reasons. Same thing seen in the home security business, 
backups, etc.

(The average user doesn't make any backups. The average homeowner 
doesn't do any more to secure his house than what it came with. In other 
words, "the defaults." )

You keep chanting about "whippersnapper!" I have no idea how old you 
are...you could very well be one of those menopausal women who go back 
to grad school after being kicked out of the house...though usually they 
end up studying to become psychobabblers.

Your problem is not your age, it's your ignorance of core issues. I 
suspect you are willfully uneducable.
