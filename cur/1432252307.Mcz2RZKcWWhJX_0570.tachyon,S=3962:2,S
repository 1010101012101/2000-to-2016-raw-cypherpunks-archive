It's interesting to note a peculiar pattern that seems to be emerging: many 
of the biggest warmongers, in the post 9/11 era, are ex-nutballs of one 
sort or another who went "straight" – and veered off into a more lucrative 
variety of extremism. Murawiec is merely the latest case. Think of David 
Horowitz, the ex-leftist cheerleader for the Black Panthers who now goes 
around lecturing blacks on their alleged "racism" and demanding all-out war 
on the Arab world. Think of Stephen Schwartz, the Weekly Standard's 
"expert" on Wahabism, who gave up the fringe politics of 
left-anarcho-Trotksyism to become a major theoretician of the 
Riyadh-as-"kernel of evil" school.
How long were you a trot jamesd? 4 years?,5?
Not that theres anything wrong with that.
