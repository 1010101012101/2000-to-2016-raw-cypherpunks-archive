But how confident are you in the robustness and integrity of the system as it
exists today? If it were a matter of life or death (and you knew your
adversaries were more familiar with the intimate details of the system than you
are) would you trust it to come through for you? Can't say that I would.

I still think some sort of decentralized P2P short-lived mosquito remailer
system would circumvent the most serious Mixnet pitfalls: if anyone ever gets
one off the ground, it would be a great, great thing.

Nice thought, but it's probably a safe bet that a real pro could pick a hole in
anything I come up with straight off the bat-- especially if I had used a
compromised compiler. How much thought are people putting into that one? Sounds
to me like another fantastic place for the government to place "trusted
insiders".

Good point, but isn't there a fair amount of danger in a network of a bunch of
well-intentioned, otherwise intelligent people setting up nodes while relying
on "out of the box" instructions? It's a terrible way to configure your own
operating system, much less becoming part of a network people are potentially
trusting their lives to.

Who knows, maybe we already do: anything worth getting nervous about is
probably totally "unmarked" as being connected to an agency anyway.
