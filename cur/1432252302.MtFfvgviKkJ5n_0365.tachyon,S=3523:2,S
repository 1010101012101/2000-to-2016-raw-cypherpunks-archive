I disagree. If you assume that the entire internet will eventually take up
on the process, start with a rule that says "if it has a hashcash token
don't process the other rules." Obviously at first this rule would be hit
rarely, but a big PR campaign surrounding it would get to people, as would
implementing it in Outlook. Eventually your other rules would be rarely hit,
and you could change them to simply discard. Once it's everywhere you can
begin culling the bad ones. I just don't see where the necessary overhead
bult into the servers will take place, or be justified.
