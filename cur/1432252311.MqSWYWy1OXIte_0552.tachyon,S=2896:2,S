Maybe, but I was talking, and not too clearly, it seems, about modeling the
motion of things, and not ray-tracing, which I was not even thinking about,
frankly.

Morphing, it seems to me, was done just because they could, and as a
result, it is the most aggregious of this cartoon physics nonsense.

I think, eventually, the public may get tired of camera-trick physics as a
movie plot, which, I guess, is probably more likely to happen sooner than
prying our schools out of the hands of innumerate socialists any time soon.

Anyway, this topic has been beaten like a dead horse, and I'm done with
wandering around in the minutae.

Cheers,
RAH
