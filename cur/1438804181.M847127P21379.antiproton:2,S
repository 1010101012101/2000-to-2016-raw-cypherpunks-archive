a declaration or notarized statement attesting to the date on which
the notice of appeal was deposited in the institution's internal mail

after service of appellant's response. Failure to comply with this
order may result in the dismissal of this appeal for failure to
prosecute. Briefing is suspended pending further order of this court.

nie B. RAWLINSON, CONSUELO M.
CALLAHAN) A review of the record indicates that the notice of appeal
in this case ws timely filed. The 7/9/04 order to show cuse is
therefore discharged. To the extend appellant has moved to have the
panel recuse itself from consideration of this appeal, that request is
denied. To the extend appellant has moved for appt. of counsel in this
appeal. that request is denied because he is not entitled to appt of
counsel and this appeal does not present exceptional circumstances
warranting the appt of counsel. (see casefile for citations). No
motions for recon , clarification, modification of the denial of appt.
of counsel shall be filed or entertained. The court's records reflect
that this case may be appropriate for summary disposition because
appellant is no longer entitled to appt of counsel. Within 21 days,
appellant shall show cause why the DC's order allowing counsel to
withdraw shall not be summarily affirmed. If appellant does not comply
with this order, this appeal will be automatically dismissed for
failure to prosecute. Briefing remains suspended pending further order
of this court. [04-30115] (CP) [Entered: 08/11/2004 12:05 PM]
