PerpetualElection.com Launches News and Discussion Site
Press Release

NOVEMBER 10, 2000 -- PerpetualElection.com, the only website devoted 
exclusively to news about the first perpetual presidential election in U.S. 
history, launched on Friday.

The site, operated by activists and journalists, is designed to provide an 
information and discussion area for Americans who want to follow the recent 
events in the Sunshine State.

For example: Will Al Gore litigate? Did George W. Bush truly win? Why would 
over 3,000 people vote for Pat Buchanan anyway? Could the House of 
Representatives pick the next president? At PerpetualElection.com, we'll 
chart the story's development with the help of our readers.

Unlike many other sites, PerpetualElection.com has liberals, conservatives, 
greens, and libertarians as editors. All have equal ability to post news 
and start discussions, and there is no single editorial point of view.

Some of our editors, in alphabetical order:

  * Sonia Arrison of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco
  * Kathleen Ellis, a Baltimore system administrator and journalist
  * Declan McCullagh, Washington correspondent for Wired News
  * Jill Pelavin, a programmer living in Mountain View, California

PerpetualElection.com is an open source project: It runs on a Red Hat Linux 
server and uses mySQL as a database. The Slash engine, made popular by 
Slashdot.org, is used for discussions and articles.
