"We" have always held that a sufficiently policed state can defeat
crypto.
If the RIAA could put a vidcam in your computer room, things are easy.
If crypto is illegal, things are easy.  (We have remarked on how,
modulo stego, crypto traffic is trivial to detect with any entropy
measure.  Got PGP headers?)

China is a police state.  A state with freedom of expression ---which
does
not include much or all of Europe--- is less so.   China is also a
nukepower,
so it is likely to persist.
