What you say is possible. But none of us actually know how bad it is.
Except, of course, for those with privileged information about US
military capabilities ;)

Tor Project says:

| Anonymity Online
|
| Protect your privacy. Defend yourself
| against network surveillance and traffic
| analysis.

| Tor prevents people from
| learning your location or
| browsing habits.

You warn people not to use Tor, because it's useless against US
military. And as I recall, you also reject Tor on moral grounds, because
US military uses it for evil.

I consider both positions to be irresponsible. Conning people into using
Tor recklessly, with insecure setups, is at best irresponsible. If the
goal is cover traffic for US military, it's malicious.

But frightening people from using Tor, when there are no viable
alternatives, is also at best irresponsible. Even if Tor is more or less
useless against US military, it still protects users against other
adversaries. And arguably it even protects most users from US military,
if only because they're not important enough to focus on.

Putting it in caps doesn't make it right :)

I disagree about backdoors generally.

But specifically about vulnerability of Tor to global adversaries, you
may be right. But also you may be wrong.

Actually, they pretty much invented it ;)

I wonder if they have AIs yet. That would be amazing!

Not at all, Juan :)

I'm just wanting to clarify your position.
