   Rare lynx hairs found in forests exposed as hoax

   rare cat species in two national forests, officials told The
   Washington Times.
        Had the deception not been discovered, the government likely
   would have banned many forms of recreation and use of natural
   resources in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Wenatchee
   National Forest in Washington state.
        The previously unreported Forest Service investigation found that
   the science of the habitat study had been skewed by seven government
   officials: three Forest Service employees, two U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service officials and two employees of the Washington Department of
   Fish and Wildlife.
        The officials planted three separate samples of Canadian lynx
   hair on rubbing posts used to identify existence of the creatures in
   the two national forests.
        DNA testing of two of the samples matched that of a lynx living
   inside an animal preserve. The third DNA sample matched that of an
   escaped pet lynx being held in a federal office until its owner
   retrieved it, federal officials said.
