Secrecy is the cornerstone of all tyranny.  Not force, but secrecy... 
censorship.  When any government, or any church, for that matter, 
undertakes to say to its subjects, "This you may not read, this you must 
not see, this you are forbidden to know," the end result is tyranny and 
oppression, no matter how holy the motives.  Mightily little force is 
needed to control a man who has been hoodwinked; Contrariwise, no amount of 
force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free.  No, not the rack, 
not fission bombs, not anything.  You cannot conquer a free man; The most 
you can do is kill him.

-Robert A. Heinlein, Revolt in 2100
