Interesting to note that the same type tax applies to "music CD-R" blanks 
(of the type required by the Phillips-Magnavox style music CD burners, 
which won't burn onto a data blank).  Last I looked, such blanks were 
still >$1.00, where data CD-R blanks are down to ~$0.39.  And, of course, 
computer-based burners have no problem burning audio onto a data CD-R.

Where they doubtless stay.  It's pretty well known how little artists make 
from their corp-owned recorded works.
