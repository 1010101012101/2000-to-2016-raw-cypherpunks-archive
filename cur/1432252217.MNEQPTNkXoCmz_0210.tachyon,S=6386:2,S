True, but my point was that the 'Samuelson technical stuff' has its place.

Point well taken. All I'm saying is that without the micro and macro 
fundamentals, it's going to be a lot more difficult to get a meaninful grasp of 
the Austrians: the meaning of the terms they're using, their contexts, who they 
were fighting against, etc. I ought to know: I did it 'backwards' myself. 

Too many people read what they know they'll agree with, leave it at that-- and 
then wonder why nobody but their friends takes their arguments seriously. It's 
a problem. Not YOUR PERSONAL problem, but a problem nevertheless. heh.

Exactly--and I happen to think Samuelson and Krugman are great places to start.

I don't think you'd expect someone who hasn't digested a book comperable 
to 'Applied Cryptography' to pick up on as many of the fine points of technical 
crypto articles as they would have otherwise, would you? Which isn't to say 
they wouldn't get it eventually by reading other articles, or shouldn't bother. 
All I'm saying is that basic technical knowledge goes a long way toward 
understanding the larger context, that's all.

Oh come on, I said it was an excellent list.

Where did that come from? I'm planning on reading some of the ones you 
mentioned that I wasn't already familiar with, myself. I wasn't being critical 
of the idea of learning more, quite the contrary.

No, my point was that people should be careful not to let their ideologies and 
interests box them in.

Not at all: I just happen to think the 'well read' might have some use for 
Samuelson and Krugman.

Reading Samuelson before Hayek will save you a lot of time in the long run. 

What about your recommended readings for all the other topics you mentioned? 
Surely they ought to count as horizon-broadening. 


with respect,

~Faustine.
