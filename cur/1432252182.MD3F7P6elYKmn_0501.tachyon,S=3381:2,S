Which is what the NRC did with the crypto issue. They sensed which way 
the wind was blowing (anti-Clipper, by 80% plus if I remember the 
opinion polls correctly) and came out with a report which massaged the 
inputs in such a way as to come out against key escrow.

If the opinion polls, weighted appropriately by inputs from media 
conglomerates, conclude that regulation of access to speech is 
advisable, then the NRC will issue a suitably-weighty report outlining 
the issues and presenting Congress with options for regulating speech 
and access to speech.
