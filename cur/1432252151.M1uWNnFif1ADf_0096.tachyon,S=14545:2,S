I've been pointing this out for many years, and did so at very early 
Cypherpunks meetings. If you say Schneier "has noted" this, I'll take 
your word.

The proper (moral, public choice theory, economically sound) approach is 
for those who want more security against theft to _pay_ for it. This 
through either their own choices, such as the choices I myself made for 
the type of gun safe I have in my house, or through the advice and 
pricing from their insurance companies. Holding a cheap safe maker 
"strictly liable" for loses when thieves use tin snips to cut through 
their safe is NOT the solution to the "strong safe" problem.

Unfortunately, as Declan also notes, the "men with guns" tend to go for 
"do this or we will shoot you" solutions. I count mandatory air bags and 
seat belt laws in this category.

Friedman's recent book "Law's Order" has many good economic analyses of 
tort situations, showing in nearly all cases that free market (mutually 
negotiated, noncoerced) produce more efficient results than non free 
market (imposed by government, coerced) solutions. Not surprising to 
libertarians, but useful to consider in the crypto context.

Bringing strict liability into the world of security and crypto would 
result in the usual market distortions. As an example, one might expect 
a "recommended security standard," decided upon by industry committees 
(with government, probably the NSA, involvement). Like airbags, this 
would then be mandated to be included in all Net connectivity and 
related products. Vendors would scramble to meet this requirement. And 
probably some form of escrow ("to help resolve disputes," "for the 
children") would be mandated-in. And of course it probably couldn't be 
"too strong."

Liability as currently interpreted can easily suppress innovation: 
Westinghouse froze the design of their boiling water nuclear reactors at 
roughly the 1960 level, except for minor changes in instrumentation and 
construction methods. The theory being that they had been given a kind 
of "safe harbor" on past designs (often done in conjunction with the 
Feds, as part of military reactor and AEC-led design projects) and that 
introducing innovations could alter the risk equation...even if it made 
the reactors better!

Similarly, innovations in automobile design are suppressed by liability 
concerns. A car maker who improves the layout of gas and brake pedals 
faces lawsuits over accidents "caused" by the changes. (cf. "sudden 
acceleration," aka "nitwit stepped on the wrong pedal.")

Peter Huber, in "Galileo's Revenge," notes many cases where strict 
liability law has suppressed innovation. My favorite was the Florida 
case where a woman claimed a CAT scan made her lose her psychic powers. 
A jury awarded her $2 million in liability damages. (This also mixes in 
pseudoscience issues, but the liability laws are still implicated.)

And speaking of CAT scans, or NMR, PET, etc. scans, many hospitals now 
routinely order such scans in nearly all cases of minor injury. My 
father went in for an exam and the doctor recommended an NMR scan of 
some sort. My father asked why. The doctor: "Don't worry, your insurance 
will cover most of it." My father: "I asked why I need this." Doctor: 
"We really recommend it."

To cut to the chase: Hospitals recommend such scans "just in case." To 
cover their asses in a possible liability suit should some problem 
happen later in time. Is this "due diligence"? Well, NMR scans are not 
cheap, so the cost gets passed on in the usual ways. Is the average 
benefit worth it to the average patient who gets the "we recommend it" 
advice? Debatable. Except there _IS_ no debate about it, certainly not 
between the average patient and the average doctor.

BTW, my father said "No" to the doctor. The doctor argued, then gave up. 
Apparently he felt my father was exposing _him_ to strict liability. 
(Needless to say, a patient's "waiver" is challengeable in the usual 
ways: "I didn't know what I was signing," "The doctor didn't explain to 
me that the scan might have detected the tumor I now have," and the 
other usual Mommy State whines.)

Anyway, I think imposing FDA-type oversight and medical industry-type 
liability laws on the security and crypto industry would be a disaster.

Here's one of my articles from 1996 about this issue:

I believe that at this time the differential market value to customers of
having strong crypto in telephones is near-zero, and in cell-phones is 
only
slightly greater. My reasons will follow below.

I'm explicitly discussing "things as they are" rather than "things as 
they
should be."

While I would certainly _like_ to see wider use of crypto, and crypto
deployed ubiquitously in products like telephones, cellphones, pagers, 
and,
of course, computers and networks, I think any honest appraisal of market
conditions must conclude that there is little _average American_ 
awareness
of, or demand for, crypto.

One could cite many reasons. Here are some that I see. (Note: I'm not
saying these are true for me and thee, nor for everyone else. And these
reasons may change with time. But for now, I think they're pretty 
accurate.)

* Most people don't think they're targets of wiretapping. They don't 
think
the FBI is tapping their phones, and they've never even heard of the NSA,
let alone GCHQ, NRO, SDECE, etc.

* "What have I got to hide?"

* Given a choice to use ordinary phone lines or cordless handsets, with
attendant ease-of-eavesdropping issues, they'll take the convenience of
cordless handsets nearly every time. (And the 900 MHz increase-security
cordless handsets are not yet in heavy demand...they'll succeed when
they're as cheap as ordinary cordless phones.)

* Security always takes some effort. The military can have it only by
having elaborate protocols, checks and balances, and essentially 
full-time
"crypto" personnel to go through the rigamarol of setting up secure
communications and locking up key material according to elaborate
procedures.

(I like to cite the evolution of metal safes. Mosler Safe Company says 
the
driving force behind safe design, and deployment to merchants and banks,
was the _insurance business_. Instead of preaching about the value of
increased security, the insurers--who knew how to take the long
view--offered rate discounts if stronger safes were installed. Voila,
stronger safes. Until similar incentives exist for data--e.g., insurance
for loss of patient records, confidential dossiers, etc.--I doubt most
people will listen to the "preaching.")

* Look at how few people--myself included--routinely use crypto (digital
signatures, etc.) here on this list! It is now "worth it" to me to
digitally sign all messages. (Please, don't send me your personal
experiences or your scripts for interfacing Pegasus Zapmail to PGP 2.8!)

* Even those with secure phones--STU-IIIs and Clipperphones--admit that
they rarely use the features. (Recall several stories where advocates of
Clipper had to take the books and magazines piled up on top of their
Clipperphones, dust them off, and try to remember how to initiate a 
secure
conversation!)

* And this raises the problem of: whom do you communicate with securely? 
If
your friends and family don't have compatible hardware, what's the point?
Sure, some corporations and enterprises will take the plunge and buy sets
of units, but Joe Public will likely not, at least not until a critical
mass of compatible crypto is installed...perhaps a decade or more from 
now.

* In short, most people don't see the need. They're not doing things they
think would warrant surveillance, and they have no experience with bad
effects from wiretaps or whatnot. Just not on their list of things to 
worry
about. And they don't want the additional confusion, learning, and
incompatibility with what their friends and coworkers have.

As to the larger issue of "edcucating the public," I think this is almost
always an exhausting and fruitless task. Do-gooders have been trying this
for decades, even longer.

(Don't let me stop you, anyone. But I think it's unlikely that a new
campaign to educate people about a potential risk that they have never 
seen
any concrete evidence for in their own lives is going to do much.)

When crypto is cheap enough, it may be a selling factor for a consumer
making a choice. How much extra people are willing to pay is unclear. And
there are "sophisticated users" who may pay extra for such features.

And certainly there does not have to be "wide acceptance" for crypto to 
be
deployed to the "point of no return" (hint: this is a more important goal
to me than acceptance by Joe Public). For example, the SSL and SWAN stuff
is incredibly important, because wide encryption of network traffic, even
if Joe and Jane Public are not using crypto at home, means surveillance 
and
vacuum-cleaner types of NSA monitoring are made ten thousand times more
difficult. Which may be enough to secure for us the blessings of crypto
anarchy.

P.S. I'll be away at the Hackers Conference in Santa Rosa, CA for the 
next
several days, and then travelling for the American holiday of 
Thanksgiving
Day. So, I'll be mostly away from the list for a while.

Just say "No" to "Big Brother Inside"
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that that ain't 
allowed.
