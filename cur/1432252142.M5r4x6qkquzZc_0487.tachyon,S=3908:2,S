I wasn't even going to answer the absurd "hypothetical", but since it's now
in play...

Obviously, every ISP does.

Maybe I should have been clearer: the feds didn't show us at any of the small
guys (AFAIK), such as the regional or small nationals - they showed up at the
large multinationals (of which the one I work at was likely the smallest,
with a mere 48 countries of footprint).  They clearly understood that
sniffing my peering/transit pipes wasn't technically *possible* (yet) - what
they were interested in was sniffing my regional POPs, with [relatively] low
speed OC3/OC12 pipes.  To rephrase it: they were interested in *my*
customers, not the traffic from other companies (they had other field
officers at the other NSPs).

It's a lot more likely than you seem to realize.  The internet is a
collection of aggregation points (ISPs): get the individual aggregations, and
the rest is as visible as a reconstructed RAID5 stripe.

This type of thing certainly goes on, but not in the vaccum cleaner world of
large pipes.  This is only technically feasible for targetted investigations.

The loops are too far out on the edge to be useful for anyone but the loop
owner themselves, and there are *way* too many [ever changing] paths out of
any individual ASN - the aggregation point is where this kind of action
*must* happen.

As I noted: much to my amazement, many do exist.

Agrred.  Encryption, properly implemented and executed, is the only real path
to privacy.
