My kid is 21 months old.  Would you still take him on as a baby privacy
client?   He's getting concerned about the number of baby pictures I've
put up on the web, and was talking about getting a lawyer.  He'd probably
have to pursue a judgement, not just a restraining order, against me
in order to pay you.  Are you licenced in Calif?
