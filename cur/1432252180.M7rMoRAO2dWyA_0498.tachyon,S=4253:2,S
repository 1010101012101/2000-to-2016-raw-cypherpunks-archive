My post was not "bait." The reason we have anything left of the amendments
so frequently talked about in here is due to the independence of the
judiciary. While you can question aforesaid independence, threatening the
judiciary is beyond the pale.

There are some posts in here that give me 'pause for psycholinguistic
analysis.' As such, I worry that they could be misconstrued (Type 5...Type
6, compulsive or possible syndicate bombers even...) by some hypersensitive,
uneducated people not intimately familiar with the history and quirks of
this list -- in what has become a hypersensitive environment.

Bell's "Assassination Politics" put cypherpunks on some protective
intelligence agendas. It would not be implausible to assume you were being
monitored to see if you "run" with the seeded assassination memes, if only
for analytical purposes. These matters are taken seriously by those charged
with the care of protected persons. (Contrary to what some here would have
you believe, subtlety can get you a much higher threat-rating than overtly
threatening correspondence.)

Baiting? Provocation? No, a caveat. Do not tolerate behavior of that nature.
It subjects you all to scrutiny and mischaracterization.

What about Mr. K-S that hides behind his hushmail jacket and asks for names
and addresses.....why doesn't somebody cuss him out?
