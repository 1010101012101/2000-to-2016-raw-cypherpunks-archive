20 years ago, I might have agreed with this assessment. Actually, written in 
the present tense it is largely true. 3,000 years ago is a different story, 
however, and modern religionists often forget that. The earliest religious 
texts (including the Torah) are written in such a 'primitive' time that I 
don't think any of the modern notions apply. For instance, in the Torah it 
would seem that there are clearly plenty of other Gods to choose from, but 
the one the jews were commanded to choose was  (Tetragrammaton). He doesn't 
even seem to have the qualities of "justice" righteousness, truth, peace, 
compassion blah blah blah that we are supposed to associate with God today. 
In fact, the Torah was written in the form of a peace treaty, with the 
implication that if the jews stopped obeying their end of the bargain, 
they'd get the CRAP kicked out of them. Period.

Likewise, the Vedas and the earliest portions of the I Ching come from a 
time that is probably incomprehensible now.

A reference to group theory, eh? Nice. The Jungians of the world might argue 
otherwise, that religion to some extent codified primitive forms of group 
theory into symbolism. Certainly, the Dzog Chen tibetan Buddhists did 
comething very close to this, visualizing n-dimensional arrays of 'dieties' 
which are considered really focal/fold points of "psychocosmic energy"*.

If you are referring to modern religion in the religious sense, I agree. But 
I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater...there are some very odd 
things tucked away into the Torah, for instance, that are arguably worth 
discovering. But then again, maybe I'm willing to throw the baby out with 
the bath water...if that water gets pooped up enough, the baby is no longer 
visible!

for an excellent discussion of buddhist iconography in the context of an 
architectural study.
