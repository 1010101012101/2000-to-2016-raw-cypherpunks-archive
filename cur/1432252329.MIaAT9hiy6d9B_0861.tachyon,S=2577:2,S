    * The NBC Today Show which stated that "studies show that the acai berry is one of the most nutritous foods in the world.      
        
    * ABC News stated that research has provided evidence that "the acai berry will help you live longer and healthier.  That it could help protect you against cancer, protect your heart and even prevent Alzheimer’s disease.
  
However, it is not only the health, rejuvenation and detoxifcation aspects of the acai berry we are interested in.  The fact that it helps the body to lose fat is what many people find of interest and thus we want to try it for ourselves! 
       
 A brief excerpt from Dr Perricone’s book:
   
Acai is good for wieghtLoss because it contains cyanidin, a highly antioxidant phytochemical compond.” This claim is based on a Japanese research report that found evidence that cyanins work by reducing fat asorption and “draining body fat”. (pp. 59)".
