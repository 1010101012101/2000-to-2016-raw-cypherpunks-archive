Hi LibTech

Citizen Lab is undertaking research on the commercial market for censorship, surveillance, and computer network attack
capabilities -- hence the interest in Blue Coat, but among many other reports we have done either alone or collaboratively
with others on the topic.  That would include reports going back to the mid 2000s on the use commercial filtering products,
published under the auspices of the ONI, and including reports on Fortinet in Burma, Smart Filter in Iran, Websense in a variety
of MENA / Gulf countries, and more recently Netsweeper.  We have also published several reports on Gamma Group, and
one on Hacking Team.  Additionally, we are working collaboratively with Privacy International and Agentura.Ru on the commercial
surveillance market in Russia and the former Soviet Union.

Our interest is to document what's going on in the first instance, typically employing a mixed methods approach that we are refining -- and a lot 
of that can be opportunistic depending on the modalities of deployment.  A second, growing concern of ours is around the question
of what can be done about this market.  

Specifically on Blue Coat, readers of lib tech might be interested in an oped that Sarah McKune and I wrote that talks
about the issue of shareholder pressure on Blue Coat as one approach short of regulation, after we determined that the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is a majority
owner of Blue Coat systems.  You can read that oped here:

http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2013/02/06/teachers_pension_plan_invests_in_internet_surveillance_firm.html

I should mention that we posted questions directly to Blue Coat in our report here:
https://citizenlab.org/2013/01/planet-blue-coat-mapping-global-censorship-and-surveillance-tools/
...and sent a letter directly to Blue Coat systems and the OTPP reiterating those questions.
To date we have not received any reply.

Our various publications on this topic can be found here:

Regards
Ron
