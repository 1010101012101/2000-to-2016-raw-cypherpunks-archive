JVM in a proper jail would indeed solve many of our problems. If you're
saying we can't develop a proper jail, then, well, maybe your sarcasm can
shield us from the future instead.

If some variant of "but then there's this" is on your tongue, yes there's
many other issues too. I'm pretty sure they can all be dealt with.

I don't really know what kind of satire you're playing here :(

If I squint I can see an argument along the lines of "but I won't trust you
either" - which is entirely destructive. In the Bitcoin world there's some
attempts to make trust less needed - but still deliver services. A
2-out-of-3 multisig wallet where the service holds one key, you hold
another, and a trusted third party (a notary of your choosing, your safe,
whatever) holds a key *you generated and gave that party* is a rather good
way, for example, to securely store your money.

Now you can run off screaming "LOL U R USING NSA CYRPTO WHAHA" and continue
eating rocks instead, but try being clearer and less "funny" while doing so.

Your comments are neither in depth nor self evident.

I'm not going to expand on the virtues and evils on capitalism. It suffices
to say that money is here to stay, and we better make good goddamn use of
it. We'll need it to live well, and allow others to live well while
supporting the cause. I think it's better to deserve (earn) the money than
to beg for it. If capitalism is a remotely sane system that must be
possible. Feel free to propose an alternative.

I talked about trust a bit before. There's always going to be some trust.
If you're reasonable about the amount and type of trust it's entirely
workable.

Technology is the mantra here. If you want it otherwise, go elsewhere.
