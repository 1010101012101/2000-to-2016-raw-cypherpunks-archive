[I guess you're jokign Steve, but I'll kinda bite :)]

(At the risk of being flamed=85actually, fuck it..)

He is damn fucking right. He posted the following a few minutes before:

"Small silver lining in NSA revelations: hardly anyone's carping that =
those who can't figure out crypto apps don't "deserve" privacy anymore."

Users are not idiots - they do not focus on this because it is hard. If* =
there is stupidity, it's the security engineers who develop tools that =
people can't use. =20

Security people need to understand their ultimate goal is to get tools =
they build (and build damn well for the most part) into the hands of =
people, real people. I know this is=20

The majority of people (Yes! None crypto-technology focused people too!) =
don't see crypto as a goal - they see using their software as a tool to =
task to succeeding their goal - sending the e-mail, receiving the SMS. =
Security and crypto should be by default.

Steve, to start your reading:

If there is anything positive to come out of all this it's two things: =
non-security peopel realising those "nerds" can help, and security =
grasping the realisation that they need people too.

Talk to people. Find out what it is they need to accomplish and help =
them do it securely and privately. You'd be amazed how much it'll do.

conversation.
