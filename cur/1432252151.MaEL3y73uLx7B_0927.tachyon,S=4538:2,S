According to the registry, their record was modified yesterday (24
November).  

In addition, I am unable to reach either of their authoritative name
servers - their upstream may in fact be off the air completely.  With the
recent change in their record, it is possible they made changes to their
dns server addresses, and the new addressed were botched in the process
(something I went through several weeks ago - it appears to be quite
difficult to get the new registrars to properly move dns hosts).

I guess the next step would be email to their admins, and possibly a NANOG
request...

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
