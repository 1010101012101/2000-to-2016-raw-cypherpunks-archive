I was shocked, *shocked* to receive the following disturbing message in my 
email!

hate mail directed by the outraged public to some innocent member of our 
community,
for surely Nobody would put their own name on this kind of material.
O, <expletive deleted> tempora!  O, <expletive deleted> mores!
