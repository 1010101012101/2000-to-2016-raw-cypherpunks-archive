Even worse, I've once heard a coworker explain to me why Bush doesn't give 
a rats ass about the environment: just like the impromptu "pilots" who 
learned how to fly, but not land, Bush and Crew believe that this world is 
theirs to do with as they wish, and that pollution isn't important - so 
what if thousands die of cancer, so long as they earn a place in their idea 
paradise.

Yes, between the flat-earther's, witch burners, jihadists, and other nuts, 
religion certain has had a wonderful influence on humanity.
