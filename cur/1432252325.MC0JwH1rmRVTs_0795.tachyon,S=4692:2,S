Looks like a great opprtunity to ask hard-hitting questions where
it counts: if more articulate and informed people who support civil
liberties would show up at meetings like this, it would be an
entirely good thing.

For what it's worth, C-Span will be there--so at the very least you
know you'll get two minutes' worth of a message out to a broader 
audience. If you're in the area, it's certainly worth a shot. Please
forward this to anyone you know who might be interested in asking 
questions: I hope we pack the place!
