Every now and again I do a search of my name just to
see what comes up and I recently saw a post of my name
an address at this url
http://www.shmoo.com/mail/cypherpunks/may01/msg00077.shtml.
I was wondering if you could please erase this for two
reasons, one I do not live at that address anymore and
two I stopped sending the chain letter 3 months ago,
so there is no use for my personal information to be
on the net anymore. Thank-You
                                       Mitch
