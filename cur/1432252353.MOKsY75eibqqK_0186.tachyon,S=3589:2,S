Maybe not "dead"

Registrant:

   Domain Name: RADIUSNET.NET

      NS2.ULTSEARCH.COM 


But it looks like the domain was first registered in 2003 (recently!)
so the hacker/crypo guys must have dumped it a few years ago thus
making it available again. 

Someone doesn't want us to be able to view the old contents
either.(?)

On <http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://radiusnet.net> this is
displayed:

In <http://www.radiusnet.net/robots.txt> this is placed:

> 
> User-agent: *
> Disallow: /s
> Disallow: /c
> 
> User-agent: ia_archiver
> Disallow: /

> User-agent: Scooter

> 


By explicitly excluding the ia_archiver bot from the contents they
are making the contents excluded from the archiv.org archives for
both "versions", regardless of whether the old owners wants that or
not.

Maybe the archive.org people should implement a feature not making it
possible to exclude old contents by taking over the domain and simply
putting in the robots.txt on the root?!

Maybe the Wayback Machine should only honor robots.txt for old
contents if the ownership of the domain in question has been
inchanged during the period in question. Every time an ownership
change is done all old contents would be blocked/protected from
deletion.
