Subject: FC: Speaking to MIT Tech/Eros group today (Thursday, 4/24)
Sender: owner-politech@politechbot.com




Join the Tech/Eros group for an informal discussion with renowned 
technology policy journalist Declan McCullagh. McCullagh is the chief 
political correspondent for CNET's News.com and moderator of the Politech 
List (www.politechbot.com). Among other topics, McCullagh will be talking 
about how current government cyber-policies affect sexual expression on the 
Internet.  McCullagh is a frequent guest on national news shows and was 
formerly the Washington correspondent for Wired News. He is also a 
photographer.

Come meet McCullagh Thursday, April 24, 5PM in the conference room at 
E32-300 on the MIT campus.

The Tech/Eros Group is made possible by a generous grant from the 
Initiative on Technology and Self at MIT. Tech/Eros (www.techeros.org) is a 
research group of scholars, scientists and writers devoted to analyzing the 
connection between technology and sexuality. If you would like more 
information about Tech/Eros, write to Annalee Newitz at godzilla@mit.edu.
