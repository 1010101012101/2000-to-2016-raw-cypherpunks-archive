I take it then that the heroic rescue of Private Jessica Lynch is also 
the truth, while the story about the use of excessive (and unnecessary) 
to "free" her is also a commie lie.

I am just wondering, but is anything that has happened (or is 
happening) in Iraq and done by the US / Western powers wrong in your 
eyes, or simply can they do no wrong?

Michael
