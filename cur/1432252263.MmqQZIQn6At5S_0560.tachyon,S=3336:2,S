Rumsfeld also revealed that the CIA has taken over the Saddam
interrogation, and pundits are speculating that they will use the same
torture techniques that are being used on the "detainees."

Later today, a source close to the interrogation said that Saddam would be
subjected to stress and sleep deprivation.  Basically, teams of
interrogators will ask questions over and over again, and no one will get
any rest until answers are provided.

Bill Bennett said just a few minutes ago, that Saddam's capture made
America safer, because the world has learned that "If you mess with
America, you wind up in a hole."

A friend of mine, when asked what he wanted from Santa for Christmas,
replied, "A crater the size of DC."

Clearly, the world's leaders are looking closely at Saddam's treatment,
and realizing how easily pissing off the Bush family could result in them
being shown on International TV unbathed, unshaven, checked for fleas, and
bent over for a rectal probe.

Of course, all of this is provoking a new arms race of astronomical
proportions, as the other nations of the world realize international law
means nothing, and that the US and Israel think they can judge everyone
else on the planet, no one can judge them, and they can act with impunity.

This will, in a few years, result in the usual "force meets force plus
brains" low level format of the arrogant, and after a few hangings, and a
big round of applause, life on the planet will move on.
