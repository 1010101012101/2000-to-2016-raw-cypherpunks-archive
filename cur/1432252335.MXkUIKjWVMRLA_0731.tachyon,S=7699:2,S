Welcome to the Simply-Spiritual & Wolfsongenchantment Newsletter!

http://www.Simply-Spiritual.com and http://www.wolfsongenchantment.com and have collaborated to become the new owners of the psychicbookstore.com newsletter!

We are two websites metaphysically oriented with access to much of the same information that you received from Psychic Bookstore but will be adding much more over the next few weeks and months to come!  Please visit both of our sites to familiarize yourself with our present services offered and stay with us throughout  the Fall of 2001 and see what exciting and diverse plans we have in store for you!  You can join our individual mailing lists by clicking on our website links at the bottom of this newsletter.  Both websites have some really comprehensive information shared in newsletters pertaining to spiritual evolution. Hopefully you will visit both of our websites in the very near future and get your email addresses incorporated with both websites enabling you to be in free drawings each month for psychic readings etc.

In this issue of the newsletter, we're addressing Spirituality by Donald Groves

Teach me the supreme knowledge of true understanding and tolerance, 
Teach me the true meaning of love so that it can reach out much further than 
the limited space it now occupies, 
My physical being is trapped by boundaries,my mind is not. 
Help me to open it so it may soar far and wide to reach levels hitherto 
unknown to me 
There is no substitute for spirituality, it is absolute, 
Once attained it is inviolate 
It will uncomplicate that which is now complicated 
It will remove all destructive fears. 
It will give you confidence, enabling you to instill it in others 
It will teach you how to give with grace and to accept graciously 
It will remove lonliness from within and replace it with peaceful solitude 
and divine silence 
It will give insight into mysteries, the revelations of which will delight 
It will transform shadow into substance 
It will spark the light that will grow brighter and brighter with the passing 
of this time,and will continue to burn externally while this cycle runs its 
course, 
Blending your thoughts and destiny in preparation for the next 
Do not doubt.. 
 





We are looking forward to meeting you either through chat or e-mail.  Within the next few weeks, we will also have the capability of doing live phone readings so please visit our websites and get your email address on our mailing lists.  We are continually giving away free readings in our monthly drawings, so share with your friends and internet buddies our website so they may have a chance of winning a free 30 minute reading also.
