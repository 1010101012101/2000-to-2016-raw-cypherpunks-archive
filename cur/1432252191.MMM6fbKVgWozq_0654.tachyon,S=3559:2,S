Day 2:

  http://cryptome.org/jdb040901-2.htm

Completion of direct questioning by Robert Leen,
Jim's many-times-fired attorney, and cross-examination 
by Robb London.

Two cpunks are mentioned by Jim by name, with glowingly
admirable death kisses. 

But he also kisses Leen (says Leen threatened to kill him 
two days before), London, Tanner, cpunk Jeff, another J 
and wife B, CIA's Bend OR Phantom, a phantom Phantom, 
The Super-Dirty Narc, Innocent Victim Agent No. 2, the 
Laura Raider of his mother's fireplace ashes, a 
police-asslick Reporter, and ... what can be said of Jim 
that he can't yodel better on the stand.

Tanner admonished London for leaving the podium
during questioning to get docs. "Stop it."

London apologized for asking Jim too many
questions without waiting for answers. "I'll stop
it."

Leen asked to be relieved as defense attorney, 
Tanner: "Denied. 

Leen asked for a psycho exam of Jim, Tanner denied.

Jim tried to invoke his 5th Amendment rights,
Tanner denied: "answer the question."

Jim asked for legal representation, crying IANAL,
Tanner denied: "answer."

Jim admitted he stole mail and opened it, and burned
it in his mother's fireplace. Jim admitted he sent a
fax across state lines, and went across state lines
in pursuit of homebases of official pukes.

London affirmed all Jim's prison phone calls were
monitored, that cpuke Jeff monitors cpunks -- maybe
it was Jim who said the latter when he testified that
that posting to cpunks was how he notified the opukes 
what he intended.

Etc.
