Or that the ability to break [truecrypt|gpg|pgp|whatever] is an incredibly 
valuable thing, and you aren't going to blow it on a petty prosecution.

Very likely, if that ability exists anywhere, knowledge of its existence 
is very highly guarded.

ObSSLBackdoorHoneypotProposal ... you know the drill.  The only question 
is, what could you obtain, and resend over and over again, that would be 
worth someone like the US Govt ... or Apple Computer ... tipping their 
hand ?
