This attitude summarizes why you are such a pest.

You clutter the list with forwarded articles filled with headers and 
footers and ads and all the junk appearing on a typical browser page, 
then you claim that the reason you do this is because Netscape gave 
you no options.

I describe how I get around this by spending a few minutes tidying-up 
the cruft.

Your response is this message, above.
