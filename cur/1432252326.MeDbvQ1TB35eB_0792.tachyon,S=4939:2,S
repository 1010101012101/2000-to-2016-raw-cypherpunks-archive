Or that mere sexism prevented her from flying a plan that she was more 
than capable of flying: since neither of were there at the time, we will 
never know for sure - making this moronic line of discussion moot.

Total, utter bullshit, and you KNOW that to be so!  Women were no allowed 
to even apply to a combat MOS until the 1990s!

Really? You have first hand personal knowledge that this is why she was 
chosen?  Proof that she wasnt chosen because she happened to be the first 
woman who asked for that MOS, and gave them a chance to prove their PC 
creds by agreeing to let her try and qualify?

No, you don't.  And neither do I: both of can speculate, nothing more.

> PC killed Amelia Earhart, 

Pure speculation.

> and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.

For this claim there is a lot more evidence: PC was a factor in her death, 
since they certified her as a competent pilot on a plane she clearly could 
not fly.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing for PC: I loathe PC!  But it's just as 
bad as the mutually stupid universal declarations you are making.

You need to wake up!  Look around, there are a lot of female ceo's of big 
business today.  Even Fortune 100 companies.

This is just your fear of feminization coming out: what's the matter, did 
the local priest play with you when you were a kid, or was you father a 
"man's man" who ran when someone looked at him mean?  What the fuck are 
you overcompensating for?  This almost looks like Homosexual Panic.
