Dear Phill,

Despite your repeated claims in this regard, we have presented the 
links to our work so that anyone can review this analysis themselves 
and make up their own minds.  Clearly you have not examined our book 
by Liebowitz and Margolis, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT 
(http://independent.org/tii/content/briefs/BriefWLMS.html), and hence 
we are still waiting for you to so and then indicate how you believe 
the analysis by Liebowitz and Margolis might be erroneous.  Your 
otherwise objecting to this work simply because you do not agree with 
the conclusions is hardly the basis for any serious, scientific 
discussion of the merits of the work.

Best regards,

David
