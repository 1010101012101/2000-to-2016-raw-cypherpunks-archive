excerpt:

AL- QAIDA S ENDGAME? 
A STRATEGIC SCENARIO ANALYSIS

The following analysis is the product of DSSis strategic analysis team
using scenario planning to make sense of the current
situation and the war on terrorism. During the course of exploring future
scenarios, past events acquired meaning, and the
direction of the conflict as desired by Al-Qaida began to make sense.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

DSSis strategic scenario analysis regarding Al-Qaidas endgame leads to
the following conclusions about the real current
events: 

     The network of networks known as Al-Qaida has successfully laid a
trap for the United States. Al-Qaida retains the
     initiative and the U.S. is operating inside the intentions and plans
of Al-Qaida 

     Al-Qaida cannot destroy the U.S. forces inside the U.S., nor can it
convince the U.S. to leave the Middle East using
     terror attacks. The intention of the terror attacks is a provocation
to force the U.S. to engage and deploy forces to the
     Middle East, where such forces could be destroyed 

     The intention and purpose of Al-Qaidas plans are either to make the
Middle East ungovernable, or to gain control of
     the petroleum production system in the region. Application of the oil
weapon could be used to attempt to force
     withdrawal of U.S. presence in the region; outright destruction of the
petroleum production system would leave the U.S.
     with no or greatly reduced real interests in the region 

     Control or destruction of the petroleum production system in the
Middle East, and the potential for attacks on global
     petroleum production, would transform the political situation in the
region, initiate a global depression by degrading or
     destroying critical industries of developing and advanced
Nation-States, and drastically shift the geopolitical balance
