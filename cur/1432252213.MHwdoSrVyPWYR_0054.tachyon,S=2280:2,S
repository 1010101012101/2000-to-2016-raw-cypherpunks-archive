By pointing out this attack you have
guaranteed that our resident cypherpunks
attackers will be reporting lots of
legit posts to razor.

I'd suggest not using razor to filter cpunks mail.

While we're talking about spam
filtering, please do not reject cpunks mail
that your filters id as spam.  Dump it
in /dev/null instead.   Sending reject messages
to mailing lists is rude.  

In another bit of list administrivia, it appears
that both aol and rr are not accepting mail this weekend.
(their servers accept connections but never send HELO or EHLO).
I hear that aol's incoming mail is hosed, I
don't know what rr's problem is.
