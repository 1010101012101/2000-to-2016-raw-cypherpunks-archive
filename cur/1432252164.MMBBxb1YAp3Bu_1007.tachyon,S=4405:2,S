In other words, the manufacturer has access to all your data because
they have the master storage key.

Why would everyone want to give one manufacturer that much power?

Or am I missing something...

and stores the blob in a safe place for future use.

and so can everyone else who visits the manufacturers database.

Seems like an understatement to me :-)  Explaining to every CEO left
standing that one company may have access to all their buisness data
because congress wants to make TCPA a law could be a very power lobby.

Yeah baby, tell them CEO's their costs are going up.  That'll definitly
help TCPA die quickly.  Especially nowadays.

Patience, persistence, truth,
