So in your version of reality, the Iraqi people were happily 
enjoying socialism, loving the socialism this benevolent Kassem 
provided to them and then this evil capitalistic CIA agent, 
Saddam, took it all away from them.

If that is what happened, what is your objection then to him 
being given to Iraqi people for execution?  Why are you calling 
for him to be released, or to be given to his fellow tyrants
who run the Hague court, who certainly will not execute him,
probably will not imprison him for very long, and might well
exonerate him?
