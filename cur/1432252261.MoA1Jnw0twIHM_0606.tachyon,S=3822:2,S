An alternative is to pay the first remailer for the whole chain, and then
to have that remailer pay the second remailer, the second remailer pay
the third remailer, and so on.  This way the follow-on remailers don't
know who the original sender of the message was.  The remailers can also
batch up their payments when they are sending a bunch of messages to other
remailers, perhaps even just pay the net clearing amount on a daily basis.

Some discussion of this idea as a mechanism for anonymous payments is
in the archives at
http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.2000.02.28-2000.03.05/msg00302.html
and follow-ups.
