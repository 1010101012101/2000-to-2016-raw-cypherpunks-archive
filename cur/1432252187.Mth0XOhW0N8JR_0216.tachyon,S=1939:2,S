Tyler,

Commie is the term used here like is nazi used elsewhere
as the most fearsome if thoughtless epithet. Nazi here is a 
term of endearment, and also admirable role model by some.

Calling someone both is not allowed, check the FAQ under impurity.

Tim May, praise Allah, always claimed cypherpunks was a fair and
balanced forum thanks to the one person of the left here who 
was fingered affectionately like a house rodent, an easy target for
errant shooters.

CJ is not to be recalled, ever.

Jim Bell still sends "very important" legal papers, the latest yesterday, 
which describe the way things should be understood. But who can
believe an MIT chemist political prisoner.

CJ and Jim jailed by the Democratic freedom-fighters.
