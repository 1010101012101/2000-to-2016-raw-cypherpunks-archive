*******************************************************************<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the wonderful world of college-posting!!! &nbsp;Unless you are: <BR>
(1) independently-wealthy, (2) are an entrenched execcutive with <BR>
extensive company stock-options, or (3) have a steady, permanent, <BR>
gravy civil-service position--- you may do well to visualize that you <BR>
have just stumbled into the equivilant of a gold-mine! &nbsp;In this <BR>
relatively lucrative field, you can indeed fulfill all those dreams <BR>
about essentially working for yourself: on your own schedule, where <BR>
you please, as much or as little as you want to! &nbsp;You can persue it <BR>
as a full time occupation--- or just dabble at it on the side-line <BR>
while working a regular job. . .if you are fortunate to have such.<BR>
<BR>
All it consist of is walking around college and university campuses <BR>
and posting fliers and such on convinent bulletin-boards and the <BR>
like. &nbsp;About the only items you need is a stapler and staples (and <BR>
maybe a roll of tape). &nbsp;You simply stick materials up on the boards <BR>
for students to see. &nbsp;For each product that you post fliers for, you <BR>
are assigned a unique agent code-number--- which goes on that <BR>
paticular flier's tabs. &nbsp;When inquiries (and so sales) result they <BR>
are tracked acording to your code, and added to your account. &nbsp;In <BR>
sum: Fliers are shipped to you free: you post them. . . responses <BR>
come in--- and you accumulate commissions. &nbsp;Checks are mailed either <BR>
forthnightly or monthly. &nbsp;Yes indeed: make quick, easy cash posting <BR>
these tear-strip fliers--- as simple as that! &nbsp;And no--- you don't <BR>
have to send us any money: we send you money instead! <BR>
<BR>
A few pointers:<BR>
<BR>
GENERAL: If your campuses are like many others across the country, <BR>
should you just slap up fliers in any old way any old where at any <BR>
old time--- well, don't expect any real worthwhile results. &nbsp;Done in <BR>
this fashion, when you put up a flier tonight, tomorrow morning it <BR>
will be plastered over with ads for fraternity parties, upcoming club-<BR>
meetings, bands looking for bass-players, and so-on and so-<BR>
forth. &quot;The only way to find a clean place to post at the University <BR>
of Florida is to light a match,&quot; jokes Mike Eisenberg, president of <BR>
Collegiate Promotions International, a postering company in Tampa, <BR>
Florida. &nbsp;Such is because most people posting bulletin-boards are <BR>
unsophisticated and haphazard in how they poster: they just grab any <BR>
old stapler, copies of their flier, and roam around plastering on <BR>
whim, paying little real attention to what they are doing. &nbsp;&quot;You <BR>
don't have to be absolutely professional (though that sure helps) to <BR>
be effective, but you need to be efficient,&quot; says Stephen Crockett, <BR>
president of Mid-South Marketing in Tennessee. &nbsp;Just remember--- if <BR>
you are: (1) courteous to other regular posting critters that use <BR>
your boards consistantly, (2) keep track of where you put your <BR>
posters, and (3) monitor boards regularly--- well, then, you can <BR>
attract a lot of attention (and so responses) through your flier-<BR>
posting eforts. Putting up fliers, posters, and other materials in <BR>
the right manner around campus can be well worth your time and <BR>
effort. &nbsp;It will prove to make a vast difference in your checks--- <BR>
say: $100, if you do--- vs $10, if you don't! <BR>
<BR>
#1: DON'T HOG THE BOARDS! <BR>
Never put more than one (or two, if massive space is available) <BR>
posters/fliers on each bulletin board. &nbsp;You'll acquire a bad image <BR>
and create hard feelings among student-groups and others if you <BR>
blanket the boards with your materials. If you have variations of a <BR>
given fleir (with significent differences), then one (or possibly <BR>
two) of each might be admissable--- depending on size-of-board(s) and <BR>
other conditions.<BR>
<BR>
#2: REMOVE ANY OUTDATED POSTERS/FLIERS YOU FIND FIRST (IN MOST CASES)<BR>
Usually, don't wait weeks or months to jerk down any present items <BR>
with past-dates on them. &quot;At one school, I found posters that were 18 <BR>
months old, towards thirty layers thick,&quot; Mid-South's Crockett <BR>
says. &quot;If it looks messy, people will poster over top of you. A lot <BR>
of students aren't going to check before they post you over.&quot; At some <BR>
places, the situation is different: The University of Texas at Austin <BR>
has developed an innovative postering technique that has helped <BR>
prevent a lot of unsightly trash around campus. &quot;Students used to put <BR>
posters anyplace, on trees, trash cans, basically anything that <BR>
didn't move,&quot; says Jerry Harrison, UT's manager of landscape <BR>
services. &quot;But a few years ago, we built some kiosks which are barrel-<BR>
shaped, made out of redwood. Every six inches, we have these large <BR>
elastic bands that are permanently attached. Students can slip the <BR>
posters under it. They work great.&quot; &nbsp;But with most schools nothing so <BR>
inovative exists--- and keeping your materials prominately displayed <BR>
remains a constant, on-going battle.<BR>
<BR>
#3: GENERALLY, WALLS ARE A NO-NO.<BR>
Nearly all colleges and universities across the nation (Canada too) &nbsp;<BR>
prohibit clubs from sticking posters to interior or exterior <BR>
classroom walls. If a surface has dry-wall (sheet-rock, as it is <BR>
called) behind it--- well, then, taping or stapling posters to such <BR>
will eventually peal off the paint. . , or possibly tear off the top <BR>
layer of the dry-wall when removed! &nbsp;If a wall is concrete or cinder-<BR>
block (especially unpainted) then you have more leeway. &nbsp;If glass, <BR>
probably pasting there is okay--- in unpainted: if painted, it is <BR>
likely to take off the paint when removed: nor big deal, possibly, <BR>
but to be avoided if possible. &nbsp;If wood, also exercise caution: paint <BR>
won't come off nearly as easily as with glass--- but the possibility <BR>
still exists; if the place already hass spots where paint has come-<BR>
off with old fliers removed in the past, then such happening with <BR>
yours won't matter much though. &nbsp;Some walls, actually, are made from <BR>
the same stuff as most bulletin-boards: a layer of thin corogated-<BR>
like rubber-matting over light (usually pine) sheet-wood--- which <BR>
permit easily stapling; may such spots you'll find already have <BR>
things affixed to them. &nbsp;Above all, watch what glue you use: avoid <BR>
model air-plane, rubber-cement, Elmers, 3M, Epoxy, etc; instead, <BR>
employ so-called glue-sticks--- available at most stores like <BR>
Staples. &nbsp;Such are actually composed of wax, with some mild chemical <BR>
adhesive mixed in--- and so hold reasonably well, while possessing <BR>
little destructive potential.<BR>
<BR>
#4: CAUTION WITH STAPLE-GUNS<BR>
Heavy-duty staple-guns (using standard thick staple-gun staples) are <BR>
a bozo no-no because they tear up the boards. Instead, use an office <BR>
stapler, such as an Arrow stapler, or a &quot;light-duty&quot; staple gun: such <BR>
is a power instrument, but uses regular-style staples (even if <BR>
appropriately chisel-pointed). <BR>
<BR>
#5: KEEP TRACK OF THE BEST POSTING LOCATIONS <BR>
Spend an hour or two going around your campus to do a bulletin board <BR>
inspection: where they are, how heavily covered they are, and how <BR>
well they're maintained. Keep detailed notes about your observations <BR>
of each location. If possible, maintain tabs about how many students <BR>
walk by the boards and note how many actually stop for a minute or <BR>
two to read posters. <BR>
(One time-tested option is to place posters on the backs of stall <BR>
doors in restrooms. These locations are the ultimate captive <BR>
audience. &quot;Since Simmons College is all women, this works really <BR>
well,&quot; says Karen Boss, a former student activities employee at <BR>
Simmons. &quot;People will always read what is in front of them.&quot; )<BR>
<BR>
#6: CLASSROOMS VS BREEZEWAYS <BR>
In classrooms, students are stuck in one place for an hour or more. <BR>
If you place your posters inside classrooms on the small bulletin <BR>
boards near the doors (or whereever available), you'll get the whole <BR>
class's attention. &quot;If you're looking for maximum exposure, <BR>
breezeways may be best. But classrooms are better for reaching <BR>
specific majors,&quot; Crockett says. &quot;You may get over two-hundred kids <BR>
through a classroom in a day, but you may have 2,000 students walk <BR>
down a hallway, which is way more competition, but also a lot more <BR>
traffic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
#7: BEST TIMES TO POSTER <BR>
Go late at night or early in the morning. &quot;We try to get out at 4 or <BR>
5 a.m. and leave enough of the board exposed so that anyone posting <BR>
later will likely leave some of our posters,&quot; says Charles Grapski of <BR>
the Independent Student Coalition at the University of <BR>
Florida. &quot;Sometimes it's a chore, but it can be fun.&quot; &nbsp;Nights may <BR>
work better at some schools (or at least for paticular buildings. &nbsp;<BR>
Sometimes weekends are about the only time to get into some places <BR>
during the whole semester.<BR>
<BR>
#8: WHERE TO POSTER ON A BOARD <BR>
Try to put your posters at eye level and remember than everyone isn't <BR>
the same height. Some people are taller than others, while others use <BR>
wheelchairs. &nbsp;Posting in a board's middle may well usually get you <BR>
posted over quickly. &nbsp;Tops or bottoms may work better in the long-<BR>
run. &nbsp;Vetran (35 years) New England posterer Ricahrd Paris prefers to <BR>
line his materils up-and-down the side ob boardds--- which makes some <BR>
sense: as then they can be covered over from onley one direction, <BR>
instead of three. &quot;One of the most unique means of attracting <BR>
attention that I've observed on our campus is when groups place a <BR>
`Burma Shave' type display on stairs,&quot; says Ken Peress of Susquehanna <BR>
University in Pennsylvania. &quot;You can't miss them when you start up <BR>
(or come down) the steps.&quot; Some stair-wells have boards for easy <BR>
stapling. &nbsp;If not, then fliers taped to the wall of various landing-<BR>
levels can work wonders if they stay up reasonably long. <BR>
<BR>
#9: WHAT IF SOMEONE POSTERS OVER YOU? <BR>
If someone slaps their posters over yours, remove theirs. You have <BR>
that right. But knowing how much you hate it when this happens to <BR>
you, don't perpetuate the problem. That's precisely why you shouldn't <BR>
post over someone else's fliers. <BR>
<BR>
#10: IN SOME CASES, SCHOOL POSTING-STAMPS MAY BE APPLICABLE <BR>
Some schools are annal-retentative aobut what is psoted in their <BR>
environs--- or at least some paticualr buildings on a campus may <BR>
operate like that. &nbsp;The psychologically-disadvantaged creatures <BR>
running these places may first require that all posters and flyers be <BR>
approved by the dean's office or by student-activities office or some-<BR>
such nonsense: that is, stamped with an official seal--- and they may <BR>
well be adverse with stamping many items they have some deranges beef <BR>
against, such as your paticular fliers. &quot;At our school, students have <BR>
to get their posters stamped at each building, which has control of <BR>
how its posters are distributed,&quot; says Cynthia Kane, assistant <BR>
director of Student Activities at Seton Hall University in New York. <BR>
And she's just referring to school-related things. &nbsp;So at some <BR>
places, where your stuff isn't stampable, and won't stay up worth <BR>
squat unstamped--- they may well not be worth posting. . . at least <BR>
in the traditional mode. &nbsp;In such cases, taping them to soft-drink <BR>
machine sides, in in side pay-phone stations (not owned by the <BR>
school) may be applicable.<BR>
<BR>
CONCLUSION: <BR>
You can get better attention and thus response if you develop a <BR>
strategy about when, where, and how to display posters and fliers on <BR>
campus to get the most exposure possible. &nbsp;Simple as that! <BR>

<BR>
OUR CURRENT LINE-UP:<BR>
 &nbsp;<BR>
(1) FUTUREQUEST. A proven, 13-year track-record winner! Top-notch <BR>
opportunity offer--- a complete money-making kit designed for <BR>
students. Pays $7 a sale! <BR>
<BR>
(2) ESQUIRE. Somewhat newer, this opportunity has a slightly <BR>
different slant--- to appeal to those with other perceptions. <BR>
Developed by other originaters, this complements without duplicating <BR>
FQ. Several years old now. Pays $6 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(3) BETTER SOLUTIONS. Another angle on the same take, true--- but <BR>
this was engineered quite differently. Aims at another sort of <BR>
audience-- though still accomodates a fair percentage of those <BR>
favored by FQ &amp; ESQUIRE. Flier is totally different--- seems like <BR>
something from an alien univese to FQ &amp; ESQUIRE. Also several years <BR>
old now. Pays $7 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(4) CREDIT-REPAIR KIT. Actually, part of the BS-offer--- the main <BR>
component designed for students to post off-campus. Your flier looks <BR>
different, is student-oriented, for on-campus posting. Some students <BR>
may post their version some on-campus though. Pays $6 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(5) PINK PLEASURES. A guide to legal Nevada bordelloes! Will have <BR>
guys fighting for the library or dorm computer to order their copy <BR>
first. Obviously not good for religious schools--- but the discrete <BR>
posting flier can be reasonably hung just about relatively anywhere <BR>
else. Pays $7 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(6) INTERNET-USER CASH-GENERATOR. About a year old now, this one is <BR>
really starting to pick up. Mostly details hundreds of internet-<BR>
programs, with free sign-up, that students can use to generate <BR>
payments and such to their accounts. Posting fliers proclaim Internet <BR>
Users/Surfers Wanted. Pays $6 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(7) INTERNET INCOME OFFER. Mainly concerns free sign-up internet <BR>
programs for making money off the net. Some are a real doozy. A sure <BR>
hot-seller. Pays $6 a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(8) CAPITOL ONE CREDIT-CARD. One of the greatest additions to the <BR>
posting-industry ever. These CapOne fliers can be posted at all <BR>
universities, colleges, vocational-technical schools or anyplace you <BR>
want to post them. Students simply enter a url referral-link, with <BR>
your unique agent-code embedded within, into any handy computer. They <BR>
complete the application online--- and within a minute are denied or <BR>
approved. With every approval, you accumulate $9. Students have <BR>
literally been snatching these fliers from reps' hands before said <BR>
reps can staple them onto bulletin-boards! This is no hype: it is <BR>
ABSOLUTELY true! We kid thee not! Pays $9 per approval! <BR>
<BR>
(9) DIRT-CHEAP! Scholarship-search. Yes, it's back! Since all but the <BR>
last step is done via the net, the cost for students is rock-bottom---<BR>
 for searches from multiple data-bases. Even pays the same $5.50 a <BR>
sale like the old Student Services deal--- maybe more later-on. <BR>
<BR>
(10) AUTO-INSURANCE. Again, students take a tab, type a url, embedded <BR>
with your code, into the address-slot, click Enter. Such takes them <BR>
to the site, where they complete a form for a quote. Your account is <BR>
automatically credited. Pays $1 or more per quote. <BR>
<BR>
(11) AMERICAN-EXPRESS CREDIT-CARD OFFER. Essentially, this works the <BR>
same as the CapOne item. Are you sick of being allowed to post Amex <BR>
apps from APM only at certain universities in the small, paticular <BR>
area(s) Kerry or Lance sees fit to condescendingly code you for--- <BR>
because those are the only places your apps will be paid on when they <BR>
are mailed-in? Well, fret no more. These Amex fliers can be posted at <BR>
ANY upper school--- and you are eligable for payment for any of those <BR>
approvals from anywhere. Usually pays comparable to CapOne. <BR>
<BR>
(12) TRAFFIC TICKETS. A guide to fighting traffic-tickets in court. <BR>
Good for off-campus posting as well as on-campus posting. Pays $5 or <BR>
more a sale. <BR>
<BR>
(13) TEXTBOOKS. Huge selection of new and used. Dirt-cheap prices. <BR>
Pays a percentage of all sales. Pure potential dynamite! (Not <BR>
available in Canada.)<BR>
<BR>
(14) THINGS-FROM-ANOTHER-WORLD. Primarily comic-books. Humonegous <BR>
range of publshers and titles. Also: CDs, maybe sometimes videos. <BR>
Pays on a percentage of sale basis. <BR>
<BR>
(15) NEXTCARD. Yet another postable-anywhere credit-card. And we mean <BR>
anywhere--- on (any) campus or off! Essentially the same deal as with <BR>
CapOne and Amex. Pays similarly. <BR>
