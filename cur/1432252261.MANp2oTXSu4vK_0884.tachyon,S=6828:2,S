My comments on code reviews is based on the practice at my 
current employer. When upper management supports the practice, and
not only allows, but in fact requires engineers to take the time and 
effort to do real reviews, they can catch a remarkable number of errors. 
It also means that more than a single engineer is familiar with a
given piece of code, which is a Good Thing.

This is a real potential problem - old code that hasn't been looked at in
years.
Re-writing from spec every few years is one solution, but one that is rarely
implemented.

Clearly, you've worked in places with shoddy (and possibly criminal)
practices.

Eavesdroppers in and out of uniform will look for, and try to generate, 
poor practices which will break otherwise secure systems. What I
find most worrying is when management only pays security lip-service,
a bullet item for marketing, without any real desire to make it strong.
Lucky's discovery that some GSM phones in the US have lousy or
non-existant keying practices is one example. I've actually turned
down jobs from firms where I felt that they wanted crypto as a
bullet item rather than for real security (one place wanted to use
20 bit keys, for example. (they no longer exist)).
