I should have mentioned in my first reply that you need to spend some 
time looking into evolutionary learning and markets. For example, the 
importance of quick feedback and correction, with profits determining 
which markets are explored.

I have strong views on this, having studied the 
electronics/semiconductor market for many years, having studied 
carefully the role of intermediate products (such as RTL --> DTL --> 
TTL --> op amps --> MOS RAMs --> 4-bit microprocessors --> etc.).

Products introduced in 1963, say, were generally making the bulk of a 
company's profits by 1965-66,  paying for the 1965 R & D and the 1966 
product rollouts, which then paid for the 1967-69 cycle, etc.

I know this was true of the earlier technologies and it matched 
everything I saw in my years at Intel and thereafter.

The "2-4 year payback cycle" in the electronics industry, from roughly 
1955 to the present, was terribly important. Each generation of 
technology paid for the next generation, and costly mistakes resulted 
in companies ceasing to exist (Shockley Transistor, Rheem, Precision 
Monolithics, and so on...the list is long).

Successful products led to the "genes" (or memes) propagating. 
Phenotypes and genotypes.

This same model gave us, basically, the commercial automobile and 
aviation industries.

"Moon shots," on the other hand, distort markets, suffer from a lack of 
evolutionary learning, and have almost no breakthroughs ("But what 
about Tang?").

"I am proud to announce, as your President, the goal of creating our 
national mechanical brain, a machine which will be built with one 
million relays and vacuum tubes. I am committing one billion dollars to 
this noble endeavour. We expect to have the mechanical brain operating 
by 1970." --President Dwight Eisenhower, 1958.

Really, Eugene, you need to think deeply about this issue. Ask your lab 
associate, "A. G.," about why learning and success/failure is so 
important for so many industries. Read some Hayek, some von Mises, some 
Milton Friedman. And even some David Friedman.

Ask why the U.S.S.R., which depended essentially solely on "federal 
funding," failed so completely. Hint: it wasn't just because of 
repression. It was largely because "picking winners" doesn't work, and 
command economies only know how to pick winners (they think).

Think deeply about why this list is what it is.
