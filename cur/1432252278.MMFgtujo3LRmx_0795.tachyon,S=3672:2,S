Well, if all you've got is hearsay and hot air, then I think it's unfair to 
tag them with words like "collaborator" or suggest that they're not 
trustworthy - those are pretty serious allegations to make. I'm aware of 
examples of cryptosystems and companies which were compromised by 
intelligence agencies - and also aware of baseless FUD and conspiracy 
theories spun against uncompromised software unfairly.
