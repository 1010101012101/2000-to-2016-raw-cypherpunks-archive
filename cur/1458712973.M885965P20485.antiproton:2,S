"
What cash is, is something that can not be refused because it is your
cash ie, how may I serve you today, oh you want to buy that loaf of
bread, some milk and some baloney, sure and thank you for your money,
oh wait the system says that money is shit because it's your money and
I must refuse it, if it was someone else's that is OK but the banks
have collectively decided that you can not eat today, please contact
you nearest treasury officer for assistance.

A pocket full of cash and you eat, a pocket full of credit cards and
you ask permission to eat. That is exactly how anonymous cash is, you
do not need to ask permission to fucking spend it, it can not be
rejected just because it is yours (most glaring example of exactly
that, racism) and when it comes to stealing it, it takes real effort,
rather than curruptly shifting around bits to enrich the minority at
the majorities expence in some of the biggest scandals in history.

Also, don't ever forget, that the banks what to charge you too look
after your money and pay no interest to use it for what ever they want
to. Don't like that idea, tough fucking luck, we wont let you have
that money we will only allow you to transfer it to one of our cartel
members and charge a fee for that, so that then they can charge fees
for gambling your money. The whole cashless society in capitalism
thing is one huge scam, to basically enslave the majority.
