Agreed near-unlimited-width SDR has fun potential, and for cpunks
some equally hard to identify/jam/locate encrypted comms that don't
interfere with traditional narrow comms.

There are some cheap ex-mining FPGA rigs being dumped on
the market too now that they're worthless to the majority of
their point-and-click owners.

My later unit of this same class of tech still reads UPC's, love the sounds
it makes.

No doubt in part because we forget wisdom of history in favor of
new hotness. Will be pretty sad when in 2100 we have to literally
rediscover things from scratch because they're lost. ie: "How
the fuck did they do that and their hacking tricks."
