What part of "no _factories_ producing stuff" was unclear? (Emphasis 
added. Oil is not something skilled workers produce...it is something 
that a very few produce, leaving most dependent on only what trickles 
down.)

You clearly have not visited oil wells or refineries lately. Most of 
the drilling is done by specialized drilling companies, e.g., the 
French, German, British, Dutch, and U.S. drilling companies. They hire 
a small number of locals...probably they'll be hiring far fewer for 
upcoming projects, due to security measures.

Refineries are built by the Bechtels and Parsons and their European and 
Japanese counterparts. Most are nearly fully-automated. Again, a 
comparatively tiny number of locals will be hired.
