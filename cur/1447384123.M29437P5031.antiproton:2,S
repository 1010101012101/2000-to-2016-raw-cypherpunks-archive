"Liberals," so-called, are not cardboard cutouts; they are human
beings.  Two value reasoning, the passionate belief that the
Left/Right axis describes real world politics, and judging others
accordingly makes one a helpless cripple in the political sphere.
 That's why Amerikans have been so carefully and thoroughly taught
to see and respond to the world around them through that frame of
reference.

Political attitude surveys consistently show a popular mandate for
what most would call Socialist economic policies and institutions
in the U.S.  Of course, in a Fascist State ruled by an
astronomically wealthy oligarchy, no such thing is allowed.  Hence
the novelty and extraordinary popular appeal of Bernie Sanders.  I
expect his failure to deliver will radicalize a rather large
number of people who would presently be described as Liberal.  I
know from observation that the Obama deception had that effect.

Just a cognitive bias toward well documented evidence and lessons
of personal experience, and a lifetime of studying the art and
science of propaganda.

I got hooked on propaganda when I was 11 or 12 and never lost
interest.  Propaganda is the principal formative influence on
social norms and political beliefs in the media-saturated
"developed" nations.  No one escapes the influence of propaganda,
but those who do not study propaganda will be controlled by it.
