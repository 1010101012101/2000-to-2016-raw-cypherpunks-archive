Here is what actually happens. It's called "The Radiated Electric Field".

Some 1st year engineering physics books will have it listed in the index
under 'mirror'.

The incident photons strike the mirror.

A current is induced.

That current is electrons moving in a resistor. Making heat, losing
energy. Note, we are NOT talking about photons here but J/C.

That current re-emits photons that retain both frequency and temporal/time
related coherence (see Maxwell's Equations for more detail). However, the
total number of photons MUST be reduced from the incident beam. This also
means the incident photons can not be the same as the emitted photons.

The photons (as opposed to 'a photon') lose energy.

Blipverts strike again!

In numbers,

z_o is the area of the incident beam

j_o is the surface current per unit distance

I_o is the induced current


I_o = (z_o)(j_o)

j_o = (c * E_o)/(2 * 3.14159... * k_o)

Go look those up yourself.
