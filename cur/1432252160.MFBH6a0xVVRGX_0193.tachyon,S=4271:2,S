Can the program be thrown off with masks?  If so, how about making some of 
those advertisement fans with the pictures of random people wanted for 
parking tickets on them, then walk through that end of town.  Possibly 
better yet would be fliers, balloons, and bumper stickers.  These could be 
given away to people in areas that don't particulary trust the local police 
anyway, or simply applied to cars of people who frequent areas such as the 
employee parking of the local court house.

Either could be distributed to bars.

Can the things be fooled by using black markers to add shadows where there 
should be none?  Will painted on faces become the new rage in Tampa?  I can 
just see people wearing "war paint", some to avoid the cameras, the rest 
because it's fashionable.
