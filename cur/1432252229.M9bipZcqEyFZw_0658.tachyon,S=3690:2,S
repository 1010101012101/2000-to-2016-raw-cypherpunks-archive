You said he was in the reserves. And that's what I commented on.

Below you are quoting use of the _National Guard_.

National Guard !=! Armed Forces Reserves (any of the services)

Activating reservists has a familiar name: "calling up the reserves."

And when reservists are activated, they are back in their respective 
services, e.g., the Army, the Navy, whatever. And once back in the 
Army, they are subject to the usual extensions of their duty during 
wartime.

Reservists are not the same as National Guard.

(In fact, there should be more debate about Bush having the authority 
to send the National Guard (of any state) into battle. It is supposed 
to be the Governors of states which can call up the National Guard.)
