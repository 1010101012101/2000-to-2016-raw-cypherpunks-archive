Interesting but unreported development: TheMarketPlace, aka "TMP", is now
also gone, although it haven't seen anything about it in any of the
government press releases. There is no seizure notice, it has simply
vanished.

The interesting thing here is that TMP operated over I2P rather than Tor.
There was a Tor gateway, but I believe the hidden service still operated as
a proxy inlet to the eepsite. If it has been seized as part of Operation
Onymous, this would be the first time (that I've heard about) that law
enforcement has been able to disrupt services on the I2P network.

It's also quite possible that the operators simply got skittish and bailed.
I certainly wouldn't blame them.

Anyway, if anybody has any other information about LEO activities on I2P,
I'd love to know more.

(ps - is anybody out there actually interested in any of these marketplace
updates? If not, I'll stop, I'm basically just passing along news from
various subreddits anyway.)
