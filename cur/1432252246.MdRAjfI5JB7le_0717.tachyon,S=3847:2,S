Well, redundancy is basically universal, thanks to SONET rings. In fact, 
this is why there was any traffic at all on 9/11 and why Wall Street was 
able to come back on line so quickly afterwards.

Even the big CO on West Street, which took some decent damage (and which I 
can see over my right shoulder), was rebooted very quickly thereafter (and 
true to GR-63-CORE just about all the equipment came back online correctly 
provisioned).

BUT, someone knowledgeable about Ring architectures and other things could 
fairly easily figure out how to disconnect big chunks of the network if they 
really wanted to, and in such a way to cause some real damage. In telecom it 
always surpirsed us that "terrorists" never seemed to try this.
