KARMA POLICE: GCHQ spooks spied on every web user ever
Leaked docs show how out-of-control spy agency went full Stasi on
innocent surfers

New documents revealing GCHQ's mass-surveillance activities have
detailed an operation codenamed KARMA POLICE, which slurped up the
details of "every visible user on the Internet".

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/09/25/trillions_in_surveillance_gchq/
Blighty's GCHQ stashes away 50+ billion records a day on people. Just
let that sink in

When the slide on BLACK HOLE was composed in March 2009, the flat data
store held more than 1.1 trillion things which GCHQ had collected since
August 2007.

The store weighed in at 217TB when uncompressed, the largest share of
which was HTTP data (41 per cent), which alongside web search (19 per
cent) and SMTP data (12 per cent) accounted for almost three quarters of
all that it held.
