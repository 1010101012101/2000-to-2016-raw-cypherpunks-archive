I think E. is a bit more contagious than you recognize.  It just hasn't
had the chance to play in dense pops.

Yeah but the meatbots do love to spread it, and here you again fail to
recognize Her subtlety.

Smallpox would reduce real estate prices by 1/3 at least, possibly
more in cities.  An interesting question is what decline (and what
rate of decline) west.civ. can tolerate these days.

Still, looking at the Roman Empire (aka paleo-cons) disease isn't
