The name of the prosecuting attorney is on the plea bargain 
sent to Brian, copy below.

I agree that this kind of once-okay data-mining and publishing 
will now get you Bell-jarred, CJ-jugged.

Dear Mr. West:

        This letter is sent pursuant to our conversation of yesterday.  
You indicated to me that you are currently unrepresented in this 
matter.  If that is untrue, or if you eventually obtain representation, 
please have your attorney contact me as soon as possible.

        You are incited to appear before the Grand jury on about 
September 5, 2001 to answer questions regarding your involvment 
in alleged illegal activity.  Whether or not you decided to appear 
before the grand jury is completely up to you.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible, but by no later than August 24, 2001, in 
writing, whether or not you desire to appear before the grand jury, 
and the invitation will be withdrawn.  Futhermore, it is prudent that 
all of our communications occur in writing, so please note I will 
henceforth decline to speak with you on the telephone.

        Pursuant to Department of Justice Policy, the folling advice 
of rights is provided for your information:

                                ADVICE OF RIGHTS

        1.  The grand jury for the Easter District of Oklahoma is 
conducting an investigation of possible violations of Federal 
Criminal Law innvolving a violation of Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 1030, and other violations.  You are the target 
of this investigation.

        2.  You may refuse to answer any questions if a truthful 
answer to the question would tend to incriminate you.

        3.  Anything that you do or say may be used against you 
by the Grand Jury or in subsequent legal proceeding.

        4.  If you have retained counsel, the Grand Jury will premit 
you a reasonable opportunity to step outside the Grand Jury 
room to consult with counsel if you so desire.

        Whether to retain an attorney is entirely your decission;  
however, I must emphasize that this is a serious matter.  
The advice of an attorney may be of great assistance.  If you 
do retain an attorney, please advise me of that fact soon as 
possible.

        Also the government would be willing to resolve this matter 
at this juncture if you agreed to plead guilty to one violation of 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1030.  As part of the 
agreement the government would stipulate that your sentence 
should be probation.  Please let me know, in writing, as soon
as possible, whether or not you wish to resolve this matter 
pursuant to plea agreement.

        If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call 
FBI Special Agent Gary Graff.  I believe a prompt resolution 
of this matter is in everyone's best interest.


Sincerly yours,
SHELDON J. SPERLING
United States Attorney
