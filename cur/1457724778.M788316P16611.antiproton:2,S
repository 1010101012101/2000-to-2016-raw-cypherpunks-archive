I haven't seen such a comparison, although from my reading it
appears that the Russian government may have done a better job
with their evacuation - understandable, because tsunami.

And, after first exhausting every wrong answer (Russian military
used conventional firefighting methods, greatly exacerbating the
situation), they finally listened to the engineers and stabilized
the remains of the melted reactor.  Not so the Japanese; last I
heard they have not even /located/ the fissionable material that's
still cooking merrily along.

According to a National Geographic article citing Japanese govt.
sources, groundwater from under the Fukushima complex was entering
the Pacific at a rate of 300 tons daily.  Same article said
strontium 90 was 100 times more abundant than cesium isotopes in
collected waste water stored on-site.

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/08/130807-fukush
ima-radioactive-water-leak/

Reuters article from 2012: "Small amounts of cesium-137 and
cesium-134 were detected in 15 tuna caught near San Diego in
August 2011, about four months after these chemicals were released
into the water off Japan's east coast, scientists reported on Monday
."

Strotium was not tested for, as that costs way more than looking
for cesium isotopes.  Fun fact:  Strontium 90 mimics calcium and
concentrates in food chains.  The Japan Current runs north to the
Aleutians and east to North America.  But the Pacific based
seafood industries can breathe easy:  USDA has increases allowable
levels of hot isotopes, and if you can't prove in Court that a
particular environmental source caused your cancer, nobody is
liable.

So, how much /worse/ is Fukushima than Chernobyl?  As Gully Foyle
would say, "guesses for grabs."  My guess is, in terms of long
term environmental and human health, way worse.
