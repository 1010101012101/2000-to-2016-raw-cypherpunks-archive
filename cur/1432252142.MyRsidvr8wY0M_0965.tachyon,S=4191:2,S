How strange.  It's always individuals working within a corporation who should
be culpable for offences committed as a result of its business practices.
Will this not have the effect of divorcing personal responsibility further
from the executive and employees of a company?

Furthermore, might not the `death' of a company in some cases penalise other
companies which depend on the products or services of the `offender' leading
to a reluctance to prosecute the largest and arguably the worst criminals?

At least when the responsible individuals are prosecuted, there is an
opportunity to `clean house' and reform the offending institution, as it
were.

It might be amusing to consider how many deaths Microsoft has caused.  You
know, all the strokes, heart-attacks, and anurysms resulting directly from the
frustration of having to re-install Windows after the n-th crash or virus
infection and the concomitant loss of data.

Let's have a two minute hate.  Chant "Lynch Bill Gates!" with your nearest
Party comrades when ready.

Steve
