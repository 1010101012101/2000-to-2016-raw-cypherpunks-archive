In fact not, pressure waves strong enough to aerosol liquid will also
cause cavitation, resulting in heating and destruction of material.

Ever tried pushing a bacterial suspension through a printer head
(processivity set aside)? It will clog it up in no time.

Um, why don't we quit armchair microbiology, and stick to what we can
best: produce lots of uninformed speculations?                     Oh.

I think it should be easy enough to look up relevant patents online,
assuming one is bored enough.
