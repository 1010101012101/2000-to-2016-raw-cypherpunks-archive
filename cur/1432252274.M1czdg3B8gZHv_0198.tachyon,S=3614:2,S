Chaum has a list of papers at www.chaum.com but most are not online.
One that is online describes credential systems along with related
technologies: "Security Without Identification: Transaction Systems to
Make Big Brother Obsolete",
http://www.chaum.com/articles/Security_Wthout_Identification.htm

In exchange for providing you with these pointers, you are obligated
to return the favor.  Your assignment, Marc de Piolenc, is to read and
understand this paper and to report back to cypherpunks with ideas about
how pseudonymous credentials could be used to improve airport security.
