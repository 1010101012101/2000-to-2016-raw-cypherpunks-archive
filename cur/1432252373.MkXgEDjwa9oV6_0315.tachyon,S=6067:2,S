Big problem, you've got to -prove- that there is only one of the
explorers (ie he has no twin) -and- that -only you and he are there-.

Your assumption that he is not lying is a major failing of the scientific
process - See the Magnificent Randy for more details and examples.

Responces to your specific questions below.

You can't, video is too easily manipulated. It is not strong enough for
any sort of real-world 'proof' without extensive corroborating evidence.

This is a moot point since the possibilities are endless.

In short, your entire scenario is swiss cheese.
