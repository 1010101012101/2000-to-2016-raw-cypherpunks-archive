Signal happens when good writers contribute good articles. Noise 
happens in the expected ways. Noise is what the delete key, and 
filters, were made for.

As you are apparently reading this from the "DBS" list, you are not 
seeing any of my contributions. Regrettfully, DBS (and DCSB, or 
Bearebucks, or whatever Bob is calling his list(s)) is not an "open 
system." The Cypherpunks tried such a censored list a few years ago, 
and we rejected the approach.

I wrote a large article debunking the "geodesics is about topology" 
point of view. Others have said similar things.

Please don't contribute articles to the Cypherpunks list if you are, 
as you say, not subscribed. While we don't reject articles by 
nonsubscribers, as per the above, it is tacky and rude for 
nonsubscribers to address articles to lists they are not tracking.


Thank you,
