I think driving through my house qualifies as 'probable cause' to search
his house IF there is evidence or a clear line of reasoning that it
couldn't be done alone...

                                Amendment IV

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,
and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.
