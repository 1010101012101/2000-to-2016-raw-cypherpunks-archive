Google has an austere black on white billboard ad which simply reads.

  www.{first 10-digit prime found in the consecutive digits of e}.com

People arriving solve another puzzle, and then can use the answer as a 
password for a website that greets them with the message...

         "One thing we learned while 
          building Google is that it's 
          easier to find what you're looking 
          for if it comes looking for you. 

          What we're looking for are the 
          best engineers in the world. And 
          here you are."

Cute, except it's now being discussed on the net, and you can google
the answers. :)
