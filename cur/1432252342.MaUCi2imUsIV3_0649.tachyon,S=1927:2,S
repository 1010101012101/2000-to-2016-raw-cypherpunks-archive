I saw in one of the tech email newsrags that F. Lee Bailey was at Comdex
promoting a package called Cypherus.  Their website,
http://www.apmsafe.com/, is a little light on details.  It only mentions
that Cypherus uses Blowfish with up to 448-bit keys.  There's some blather
about a "Key Manager" and self-decrypting envelopes, but nothing about
asymetrical crypto.

No evaluation version that I could find.  They claim they'll be shipping in
Dec.  Anyone heard anything at all about Cypherus?
