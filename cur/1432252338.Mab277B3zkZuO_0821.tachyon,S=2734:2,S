The Fedz can watch who you call and what
DTMF tones you press without the same
warrant they need to listen to voice.

Your cellphone location (ergo, yours) is 0wn3d by them too.

As is your cellphone-stored address book, in practice.
  
WAP encrypts data between your phone and the
basestation, at which point it is cleartext,
and may continue on as a new ssl session, 
and you trust your cell service provider
dont you?

Oh, and dont think GSL, which
stands for voice encryption for gullible
europeans, is going to help :-) 

Clearly cellphones need more low-power MIPS to do
the crypto they really should be doing.  And
the OEMs need a few uncoercable paranoids 
on their design staff.  Otherwise theyre
just deceiving customers, or even making them 
more exposed than before.
