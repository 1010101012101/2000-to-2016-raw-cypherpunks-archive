I'd be interesting in hearing whom you think are good examples.

I can think of some scientists who had enormous influences on policy, 
men like Szilard, Von Neumann, Fermi, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Teller, and 
a bunch of others just in their field. Or in fields like game theory, 
economics, biology, medicine, and so on.

But the typical "mathematician-analyst" coming out of a typical grad 
program, even a high-reputation grad program, is not going to have 
"enormous influence." A vanishingly small fraction will, in fact.

Look, while you condemn all the anonymous and pseudonymous posts here, 
we know zero about who you are, where you are, what you do, except that 
you're probably some kind of intern who surfs the Net while your 
employer for the summer is paying you do some kind of study.

Do you think you are preparing to have "enormous influence" on policy?

Do you think the superdupercomputer you say you want to assemble out of 
old machines will help you in some magical way in this goal?

I know a couple of ex-CIA "mathematician-analysts" who were deemed tops 
in their classes. One is now headed out to the Bay Area to do something 
more useful. Another I've lost track of. Neither seems to have had 
"enormous influence" on policy.
