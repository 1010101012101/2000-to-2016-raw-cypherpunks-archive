"A security consultant working with a major telecommunications carrier
told me that his client set up a top-secret high-speed circuit between
its main computer complex and Quantico, Virginia, the site of a
government-intelligence computer center. This link provided direct
access to the carrier's network corethe critical area of its system,
where all its data are stored. "What the companies are doing is worse
than turning over records," the consultant said. "They're providing
total access to all the data."


i'm on the wrong end of this gang bang...

"    The Departments of Justice, State, and Homeland Security spend
millions annually to buy commercial databases that track Americans'
finances, phone numbers, and biographical information, according to a
report last month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the
investigative arm of Congress. Often, the agencies and their
contractors don't ensure the data's accuracy, the GAO found.

    Buying commercially collected data allows the government to dodge
certain privacy rules. The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts how federal
agencies may use such information and requires disclosure of what the
government is doing with it. But the law applies only when the
government is doing the data collecting."


and sprint was sucking lucre from that SIGINT teat:  (i'm shocked, shocked! :)

'''Sprint Nextel Corp. is the latest phone company to be sued for
possibly giving call records to the government. ...

"Sprint Nextel continues to be dedicated in protecting the privacy of
our customers' communications," Gunasegaram said. "We comply fully
with lawful processes."

He declined to comment further when asked whether Sprint had been
approached by the National Security Agency or provided any customer
calling records to government officials.'''


still basking in the CHB afterglow of "fuck you. strong letter to follow":
http://www.capitolhillblue.com/content/2006/05/bushs_wants_to_jail_reporters.html
"Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says the Bush administration may
prosecute New York Times reporters who wrote about the NSA's spying on
Americans, which means Bush can break the law by ordering the spying
but he wants to prosecute reporters who caught him breaking the law."


ahhh... i need a smoke.
