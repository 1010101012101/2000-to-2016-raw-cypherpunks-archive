Resendâ€“HTML email scrubbed

Calling bullshit. Mirimirs right, this makes no sense. And JYA says netsol won't let him delete the logs but Netsol says logs are disabled by default[https://www.networksolutions.com/support/how-to-enable-download-the-web-logs/] and you have to turn them on.

So how the fuckd this really happen?

Mirimir <mirimir@riseup.net> 
Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?

I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.

But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?

I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.
