It does not. It does, however, point out the futility in the imposition of
arbitrary terrorism-prevention measures.

There is an upper bound on risk for any terrorist: that of his life.

I fail to see any truly effective measures that can be taken to prevent
determined attackers from committing acts of terrorism. The only course of
action, I believe, is to eliminate their desire to commit these attacks.

Harry Browne's essay[1] points out things we could have done to remove the
(suspected) motivation for this (and other possible) political terroristic
attacks. Tim May has made similar points.

The game changes drastically when the motive changes to an economic one.

My apologies for distracting you. I'll wait until after this is no longer
hypothetical to discuss these issues.
