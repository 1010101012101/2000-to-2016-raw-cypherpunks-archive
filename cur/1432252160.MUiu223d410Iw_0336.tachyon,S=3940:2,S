Bullshit, the 1st makes no such distinction. With respect to libel, or any
other form of speech it only says it isn't a federal issue. Note that no
stipulation is put upon the states (see 10'th).

                                 Amendment I

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
