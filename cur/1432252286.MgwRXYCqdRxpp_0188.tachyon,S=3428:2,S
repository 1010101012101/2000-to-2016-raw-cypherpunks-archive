Many people on and off this list have spent a lot more than 90 minutes
researching things, writing posts, writing code, solving math
problems, etc., etc.  Tim May in particular has written thousands of
pages of high quality or entertaining work.

Your complaints about "free research" suggest that you have the sense
that you are more valuable than or superior to other contributors.
While this is couched in civility, one could conclude that this is an
insult, something along the lines of "of course geeks should work for
free, but I'm a lawyer!"  It's a free world, but it might work better
not to insult people, even if the insult is slightly veiled.

(Your spoliation posts have been interesting.  Thank you for writing
them.)
