I hope you are not saying that you think there will always be 16 heads 
and 16 tails!

Your comment below seems to suggest you think this is so. If so, you 
need to spend a lot of time thinking about probability.

How does knowing what has already come before tell you that coin 31 is 
a tail without your having to look at it to see?

It certainly sounds to me that you have a very weird, and very wrong, 
concept of probability.
