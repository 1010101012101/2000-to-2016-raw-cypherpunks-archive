Turn 6$ into 50,000$

It's true.Read this carefully or download to read

A while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you are now, and 
came across an article similar to this 
that said you could make thousands of CASH within weeks with only an 
initial investment of 
$6.00 plus stamps! So I thought, "Yeah, right, this must be a scam!" But 
like most of us I was curious and kept 
reading. It said that if you send $1.00 to each of 
the 6 names and addresses listed in the article, you could make thousands 
in a very short period of time. You 
then place your own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6, and 
post the article to at least 300 
newsgroups. (There are about 32,000 of them out there and that's quite a 
large market pool). No catch, that was 
it. Even though the investment was a measly $6, I had three questions that 
needed to be answered before I could 
get involved in this sort of thing. 

1. IS THIS REALLY LEGAL? 
I called a lawyer first. The lawyer was a little sceptical that I would 
actually make any CASH but he said it WAS 
LEGAL if I wanted to try it. I told him it sounded a lot like a chain 
letter but the details of the system (SEE 
BELOW) actually made it a legitimate legal business. 

2. IS OK WITH THE POST OFFICE OR IS IT MAIL FRAUD? I called them: 
1-800-725-2161 and they 
confirmed THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! (See 18, h sections1302 NS 1341 of 
Postal Lottery Laws). This 
clarifies the program of collecting names and addresses for a mailing list. 

3. IS IT RIGHT? Well, everyone who sends me a buck has a good chance of 
getting A LOT of CASH ... a much 
better chance than buying a lottery ticket!!! 

So, having these questions answered, I invested EXACTLY $7.92 ... six $1.00 
bills and six 32 cent postage 
stamps ... and boy am I glad I did!!! 
Within 7 days, I started getting CASH in the mail! I was shocked! I figured 
it would end soon and didn't give it 
another thought. But the CASH continued coming in. In my first week I made 
between $20 to $30. 
By the end of the second week I had a made a total of $1,000.00. In the 
third week I had over $10,000.00 and it 
was still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of 
just over $42,000 and it's still coming 
in ..... 
It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps !!! 

Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the 
information off of it as you need it. I 
promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start 
making more CASH than you thought 
possible by doing something so easy! 

Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download 
it.) Follow the simple directions and 
watch the CASH come in! It's easy. It's legal. 
And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) 

IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; 
and it is virtually no risk - it really 
works!!!! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will 
receive extraordinary dividends. 

PLEASE NOTE: 
Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 
20 to 60 days. This program 
remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the 
participants. Please continue its success by 
carefully adhering to the instructions. 
You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your 
product is not solid and tangible, it's 
a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large 
corporations are happy to pay big 
bucks for quality lists. However, the CASH made from the mailing lists is 
secondary to the income which is made 
from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. 

Here are the 4 easy steps to success: 
STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each 
piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON 
YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of 
the 6 pieces of paper so the 
bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent 
thievery). Place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You 
should now have 6 sealed envelopes, 
each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, 
and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing 
is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a 
legitimate service and you are 
paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little 
worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I 
checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they 
confirmed that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 
envelopes to the following addresses: 



#1) J. Thomas 
36 Easterly Drive 
East Sandwich, MA 02537 

#2)Christopher L. Sloan 
2200 Hickory St. 
H.S.U. Box #14579 
Abilene, TX 79698 

#3) Kristen DeJoseph 
138 Jansen Street 
Staten Island, NY 10312 

#4) Baraquin Yannick 
10 Charlemagne 
L-1328 Luxemburg 
Luxemburg 

#5)Le Huynh Ngoc Phan
75/11 Nguyen Van Cu P1Q5
Ho Chi Minh City
Viet Nam

#6) Ngocchau Tran
9742 Hibiscus Drive
Garden Grove, Ca 92841



STEP 2: Now take the #1 off the list that you see above, move the 
other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 
becomes 4, 5 becomes 4, 4 becomces 3, 3 becomce 2, 2 becomes 1
) and add YOUR Name and address as number 6 on the list. 

STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close 
to original as possible. Now, post your 
amended article to at least 300 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 
32,000 groups) All you need is 300, but 
remember, the more you post, the more CASH you make! This is perfectly 
legal! If you have any doubts, refer to 
18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps 
for 
yourself and, whenever you need CASH, you can use it again, and again. 

PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty 
and integrity of the 
participants and by their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it 
this way. If you are a person of 
integrity, the program will continue and the CASH that so many others have 
received will come your way. 
NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on 
a computer or hard copy and keep 
the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a 
service. (Also, it might be a good idea 
to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce 
the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions 
carefully followed, 
six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer 
with one dollar each. Your name will 
move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 
position you will be receiving thousands of 
CASH in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the 
first six people listed above) Send 
it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! 

---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS 

Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own 
posting. Simply put your cursor at the 
beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this letter, 
and select 'copy' from the edit menu. 
This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. 

Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the 
blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 
'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can 
add your name to the list. 

Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your 
postings in different settings, you'll 
always have this file to go back to. 

Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various 
newsgroups (on-line forums, message 
boards, chat sites, discussions.) 

Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message 
by highlighting the text of this letter 
and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be 
the header 
that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a 
particular group, click the post message button. 
You're done with your first one! 
Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different 
newsgroups and post away, after you get 
the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! 

**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE 
MORE CASH YOU WILL MAKE!! 
BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 300** 

That's it! You will begin receiving CASH from around the world within days! 
You may eventually want to rent a 
P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to 
stay anonymous, you can invent 
a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. 
**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** 

Now the WHY part: 
Out of 300 postings, say I receive only 7 replies (a very low example). So 
then I made $7.00 with my name at #6 
on the letter. Now, each of the 7 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the 
MINIMUM 300 postings, 
each with my name at #5 and only 7 persons respond to each of the 7 
original 7, that is another $49.00 for me, 
now those 49 each make 300 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 7 
replies each, I will bring in an 
additional $343.00! Now, those 343 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 
300 with my name at #3 and 
only receive 7 replies each, I will make an additional $2401.00! OK, now 
here is the fun part, each of those 2401 
persons post a MINIMUM 300 letters with my name 
at #2 and they each only receive 7 replies, that just made me $16,807.00!!! 
Those 16807 persons will all deliver 
this message to 300 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 7 persons 
per 300 Newsgroups react I will 
receive $117,649.00! With an original investment 
of only $6.00! And some stamps. 
AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest 
posting in the newsgroups, and 
send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 
again. And start posting again. The 
thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the 
world are joining the internet and 
reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford 
$6.00 and see if it really 
works?? I think so... 
People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the 
CASH? So what! What are the 
chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new 
honest people who are joining the 
internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? 

Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of 
those joining the actual internet. 

Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. 

By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages with 
your name in the list and not sending 
the CASH to the rest of the people already on the list, you will NOT get as 
much. Someone I talked 
to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and that's 
after seven or eight weeks! Then he 
sent the 6 $1.00 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks 
he had over $10k. 
This is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the 
wealth of the world without costing 
anything but our time!!! You also may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists 
for future CASH. 
Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW! Also, try to keep a list of 
everyone that sends you CASH and 
always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing 
fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE 
BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make the CASH!! GOOD 
LUCK to all and please 
play fairly and reap the huge rewards from this, which is tons of extra 
CASH. 

Please remember to declare your extra income. Thanks once again... 

"People have asked me if this is really legal. Well, it is! You are using 
the Internet to advertise your business. 
What is that business? You are creating a mailing list of people who are 
interested in home based computer and 
online business and methods of generating income at home. Remember, people 
send 
you a small fee to be added to your mailing list. It is legal. what will 
you do with your list of thousands of names? 
That's up to you." So, build your mailing list, keep good accounts, declare 
the income and 
pay your taxes. By doing this you prove your business intentions. Keep an 
eye on the newsgroups and when the 
cash has stopped coming (that means your name is no longer on the list), 
you just take the latest posting at the 
newsgroups, send another $6.00 to the names stated on the list, make your 
corrections (put your name at #6) and 
start posting again. 

NOTES: 
*1. In some countries, the export of the country's exchange is illegal. But 
you can get the license to do this from 
the post office, explaining the above statements (that you have an online 
business, etc. You may have to pay an 
extra tax, but that's OK, the amount of the incoming CASH is HUGE! And as I 
said, a few countries have that 
restriction . 
*2. You may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future CASH. (Or 
Database or Spreadsheet software.) 
*3. If you're really not sure or still think this can't be for real, please 
print a copy of this article and give it to 
someone who really needs the CASH, and see what happens. 
*4. You will start getting responses within 1-2 weeks, it depends. 

***ALSO REMEMBER*** 
SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, 
EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT FROM THE U.S. 

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? 
$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!
