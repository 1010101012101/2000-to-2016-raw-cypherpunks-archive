Note that properly run, this "Ideas Futures" market would be a money maker,
not a cost center.  For only a modest percentage of the winnings, it could
be self sustaining.  Perhaps someone with a profit motive will pick up the
idea.

If they don't want the label of "Assasination Politics", they can forbid
bets on individual deaths, and still have nearly the full field, including
wars, revolutions, "nonstandard" attacks, and elections available for play.
(c.f. the way eBay and Yahoo limit themselves.)
