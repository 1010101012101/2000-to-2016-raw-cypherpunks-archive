Oh, general cluelessness doesn't suprise me. What suprises me is that the 
writer of the original article seemed to believe that Stego was a new 
development.

Those cops you taught...do you think they were stupid enough to assume that, 
because this was their first time hearing about Stego, that Al Qaeda was 
only starting to use it right then? (I assume the answer is 'no'...they'll 
be smart enough at least to recognize that this was something around for a 
while that they were unaware of).

NSA folks, on the other hand, I would assume have a soft version of a 
Variola Stego suitcase...able to quickly detect the presence of pretty much 
any kind of stego and then perform some tests to determine what kind was 
used. I bet they've been aware of Al Qaeda stego for a long time...that's 
probably the kind of thing they are very very good at.

In the end it probably comes down to Arabic, however, and that language has 
many built-in ways of deflecting the uninitiated. I'd bet even NSA has a 
hard time understanding an Arabic language message, even after they de-stego 
and translate it.
