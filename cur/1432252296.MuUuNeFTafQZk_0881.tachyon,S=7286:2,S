The downside of using a faraday cage with an activated phone: The phone 
will start "screaming" looking for a tower, and you'll get much reduced 
battery life. Turning phone off first and *then* putting it in the bag 
saves battery and prevents any suspected "backup battery" driven chips 
from getting a signal out..although if that's your threat-model, they 
could just record whatever telemetry they need and send later.

i.e., if a phone is suspected to be compromised and could turn on the 
core or auxiliary chips (with main or backup battery), and activate the 
microphone or camera, the faraday cage bag will prevent it from sending 
that data right away but it could be instructed to store that data 
instead and send it back later.

Personally I think removing the battery is sufficient for most phone 
models; the backup batteries are unlikely to be enough to drive the more 
concerning chips and sensors for long even if they're wired up to it in 
the first place.
