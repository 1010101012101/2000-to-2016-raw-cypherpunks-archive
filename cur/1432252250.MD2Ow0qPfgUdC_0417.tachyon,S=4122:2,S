Have you saw tools such as Maltego [1] and/or Palantir [2] to apply deep
OSINT techniques, including social network monitoring and analysis?

Those stuff are already widely used by two kind of people:
- Marketing
- Security (being private/public, democratic or non-democratic)

I am sometime curious to see this huge attention to surveillance
technologies like if it's "something new", while it always existed, it's
there publicly known on the website of surveillance producers and at
surveillance trade-expo.

There are also very nice tools [3] to handle "group of investigators"
doing infiltration in social network using multiple identities, quite
nice tools i've evaluated in past.
