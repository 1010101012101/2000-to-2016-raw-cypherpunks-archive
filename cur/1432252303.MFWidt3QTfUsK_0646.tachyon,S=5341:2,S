I suspect there may be some positive correlation between brilliant minds and
consideration of human rights & ability to think independently and
critically including in the area of uncritical acceptance authoritarian
dictates.  We're not talking about random grunt - we're talking about gifted
end of PhD mathematicians or equivalent to be much use to NSA for
surrepticiously cracking or backdooring ciphers in the face of public
analysis.  (Well the DRBG one was pretty ham-fisted, but maybe they have
some better ones we hvent found yet, or at least tried).

Take a look eg at this washington monthly article, there is a history of top
US universities having to divest themselves of direct involvment with
classified research due to protestations of their academic staff about the
ethical considerations.

Psychopaths are a minority, and people on the top end of crypto/maths skills
are sought after enough to easily move jobs even in a down market - so the
"must collect pay-check" argument seems unlikely.  So I stand by my argument
that they probably scored an own goal on the retention and motivation
front. I think for the majority of people - they wont like to go to
work, or will
feel demotivated, feeling the world is sneering at their employer as a
quasi-criminal org.
