I want everyone here to stop and consider for a second what happened
yesterday in Missouri.

First, the primary had the highest voter turnout since the state began
keeping records.  Put another way, at least one group "got the vote out".

Second: the hate amendment didn't just pass, it passed by a better than 2
to 1 majority, out of a million and a half votes cast.

Third: Those votes were evenly distributed across both city and state
lines.  Put another way, even the city of st. louis voted for this
atrocity.

Fourth: No group saw this coming.  Both sides thought the amendment would
be a very close vote.  I think we all believed it would pass, but by only
the slightest of a hair.  This is an important detail - it shows that one
of two things happened yesterday.  Either there really is no support for
treating humans evenly and without discrimination, or the side that has
their shit together isn't getting the vote out.  I'd like to think that
the 57% who didn't bother yesterday were the majority that could have
forced some kind of sanity onto the face of Missouri, but I just don't
know.

Fifth: If that 57% *is* the group that believes in doing the right thing,
then we had better find a way to get them out the fucking door on Nov 2nd,
or we are going to be in some very serious shit over the next four years.
You've seen what that little midget fuck is like when he hasn't even won
an election, can you imagine how he's going to behave if he thinks he's
got some kind of *mandate*?  Picture an entire government populated by
clones of Travis and Becker.  Not a pretty sight.

Missouri is one of the most hotly contested states right now.  It is one
of the states that could literally decide the election.  If you don't
believe that what happened yesterday is a preview of things to come on Nov
2nd, then you are *blind*.

This amendment vote must act as a wake-up call - the fascists are really
at the gates.  And they are organized, and getting their voters to the
polls.  If we can't find a way to get the other side out, in force, and
right *now*, this country could really look like 1939 Germany in four
years.  Whole sections of the population are being turned on others, just
for the sake of divide and conquer, and there is only one way to put a
stop to this (short of taking up a collection to pay for a shooter for
Bush's first legitimate oath of office) - we need to get people out to the
polls in 90 days.

This country is on the edge of a disastrous precipice.  Get your family
out there.  Get your friends.  Knock on doors and offer to drive the
people in your neighborhoods, but *do something*!  We cannot allow the
apathy to get in the way this time - this is too serious.
