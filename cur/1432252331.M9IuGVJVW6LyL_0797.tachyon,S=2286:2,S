I think this pretty much nails it. Actually, I was imagining that there was 
still enough relationship left between PRC and NK for the Chinese to say, 
"Uh, a nuclear test would not be a good idea", meaning (in Chinese speak), 
"No way you're gonna do that". I'm sure the Chinese at this point regard 
their relationship with NK as baggage, though I know the Chinese do 
re-patriate NK refugees, so they're at least maintaining pretenses.
