Spending three hours screwing around on her laptop?

Printing out a coupon for ice cream?

That's just fascinating, Choate.

Only no one has accused Condit of personally
making Levy disappear.

No one.

Notes from Italy: the person who shot the
protester was not a regular cop.

He was a 20-year-old doing "national service".

#    IBM Develops Annoying "Passenger" to Keep Drivers Alert
#    
#    DETROIT - You're driving along and suddenly a voice starts 
#    shouting personal questions at you:
#    
#    "Where did you go on your first date? What's your favorite song? 
#    What's your mother's maiden name? Where'd you go to school? What's 
#    your favorite food? Who won the ball game?"
#    
#    If you don't answer quickly enough, correctly or at all, then 
#    the fun really begins. Windows start opening and closing, a buzzer 
#    might sound and worse, you might get spritzed with a stream of 
#    cold water.
#    
#    It's a cross between Stephen King's maniacal car Christine and 
#    the yapping disembodied voice of Ann Sothern in the never-lamented 
#    TV show "My Mother the Car."
#    
#    Indeed, IBM's "artificial passenger" is designed to be as annoying 
#    as possible all in the name of safety, says David Nahamoo, IBM 
#    senior manager for human language technology.
#    
#    "Essentially, the technology and the system relies on 
#    conversational interaction as a mechanism for keeping a person 
#    alert," says Nahamoo.

But can you hump it?
