I'd pretty much dropped this topic after it became clear that Mr. Leichter's
only response to the problems that people pointed out in VoteHere's
scheme (in particular, its vulnerability to vote coercion, and lack of
recountability) was to attempt to redefine them as non-problems. 
However, since the topic has arisen again.....

Ed's got a very good point. I always prefer security which relies for
its integrity on the laws of nature, rather than on people behaving
with integrity.
