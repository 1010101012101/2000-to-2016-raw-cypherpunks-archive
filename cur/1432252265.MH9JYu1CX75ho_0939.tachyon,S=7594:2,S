Anyon is free to post, even people from Italy. That there are very 
few subscribers from Italy, or Botswana, or Gondwanaland, is just the 
way it is.

"Bragging about what illegal I did" is in the context of civil 
liberties and the ground truth of cypherspace. If you don't "get it," 
it's probably best that you follow through on your promise to leave. 
Auf wiedersehen! Ciao!

And just which articles have _you_ contributed?

First, Italy has no corpus of laws about/against crypto for the 
simple reason that Italy has a weak Internet culture. Weaker than 
France, which is saying a lot. When you wake up some day and find 
that the Protection of the Constitution Law has been passed by your 
parliament, don't come to us and say "But I had no idea this was 
coming."

Second, beware variants of the bogus "virtual one-time pad." Using 
keying material to encipher plaintext is an idea as old as the hills, 
even the hills of Rome.

Cf. basic textbooks on crypto for why this is not a good solution. 
Read especially the parts on key distribution, on flaws arising from 
re-use of key material (cf. the Walker case), etc. Read also the 
mid-70s papers on why public key systems have such compelling 
advantages.

I know this 25-year-old material must be boring to an enlightened 
Italian such as yourself, but you may find it useful to see why we 
backward Americans adopted public key systems over ""trivial XOR 
algorithms."

For a very good reason: no state may compel a person to communicate 
only in certain forms acceptable to the state.

If you don't get this point either, it's probably hopeless. Maybe you 
can find a copy of "1984" for starters.


Meanwhile, claiming that the list is not what you would like it to be 
is, especially when you have not contributed anything, is...typical.
