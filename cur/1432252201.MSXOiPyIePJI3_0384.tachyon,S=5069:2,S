Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm sure you all will :), but wouldn't you also
have to possibly go through this exercise with the TPME key and sending
your system to the manufacturer when you wanted to, say, upgrade your
operating system or switch to a completely different OS? That will go
over like a lead balloon. (Gee... must be getting late. I almost wrote
"like a bag of dirt". Duh! Can't even remember cliches at my age.)
