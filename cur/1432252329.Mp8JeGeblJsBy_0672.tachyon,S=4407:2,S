China modernising Pak infrastructure
PTI [ THURSDAY, AUGUST 01, 2002 11:40:28 AM ]
BEIJING: As part of Beijing's efforts to supplement its strong political 
and military ties with Islamabad, China is actively helping develop 
Pakistan's key infrastructure sectors like roads, ports and railways.
The leadership of the two countries during their recent meetings has 
decided to establish a "comprehensive partnership" in all fields of mutual 
interest, particularly in the economic field, official sources said. I just 
spewed coffee out of my nose.
