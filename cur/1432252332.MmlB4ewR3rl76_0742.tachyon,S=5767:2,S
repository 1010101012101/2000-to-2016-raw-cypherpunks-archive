I think most of us will agree to that.

But you are choosing favorites: You're asserting certain ideas about
society and how it ought be structured, and asserting that a system
should do certain things.  Some de-contextualized quotes are below.

Why do countries get to impose their laws on my data?  Which countries
get to do so?  And are you still in France? ;)

This doesn't work, since, as Ross Anderson points out, the knowledge
that you're HIV positive is owned by lots of different people at
different times, and once one of them reads it on screen, they can
reproduce it, irrevocably, outside the policy which you've tried to
impose.

So, you've made some choices about how the system can be used; you've
chosen ways to protect privacy which reflect your view of how privacy
should be protected.  Similarly copyright.  Thats your right, however,
I, and many others are deeply concerned that those choices are going
to get embedded and imposed on the rest of us.  Hey, you know what?
They may even be good choices.  But I don't care.   Fundamentally,
they restrict my freedom to do dumb things, to be unreasonable, to
dissent.

And that worries the hell out of me.

Adam
