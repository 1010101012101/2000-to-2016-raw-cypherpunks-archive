No, it vindicates the vaccination approach, the antigen-antibody 
approach.

Or, more pedestrianly, simple learning. Those who learn to filter do 
so. Others drown.

A central tenet of homeopathy is the bizarre and acausal notion that 
dilution of the agent by 100x, by 1000x, even by one billion times, 
makes no difference. "If there is just one atom of arsenic, maybe just 
one quarter of an atom, in this liquid, your body will learn to later 
tolerate arsenic!"
