   An anonymous reader writes "Yahoo! News is reporting that law
   enforcement officials have launched a new form of drone aircraft to
   [1]patrol the skies above Los Angeles. From the article: 'Police say
   the drone, called the SkySeer, will be able to accomplish tasks too
   dangerous for officers and free up helicopters for other missions.
   "This technology could be used to find missing children, search for
   lost hikers, or survey a fire zone," said Commander Sid Heal, head of
   the Technology Exploration Project of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
   Department. "The ideal outcome for us is when this technology becomes
   instrumental in saving lives."'"
