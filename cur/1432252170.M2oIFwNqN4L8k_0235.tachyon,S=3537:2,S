The notion of licensing programmers as competent in some field
has come up before, e.g., in safety-critical systems.  The idea
being that when you're sued because your radiation therapy machine 
fried a few people, you (the manufacturer) can show 'due diligance'
aka best practices.

Using DES, then 3DES, then AES is the same
cover-your-ass protection.

Of course, a firm is still responsible for its bridges that
fail, even if it used state-licensed engineers and reviewers
and followed standard practices.  But the penaltie$ are less if you snag
engineers qualified to work in the domain.

.....

I believe in Texas or some other state you can't call yourself
an engineer since that is a legal term.
