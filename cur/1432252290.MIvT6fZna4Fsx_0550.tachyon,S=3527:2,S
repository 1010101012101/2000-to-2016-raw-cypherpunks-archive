Mr Godsell rejected criticism that AngloGold's proposal to form a global 
co-operation pact with Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold was not clear. No 
formal deal has been signed, but the miners propose to extract synergies 
from neighbouring assets, starting in Australia and Africa.
In particular, AngloGold plans to sell Barrick sole management rights at 
the Kalgoorlie Super Pit (owned by Normandy and Barrick), and offer a stake 
in the 15 million ounce Boddington project south of Perth, should its bid 
succeed.
"In my view (the proposal) is very clear," Mr Godsell said.
Many analysts believe the proposal could be a prelude to a formal alliance 
between the two groups, an outcome Mr Godsell refused to rule out: "Could 
this lead to greater things? Well perhaps. The agreements are pretty clear 
and are ... quite meaningful."
Why is a Canadian company's successful libel suit against a British 
newspaper a possible threat to your ability to get uncensored news on the 
internet? The story of reporter Greg Palast and the Bush family-linked 
Barrick Mining Corporation will make that clear. We'll hear from Greg 
Palast, who writes for the UK-based Observer.
