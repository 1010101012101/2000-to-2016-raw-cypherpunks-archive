Sealand is an independent principality with no treaties related to
rocketry with any of them. What are they going to do, attack an
independent nation because a hobbyist fired off an amateur rocket?

Yep, that's how WWIII will start, you bet. Hell, by the time the radar
op's figure out what's going on you're so high you're off their scopes.
Just exactly how long do you think it takes to get to orbit at 50G's?
We're not flying a fucking school bus like the shuttle with 3-4G limits.
This is balls to the wall Isp.
