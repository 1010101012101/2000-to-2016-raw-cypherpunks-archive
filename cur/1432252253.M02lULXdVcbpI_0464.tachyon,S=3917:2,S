		Here are two excerpts from a 180-page how-to manual that
                 investigators believe has been used by followers of
Saudi
                 terrorist Osama bin Laden. The document, "Military
Studies
                 in the Jihad Against the Tyrants," was seized last year
at
                 the Manchester, England home of a bin Laden disciple.
                 Federal prosecutors in New York recently introduced the
                 18-chapter manual, written in Arabic, at the trial of
four
                 men accused of involvement in the 1998 bombing of U.S.
                 embassies in Kenya and Tanzania (an English translation
was
                 also placed in evidence). The terrorism manual offers
jihad
                 members detailed pointers on everything from forged
                 documents to kidnapping techniques. TSG may soon post
the
                 whole incredible document, but until then, you'll have
to
                 get by with these bizarre and scary pieces--all of
Chapter
                 16 (assassinations) and part of Chapter 17
("Interrogation
                 and Investigation"): 

                 Pages 1-8: On death and dying. 

                 Pages 9-14: Beat it.
