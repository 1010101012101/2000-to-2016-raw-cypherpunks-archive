Though routinely professing otherwise, evidently Anonymous knows nothing
of the spirit of the TCPA: I proposed the use of blinding schemes to the
TCPA as far back as 2 years ago as a substitute to the Privacy CAs
schemes which are subject to potential collusion. I believe
"unreceptive", rather than "very much open to this suggestion" would
more accurately describe the TCPA's spirit Anonymous holds so high.
