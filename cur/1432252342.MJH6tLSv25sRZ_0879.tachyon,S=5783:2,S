Huh?
Seems to me we have much more than that.

NSA may be able to tap optical cables without AT&T knowing (or with them 
looking the other way), but in general that's not the way they're going to 
eavesdrop. The only way they can cost-effectively get the access they need 
is in the electronic domain, and there's little doubt in my mind that they 
merely asked for certain traffic to be dropped-and-continued onto NSA 
gathering points.

Why?
For one, there's just no way they'd be able to deploy a duplicate optical 
network that backhauls all of the relevant traffic to NSA facilities.

They can't even secretively grab individual DS0s and backhaul them without 
cooperation. Optical span + EDFA noise budgets will first of all prohibit 
this (ie, it ain't good if your tap brings down an AT&T cross-country 
OC-192: 3 dB matters to optical amplifiers). Second, to have ready access to 
any DS0 in the country is impossible without help. Consider even a single 
128 wavelength optical cable carrying OC-192 on each lambda: they'll need a 
tap, a 128 (optically amplified) DEMUX, an OC-192 SONET terminal for EACH 
wavelength and some way to grab individual DS0s (or maybe they just take the 
DS1). And THEN they have to backhaul that somehow.

And that's just one cable.

It's just physically impossible for them to grab everything and backhaul, of 
that I am convinced. My assumption is that EFF folks in the know already 
know this. They might have even just picked AT&T nearly randomly...any of 
the big long haul carriers will have had to collude, and probably didn't 
even seriously consider not colluding.
