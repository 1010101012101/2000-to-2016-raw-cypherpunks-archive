Your economics is entirely sound, but I disagree with 
you on one minor question of fact.  I doubt the yuan is 
cheaper than it should be.  Seems to me that the 
fundamental reason why chinese are working cheap and 
providing us with their excellent goods in exchange for 
our rather dubious and shaky dollars so abundantly
printed by the Bush administration, is that the chinese
banking system is even more dubious and shaky. Chinese
prefer to stash their wealth in America, rather than in
China.
