No, you asked for an explanation. The book is an excellent one. Just
another example of you wanting somebody else to do it for you.

I never speak for others, that's their job.

Irrelevant.

For all we know you can't read. You might be having somebody else read and
write this text that supposedly comes from you. Not my problem or of any
interest to me really.

By the way your commentary is a ad hominim attack and tends to weaken your
argument.

Your commentary.

>  If you don't, your argument falls with it's own dead weight

If I don't what, explain my self? I did, I suggest that you read "We". My
argument at no point requires 'We' and I've explained my views much better
than you have.

> - one beauty of free speech: ideas without merit fall,

That's a laughable one. How come religions like Christianity still hang
around then? Peoples belief that gay marriage is a sin and will cause the
collapse of western civilization? Or that government is 'good'?

> good ideas are carried as far as they're worth.

Not hardly. If that were so then this discussion would have been resolved
200 years ago. It isn't, and it won't be 200 (or 2,000 for that matter)
years from now. Your thesis is bogus.

Right to speak and press. People have a right to speak their mind and they
have a right to use a press to spread it around.

You better talk to a lawyer and do some deeper thinking. People have a
right to contact you, you have the right to tell them to go away. You
don't have the right to be hermit.

Your views of 'individualism' are the exact sort that Hayek and others
warn against.

Individualism and Economic Order
F.A. Hayek
ISBN 0-226-32093-6

In particular the very first section, "Individualims: True or False".

That is correct, YOU are responsible for it. And even that is a perfect
defence since there is still a public access to your property where it
meets public property, an easment (ie the place where a sidewalk goes). In
most cities it ranges from 3 to 4 ft. from the curb. That property is managed
under imminent domain concepts even though you are responsible for its
upkeep and such.

I have no problem with a 'private right', sue in civil court till the cows
come home. That's not what you're talking about or promoting.

You're talking about of both sides of your face.
