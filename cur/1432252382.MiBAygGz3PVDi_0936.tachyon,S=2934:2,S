If no one has already done this, the humor value in publishing a public
key
under names like OBL would certainly collect some interesting messages.

It would also demonstrate something about the (lack of) value of
a claimed (but personally unverified) association of a Real Meat Person
and a key.
(A good prankster would of course create other IDs which would
vouch for OBLs.. much like when a CIA agent gives out a number which
will
vouch for his employment in a benign industry..)
