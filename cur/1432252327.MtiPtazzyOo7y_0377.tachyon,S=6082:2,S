Tough to do NAA on a living person. Likewise for getting a sample from 
the inside of someone for mass spec.

All of these scanning technologies are ultra-expensive. Even for 
hospitals, where such scans routinely cost thousands of dollars. While a 
security scan may be faster (less analysis by doctors...), and while 
there may be economies of scale (as the number of scans jumps from 
hospital-type numbers to airline-travel-type numbers), the math is 
clear: deploying an arsenal of NMR scans, x-ray body scans (lawsuit 
issues, too), etc. will not be economically feasible. People will stop 
traveling by air unless absolutely necessary, which will accomplish  the 
effect the terrorists sought.

There are dozens of explanations on the Web. I can't imagine anyone 
knowledgeable will write such an article for you, though I could be 
wrong. For one thing, time. For another, relevance, as we are not 
scannerpunks.

Speaking of the U.S. having "won" the opportunity to become an empire, 
why not think about alternatives?

I can imagine that a North American continent operating as roughly 5-15 
regional states, each trading freely with each other, with none of them 
sending gunboats to far off shores and none of them sending taxpayer 
monies to prop up dictatorships and satrapies would be an improvement. 
My own state, California, is already the sixth largest economy in the 
world. (Before someone jumps in with a claim that the only reason 
California thrives and can trade with China and Japan and Mexico and so 
on is because the U.S. government intervened in past European and Asian 
war and now sends $5 billion a year to prop up Israel, I don't believe 
it. We can debate one specific war, WW II, as a separate issue. Even 
that war could have been fought from this side of the oceans with 5-15 
regional states, if necessary.)

Empire is not necessary. Empire brings on precisely the foreign 
engagements that Washington warned us to avoid. Empire  brings on "peace 
keeping troops" in far-away lands...and attacks like 911. Empire will 
eventually get us nuked.
