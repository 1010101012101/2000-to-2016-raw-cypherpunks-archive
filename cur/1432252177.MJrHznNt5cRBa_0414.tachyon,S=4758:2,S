These seem to be actual chips. Anyone know of companies selling Crypto apps 
for Network processors? If so, which is deemed more secure by 
Cypherpunks...software apps on network processors or outboard chips? (Am I 
correct in assuming that a crypto app on a network processor is not any 
easier to view or examine that a crypto ASIC?)

Motorola Locks Down Chips

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motorola Inc. (NYSE: MOT - message board) has become the latest vendor to 
integrate security into its microprocessors, continuing the trend of putting 
encryption acceleration on-chip.

The company announced eight new varieties of its PowerQuicc processors 
today, grouped under the family names MPC885 and MPC8272. Four of the eight 
include security. Specifically, Motorola is enhancing some of its PowerQuicc 
chips with the encryption functions found in its S1 line of security 
co-processors, which the company introduced in 2000. (see Motorola 
Processors Integrate Security ).

The idea is to speed up security processing. Encryption involves doing math 
with unusually large numbers, a task that can bog down a general-purpose 
processor. So, several companies, including Cavium Networks Inc., Corrent 
Corp., and Hifn Inc. (Nasdaq: HIFN - message board), have developed 
specialty hardware for the task. These chips are often called co-processors, 
as they're meant to sit alongside a microprocessor.

Naturally, processor companies believe they can further speed things up -- 
and save OEMs a bit of money -- by merging the co-processors into their own 
chips. Broadcom Corp. (Nasdaq: BRCM - message board), Integrated Device 
Technology Inc. (IDT) (Nasdaq: IDTI - message board), and PMC-Sierra Inc. 
(Nasdaq: PMCS - message board) are adding security to their microprocessors; 
and Agere Systems Inc. (NYSE: AGR.A) and Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC - message 
board) have done the same with some of their network processors (see Vendors 
Add Security to MIPS Chips and Intel Moves on Security ).

PowerQuicc tends toward a lower-end market than those processors, however. 
The product line, consisting of a few dozen chips, spans applications from 
access modems to edge-network equipment.

In addition to the usual speed and cost arguments, Motorola is hoping to 
gain an edge from its greater experience with ATM and Ethernet. "We can 
attack kind of the next-generation security processors," says Matthew Short, 
head of security applications for Motorola's networking and computing 
systems group.

The integration trend doesn't necessarily mean the end of co-processors. 
Motorola and Broadcom plan to continue selling their co-processors. And 
Short notes that chips such as Corrent's will continue to serve high-end 
applications, where integration becomes too cumbersome.

"Corrent's kind of a different beast. It's pretty high-end. We even 
recommend them to go with C-Port," he says, referring to Motorola's line of 
network processors.

The new PowerQuicc chips are due to begin sampling next month, with volume 
production slated for the second quarter of 2004.
