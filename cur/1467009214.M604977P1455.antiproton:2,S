Yes, it's not so easy. And even with help from their national
government, it would take a while. And even VPNs that log can't retain
logs forever, so you might get lucky.

True. But ISPs normally aren't a treat. It's who's pushing their
buttons. Whether it's the MPAA or Los Zetas.

Yes. But there are many mid-size adversaries. And you could also say
that Tor works against all but the global adversaries. Plus clever ones
that can exploit bugs.

True. But not me.

I have no clue what percentage of Tor code has been funded by the US
government. There are lots of volunteers, after all.

But I agree that Tor has rather dominated the space for "anonymity
systems". Every few years, I see a paper about something new, but they
never seem to go anywhere. So yes, there is a problem. But I don't think
that state subsidy is directly at fault.

Interesting. But I still don't like I2P, because decent performance
depends on being a relay, with a public IP address and open port. One
can do it with VPNs and port forwarding. But still.

I get that. And I suspect that you're in a friendlier environment.

Many Tor users have been screwed by thinking that they were "anonymous".
But still, many more would have been screwed if they had done whatever
they were doing without any protection. Maybe some of them, such as the
ones pwned by CMU, would have been better off using VPNs. That's rather
ironic, considering how much abuse Tor supporters have heaped on VPNs.
But overall, I think that Tor has done much good.
