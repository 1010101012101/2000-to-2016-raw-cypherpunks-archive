You would still be in violation of the law.

Censorship by copyight is not new.  It has been going on for quite a
while.  (Everything from the Scientologists trying to prevent leaks of
their pay-per-view religion to companies that produced films hyping
products that turned out to be a danger to the general public. (Like the
paint company that was pushing a paint mixed with DDT in incredibly high
doses.))

I expect to see alot more copyright censorship in the coming years.  In
fact, I expect that with the direction the feds are taking, all forms of
censorship will have copyright violations attached for extra jail time
added.
