I've rebuilt the archives, adding the To: and Cc: headers and
(finally!) disabling the rudimentary obscuring of email addresses that
had previously been enabled.

I was surprised to learn that (at least in the version I'm running)
Mailman has no options for retaining extra headers in the text
archives. Fortunately, adding it wasn't too annoying.

Please let me know if I've unwittingly broken anything, and thank you,
grarpamp, for suggesting the various improvements to the archive.
