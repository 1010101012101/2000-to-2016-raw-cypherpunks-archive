This is old news to followers of the New World Order, the Blue 
Helmets, and the Zionist Occupation Government.

Barry S. is reacting quickly to the changing ground truth of the 
election: the civil liberties groups used to avoid such implications 
of the NWO, but now that Republicans are about to take over, the ACLU 
will likely soon be talking about black helicopters and re-education 
camps being built to house the political prisoners.

I wonder who the Tim McVeigh of the Left will be?
