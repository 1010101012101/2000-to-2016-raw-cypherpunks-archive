Maybe you're suggestion was too far afield from their ambitions for 
LimeWire.  Maybe they thought you were a jerk.  Maybe...  In any case Lime 
is getting great reviews from friends regarding easy of learning, use and

It seems that if a few of the technically competent want to raise this 
issue with them perhaps we should discuss this a bit to see if we can reach 
something of a consensus and then have on of the coders make contact with
