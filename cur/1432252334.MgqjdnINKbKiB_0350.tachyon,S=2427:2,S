Is it true Bush wears a Kevlar vest when he parades to
and from his chopper for photo ops? All the time he
is in public? Is there a lighter more effective material
than Kevlar, for a sleeping bag on AF1? What protection 
could possibly be effective during the CN trip what with 
all the dumb-tech guided missles going berzerk lately?
