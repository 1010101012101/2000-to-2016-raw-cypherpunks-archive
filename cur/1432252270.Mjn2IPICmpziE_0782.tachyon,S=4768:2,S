No doubt, but I think it's dangerous and entirely to your disadvantage to 
dismiss everyone doing government work in computer security as a donut-
chomping incompetent Barney-Fife-clone imbecile. 

Anyone can laugh at the department heads on C-SPAN, but did you ever stop 
to think about who's really doing the hardcore research for the NSA at Ft. 
Meade--and elsewhere? And did you ever think that they may have decided 
it's in their best interest to let otherwise informed and intelligent 
people like you laugh them off as third-rate and underfunded? Think about 
it.

Not everyone who wrote assessments for CIA got them past the politicized 
review of deputy director Gates. As you may know, the whole culture in the 
80s was characterized by a deep rift between two warring factions who 
literally referred to each other as "knuckledraggers" and "commie symps." 
If the symps had the upper hand instead of the knuckledraggers under Casey, 
there's not a doubt in my mind you would have seen an entirely different 
kind of intelligence product. 

The same old resentments are still there: just yesterday I heard Michael 
Pillsbury, a former defense policy planner in the Reagan administration, 
repeatedly refer to analysts who disagreed with him as "panda huggers" 
during the course of his testimony before the Senate. The hardliners he 
called "blue team". (Gee, I wonder which side he was on!) I guess "panda 
huggers" is a little better than "commie symps" but it sure says a lot 
about the intellectual climate. It won't come as a surprise when we start 
seeing the same kind of analytic mistakes again because of it...

I'm sure the senior scientists at Ft. Meade couldn't be more delighted to 
hear you say that.
