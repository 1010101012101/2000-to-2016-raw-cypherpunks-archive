FBI investigating incidents on subdomains hosted by flag.blackened.net.

OK folks, here's the real deal as far as I can share it legally at the
moment. Consider it as a press release if you wish and feel free to
distribute it for whatever reason you deem necessary.

I'm under court order not to speak about specifics and have my attorney
trying to find out what the maximum penalty for disclosure really is. I hate
to have to keep my mouth shut in areas where the Gestapo is involved, but I
also have to weigh things against the overall security of flag and it's
subdomains and also the wellbeing of my family.

I have been ordered to submit IP info on two separate incidents having to do
with subdomains hosted on flag. Both of these are in regard to claimed or
threatened responsibility for acts of propaganda by the deed. Both incidents
involve topics which are completely out of line for consideration here at
flag and really I can only view them in two ways. Either people are simply
ignorant about the murderous history of the FBI, or, as is my belief in one
case, they are trying to make flag vulnerable to government intrusion.

At this point let me say, in all honesty and conviction, that if I end up
dead by strange means - suicide, overdose, drunk driving accident (I never,
ever, ever drink and drive), "accidental" gunshot to the back of the head
while sleeping ala Fred Hampton, car jacking, or anything else reasonably
suspicious, contact the FBI in Chico, California for more details.

I have called numerous friends nationwide, anarchists and otherwise whose
opinions I respect and who I know will be honest and forthwith in their
opinions to ask them how I should proceed. The unanimous consensus is that I
comply with the wishes of the FBI and provide the IP addresses responsible.
The only point of discussion, really, has been whether or not I should reveal
the specific information in violation of two court orders.

Really, I am not left with much of a choice. Here are my two choices as I see
them:

1. Do not comply with the wishes of the FBI. This will most likely lead to
the seizure of flag and a compromise of all the sites and information online.
It will probably also lead to me being imprisoned, I would guess. I
personally do not fear this, but I am the sole support for my wife and infant
daughter. There can be no doubt we would probably lose our home as a result.

2. Comply with the wishes of the FBI, provide the IP addresses, and count on
the fact that I will catch a lot of heat and hatred from my comrades in the
anarchist movement worldwide.

Though it pains me to comply with the State in any manner, I have to choose
option #2. The people who have foolishly compromised us all will shoulder the
burden for their selfish actions. Frankly folks, they know better - we all
know better.

I was first contacted by the Oakland FBI. Many of you know their history. We
are talking COINTELPRO for real - not a perceived or mythical fear. They are
proven murderers and automatons for the state who will blindly follow any
order to kill or disrupt without question. Read the history of their
disinformation campaign against the panthers if you don't believe me. The
panther comic book which they completed and distributed, the fake letters
between Huey and Eldridge, the fires of hatred and murder they faked and
inflamed between the panthers and the US or "united slaves" which led to the
murder of Bunchy Carter and John Higgins in L.A., the list goes on and on.

But, the real point is that I feel like a coward and traitor to my comrades,
even in the face of what is essentially a coerced decision. I'm the last one
who will criticize or disagree with any of you who want to deride me. I'm
also aware that this will probably cause quite a few of you to lose faith in
me, flag, and it's subdomains. This can't be avoided and it's something I
weighed into my decision. I post this mainly to inform you all and give you
opportunity to make your own decisions as to whether I've handled this
correctly and whether you wish to use flag or it's subdomains in the future.
If you don't trust me, I understand, believe me.

It is by far the most agonizing decision I've been faced with in relation to
my anarchist opinions.

This is why we do not discuss certain things as if they are a legitimate part
of anarchism. Resist the extra y-chromosome influenced urge to sound more
hardcore than the guy next to you. Nobody is impressed and the powers that be
are sitting on the edges of their seats waiting for an excuse to shut down
flag. Freedom of speech does not exist, don't try to test it. They will come
bust down your door - for real - point a gun to your head and pull the
trigger if you refuse to comply.

Believe it.

Your admin,

Dave
