>From  http://www.bitzi.com/developer/code :

"Bitprint Definition

Our distinctive bitprint is actually a combination of several nonproprietary
cryptographic hash values.

We take both the SHA1 hash of a file, and the "TigerTree" hash of a file.
TigerTree is based on the Tiger hash algorithm, applied to each 1024-byte block
of a file, then combined up through a binary hash tree to a final summary
value.

Such a composited hash tree value allows compact proofs that file fragments
combine to form the full file - a useful quality for verifying or resuming
downloads-in-progress from unreliable peers, among other applications. "
