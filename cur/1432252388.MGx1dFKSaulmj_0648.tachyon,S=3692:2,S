I don't think there are any difficult legal issues involved.  If you drop your
wallet on someone's property, it is still your wallet.  If you crash your car onto
somebody's front yard, it's still your car (for better or worse).  If a plane
crashes carrying U.S. mail, the Post Office gathers up whatever mail it can find and
tries to deliver it.  Would you have it any other way?

Even if ownership was in question, does anybody really think it's a good idea to
sell the pieces of evidence while the accident investigation is going on?
