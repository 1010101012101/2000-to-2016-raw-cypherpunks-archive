Hi everyone,

I'm working on the Movim project since 2008, our aim is to create a=20
full social network on top of the XMPP protocol. As I see again, the=20
guys of the Tox project are trying to reinvent the wheel=E2=80=A6 again. No=
w,=20
to do IM, we have Skype, BBM, Line, WhatsApp, MSN, QQ, AIM, ICQ, IRC,=20
XMPP, Facebook Messenger=E2=80=A6

Same for the social networks as Davis said (PumpIO, TentIO=E2=80=A6)

I really think that we need to focus on an existent standard and=20
improve it, and for me XMPP seem to be the perfect protocol for all=20
theses things :
- Standard IM + chatroom
- Video/Audio conferencing (with Jingle, we are using it with WebRTC on=20
Movim)
- Pubsub (for newsfeeds, blogging)
- Geolocation
- Vcard4 support
- SASL2 authentication
- OTR support
- Full encryption between the servers (https://xmpp.net/list.php)
- and so on=E2=80=A6

XMPP can do a lot more than just IM, it's a full social-communication=20
protocol it just need to be implemented, tested and debugged :)
