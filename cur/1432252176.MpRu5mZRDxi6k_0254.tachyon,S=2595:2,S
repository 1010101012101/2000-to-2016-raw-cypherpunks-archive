A few months ago, it was revealed that the FBI broke into some
mafiosos house and installed some keysniffing software on his
computer, because he was using PGP.  Apparently the software was very
hlpeful to the prosecution in the trial.

Does anyone have any more technical info about this?  How did they
physically get in?  What kind of software did they use?  How do they
get the data which the software collects?

Curious.  Thanks
