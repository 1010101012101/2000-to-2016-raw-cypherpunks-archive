You say that like it's a bad thing.  The real world, that is.  Most people
find that the real world isn't all bad, and get on with their lives.

Oh, it's even simpler to deal with than that.  Technology (for real this
time) will eventually make air travel, at it's current state-of-the-art,
obsolete, thus obviating the immediate inconveniences that spur like
complaints.  It's all simply a matter of obtaining the proper perspective.

This is fairly cogent.  In the real world, large bureaucracies are not so
good at handling a wide variety of different things.  Corporations usually
specialize in one major product area, and don't do so well when they
expand into areas that differ too much from their core product.  Don't
blame the ACLU too much, it's really not their fault if they fail to fully
leverage their expertise and influence in every single case.

That's strange.  I find that one's personal life is never really much of a
concern to for most people in our society.  I know a large number of
people, personally, who give virtually no thought to their own lives
outside of work.  Myself, I am also inclined in that direction.  

Today, most of the people I know are out satisfying their Christmas
obligations.  And while those who choose to enjoy the season are fully
engaged in the spirit of merrymaking, it is very nice that at least the
holiday is entirely voluntary.  So far, I have not had to fight off any
Christmas carolers, nor have I received any unpleasant gifts (although I
will tell you more later about the non-Jewish group I saw recently that
seemed to be confused by Chanukah).  Which is why, incidentally, that I
rarely have to care about my personal life.  As much as can be expected,
my personal life caries on in the best way possible, thus requiring none
of the time and attention that would be better directed elsewhere.

These things happen from time to time.  The best advice that you could
give to the original author would be to suggest that he relax and wait
until the incident passes.

it would amuse the list and so resent.)
