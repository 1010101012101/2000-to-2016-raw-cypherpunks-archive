Hacker behind 'Loverspy' Trojan added to FBI's most wanted cybercriminal list
http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/7/5077762/hacker-behind-loverspy-added-to-fbi-most-wanted-cybercriminal-list

      "Back in 2005, a hacker named Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara
released a piece of malware called "Loverspy" into the world. The $89
software purported to be a way to catch a cheating lover â€” it sent the
suspected cheater an electronic greeting card that, when opened, would
install a particularly malicious Trojan that could capture keystrokes,
email addresses, instant messages, and even record video from a
webcam. Once it was installed, the infected computer was essentially
at the attacker's mercy."

(...thought for certain it involved a paper-based 'electronic' card,
which set my imagination going as far as potential platforms
for delivery of sound-based triggering of computer events...
thus: regarding the issue of covert, audio-based data transmission
the idea of a silent dog whistle greeting card, modified to send
data in inaudible frequencies was imagined, likewise: most any
triggered, playback device: x-mas ornaments, singing fish, etc.
potentially influencing nearby computers, hotspots, phones...

(note also: PIR-motion detecting or light sensors for activation
of larger artifacts, e.g. garden gnome, lawn ball, flood lights)

Over $1 million stolen from Bitcoin digital wallet service, claims site owner
http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5082350/over-1-million-stolen-from-bitcoin-digital-wallet-service-claims-site

       " It's far safer to keep Bitcoins in "cold storage" by keeping
your wallet key offline, possibly even in a safe deposit box. The key
used for withdrawals is different than the public one needed for
deposits, making cold storage appealing for keeping a reserve of
Bitcoin safe from hackers. "

question: what if 'the banking system' itself were a model for
cryptography in terms of how keys and transactions occur, instead of
layer within banking transactions. in other words, what if 'securing
data' actually involved taking it offline, removing it into physical
media (such as pressed CDs in secure storage, out of circulation) or
other approaches.  my naive sense is that anything more complicated
than can be worked out with paper, envelopes, and social transactions
may not be secure by design of incomprehensibility, and who better
than banks for these kinds of advanced transactions of exchanging
valued information en masse.
