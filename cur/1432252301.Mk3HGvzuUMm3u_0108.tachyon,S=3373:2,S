Since I filter Choate into my trash folder, I typically don't see his 
dozens of one-liners giving some URL he feels we should all look at.

I do check the contents of my trash folder occasionally. Sometimes to 
retrieve something I accidentally trashed, sometimes to see what junk 
has collected there, sometimes to make sure my filters are not 
filtering something they shouldn't.

It's amazing to see the volume of one-line URL pointers Choate spews.
