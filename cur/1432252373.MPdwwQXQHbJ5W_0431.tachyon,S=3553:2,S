I don't have a good feeling about this at all.  My passport is actually
invalid as a form of ID for anyone who checks closely(the BMV did!)
because the gov't printed the wrong birthdate on mine!

I went to Germany and back just after the embassy attacks in
africa(things were on high alert briefly then) with no questions on it.
 Try to renew my lost drivers license with it and suddenly its a damn
problem.

As far as I can tell, they used the month of issue as the birth month as
well.  A small mistake...but obviously an important one.  What ways do
you suppose there will be for them to screw up these RFID tags?  These
days ones libel to get branded a terrorist with the wrong info...
