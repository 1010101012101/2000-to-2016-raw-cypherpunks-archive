Subject: mailing list announcement for IP

I have created the mailing list "ias-opportunities@cerias.purdue.edu"
for distributing announcements of funding opportunities, conference
and journal calls, and similar solicitations specifically about
issues of information assurance, information security, and
cybercrime-related issues.  This is not limited to academics -- these
announcements should be of interest as well to people in government
and industry.

Members of the list can send announcements such as the above to the
list.   Non-members can send announcements to
"ias-opportunities-submit@cerias.purdue.edu" for posting.

If you are interested in subscribing to the list, send email to
"ias-opportunities-request@cerias.purdue.edu" with the message
subscribe

If you want to subscribe an address other than the one from which you
send the email, use the message
subscribe <other-email>

This list is for announcements only -- not discussions, and should be
low-volume.

A WWW-archive of posts is available at
<http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/ias-opportunities/>.

Cheers,
--spaf
