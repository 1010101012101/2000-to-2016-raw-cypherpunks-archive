I once counciled a fellow grad student who was growing hot peppers on a
little
plot for student farmers.  Seems he had problems with 'raccoons' that
stole
his peppers.

I pointed out that phenolphlalein, a common pH indicator, was the active

ingredient in ex-lax, and very effective, invisible.  I suggested
depositing some in
a few growing peppers.  He also posted a sign to that effect.

Amazing that racoons can read.
