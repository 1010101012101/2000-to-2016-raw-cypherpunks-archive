There is a problem with images and other inline objects. There is a
solution, too.

The objects included into the document can get their hash calculated and
included in their tag; eg,
<IMG SRC="image.jpg" HASH="SHA1:4e1243bd22c66e76c2ba9eddc1f91394e57f9f83">
The tag has to be in the signed part of the document, so the hash can't be
tampered with.

Full digital signatures should be possible as well, eg.

<IMG SRC="image.jpg" SIGNATURE="http://where.is.the/signature.asc">

or

<IMG SRC="image.jpg" SIGNATURE="identifier">
some HTML code here
<SIGNATURE TYPE="gpg" NAME="identifier"><!--
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
--></SIGNATURE>

This way doesn't depend on the part of the document being signed, as the
signature can't be effectively tampered with undetected anyway.


Same scheme could be used in <A HREF> tags, allowing automated checking of
signatures or hashes of downloaded binary files.
