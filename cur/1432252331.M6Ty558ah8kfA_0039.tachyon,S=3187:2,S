Would you trust the Witness Protection Program with your life? Whoever
opts to collect that $5,000,000 will forever live in fear.

No, any tips that directly lead to the apprehension of Bin Laden must be
done under total anonymity. All the more reason for remailers to remain
operational.

For discussion:

Assuming only the use of mixmaster remailers for communication, and
assuming an honest FBI, how could one collect a cash reward for tips
satisfy the FBI's reward requirements?
