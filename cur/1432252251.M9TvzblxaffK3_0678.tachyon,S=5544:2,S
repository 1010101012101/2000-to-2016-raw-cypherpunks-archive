Yes, but someone somewhere is in charge of making the decision that
something is more or less efficient.  How do you measure merit for
instance for literature?  There can be little technical measures.  Sure,
you can measure grammer and spelling, and use of vocabulary, but you
cannot measure creativity by technical means.

Discrimination is simply the chosing of A over B, C, D, and E.  It is not
necessarily emotional.  When someone choses mates, he/she does so by
picking the mate that is most likely to guarantee the sucess of their
offspring.

When someone has discriminating taste, it means that they aren't likely to
eat at McDonalds.  Further, discriminating between food and poison is a
very good thing and has everything to do with logic.  The goal of every
being is to survive and to produce offspring.  It is therefore a good
thing if that being can discriminate between sweet and bitter
flavors.  Sweet flavors are more likely to provide nutrition whereas
bitter flavors may indicate posion.

Merit simply discriminates between those who have done the work, and
therefore are worthy of the reward, and those who haven't.
