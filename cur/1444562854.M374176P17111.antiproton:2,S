Realness is definitely a problem. I think by now a mayor reason could just
be "trolling paranoid people", as they're generally a willing target and
have no real defense against this sort of thing.

Snowden has a reputation, so he's unlikely to be fake. The Independent
would also ruin their rep by publishing fakes - but might still. It's not
unlikely Snowden/The Intercept are helped by people with various
motivations.

German court couldn't have been able to determine the slides real,
therefore must treat them false for the purpose of proof. Doesn't mean
they're actually fake, it's just not certain enough that they're real.
