It was more of an educated guess. =C2=A0I knew that I hadn't been promoting=
 AP, yetsomebody was seemingly trying to bring it into reality, or saying t=
hey were. =C2=A0Themost likely scenario, given that this person had contact=
ed me, is that he (they) weresimply trying to discredit me. =C2=A0To avoid =
that happening, and to 'kill two birds withone stone', I threw that hot pot=
ato to Andy Greenberg. =C2=A0(I was not at all happy with=C2=A0Greenberg, w=
ho greatly misrepresented 'facts' about me in his book). =C2=A0 I figuredth=
at Greenberg wouldn't do anything with this contact, which would allow me t=
o usehis negligence to discredit him. =C2=A0Very surprisingly, to me, Green=
berg actually wrotean article and published in Forbes! =C2=A0Literally with=
in hours, many dozen other=C2=A0articles appeared in other media, and in th=
e end it probably was hundreds of articlesover the next year or so.

I expected to, within a few weeks or months, read many articles publishing =
details. =C2=A0But no,all the rest were seemingly just rehashes of Greenber=
g's. =C2=A0 So, I learned very little. =C2=A0ButI _DID_ learn that that sys=
tem wouldn't be successful: =C2=A0At the very least, it would have hadto co=
nvince the public that they could trust the system to operate reliably, and=
 that neveroccurred.The only public criticism I voiced was the fact that th=
e system didn't accept individual donationslower than 1 BTC. =C2=A0Most peo=
ple would be willing to throw a penny, nickel, dime, quarter, ordollar into=
 a wishing well. =C2=A0But nearly $1000? =C2=A0Highly unlikely. =C2=A0It wa=
s one choice that virtually=C2=A0guaranteed failure, even if everything els=
e was done right.=C2=A0I am now, however, paying attention to Auger and Eth=
ereum, which if they meet their impliedpromises, will actually do the job.
