Yeah, even if there's disagreements with some of the anti-public-smoking 
arguments, the general principals involved shouldn't be too hard to agree 
with. Basically, "don't try to kill me".

It gets easier when one remembers that cigarette smoke was inches away from 
being declared a "class A carcinogen", but the tobacco companies through 
much dinero into the debate. That would have put smoke in the same category 
as asbestos. So now replace a public smoker with a guy playing tossing 
around a big blob of asbestos, and watch various cypherpunks start taking 
out their shotguns.
