Drexler's estimate for computers are coservative (purely mechanical rod
logic).

SWNT-based reversible logic (in spintronics? even utilizing nontrivial
amounts of entangled electron spins in solid state qubits for specific
codes?) could do a lot better.

So today's secrets perhaps won't be in a few decades. What else is new?
Rather, who's passphrase has 128 bits of pure entropy? Certainly not mine.
So the weakest link is elsewhere.

By that time the question is rather "do you think that's air you're
breathing?"

Check out some of the stuff on http://moleculardevices.org/
you might get a surprise.
