My god!  Did you stay up all night to find this?  It seems quite 
clear to me that the vast majority of the website is focused on 
man/teen relationships.  Even so, if this were a website advocating 
man/baby relationships, especially those that included horses it 
would not affect my position one bit.  These people have the right 
for their information to be put into the public forum.
