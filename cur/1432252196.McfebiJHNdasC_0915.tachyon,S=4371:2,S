I had suggested that a large number of crypto researchers take the 
proactive (or rather, prophylactic) step of informing *all* vendors of copy 
protection that the researchers are interested in studying the encryption 
used in their products. The notion of this would be that such an act by a 
large group would reduce the risk of retribution against individuals who 
participated.

I Am Not A Lawyer, so someone more knowledgeable may correct me if I'm 
wrong, but...

There's nothing here for a prosecutor to do. There's nothing illegal about 
a bona fide crypto researcher informing a vendor of an intent to study 
their product, which is offered to sale to the public. In fact, the 
researcher is complying with the legal requirements.

I don't see any way the vendor could file an injunction or take other legal 
action simply because someone (especially one of a large number of people) 
announced an intent to study their product, again, as a bona fide crypto 
researcher, as stated in the law.

Rick.
