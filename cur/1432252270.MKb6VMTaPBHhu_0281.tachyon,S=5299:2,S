The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|l change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slightly, you wil| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are we|l established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
