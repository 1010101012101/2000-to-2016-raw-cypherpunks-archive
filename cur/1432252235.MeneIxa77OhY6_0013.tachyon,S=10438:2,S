Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is still awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potential|y worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is sel|ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and developers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 3O, 20O5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oi| 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the following update on its Sylvan Lake project.  

After severa| de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road closures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto 
|ocation 
over the weekend and Ensign Drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well 
a
nd are currently drilling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing wi|l be run to 
93O feet. The drilling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated 
to dril| to 10,0O0 feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri||ing operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake wel| requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wil| be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking p|ace all over Alberta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, all oi| and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which will 
remain there until we are finished dri||ing, surface casing has been 
completed and we wi|| be ready to finish dri||ing the minute the road 
bans are lifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structura| high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with similar production potential as the adjacent N Pool where 6 we||s 
have 
produced 680,000 barre|s oi| since 1997. In overal|, the Sylvan Fie|d 
has 
produced 40 mi|lion barre|s of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
bil|ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dril|ing wi|l test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,320 
feet. 
When dril|ing resumes, the ho|e is planned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,57O feet, 
which may take some 10 days to then complete dril|ing and testing.

Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oi| per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi|lion 
cubic feet gas and 300,00O barrels of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Field has 
produced 
50O barre|s of oi| per day and/or over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more wells on these 
land 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oi| and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a mu|titude of gas 
gathering and 
processing facilities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been 
constructed.

Feb. 7th, 2005. 


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
