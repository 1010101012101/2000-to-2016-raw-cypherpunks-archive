I saw the ad for Chase Durer watches on your website and just wanted to say 
that while the watch I have looks good, it has broken three times in the 
first 7 months of ownership.  Now the company will not even give me a 
replacement without me paying to ship it to them AGAIN!  Just a waring, they 
haven't given very good customer service to me.  Buy a Luminox or Brietling 
instead.  I have both and they are bulletproof.


Thanks

MS
