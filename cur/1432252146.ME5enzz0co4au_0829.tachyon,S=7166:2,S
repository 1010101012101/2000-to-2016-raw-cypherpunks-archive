  Dear Cruise Enthusiast,</span></font></p>
<p><font size="3"> Thank you for choosing to receive information about special 
  travel opportunities.  This e-mail from Clipper Cruise Line, named one of the 
  top-ten cruise lines in the world by the readers of Condi Nast Traveler magazine 
  for the past five years, is designed to make it easier for you to discover the 
  beauty of small-ship cruising.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Were delighted to be able to extend to you a special offer 
  to explore New Zealands spectacular North and South islands this November or 
  December.  This unique itinerary offers the best of New Zealand -- spectacular 
  waterways, majestic mountains, rolling pastureland, and lively cities.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Youll embark the 122-passenger Clipper Odyssey in Auckland, 
  and enjoy a full day of exploration of this vibrant city while the ship is tied 
  up at the citys Waitemata Harbor, within easy walking distance of downtowns 
  museums, parks, and lively waterfront.  Then, youll set sail on a route that 
  takes you along virtually all of New Zealands eastern coastline.  Well stop 
  at Tauranga, where you may join an optional tour to Rotorua to discover the 
  rich culture of the native Maori; Napier, with its nearby enormous gannet population; 
  Queen Charlotte Sound, where we use our Zodiacs for exploration; Lyttelton, 
  the jumping-off point for a tour of the very English city of Christchurch, or 
  for an optional ride on the Tranz Alpine Express; and the Scottish-flavored 
  city of Dunedin, located at the end of a long and beautiful harbor.  Then, well 
  cruise through the stunning Fiordland National Park, including Dusky and Doubtful 
  Sounds, and the spectacular Milford Sound, where youll disembark.  Following 
  the cruise, enjoy two days at the ParkRoyal Hotel in Queenstown, surrounded 
  by The Remarkables mountain range.  During your stay, youll thrill to an exhilarating 
  jetboat ride on the Shotover River.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><span> </span></font><font size="3">An experienced expedition 
  leader and a distinguished group of naturalists accompany us throughout our 
  voyage, adding to your enjoyment of the places we visit.  On the comfort side, 
  the Clipper Odyssey offers amenities you would expect to find aboard a luxury 
  yacht -- outside staterooms averaging a generous 186 square feet in size, an 
  elegant dining room where meals are served at leisurely seatings, a comfortable 
  library, gymnasium, beauty salon, and outdoor pool.<br>
  <br>
  IMPORTANT:  To encourage you to join us exploring New Zealands North and South 
  Islands, we are offering a very attractive incentive.  International airfare 
  from Los Angeles is normally included in the cost of the cruise so, first, well 
  deduct the listed international air credit of $800 per person from the published 
  rates.  Then, you may deduct an additional $600 per cabin ($300 per person, 
  double occupancy, $600 single).  Finally, well include domestic airfare from 
  our gateway cities at no additional charge, an added savings of up to $1,240 
  per couple.  Thats a total savings of up to $3,440 per couple!  </font></p>
