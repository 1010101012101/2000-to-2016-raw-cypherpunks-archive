If one goes into it with a fuck it attitude, then nothing can truly
touch them. And no matter what happens, their family will inherit
that ethos.
If one goes to beer and TV, that's what they inherit.
So the real question is, is a relatively blissful beer and TV
subsistance life the only, indeed natural, way of things?
Or is there an alternate reality in the offing?
The only sure way to find out is to say fuck it.
Otherwise just throw in the towel and embrace the bliss.
That's the easy, understandable, and certainly popular way.
Beyond that... tldr, sorta... the deepweb's a better forum,
but I feel ya bro.

If you do throw it in, you can always send some unspent fuckits
this way, if for nothing else, beer and TV, maybe some chickens,
and a barn, with a tractor...
