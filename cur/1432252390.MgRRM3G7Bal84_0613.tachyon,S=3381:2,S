The New York Post is reporting that a female librarian at American Media
has pneumonia, and has tested positive for anthrax.

There's still no evidence, according to the FBI, that this anthrax
outbreak was the result of criminal activity.

Legionaire's Disease first appeared to be a terror weapon when significant
numbers of cases appeared at a convention center.  Later we learned that
it was simply a virulent form of pneumonia that liked to live in standing
water in building air conditioning systems.

Time will tell whether this anthrax outbreak is something similar.  
Clearly the timing is suspicious.

One would think that a competent biological warfare attack against an
office building with 300 people in it would kill more than one person.
