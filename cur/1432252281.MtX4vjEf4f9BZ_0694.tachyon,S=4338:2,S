"The term "terrorism" means premeditated, politically motivated violence
 perpetrated against noncombatant(1) targets by subnational groups or
 clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience."

The footnote expands "noncombatant" to include any element of the military
that is not actually engaged in formal hostilities against you at the time
you attack it.

So under the State Department's definition, unless official war is
currently being waged around the target, all attacks on US Servicemen, and
US military bases and assets, are "terrorist" attacks.  Nothing Israel
does to the Palestinians is "terrorist", but everything the Palestinians
do in response is "terrorist," of course.

According to the state department, "noncombatants" can actually be
property, as opposed to people, so taking a few whacks at an oil pipeline
with a baseball bat is "terrorism" too.

Unless you're a government, of course.  

Premeditated violence by persons in no official position of authority is
generally unlawful, as far as I know.  Perhaps you could think up an
exception, but I'm not aware of any.
