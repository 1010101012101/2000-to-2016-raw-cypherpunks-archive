Besides, being drunk is no excuse for beind stupid. I mean, I boast a good
in-excess-of-1-per-mille alcohol intoxication at the moment, and still
manage to write in a relatively rational manner. Being drunk does *not* mean
one is exempt from displaying manners, or that one can safely switch off
one's intellect.

Then, if one really can't cope with drugs as strong as alcohol, but still
wants take them, sure. One just shouldn't be surprised if that leads to
behavior one might regret later.

He really does seem to need a clue pill.
