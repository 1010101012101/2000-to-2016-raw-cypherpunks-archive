Lossy (cassette) copies were illegal if you sold or disseminated to
too-broad a category of "associates".  Perfect (digital) copies are
not illegal if the associates are limited; the past several jobs
I've had, I've shared my ripped collection of physical-CDs
without worry, inside the local net.

You want something operational, so: a very low-res copy is the
same.  This works for MP3s vs. CDs, etc.  In practice, a judge
will say that perceptually similar (semantic) copies are copies.
This is also true for eg trademarks.

A state which protects individuals against harm from others is
pretty much defensible.  Those that need killing (impeachment,
fragging, etc) are those who abuse this "right" of violence.

There are some who don't hold that the State has any justification
for that role, but that is amoral.  In the vacuum, thugs rule.
(Cf any state which has no effective power.)

The RIAA/MPAA would use low-res similarity matching, or
just hire offshore listeners/watchers.  Ones who grok sarcasm.
Fair use exemptions are an excuse under US laws.  YMMV.
Of course, if I have 10 friends, and they each have 10 friends,
content is toast, best charge for live performances.

I watched an industrial-sports event on TV, and it had
warnings that any description thereof without the consent
of the commisar of that "sport" was illegal.  FThatS.
