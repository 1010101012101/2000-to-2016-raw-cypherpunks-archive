Healthcare.gov used to have some very bad vulnerabilities.  Some of which
still are laying around in wait,
 but --> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html
they've fixed it up since a while back.

However, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. One of the biggest
providers, Anthem (anthem.com) fails.  (servers: openroadfromanthem (cert
not even valid), deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com... 'F' grades,
ssltest)  Supposedly people are getting connected to these health
insurance companies through healthcare.gov ~ real reassuring, right?
