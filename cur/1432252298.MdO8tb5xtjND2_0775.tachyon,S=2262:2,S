The CIA's official explanation of the event, even to this layman, is
aerodynamically impossible.  Let me say that the TWA 800 coverup has a lot to do
with my cynicism about what really happened on 9/11. (I have a copy of the
Howard Stern show from that day, and chopper reporter that Howard fed in clearly
reports a second, massive explosion just before the south tower collapsed.
Speaking with an ironworker who worked on the cleanup only brought more
questions as to the "real" cause of the collapses.)
