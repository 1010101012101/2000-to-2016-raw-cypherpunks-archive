<b><font size="4">INTRODUCING  Interactive Business Cards (IBCs) from 1 Global
City</font></b>
<br>
Imagine a powerful multimedia presentation that fits into a wallet. Or an entire catalog on a
CD-ROM the size of a business card. At only 2.35 by 3.65 inches, the IBC card holds up to
50 megabytes of information - that's 10 minutes of full-screen video, one hour of
compressed audio, or 50,000 pages of text. It all translates to big space for gutsy,
high-powered multimedia.
