Weather in Boston is so variable that the weathermen can't even forecast 
yesterday's weather.

Don't like the springtime weather in the Adirondacks? Just wait an hour. 
(Barely a joke---a couple of weeks ago, we had a day hit almost 80F and 
the next day had an ice storm that brought down trees and power lines; 
some people were without power for four days, and this with nighttime 
lows around 10F. Then the days turned warm enough that the three to six 
inches of new snow and ice melted in a day or two. Sometimes I miss 
Arizona...)
