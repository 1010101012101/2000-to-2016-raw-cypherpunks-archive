No RTOS/Linux is needed for fast sampling, which has been happening for 
several decades now.  Nor is a digital oscilloscope needed.

(FWIW, I used a Nicolet digital oscilloscope, and also a LeCroy CAMAC 
digitizer, for some high-speed single-shot event capture--the strike of 
an alpha particle--nearly 25 years ago. The OS for our data collection 
computers were, variously, RSX-11M and VMS.)

Video ADC cards are already vastly capable at sampling video streams.

So? Yes, this is all possible. Any moderately well-equipped lab can do 
this. So?

I have no idea what you mean by "fill this idea with water," but by all 
means go ahead and rig up such a machine.

Personally, I already make about 1-2 recordable DVDs per day, on 
average, without any hint of copy protection or Macrovision. I usually 
use the 3-hour speed on my DVD recorder, and can put one high-quality 
movie on the first part and then, by using a slightly slower speed, 
another movie on the remaining part. If "DVD quality" is needed, I 
record at the 2-hour setting. If "better than DVD quality" is needed, 
as from a DV camcorder source, I record at the 1-hour speed.

If you build a machine which has even higher digitization rates, taken 
ahead of any DVD spec circuitry, you will get about what I am getting 
at the 1-hour setting.

A very limited market for consumers to buy such machines. Video pirate 
labs very probably already have such rigs set up.
