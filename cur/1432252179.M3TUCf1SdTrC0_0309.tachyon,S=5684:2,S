Actually it depends on the type of tube, triodes as compared to a pentode
for example 'color' a signal in different ways. There are also geometry
issues that filter the harmonics in different ways for different types of
tubes. So a blanket statement such as 'all tubes boost even order
harmonics' is gibberish.

Further, to correct Tim's audio bullshit, -EVERYTHING- colors the music.
There is -NOTHING- in the pipe from initial performance to end user
experience that is 'perfectly flat'. Unless you were there when it was
done you'll -never- get close to what actually happened. Changing the
speakers will change the music, putting fiberglass in the cabinet changes
the music, changing the cables from Copper to Gold makes a audible difference
in some cases. Another fine point to make in regard to things like
distortion and THD, considering the average performance amp is about 3-5x
-higher- in THD (for example) the distinction between audio performance above
a certain threashold (that is primarily listener dependent) is a waste (and
really a tad dellusional).

Which means it colors it differently is all. YMMV...big surprise.

First off single ended Triodes have been around a lot(!) more than 10
years. Secondly the term you want is 'warm' in reference to a tube amp,
it's been around since at least the 50's. Using a term like 'live' to
describe a sound simply means somebody has never compared (for example) a
Fender to a Marshall amp and understood why the same 'live' performance
sounds so different (and you can use the same speaker stack for either
head).

You mean the wave is actually more 'square' because the higher sampling rate
better matches the original signal?....Duh.

As somebody who has been involved in audio (both listening and
performance) for many years (30+) that is simple bullshit. The Voodoo that
sells keeps on going, and going, and going,...

Bullshit, you're born with good ears or your not. There is not a single
thing one can do to change that. If you have good ears and train them then
you get what you pay for. If you got bad ears, pick another field to work
in.

And a -lot- of those golden ear differences are just ego or marketing
hype.
