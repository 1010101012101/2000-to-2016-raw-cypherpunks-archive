Right, there are at least two workable solutions-

Hard drives with user alterable firmware. I surprised that none of the 
major drive manufacturers seems to have thought about offering a version of 
their controllers, for substantially more money, that offers this.

A retrofit device that screws into the side of the hard drive and is set to 
inject a corrosive that almost instantly destroys the drive surfaces.  The 
device can be triggered by any number of intrusion detectors or a 
voice-activated system keyed to the operators voice print.
