I wasn't poking at them, either. Tim is just hilarious when he wants to be,
and Declan included the terrorism variable in his comments -- and I didn't

Furthermore, I am a bitch, and the terrorism variable played out. (You're
all SOBs in my book, but you're insightful SOBs at times.)

I read a little on your terminology. Interesting, thank you.
