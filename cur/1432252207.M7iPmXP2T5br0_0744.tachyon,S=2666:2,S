Don Foster was asked to track down Ted Kaczynski by studying the
           Unabomber's own words (and uncovering fresh information about
his choice of
           victims). Foster, a Vassar prof who solved a centuries old
mystery involving a
           Shakespearean sonnet and unmasked the anonymous author of a
sensational Clinton
           campaign book, has written a book about science, words and
identity. You can run and hide,
           he says, but your words will always give you away. Author
Unknown is relevant to life
           online, where responsibility for words and anonymous
authorship is an everyday issue.
