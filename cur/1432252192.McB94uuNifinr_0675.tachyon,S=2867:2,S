"...Hitting the 5, 6, 7 and 8 buttons on the phone gun fires
  four .22-caliber rounds in quick succession. ..."

OK, so I can accept that only Mad Dogs & (Home Office) Englishmen may
be looney enough to sit around under the noonday press coverage after
someone's leaked their classified plans to store seven years' worth
of everyone's communications (Ministry of Silly Flippin'
Traffic-analysis... MSFT?), and maybe Viagra is responsible for all
this US presidential madness (how else could two old white guys hold
an election for so long? ;) -- but what the hell is going on when you
can't order a damned pizza over the phone without risking that you'll
blow your own salami off?
