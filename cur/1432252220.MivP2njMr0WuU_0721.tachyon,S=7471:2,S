Accountability will be zero if the police body cams are reviewed and paid for
by the police. This is already the case as you have a case documented *on
video* which was ruled a homicide by the coroner. But police have great
protections and latitude on what they are allowed to do, which may or may not
be a mistake. Only more awareness and debate will answer that.

What happens to the police body camera footage is far more important. If it is
immediately posted via bittorrent or multicast IP on public access wireless
mesh networks, it will become a great tool for the police, for social justice,
and for accountability.

The cost, however, is a loss of privacy.

As it is now, all I need to do is buy my privacy by providing forensic data
analysis services to the police to give them whatever answer the prosecutor
or campaign contributors would like to see.

I would trade my privacy for the freedom and liberty that would come from
an open and transparent society that calls all it's members to account for
their actions, rather than only calling the lower classes to account.

What happens next depends on how many would trade in privacy for an upgraded
society.
