Some observations:

What would keep a Gov't from using AP to accomplish their own objectives ?
They obviously would have the resources to.  They might even find it a much
more  efficient way to silence vocal critics with plenty of "plausible
denialbility".

To be fair (and I'll guess that it has been covered before) you would really
want to have a "futures ;) " market where
supporters could sell contracts that paid off if the target lived to a
certain age, past certain date, or for a specific period
of time. This would be in addition to contracts sold by detractors that
would pay off if the target didn't.

Maybe even a anonymous pool that gets paid to the entity accurately
predicting the date of a FOILED attempt on the target.

I can see it now:

Mr. May:

  Enclosed please find the keys to your new armoured vehicle. No Charge.

Signed: A concerned investor.


(P.S. It really IS armoured. It just "looks" like a '76 Ford Pinto. :) )
