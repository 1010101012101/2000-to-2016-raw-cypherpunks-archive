This may be on national but the local ABC station is 
showing raw footage of the plane and engine crash sites, 
fairly close up, right by the fallen engine, and within a few 
yards of the plane. 

There are relatively large portions of the plane which seems
to indicate a slower speed hit. The fire at the engine is out, 
but the plane and surrounding building fires continue. 

A mix of firemen, police and citizens battling the blaze.
A few young men running into the fire along a street of
houses for unknown reasons, but may be heading for 
home or known area locations. Running right into and
through the flames. These are wood fires of houses
and trees not fuel, which explains the whitish smoke.
