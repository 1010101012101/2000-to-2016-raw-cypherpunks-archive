Are all the keys certified?  Are any copied outright?

One key for encryption, one key for signature, one key for checksums,
and one key to rule them all!!  :-)

I think that explaining it in a mathematical or technical abstract
way would give competitors an advantage.  Seems like the consortium
that's building it can keep these details proprietary and just
sell the thing on the market to whoever wants to buy it - no need
for all this FAQ stuff anyway.  They only need publicity to get
past the congress or MP's.  I guess I don't see why the spec is
public if the purpose is to create a platform that's just a toy.
But I'm confused, so keep at it and maybe I'll figure something out!

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
