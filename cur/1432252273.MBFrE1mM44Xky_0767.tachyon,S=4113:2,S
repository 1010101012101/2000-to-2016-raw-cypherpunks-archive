What you mean by the IRA is probably the Provisional IRA.

The Official IRA (Marxist and known as the "stickies") itself has been
defunct since the early 1970s and PIRA was formed by hardliners
leaving OIRA.

The Real IRA has been formed by hardliners leaving PIRA.

If history repeats itself then most people will probably end up
refering to RIRA as IRA anyway, since the distinction between these
organisations will probably be of little interest to the family of
someone killed.

(There are another republician terrorist groups such as the INLA as well)
