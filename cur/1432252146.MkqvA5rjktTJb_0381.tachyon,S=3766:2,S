Hummmm !

I have loaded 7,62 and .308 cartridges in my L1A1 ( FN variant made by 
Lightgow ) and in my FR8 ( spanish bolt action carbine ) without any problems.

One thing though !

When you reload a military brass, you should always, always, reduce your first 
(tests) charges of about 10%.

Reason.  The military brass is thicker, so there is less space (volume) in the 
cartridge to accomodate the powder.

Not a problem when you are using BLC-2 or other similar powder, since the full 
charge that I was using was filling the cartridge up to the neck ( 52 grains 
of powder over a 125 grain softpoint bullet).  So, if by mistake, a military 
brass would have mixed with my "federal" brass, I would have had a big mess on 
my reloading press....  and not in my face.

I always used the same technique with all the calibers that I reload, and 
always developed powerfull but safe loads.

Apart from an empty case volume, I do not see any problem using 7,62 or .308 
ammo in the same rifle.

After taking a look at the M1A1 rifle that blew up, and especially at the 
split shell and almost ejected primer, the only conclusion that I can come 
with is :
  a.. The wrong type of powder was used ( faster burning rate like pistol 
powder ) ;
  b.. Something was blocking the barrel ( pine needle, small rock, forgotten 
(!!!) cleaning cloth, etc ) preventing the bullet from exiting, and causing 
the pressure inside the barrel to exit through the weakest point of the 
rifle....OUCH !
  c.. Looking at the primer, some extraordinary pressures develop in the 
barrell !
  d.. So, if the barrel started splitting apart near the chamber, that would 
explain the split case !
Glad it wasn't my rifle...and my face !  

Regards,
