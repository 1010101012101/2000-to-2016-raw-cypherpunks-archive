They are fun to see, and I don't think they have a problem with photographs.
Their web page is at www.att.com/ndr/ and most of the good pictures
are under "Deployments".

They do quarterly exercises around the US, which include a certain
amount of showing them to tourists (i.e. the sales people get
to bring in customers to see the cool stuff, along with
running seminars about why you need to buy more telecom
to support your business disaster recovery needs.)
