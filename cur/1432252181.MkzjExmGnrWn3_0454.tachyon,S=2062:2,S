What a hypocrite!  You have repeatedly stated that you would kill people
who committed far less serious offenses.  What if protestors performed a
sit-in or march on your property?  You have threatened many times to kill
trespassers in such situations.  How can someone who threatens death for
the most minor offenses claim to be shocked at a sentence of 25 years?

Your violent rhetoric has destroyed whatever credibility you once had
as a defender of rights.
