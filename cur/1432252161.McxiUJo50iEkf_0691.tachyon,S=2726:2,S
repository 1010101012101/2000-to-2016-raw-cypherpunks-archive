OK, so Tyler [apparently] works in the business :-)

Let me fill in what he left out.  Yes, the industry is moving towards
MPLS over POS.  That's not where it is now though.  At least not for most
interfaces.  Right now the industry is chock full of lagacy gear, mostly
old fashioned ATM.  You think you can just casually reassemble this crap
in transit?  Let's see it!

Besides that old fashioned transport diversity, we have the original
problem: even if you could do it (maybe in three to five years), what are
you going to do with the data you've snarfed?  Backhaul it?  Shove it into
TB cassettes?  Better keep a guy on staff to change the tray!!

None of the many obstacles curretly in the way will allow this to be done
on the QT.  Semi-openly would be another story, as would the scenario of a
smaller, say regional, ISP.
