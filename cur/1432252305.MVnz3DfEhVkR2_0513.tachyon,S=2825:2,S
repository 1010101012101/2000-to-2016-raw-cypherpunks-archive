First, the issue of double-spending. As any digital instrument is 
replicable, Alice's "proof" that she transferred a digital instrument 
to Bob can NEVER by itself mean that Bob eventually got some other form 
of money. This is why online clearing is so advantageous.

Second, the problem of Alice trying to prove (to whom, by the way?) 
that she paid Bob is a can of worms. If Alice is trying to prove to 
some third party then perhaps she should use that third party as an 
escrow service...they know _they_ got paid, because they cashed the 
instrument, and now they can pay Bob.

Third, meatspace identity is only one of many "enforcement mechanisms" 
which can be tried. Not a good avenue, in my view.
