Israel to look into Arafat murder ad

 Israel to look into Arafat murder ad
 By SAUD ABU RAMADAN

  GAZA, July 23 (UPI) -- Israel's attorney general on Monday said he
would
 consider opening a criminal investigation into an advertisement that
urged
 anyone who had the opportunity to murder Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat,
 the Haaretz newspaper reported.

  The paper said that a leader of a group called Zo Artzeinu, Moshe
Feiglin,
 and three movement colleagues signed the advertisement, published in
the
 Makor Rishon newspaper by the right-wing group.

  The ad called on any Israeli to "point your rifle at his (Arafat's)
plane
 when it flies over the Jewish settlement..." The ad also urged members
of
 the Israeli secret service to "open fire immediately at Arafat's convoy

 whenever driving in the streets of Gaza and the West Bank."

  Legal officials said they doubted indictments could actually be
submitted
 against either the Zo Artzeinu members or Makor Rishon's editors. Since
a
 tougher anti-incitement law was recently defeated in the Knesset, said
the
 paper, prosecutors lack the legal tools needed to indict the sponsors
of the
 anti-Arafat message.

  But Member of Knesset Ran Cohen from Meretz Party urged Israel
Attorney
 General Elyakim Rubinstein to charge both the Zo Artzeinu members and
Makor
 Rishon's editors.

  Rubinstein also ordered the Israeli army, the police and the Shin Bet
 security service to take firm, uncompromising action against "extremist

 Jewish settlers who harm innocent Arab civilians."

  Meanwhile, Rubinstein reportedly convened a secret meeting last week
with
 top security officials to consider ways of clamping down on vigilante
 actions that harm Palestinian civilians, including women and children,
said
 the paper. Officials at the meeting considered various legal steps
against
 extremists, particularly in the Hebron area, such as banning their
entry to
 flashpoints on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

  Ha'aretz said that no decision had been reached regarding the
imposition
 of such restraining orders on Jewish militants.
