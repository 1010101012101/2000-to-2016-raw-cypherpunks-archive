Interesting stuff.

There does seem to be a swell of interest in bitcoin among
non-cryptohead users, not surprisingly as the limits of fiat currency
believability are being stretched paper-thin. The question is, will
existingpowerstructure.gov wise to the threat it poses before it gets
too many legitimate uses?

Assuming bitcoin's technical defences are sound, then they are going
to go after it via media means - the four horsemen, etc. The first
establishment journo to hear about Silk Road is going to have a field
day.
