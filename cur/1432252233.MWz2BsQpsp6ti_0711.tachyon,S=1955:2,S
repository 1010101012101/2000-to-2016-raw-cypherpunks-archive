Or is he?!!!

Nah... I know this was an accident, though I can't help wondering if someone 
phoned the airport in advance. I've noticed that the reporter (who was 
taking notes) was questioned: Would someone merely writing normally get 
noticed by security?

The silver lining here is that the TSA was forced to say that an ID isn't 
technically required, so that they have in theory relinquished the right to 
demand one. There have been worse mistakes.

Of course, I have little doubts about how this really works in practice.
