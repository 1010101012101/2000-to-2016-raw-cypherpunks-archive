y PREGERSON, William C. CANBY, ):
The ct, sua sponte, consolidates appl number 05-35289 and 05-35291. A
review of the record demonstrates that, although the 3/10/05 and
3/15/05 notices of appl were not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment, aplts filed timely mtns for ext of time to appl
pursuant to FRAP 4(a)(5), which were contained in the notices of app.
The dc has not ruled on those motions. Accordingly, these appls are
remanded to the dc for the limited purpose of allowing that ct to rule
on aplts' mtns. The dc is requested to serve a copy of its decision on
this ct at its earliest convenience. Br in these appls is stayed
pending further order of this ct. [05-35289, 05-35291] (GR) [Entered:

view of the record demonstrates that
this court lacks jurisdiction over appeal no. 05-35291 because the
3/15/05 notice of appeal was not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment...CITE. Consequently, appeal no. 05-35291 is
DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Although the district court also
denied aplt James Bell's motion for ext of time to appeal no.
05-35289, further review of the record reflects that aplt Bell's
appeal was timely filed pursuant to FRAP 4(c) because aplt Bell is
incarcerated and his 3/10/05 noa was recvd by the dc one day after the
deadline prescribed by FRAP 4(a)(1). Consequently, appeal no. 05-35289
shall proceed. A review of this court's docket in appeal no. 05-35289
reflects that the filing and docketing fees for this appeal remain
due. Within 21 days after the filing date of this order, aplt Bell
shall pay to the dc the $255.00 filing and docketing fees for this
appeal and file in this court proof of such payment or file in this
court a motion to proceed ifp. Failure to pay the fees or file a
motion to proceed ifp shall result in the automatic dismissal of the
appeal by the clerk for failure to prosecute. See 9th Cir.R. 42-1. (
