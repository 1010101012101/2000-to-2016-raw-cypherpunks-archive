FBI is NSA's front man for domestic programs. see DITU and how PRISM,
while an NSA program, is coordinated through FBI.

FBI does provide blanket surveillance, although they must launder
information through parallel construction before the surveillance
becomes legally actionable.

to be clear, they inspect nearly everything in-line with "Deep Packet
Inspection" and "semantic analysis" and similar techniques, e.g. Narus
Insight, at the edges rather than centrally. there is an order of
magnitude less capacity for NSANet uplink than what is monitored
through taps. they could not pull a mirror of all traffic if they
wanted to!

then, the selected stuff is collected and stored forever*. the Utah
massive data repository is not full take buffer, but rather
persistence for selected or collected information.

(full take on backbones a technical challenge, and not everywhere.)

as discussed elsewhere, you can get "selected" for various activities,
which is auto-targeting, in a sense...

best regards,



* for some definition of "forever".
