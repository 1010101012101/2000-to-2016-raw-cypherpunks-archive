Your point is well taken; however, it is simply pragmatic that 
when one is mere weeks away from releasing a digital money system, 
given the current legal environment, one MUST NOT say so.

In order to maintain anonymity in the current legal environment, 
a digital money system will have to be independent of all nation 
states -- hence, not overtly tied to nor created by any known 
organization or person.  

This presents major logistical difficulties for the idea of a 
"unified" system with a single currency; it becomes very difficult 
for an issuing authority to "redeem on demand" without becoming 
known.  The difficulties are different for the "every member a 
mint" model, but by no means less.
