If the information provided in the article and your interview is reasonably 
accurate I suggest the Green Party, which is fairly popular in Maine, and 
others who oppose this sort of McCarthyesque law enforcement take direct 
action against them.  By that I mean they identify the "thugs", including 
towns and photos, and invite the opposition to shun them in every legal way 
possible (e.g., denying them service at restaurants, shops, service 
stations, etc.)
