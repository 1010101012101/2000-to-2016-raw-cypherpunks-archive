but on the other hand, we *do* want to keep cracking legal (at least to
some extend) because otherwise what is left of security in cyberspace
will quickly vanish into oblivion, right?


as a matter of fact, *probing* my machine is nothing I'm worried about.
if you like, you can come over and probe all you want. if you find
something that should worry me, it would be nice of you to tell me
first. but if you dump half a million mails on my server, *that* is not
acceptable.
