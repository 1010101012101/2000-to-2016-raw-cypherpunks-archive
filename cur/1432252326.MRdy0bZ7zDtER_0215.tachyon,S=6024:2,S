Let me posit that we need humans that act more like ethical beings, that 
have insights that go beyond the logic, rules, and reason that seem to,
well, govern the keeping of secrets. I see a disturbing trend towards 
people who appear to be more human rule-and-emotional-reactivity execution
units than empowered beings with free and unpredictable thought and 
discernment.

The great thing that Snowden did was get more of the general public engaged
and involved, and for the various types of infiltrators to have any lasting
effect, there must be cypherpoliticians, architecting secure legal codes and
blocking legislative trojans.

Assassination Politics is an interesting armchair quarterback game, but I
think what we really need is some of that theory applied to Election politics,
with some down-in-the dirt wrestling with campaign finance. We need cypherpunks
pointing out the futility of more reactive campaign finance regulations that
plug the holes we saw last year. We need speech, and code as speech, and 
a debate about does the First Amendment cover the right to speak in code, and
does the Second Amendment give us the right to keep and bear a well-regulated
open-source drone Militia?

Get the public engaged and involved again, and run for office, or go work
for a campaign an do some analytics, and tell us the state-of-the art in
modern election engineering.
