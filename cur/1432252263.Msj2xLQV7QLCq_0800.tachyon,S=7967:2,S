I was looking up the way cool VASIMR plasma rocket, which would make 
90-104 day transfers to Mars possible, but spaceflight.nasa.gov is not 
reachable. Must be a DNS problem.

This degree of seeming idiotic paranoia is not healthy. It doesn't 
inspire confidence, either. The paternalistic (or is it maternalistic?) 
  policy of keeping nobody but the American public in the dark doesn't 
help, it makes matters worse. And it makes people less apt to pay 
attention to voices of reason. Or know where to watch for suspicious 
activity.

So? If that's the whole point, fuck that. If not, well, get a fucking 
grip, America.
