Which idiot would assume his specific location is excluded? Especially,
if it's a long-distance (transcontinental) link?

Dave,

    This entry from the blog at wired.com might be good for the IP
list. The best part is at the end. Good old traceroute!

The Newbie's Guide to Detecting the NSA
http://blog.wired.com/27BStroke6/#1510938 ... "With that in mind,
here's the 27B Stroke 6 guide to detecting if your traffic is being
funneled into the secret room on San Francisco's Folsom street. If
you're a Windows user, fire up an MS-DOS command prompt. Now type
tracert followed by the domain name of the website, e-mail host, VoIP
switch, or whatever destination you're interested in. Watch as the
program spits out your route, line by line. C:\> tracert nsa.gov 1 2
ms 2 ms 2 ms 12.110.110.204 [...] 7 11 ms 14 ms 10 ms
as-0-0.bbr2.SanJose1.Level3.net [64.159.0.218] 8 13 12 19 ms
ae-23-56.car3.SanJose1.Level3.net [4.68.123.173] 9 18 ms 16 ms 16 ms
192.205.33.17 10 88 ms 92 ms 91 ms tbr2-p012201.sffca.ip.att.net
[12.123.13.186] 11 88 ms 90 ms 88 ms tbr1-cl2.sl9mo.ip.att.net
[12.122.10.41] 12 89 ms 97 ms 89 ms tbr1-cl4.wswdc.ip.att.net
[12.122.10.29] 13 89 ms 88 ms 88 ms ar2-a3120s6.wswdc.ip.att.net
[12.123.8.65] 14 102 ms 93 ms 112 ms 12.127.209.214 15 94 ms 94 ms 93
ms 12.110.110.13 16 * * * 17 * * * 18 * * In the above example, my
traffic is jumping from Level 3 Communications to AT&T's network in
San Francisco, presumably over the OC-48 circuit that AT&T tapped on
February 20th, 2003, according to the Klein docs. The magic string
you're looking for is sffca.ip.att.net. If it's present immediately
above or below a non-att.net entry, then -- by Klein's allegations --
your packets are being copied into room 641A, and from there,
illegally, to the NSA. Of course, if Marcus is correct and AT&T has
installed these secret rooms all around the country, then any att.net
entry in your route is a bad sign.
