Hamas bans masks for Gaza gunmen


>From correspondents in Gaza

June 16, 2007 11:35pm

IN their first order since seizing control of the Gaza Strip, Hamas
Islamists banned gunmen from wearing masks - unless they are shooting at
Israel.

The masks have become commonplace in the Gaza Strip during weeks of
factional fighting between the ruling Hamas movement and President Mahmoud
Abbas's secular Fatah faction.

Both sides wore the masks to hide their identities.

"A decision was taken last night to prevent (people from wearing) masks,"
Khaled Abu Hilal, a spokesman for the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry,
said.

Hamas made one exception, for militants carrying out cross-border attacks
on Israel.

"Wearing masks should only be near the borders and in fighting the Zionist
enemy, not in the streets and near people's homes," Abu Hilal said.
