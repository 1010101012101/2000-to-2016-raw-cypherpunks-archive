Certicom Hosts First Annual ECC Conference
                         
    Industry experts, the creators of ECC and users convene in Toronto to
    discuss best practices and growing adoption of Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography

    MISSISSAUGA, ON, Oct. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Certicom Corp.
(TSX: CIC), the authority for strong, efficient cryptography, today announced
it will host the Certicom ECC Conference 2004, the first-ever conference that
brings together Elliptic Curve Cryptography researchers, industry experts and
users. During the two-day conference, participants from North America, Europe
and Asia will discuss the growing adoption of ECC and share best
implementation practices and insights for future applications. The conference
begins with an evening reception on November 15 with sessions running
November 16-17 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto, Canada.
    Keynote speakers include Mike Lazaridis, president and co-CEO of Research
In Motion, and Dr. Scott Vanstone, Certicom founder and EVP strategic
technology. Also participating are Norm Kern, Unisys; Dr. Jerry Krasner of
Embedded Market Forecasters; Herb Little, Research In Motion; Dr. Ralph
Merkle, Georgia Tech; and Dr. Leon Pintsov, Pitney Bowes. During the
conference, Certicom will present recognition awards to ECC creators Dr. Neal
Koblitz, University of Washington and Dr. Victor Miller, Institute for Defense
Analyses Center for Communication Research, as well as an ECC visionary award
to Dr. Walt Davis, Motorola (retired).
    ECC, which is often referred to as the next-generation public-key
cryptography system, is used in a growing number of sectors ranging from
consumer electronics, wireless devices and semiconductors to government and
financial services. Specifically, its implementations protect content,
securely transmit data and digitally sign documents. The small size of ECC is
a main driver behind its growing adoption. It provides equivalent security to
competing public-key cryptosystems but at a fraction of the size, making it
ideally suited for resource-constrained devices such as smart phones,
semiconductors and smart cards.
    Software developers, hardware engineers, and anyone responsible for
buying or implementing cryptographic systems will benefit from this conference
and the free exchange of practical ideas and real-world lessons. They also
will gain insights into future applications of ECC, including standards and
protocols.
    "This conference is a dynamic forum for ECC proponents to get together
and engage in open discussions about the technology: its roots, how it is used
today and where it's going," said Scott Vanstone. "We've pulled together a
stellar roster of the who's who in the ECC world and representatives from some
of North America's leading companies. This conference promises to advance the
understanding of ECC and accelerate its adoption."
