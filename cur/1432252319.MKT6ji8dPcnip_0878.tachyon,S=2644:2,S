shitty stacks are a common reason for networked applications,
particularly on non-server variants of windows that are intentionally
crippled for "revenue optimization" in redmond:
http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/WindowsBufferProblems

my suggestion is to use a virtual machine.  you could copy a
statically linked mixmaster to any number of existing virtual
appliances: http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/

customizing / managing virtual machines is a bit cumbersome right now
but these problems are being worked on and should address many
platform specific problems people encounter with network intensive
software like anonymous mixes / onion routers.
