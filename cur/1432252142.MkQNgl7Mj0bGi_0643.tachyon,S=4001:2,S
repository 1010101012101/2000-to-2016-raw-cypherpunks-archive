Wow,
    thats kind of an interesting read.. especially using the technique
of tagging the wallets with another easily recognizable amount to make
them easy to trace.

It would seem the the blockchain which protects against double spending
but is entirely public and unblinded(in a chaumian cryptographic
blinding sense) and the fact that one can unilaterally pay a particular
wallet a recognizable amount..

It would seem that one simple could leave that amount behind(since it is
EASY to identify and simply transfer the rest of the funds into ever
smaller wallets and exchange those face to face at buttonwood meetings etc

    formerly we used to classify an electronic anonymous currency
by saying "its good enough for assassination politics"..

   Bitcoin is not NEARLY good(safe) enough for AP... sorry

   GH

ps is lucky present?

and TC MAY get your ass out of the woodwork and post damn it...
