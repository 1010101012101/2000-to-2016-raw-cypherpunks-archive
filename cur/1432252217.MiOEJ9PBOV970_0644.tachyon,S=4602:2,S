I've said it elsewhere.. The legally accepted way to launder money is hide
it in high-frequency trades. Why would you want to trade on a centralized 
and reporting-to-the-regulators exchange?

Well, its the perfect (and only) place to gain a sufficiently large anonymity
set, and then when the exchange goes bust and large amounts are 'stolen' the
entire corrupt Bitcoin 1% cartel now has plausible deniability that they were
ever involved in Silk Road, or that fiat money bankers engineered the crash
and subsequent 'ressurection' and additional 10x price jump you'll see in 
6 to 9 months.

See, it WAS those evil anonymous and distributed hackers that did it, really,
not us central disaster capitalism planners.


At least us farmers who remember the energy crisis, the farm crisis, the 
following mortgage crisis, and now the Bitcoin crisis sorta see a pattern
here.

My long-term bets are on more disaster capitalism when the great lakes 
freeze and the artic melts, and that the real money is in political theatre.
