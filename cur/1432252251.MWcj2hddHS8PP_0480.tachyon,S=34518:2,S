the Mediterranean region with colleagues from Granada University, Spain. =
He has identified, in south east Spain, the erosion surface that formed w=
hen the Mediterranean Sea dried up, revealing the timing and conditions s=
urrounding this dramatic event. It is widely accepted that the Mediterran=
ean Sea dried up near the end of the Miocene, about 6 million years ago (=
Messinian Stage), depositing large thicknesses of evaporites. The only co=
nnection the Mediterranean has with the world oceans is via the Straits o=
f Gibraltar and without this influx of Atlantic water the Mediterranean c=
ould dry up completely in less than about 2000 years. The initial evidenc=
e for the Messinian Salinity Crisis event came from deep-sea drilling whi=
ch discovered the evaporites. Information from the deep Mediterranean alo=
ne, however, has never been sufficient to elucidate all the details of th=
is dramatic event. (continues).  =

 desiccation. These data are supported by magneto- and lithostratigraphy =
that have been integrated at a single continuous section. Not only do the=
se discoveries question the existing foraminiferal biozone stratigraphy, =
they also suggest new models for the dispersal of planktonic species. We =
propose that Globorotalia puncticulata and perhaps even Globorotalia marg=
aritae evolved in the Mediterranean during earliest Messinian times (duri=
ng or before chron C3Bn1n) and dispersed into the Atlantic. This suggests=
 that a marine connection remained between the two sea areas until at lea=
st chron C3An.1n. Using the existing geomagnetic polarity time scale, the=
se occurrences are some 2Ma earlier than previously recorded in the Medit=
erranean. The distribution of G. margaritae and G. puncticulata in Medite=
rranean sections is likely to reflect palaeoenvironment or the preservati=
on of deposits rather than the absolute age of the sediments. =

n salinity crisis is proposed. Two types of evaporite deposition may be d=
istinguished: those in marginal areas vs. those in basinal ones. Their di=
achroneity is deduced from the stratigraphic relationships linking these =
evaporites to a major Messinian erosional surface. A two-step model is pr=
oposed for the evolution of the salinity crisis through time. During the =
first phase (from 5.75 to 5.60 Ma), the deposition of marginal evaporites=
 took place in response to a modest sea-level fall; in the second interva=
l (from 5.60 to 5.32 Ma), the Mediterranean basin became isolated. During=
 this later period, the deposition of basinal evaporites and the cutting =
of the Mediterranean canyons took place. =

 Study - Messinian Salinity Crisis.</A> - McClelland & Butler (Leeds) =

The Messinian 'salinity crisis' marked a dramatic climate change in the M=
editerranean region. Many authors have considered this to have been a ver=
y rapid and catastrophic event. We have magnetostratigraphic data from fi=
ve sections from the Neogene Caltanissetta basin, Sicily, which contain t=
he early Messinian Tripoli formation and the transition to overlying Calc=
are di Base shallow water carbonates that mark the start of evaporite dep=
osition. Our correlations demonstrate considerable diachroneity in onset =
of evaporite formation over the studied region. Evaporites were deposited=
 first at about 6.8 Ma in the highest perched basins in the north of the =
region, and the progressive fall in sea level took about 0.6 Ma to traver=
se the palaeoslope in the ancient Caltanissetta basin. Furthermore, publi=
shed Sr isotope data places the evaporites from the deep Mediterranean at=
 about 5.5 Ma, suggesting that the whole period of draw-down and evaporat=
ion of the Mediterranean basin took up to 1.5 Ma, and was not a catastrop=
hic, rapid environmental change. =

1993): Messinian facies relations in the San Miguel de Salinas Basin, SE-=
Spain. - Z. dt. geol. Ges., 144: 352-369. Abstract: According to several =
authors, the Neogene basins in SE-Spain represent the connection between =
the Atlantic Ocean and the deep desiccated Mediterranean Sea during the "=
Messinian salinity crisis". The vast amounts of water required to precipi=
tate the thick Messinian evaporites are thought to have cascaded through =
the cataract-like basins of the Betic Strait and a final waterfall into t=
he Mediterranean Basin.
Within the San Miguel de Salinas Basin, which represents the easternmost =
basin of the Betic Strait, a successive shallowing of the marine depositi=
onal environment can be shown for the Late Tortonian and Messinian. Thick=
 marine Tortonian marls are increasingly superimposed by calcareous areni=
tes during the Early Messinian. These are succeeded in the central part o=
f the basin by the formation of the characteristic Messinian selenitic gy=
psum. The different sulfate facies are considered to be of primary and se=
condary origin. In the marginal parts of the basin primarily platform car=
bonates developed, including some pre-evaporitic Porites reefs. The Messi=
nian succession is concluded by calcareous arenites, oolites, stromatolit=
es and marls that can be correlated with the "Terminal Carbonate Complex"=

 marine conditions up into the Pliocene. There is no evidence for strong =
one-way water flow, as should be expected for a cataract basin.

he Geological Society of London, 156, 827-835. Abstract: The Messinian "s=
alinity crisis" which affected the Mediterranean represents one of the mo=
st dramatic examples of base-level fluctuation known in the geological re=
cord: an amplitude of perhaps 2 km within a stage with a duration of less=
 than 2 Ma.  Deposits within the Caltanissetta Basin of central Sicily ar=
e used to calibrate the duration and timing of these fluctuations. Two su=
ccessions of evaporites termed "First Cycle" and "Second Cycle" are separ=
ated by an inter-regional unconformity. The first cycle is regionally reg=
ressive while the second is transgressive. Chronostratigraphic calibratio=
n of these deposots has been provided by a linked magnetostratigraphic, s=
tructural and sedimentological study. The regression was protracted. The =
earliest evaporites in our study accumulated early in Chron C3Ar (pre 6.8=
8 Ma) and the youngest accumulated late in chron C3An (post 6.0 Ma). Duri=
ng this interval the basinward shift in coastline was 70 km and in vertic=
al section implies a relative fall in sea level at 0.3-0.4 m ka -1. Lowst=
and probably finally occurred at 5.8-5.5 Ma. Transgression, marked by acc=
umulation of the "second cycle" deposits, which all record reversed magne=
tizations (C3r), apparently occurred far more rapidly (200 ka), prior to =
the return to "normal" marine conditioins in the central Mediterranean la=
te in Chron C3r. Local rates of tectonic deformation  are relatively slow=
 within the thrust belt which underlies the Caltanissetta Basin. Therefor=
e, it is likely that the timing and rates of the Messinian "salinity cris=
is" on Sicily are generally applicable to other basin in the region and h=
elp to underpin rates of climatic change within this part of the Neogene.=

gnals in the sedimentary succession of marginal basins using Sr isotopes:=
 an example from the Messinian salinity crisis, Eastern Mediterrranean. J=
ournal of the Geological Society of London, 156, 847-854. Abstract: The e=
volution of oceanic Sr-87/Sr-86 through the Tertiary has been sufficientl=
y well documented to provide a useful stratigraphic tool for carbonate-ri=
ch marine sediments which were deposited in basins connected to the globa=
l oceans. In isolated basins, sea water Sr-87/Sr-86 Will diverge from coe=
val oceanic values; thus if independent age information exists, the geoch=
emical signature can constrain the timing of isolation. In marginal basin=
s formed in tectonically active settings, the timing of isolation is crit=
ical to the assessment of the relative importance of climate or tectonic =
controls on that event. Previously, isolation has been assumed to coincid=
e with the last occurrence of open marine fauna. However, in an example f=
rom the Eastern Mediterranean, Sr-87/Sr-86 data challenge that assumption=
 and can be interpreted as indicating a protracted period of isolation (c=
=2E 3 Ma), during which time marine conditions prevailed, prior to the Me=
ssinian salinity crisis at the end of the Miocene. This allows tectonic a=
nd climatic signals to be distinguished, since although convergence of Af=
rica with Eurasia was responsible for isolation of this part of the Medit=
erranean, it is more likely that later climatic change triggered desiccat=
ion. =

Abstract: The stratigraphic record of climatic and palaeoceanographic cha=
nges in the Mediterranean during the late Messinian is controversial. On =
Sicily, sedimentary facies show a steady transgression, suggesting that s=
ub-basins were hydrodynamically linked to a larger water body. Here we te=
st this hypothesis using strontium isotope studies from Messinian materia=
ls collected from a range of sites in the Caltanissetta Basin of central =
Sicily. The strata include a regionally regressive 'First Cycle' of early=
-mid-Messinian age and a younger, transgressive 'Second Cycle'. These cyc=
les are separated by an inter-regional unconformity which may be correlat=
ed with base-level low stand in the Mediterranean. Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios for=
 all First Cycle gypsum fail within the expected global marine compositio=
n (0.70891-0.70897). All Second Cycle analyses fall within a grouping of =
significantly lower values (0.70868-0.70878), a surprisingly tight but di=
screpant grouping for data collected from shells of a brackish water faun=
a and from gypsum. Analyses from these different Second Cycle materials a=
re statistically indistinguishable. These results indicate that the stron=
tium isotopic composition of waters from different sub-basins on Sicily a=
re indistinguishable regardless of salinity during the late Messinian. Th=
erefore these basins must have mixed with a larger, homogenized reservoir=
 which we infer was the ancestral Mediterranean. Thus circum-Mediterranea=
n basins may indeed chart regional palaeoceanographic and climatic events=
=2E By the end of Messinian times the base-level of the Mediterranean was=
 within the range of the world's oceans but the water-body probably had a=
 distinctly different but internally homogeneous strontium isotopic compo=
sition.

n surface on-land in southeast Spain. Sedimentary Geology, 123, 1-7. =

Abstract: The result of sea level fall at the margins of the Mediterranea=
n during the Late Miocene 'Salinity Crisis' was the creation of an extens=
ive erosion surface. However, the shape of this 'Salinity Crisis' unconfo=
rmity reflects local factors and in turn significantly determined local c=
onditions during subsequent reflooding. At Sorbas, in southeast Spain, er=
osional overdeepening of a pre-existing basin during drawdown created a d=
epression over 200 m deep with an incised floor patterned by 30-m-deep gu=
llies. During reflooding this semi-enclosed palaeovalley temporarily beca=
me a barred basin in which gypsum was deposited. These Sorbas evaporites =
thus resulted from local basin sculpture. Diverse local effects elsewhere=
 during drawdown and reflooding account for marked stratigraphic variatio=
ns that continue to complicate recognition and correlation of the 'Salini=
ty Crisis' in marginal successions. The drawdown erosion surface is itsel=
f the key indicator of this important event in marginal Mediterranean bas=
ins. =

asin, Sorbas, southeastern Spain. Marine Geology, 146, 1-20. =

Abstract: The extent, timing and effects of Late Miocene desiccation and =
evaporite deposition in the Mediterranean Sea remain controversial. Margi=
nal basins containing Messinian (5.3-7.1 Ma) sequences now exposed onland=
 supplement information from the deep Mediterranean, but have evaporites =
of a variety of ages. Some of these Messinian evaporites pre-date, and ot=
hers post-dale, deep desiccation. None appears to be exactly coeval with =
those of the deep Mediterranean. In the Betic Cordillera of southern Spai=
n, basins (e.g. Granada Basin) far from the present-day Mediterranean los=
t connection with the Mediterranean due to uplift similar to 1 Ma before =
the Salinity Crisis, and have marine evaporites of early, not late, Messi=
nian age. In contrast, basins such as the Sorbas Basin in southeastern Sp=
ain, adjacent to the present-day Mediterranean, record events directly re=
flecting the course of the Salinity Crisis. The Sorbas Basin retained mar=
ine connection with the western Mediterranean up until evaporative drawdo=
wn in the mid-Messinian and was rapidly reflooded immediately afterwards.=
 The Sorbas Messinian sequence is up to 320 m thick. It is complete and n=
ormal marine, except for an incised basin wide erosion surface overlain b=
y a 130 m thick gypsum deposit. We propose that this surface marks the in=
terval of deep desiccation of the adjacent Mediterranean basin. Erosion o=
ccurred shortly after 5.9 Ma and the irregular unconformity has relief of=
 at least 240 m, confirming Mediterranean drawdown significantly below th=
e Atlantic level. Sorbas gypsum deposits overlie the unconformity and are=
 intercalated with marls estimated at similar to 5.5 Ma containing normal=
 marine Messinian biotas. These gypsum deposits therefore post-date deep =
desiccation and formed in a silled basin immediately following marine ref=
looding. They mark the end of the Salinity Crisis and are overlain by 70 =
m of normal marine sediments containing unreworked foraminifers of latest=
 Messinian age. This succession demonstrates that the Salinity Crisis occ=
urred faster and was completed sooner than previously believed. It took p=
lace within similar to 0.4 Ma (time-scale of Berggren et al., 1995b, is s=
imilar to 0.2 Ma on the time-scale of Baksi, 1993) and was completed befo=
re the end of the Messinian. This corrects previous views that the Salini=
ty Crisis continued until the Early Pliocene. There is no evidence in the=
 Sorbas Basin for brackish 'Lago Mare' conditions, and the normal marine =
biotas that directly precede and follow drawdown rebut earlier suggestion=
s of prolonged salinity effects. =
