First, I like to think the 1st Amendment includes the right to _receive_
anonymously, as well as send/publish -- which implicates anonymous digital
cash. Second, sounds like _Lamont_, but it's content-neutral on its face. In
_Lamont_ the postal tried to make people "sign up" in order to receive
communist propaganda. Not surprisingly, people hesitated....
LAMONT @

&page=301.

They will argue the statute is content-neutral, aimed at secondary effects,
and withstands intermediate scrutiny....

trying to impart to me. Ah.
