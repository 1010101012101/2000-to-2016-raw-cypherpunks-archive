If something like cryptosporydium gets in the water,as it did in 
sydney,au,a few years back,probably from dead foxes,then look forward to an 
increase in burns admissions to casualty.Boiling water accidents went up 
sharply.Get that Hilary/OZ style health plan going soon if your smart,like 
I know your not.Kill the president,mattd.

"a possible charge of "criminal association in
relation to a terrorist enterprise" would cover anyone suspected
of having acted as Mattd's accomplice, officials said."
