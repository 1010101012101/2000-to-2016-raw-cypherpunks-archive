You can get dust rising off the mountain ---find the video of the Paki
tests.  But not a big rising cloud.

An underground test is a few *hundred* meters below surface.
And sometimes you get a chimney of crumbled rock leading to
either a crater or a dome on the surface, depending on the
rock type; Nevada is pockmarked with them.    But no big
cloud.
