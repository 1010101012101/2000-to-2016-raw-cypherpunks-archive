Whoever you are in reality, your naivete is breathtaking.

Why are they looting? To get free stuff.

(More intelligent teams were apparently moved in once the looting 
started. I just got a communication that professional thieves from 
Cairo and Damascus were quick to realize the opportunities of 
plundering the national museums and private homes. The silver Harp of 
Ur alone is worth $4 million.)

This looting and collapse is a consequence of the sacking of Baghdad. 
Perhaps it's part of the plan. Burn off several million useless eaters 
and maybe there's a chance for a more compliant U.S. client state.

As Anne Coulter and her fellow republidykes have suggested, invade 
their country, take their oil, give their children blue eyes, convert 
them all to Christianity, and kill those who don't convert.
