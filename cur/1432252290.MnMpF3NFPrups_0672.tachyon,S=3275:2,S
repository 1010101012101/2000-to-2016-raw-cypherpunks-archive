I've been told that entrust is embedding CAST-256, but this don't seem to
matter that much.  I wouldn't be surprised if RSA did the same with RC6; it is
much less probable that IBM or Counterpane do this regarding MARS and Twofish,
respectively. Counterpane lists several products known to implement Twofish.
The shareware library MIRACL includes Rijndael for a long time now.  I don't
think it's difficult to find more examples.

Paulo.
