It is really intesting that there is a real exchange for this game,
but trading game-gold and so on for real world money is surely nothing
new. Ebay does it all the time.

Surely it'll regulate itself. As in, if it becomes easy to print money
inside the game, the money will just be less valuable. People will pay
less real money for it.

I probably need to sit down and come up with a real reply to this ...
but I'm just wondering how this is so different from any external
trading that almost all online games have [obviously the exchange is
one factor...].
