I think "common carrier" status was orignally conceived to allow access by all to an asset which is a "natural monopoly". Thus the owner of the monopoly, in return for having it sanctioned by the government,is required to do business with all.  He is not held liable for certain results because he is required to forego normal business judgement about with whom to do business.  As remailers are not in any sense a "natural mononoply" the common carrier rational for not holding the remailer liable for the results of doing business with particular parties would not apply.  Nor for that matter would the monopoly grounds for the government regulation of remailers exist.  Though I supppose the government has expanded the concept of common carrier to expand its regulatory grasp I don't think it could be expanded so far as to include remailers, but I don't know current case law on this question.

Agreed, its hard to imagine a grounds for government regulation here that doesn't infringe on the first amendment.

Of course when it comes to defining concepts from economics and law I defer to Faustine and Aimee.  Unfortunately they seem, like cops, to never be around when you need them.
