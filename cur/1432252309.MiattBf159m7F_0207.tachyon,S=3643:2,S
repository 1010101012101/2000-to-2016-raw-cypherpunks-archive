P2P nodes are ephemeral, the content is not. A short message hop from node
to node is in the second range. Assuming the message doesn't sit on the
node too long (running danger of it being pulled) and there are multiple
redundant messages in transit (you wanted more idle traffic? here's is
your idle traffic) the probability of delivery should be higher than the
current remailers'.

Ask Google for XML-RPC and Freenet and/or Mojo Nation.
