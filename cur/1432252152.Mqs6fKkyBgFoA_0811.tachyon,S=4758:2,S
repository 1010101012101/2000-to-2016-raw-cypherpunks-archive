Can the program be thrown off with masks?  If so, how about making some of 
those advertisement fans with the pictures of random people wanted for 
parking tickets on them, then walk through that end of town.  Possibly 
better yet would be fliers, balloons, and bumper stickers.  These could be 
given away to people in areas that don't particulary trust the local police 
anyway, or simply applied to cars of people who frequent areas such as the 
employee parking of the local court house.

Either could be distributed to bars.

Can the things be fooled by using black markers to add shadows where there 
should be none?  Will painted on faces become the new rage in Tampa?  I can 
just see people wearing "war paint", some to avoid the cameras, the rest 
because it's fashionable.

#    No one expected it to apply, too, to America. Yet, here it is. It is
#    far more sinister than people realize. As one reader already mentioned
#    in one thread: " this can readily be used for people carrying guns."
#    That, and the identification of members of the NRA, JPFO, GOA, North
#    Caucus, CCOPS, RKBA, and instant notification of the street cop in the
#    vicinity, and we have a far more THOROUGH Tyranny than even the North
#    Caucus envisioned when it began warning the people and government some
#    years ago.
#
#    Our question, this time: "how accurate are paint guns? Seriously.
#    Could a
#    good shot peg these cameras from the street below?" We have similar
#    cameras
#    in a towns in Georgia, watching traffic for people running stop
#    lights. How long before those cameras are silently hooked into this
#    network for face recognition?
#
#    It's time for civil disobedience.
#    1) Arm yourselves in anticipation of a governmental advance on your
#    firearms.
#    2) Get paint gun specialists to try these cameras.
#    3) WARN the governments, local, state and national, that we won't stay
#    put
#       for such tyranny as they envision.
