Even the most moronic suicide bomber (after all, you have
to be a moron to be one) would use an explosive belt
or vest, with loose garments above.

Of course they're afraid, and under a great deal
of emotional stress.

The current level of paranoia does not improve the security,
yet causes considerable damage to the travel industry and
travelers. Come on, ethyl nitrate has been an old hat
in 1980s, and it's trivial to form nitrate-less explosives
as hardcase luggage. They didn't even think of training dogs for
TATP, which is what I used to blow things up, as a kid,
using RF teledetonation. As Schneier said, this is pure
security theater. And even a lousy play, as these go.

There are no real terrorists, orelse our civilisation would
cease to exist.

I've followed up on all so-called terrorist plots as reported
by the local press, and none of them was credible. None.
I wouldn't be surprised if a fair fraction of them was pure
fabrication, or false flag operations.

Why this is being done should be obvious.
