I hope people will forgive me for tooting my own horn. =C2=A0I was a minarc=
hist Libertarian in 1994,not an anarchist Libertarian. =C2=A0But it wasn't =
because I somehow wanted to keep around someminimal government. =C2=A0Rathe=
r, it was because I couldn't figure out a logically-consistent method'to en=
tirely get rid of those last vestiges of government. =C2=A0Lacking such an =
plausible method,I chose the intellectually-honest route of accepting (at t=
he time) that some residual governmentwould be necessary.
While not specifically aware of David Friedman's (son of famous economist M=
ilton Friedman)"Hard Problem" =C2=A0http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/200=
9/04/will_david_frie.html=C2=A0 =C2=A0, from his=C2=A0book, "The Machinery =
of Freedom" (1973; revised in 1989; again 2014), =C2=A0I was effectivelyawa=
re of the =C2=A0same barrier, and like Friedman, I could not see any soluti=
on. =C2=A0Anarchy, I=C2=A0concluded, was impractical, and unachievable.=C2=
=A0
It's a good thing that I wasn't aware of Friedman's "Hard Problem", or the =
idea it was "hard".In January 1995 I because to contemplate the idea that t=
urned into my "AssassinationPolitics" essay. =C2=A0 https://cryptome.org/ap=
.htm=C2=A0=C2=A0
=C2=A0=C2=A0I wasn't intending to solve that problem: =C2=A0Rather, I was t=
rying to figure out howan otherwise-powerless public could defend itself fr=
om bad acts, mostly from governmentemployees. =C2=A0I realized that to comb=
ine the contributions of anonymous individuals, =C2=A0allowsthat public can=
 deter and prevent those bad acts. =C2=A0I further realized that this syste=
m wouldbe extremely economical, allowing (for instance) the region known as=
 "America" to defenditself, not merely from external threats, but also inte=
rnal crime, probably for a total cost of=C2=A0under $1 billion per year, fa=
r less than the $600 billion in defense spending currently done.

A simplistic, initial analysis (which I initially assumed, even before I wr=
ote the first part of theAP essay) was that AP would simply fix government.=
 =C2=A0But the ultimate "fix" was actually farmore powerful than I'd initia=
lly realized, not merely fixing governments, but destroying allgovernments,=
 and thus protecting an anarchist or minarchist region from threatening=C2=
=A0neighbors.
Put simply, I solved David Friedman's "Hard Problem". =C2=A0I haven't yet s=
een the 2014 revisionof his book, Machinery of Freedom, to see if he has ac=
knowledged this yet. =C2=A0 =C2=A0I think it wouldbe extraordinarily strang=
e if he doesn't do so: =C2=A0After all, ostensibly we are on the same sideo=
f this matter. =C2=A0He advocates a zero-government solution: =C2=A0Why wou=
ldn't he cite a proofthat a zero-government solution is actually possible, =
contrary to his apparent previousopinion?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machinery_of_Freedom=C2=A0
But in effect, I think I was quite correct, pre-1995, for me =C2=A0to belie=
ve that anarchy was=C2=A0impractical. =C2=A0 I don't know how people who la=
belled themselves as 'anarchists' =C2=A0resolvedthe apparent contradiction.=
 =C2=A0Were they aware that anarchy wasn't stable? =C2=A0(At least notabsen=
t my 1995 invention, AP). =C2=A0 Most likely I think they were simply unawa=
re that anarchywasn't going to be stable. =C2=A0Or, perhaps they assumed th=
at then-future events would somehowsolve the problem. =C2=A0As, ultimately,=
 they did, but it didn't have to be that way. =C2=A0I, virtually byaccident=
, solved that problem. =C2=A0But things could have been very different.
