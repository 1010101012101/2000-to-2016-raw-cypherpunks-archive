Boeing may have the biggest drone so far.  It is an airship, flying cell
tower.

The Phantom Eye: 

*	wingspans of 150 feet;
*	gross takeoff weight of 10,000 pounds; 
*	room for up to a 450 pound payload; 
*	two four-cylinder engines each providing about 150 horsepower. It
runs on liquid hydrogen, not only making it greener than the rest of the
U.S. military's drone fleet, but, Boeing believes, three times more
energy-efficient. 
*	Most drones are lucky if they can stay aloft for a day at a stretch.
The Phantom Eye aims to stay in the air for up to five days, and about three
times higher - at 60,000 feet.

 

Flying cell towers can have two functions:

*	Surveillance society listen in on everyone's phone calls;
*	Disaster response, fly over where there was just an earthquake, or
severe weather, to provide cell phone tower service, until ground
infrastructure has been repaired.

i-phone can be a ground station for drone control.

mobile-ground-station-for-drones 

 

Add to our acronym list: LaWS = Laser Weapons System 

The Navy calls it a "directed energy pulse weapon."

on-ships-in-2014/ 

Other nations have done lots of research with lasers as weapons, and I
believe the US has done so as far back as Reagan's Star Wars, but apparently
it is a first for US Navy ships to have lasers to defend them against
drones.

 

I do not believe this will protect the navy from underwater drones.

 

Bad weather can allegedly mess with laser quality, but I believe science has
the ability to distort a beam at launch point to compensate for what the
weather is about to do.

 

Each "bullet" costs $ 1.

Each "gun" costs $ 32 million.

 

To put that $32 million in perspective, consider some alternatives:

 

*                    $1.5 Trillion = how much USA has so far invested in the
War on Drugs, in 40 years, according to link at footnote.[1]

*                    $1 Trillion = how much USA has so far invested in the
War on Drugs, with nothing to show for it, in terms of any change in volume
of people addicted & consuming the stuff, according to Rep John Conyers
(D-Michigan) in a Congress hearing I saw on C-Span.

*                    $400 Billion = estimated size of future civilian drone
market.[2]

*                    $24 Billion = DoD Budget request[3] for drones
2010-2015

*                    $16 Billion (more than) = DoD plans to spend 2008-2013
to improve drone technology & acquire more of them.[4]

*                    $6 Billion = US Navy budget for Drones.[5]

*                    $4 Billion = How much NATO plans to spend on drones
over the next 20 years.[6]

*                    $3 Billion = How much the USA spent on unmanned
aircraft in 2010.[7]

*                    $3 Billion, or 37% = increase in costs beyond initial
estimates, for Pentagon acquisitions.[8]

*                    $1.4 Billion = investments in improvements to US drone
base in Djibouti.[9]

*                    $1 Billion (Canadian) = Starting Budget for Canadian
Drone fleet.[10]

*                    $200 million = Cost of Navy Drone which crashed June
2012 in Maryland.

*                    $100 million = what the USA would save each year, if
the detainees were transferred from Gitmo to Super Max inside USA.

*                    $ 1.5 million from NASA to whoever can first perfect
the Jetson's vehicle.[11]

*                    $30,000 to $50,000 is the expected cost of a small
drone for use by a police dept, which is about the same as what they expect
to pay for a police car.[12]
