Subject: Re: [liberationtech] Thoughts on decentralized DNS,
	and OpenNIC particularly?

Thanks for this, really helpful. My purpose in doing this is to figure out
what the most practical/quickest to deployment solution is for distributed
DNS records, so this is definitely useful.

I looked at both namecoin and CJDNS. Looks like namecoin has attracted most
of the developers from the initial project, with CJDNS still limping along
(I'm guessing based on activity here.)

Links to the code:
namecoin: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/graphs/impact
CJDNS: https://github.com/vinced/namecoin/graphs/impact

Could you speak to the structure of namecoin a bit more? Looks like it uses
the "proof-of-work" trick from bitcoin to validate DNS records (and
arbitrary key-value pairs), unless my skimming was totally off. That's
pretty ingenious, for those who are interested I found a great blog post
that serves both as an introduction to Bitcoin and explains how it could be
used to make a distributed DNS.

http://paulbohm.com/2011/06/17/bitcoins-value-is-decentralization

It appears they're also proposing integrating with providers like OpenNIC,
OpenDNS, etc. although I'm not qualified to judge how feasible that is.
http://dot-bit.org/Project_Roadmap They also share computing resources with
current bitcoin generators.... seems they've thought of everything.


Someone mentioned DNSSEC in a new off-shoot thread. DNSSEC within the
existing DNS paradigm is only a half-measure (although I think you'll
agree, an important one.)


*Notes on other dDNS providers:*
So besides namecoin and CJDNS, there's also Dot-P2p, the dDNS system that
was proposed based on the BitTorrent protocol. Some info was here:
http://p2pfoundation.net/Dot-P2P but the link to
http://dot-p2p.org/index.php?title=Main_Page looks dead. The first hit
Googling "distributed dns" brings up another codebase that hasn't been
modified seemingly since 2005 (
http://sourceforge.net/projects/distributeddns/files). I checked out DIANNA
as well, but didn't see a link to active code so assumed it was mostly
dead. http://dianna-project.org/wiki/Main_Page
