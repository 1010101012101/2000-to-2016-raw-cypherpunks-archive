The only people making threats online are either idiots or agents
provocateurs.

This applies to all anonymizing and traffic hiding services, all
of which are compromised, witting or unwitting, the more popular
and trusted the greater the compromise. Lesson one of comsec,
trusted systems are the best source for entrapment.

No trap works better than to promise confidentiality, untraceability,
anonymity, invulnerable communications, slathered with endorsements
by best of reputations, vast numbers of users, webs of trust, face-to-face
key signings, bragging about never being breached except for an
obligatory caution that no system is absolutely secure, beware of
faulty implementation -- the favorite exculpation of designers and
promoters chanting "unavoidable fixes underway, be patient, help
us test and improve. sign up for volunteering into our database of
the willing to sacrifice nymity for being part of something very, very
important to freedom."
