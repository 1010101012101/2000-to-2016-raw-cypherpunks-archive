Subject: [EMED-L] abuse of ed's

I HAVE READ WITH GREAT DISMAY CONCERNING THE ABUSE OF OUR NATIONS ED'S WHICH BY THE WAY HAS INCREASED THE WORK LOAD FOR US ALL.
THERE IS ABUSE BY MILLIONS EVERYDAY WHO KNOW THEY CAN GO TO THE ED WITH FALSE CREDENTIALS, LIE ABOUT WHO THEY ARE, OR JUST REFUSE TO PAY THE FEE AT THERE PHYSICIANS OFFICE, WITH THE RESULT BEING THAT WE AS ED PHYSICIANS GET THE ULTIMATE  'DUMP'. THIS WILL NEVER GET FIXED UNTIL THERE IS SOME FORM OF REQUIRED NATIONAL ID CARD THAT YOU MUST PRESENT UPON ARRIVAL TO THE ED WHICH VERIFIES WHO YOU ARE WITH A UPDATED CORRECT ADDRESS, AND THE APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW THIS TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT THREAT OF SUIT BY THE PATIENT. PATIENTS HAVE RIGHTS YES, BUT NOT THE RIGHT TO ABUSE OR COMMIT FRAUD.
