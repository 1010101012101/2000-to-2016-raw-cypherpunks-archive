> ++ Much ado about peering
>    7:04:31 pm
> 
>    The NANOG list has recently carried some close-to-the-ground mes-
>    sages on the murky and little-understood world of ISP peering.
>    Someone notified Dave Farber (the Paul Revere of the Internet [1]),
>    and readers of his IP list enjoyed this piece of apparent news [2].
>    Now unless the tech reporters read NANOG, the media will probably
>    pick up the story, reporting that UUNet has at last published its
>    requirements for peering and the world will be a better place.
> 
>    For the record, there's no news here.
> 
>    Background: in the earliest days of the commercial Net, at the point
>    when the phrase "Internet backbone" ceased to have a well-defined
>    meaning, the largest ISPs met at public exchange points [3] and
>    swapped traffic for free. Soon the largest of the large were ex-
>    changing for free only among themselves; they began charging to
>    take the traffic of smaller carriers. In 1997 TBTF marked [4] the
>    point at which the next smaller fish, tier-2 carriers, began to
>    charge exchange fees to the still smaller downstream regionals and
>    ISPs.
> 
>    In recent years, as Net traffic has continued its wild growth,
>    peering arrangements have gotten increasingly complicated. It used
>    not to be possible for a mid-sized carrier to discover anything
>    about the peering policies of the big guys without signing a non-
>    disclosure agreements and engaging in exhaustive price negotiations.
> 
>    The piece that caught Farber's eye was news of UUNet's publication
>    of its peering standards [5]. This event was neither the first of
>    its kind -- Genuity had published their standards [6] last fall, as
>    a Farber follow-up mentioned -- nor was it particularly meaningful
>    for mid-tier ISPs. As one of NANOG's stalwarts posted [7], knowing
>    what a tier-1's peering policies are is not the same as obtaining a
>    peering agreement with one of them. UUNet's publicly disclosed
>    policy will simply make it easier for smaller carriers to rule out
>    the possibility of ever peering with the giant.
