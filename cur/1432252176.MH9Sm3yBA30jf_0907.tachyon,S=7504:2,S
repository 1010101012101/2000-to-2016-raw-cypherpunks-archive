I don't understand this idea, at all. (I don't like the current tribler,
its decentralized search is a throwback to all the gnutella systems of the
past; I think bittorrent is showing that there is still a need for
centralized repository with control)

What are the proxy nodes? Is it like Tor with only volunteers? Is it like
Freenet where every user is a proxy? Or are they themselves the proxy
servers?

Also, I think they are basically doing two things that are in opposition -
making bittorrent faster and making it more anonymous.

This will not work.
