A fair amount of the redactions of the Scott Marcus declaration
can be restored by using the various Klein statements, releases 
and declarations, the ATT filing which had liftable redactions,
Wired's releases, and the recent Salon article.

For example, Coderman guessed here a 3-letter redaction  could 
be "tap," while it is actually "SG3," the acronym for "Study Group 3." 

This is disclosed in the ATT filing which had a liftable redaction 
referring to a redacted sentence in the Marcus declaration.

"Study Group 3" is also one of the common redactions in the
Marcus doc.

We're restoring others and will share or put on Cryptome. Help
welcomed.
