There's some guy ("German Guy") spouting some coherent-sounding conspiracy 
theories over here:

http://www.godlikeproductions.com/bbs/message.php?page=23&topic=10&message=54181&mpage=1&showdate=12/18/04

I wouldn't normally post something like this, but the guy's done a little 
bit of homework on a huge variety of topics, so it's really an excellent 
hoax, seen from a distance.

Here's on thing giving me some doubts, though (but of course if this is true 
he may have just pulled it from Google somewhere):

"Here4s another myth: you cannot hack bluetooth from a distance of more than 
40 metres. Not true. My technical partner Felix can crack it at over half a 
kilometre. Which is why he enjoys driving around so much in areas where we 
know British, American, Israeli or Russian ops are living or working. The 
great thing about many German cities is that most affordable residences are 
within metres of the street anyway."

Any comments?
