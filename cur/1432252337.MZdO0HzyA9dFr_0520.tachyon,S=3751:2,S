China does lots of things in various ways. Best educated guesses as to why
this is so are around lack of coordination internally and they like to
try new things to see how much under- or over-blocking happens. What's
been interesting is that I ran an IPv6-only host for the past year
and queried all sorts of banned terms and known-blocked sites without
issue. It seems China only focuses on IPv4 right now. When Huawei,
Cisco, ZTE, and others have an IPv6 firewalling solution, I'm sure the
censorship will expand to include IPv6 as well.
