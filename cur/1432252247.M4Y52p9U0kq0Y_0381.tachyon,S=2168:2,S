And what is the purpose of connecting the key and data storage in the first
place ?

Data storage is data storage, concealed or not. You feed encrypted data to/from
it.

Key is required at human interface and has absolutely nothing to do with the
storage.

If you want better security than passphrase, then you need a mechanical key
carrier. Indeed, that is where the word "key" comes from. You can store any
number on bits on it and you'll hand it over before they beat the shit out of
you - or  you may want to be brave and destroy it instead (trivial with
flash-on-chip and small battery cell), but, again, it has nothing to do with
storage of data.
