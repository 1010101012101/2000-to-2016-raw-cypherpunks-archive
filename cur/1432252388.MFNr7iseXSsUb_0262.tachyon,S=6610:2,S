Libertarian Party, and its organs, such as "Reason" Magazine, have not 
been libertarian for some considerable time.

As the inner party (Democrats) and the Outer Party (Republicans) 
continue to move left on racial and sexual differences and on sexual 
preferences, the "Libertarians" attempt to maintain a a "balanced" 
position between them - which means that they steadily move left on 
these issues, adopting ever less libertarian positions, positions that a 
decade or two ago would have been seen not merely as statist, but as 
insanely statist.

They theoretically support the abolition of welfare and open borders, 
but actually support open borders with welfare for underclass immigrant 
bastard spawn, a disturbingly different proposition.  In California, we 
are getting more Indios than Mestizos.  They did not work in Mexico, and 
even less are they working in California.

They theoretically support freedom of speech, but repression of speech 
on racial and sexual differences is just fine by them.

They theoretically oppose welfare, but do not actually oppose welfare.

They oppose profiling - you are allowed to reason about some matters, 
but not others.

The took a "balanced" position on the Zimmerman case

"President Obama spoke some undeniable truths when he noted that the 
African-American community’s intense reaction to the case must be seen 
in the context of a long, terrible history of racism"

"No one except Zimmerman knows whether he continued to track Martin—or, 
as he claims, headed back to his truck only to have Martin confront him. 
No one but Zimmerman knows who initiated physical violence"

In fact we have compelling forensic and circumstantial evidence that 
Zimmerman spoke the truth on both of these questions.  Reason Magazine 
is lying, they are merely lying less egregiously than the rest of the 
mainstream media.  Their position is "reasonable doubt", whereas in fact 
we have enough evidence to convict Martin Trayvon, a drug addled 
burglar, had he lived.

When discussing this case "Reason" regularly make the pious affirmation 
that the poor blacks are being victimized by evil whites, while, Martin 
Trayvon exemplifies black privilege, both in his reaction that Zimmerman 
dissed him by profiling him as the drug addled burglar that he in fact 
was, and in that for affirmative action reasons he was not charged with 
burglary under circumstances where a white boy at the same school would 
have certainly been charged with burglary.  (The government did not like 
the criminal system having disparate impact on the kids in that school, 
and were taking affirmative action measures to correct the disturbing 
fact that lots of black kids were being imprisoned, and few or no white 
kids - since equal discipline and law enforcement had unequal 
consequences, they were applying unequal discipline and law enforcement. )

When reason magazine discusses the curious anomalies leading to 
massively unequal university education for males and females, their 
explanation for all discrepancies favoring women is that women are 
wonderful, even though many of these discrepancies are demonstrably the 
result of systematic discrimination against males and intentional 
penalization of males for being male.

All increases in female representation in academia and decreases in male 
representation, are, according to reason magazine, sunshine, lollypops 
and rainbows, a manifestation of the fact that decreases in evil sexism 
now allow women to demonstrate their true abilities, which are of course 
equal to men, except that women, being wonderful, are a lot more equal 
than men.
