A common mechanism that they do use in Australia is an old school tie.
Such a mechanism can be readily adapted to anonymity.  For example one
could have anonymous credentials proving that this person is a member of a
certain group, credentials that the group can use to identify him as a
specific member of the group, but which outsiders cannot use to determine
which specific member of the group he is.
