Children can be terrorists.  Its the asymmetry, again.

"Terrorists are the only true avant-garde artists because they're the
only ones who are still capable of really surprising people."
---Laurie Anderson

"Never underestimate the stupidity of some of the people we have to deal

with," William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for the Bureau of

Export Administration, said while being grilled about whether terrorists

and criminals would be naove enough to use the technology being pushed
by
the Administration.

"Terrorism: deadly violence against humans and other living things,
usually conducted by government against its own people."
-- Edward Abbey
