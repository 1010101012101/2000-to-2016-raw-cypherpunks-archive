Agreed.  

I envision a day (background music swelling and eyes tearing slightly --
an obvious Oscar moment) when it matters little who the President-elect is, 
because DC is bound and emasculated by its original constitutional chains.
The day when the Pres has little more power than the Queen Mother.

(Of course the Clinton Administration's idea of a Queen Mother might
mean something altogether different ;-)  (tim: is a smiley face
acceptable as a meta-closing paren?)

That should be an easier problem to solve than getting people to accept
the validity of exotic crypto voting protocols.
