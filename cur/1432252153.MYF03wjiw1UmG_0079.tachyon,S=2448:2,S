Just wanted to clarify something for subscribers of cypherpunks@algebra.com.

If a message posted to cypherpunks and then sent to you bounces, and if the
bounce looks like a permanent problem (no such user, relaying denied, etc),
your adress will be removed from cypherpunks@algebra.com. feel free to
resubscribe whjen you resolve your problems.
