I believe that currently, they do cover people with genetic
abnormalities.  However, they have been trying for quite some time to
allow for discrimination based upon said abnormalities.

OK.  This lowers the amount of people the companies would be
discriminating aginst.  Therefore, the insurance company is saving
less money.  Therefore, we have more reason to force them to insure
said people, if it affects them less.

Like I've said before, people may be able to afford coverage without
being able to afford the care.

Why does it have to be a business?
