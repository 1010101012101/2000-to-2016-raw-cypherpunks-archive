I don't think my self-esteem will be greatly damaged by someone without
the balls to attach his own name to his message. When Tim called for a
fatwah against me a year ago, following a misunderstanding about
something I wrote, he at least had the balls to do so over his own name.

And now that I think about it, there's no real indication that you are a
"someone". Quite likely you're just a dumbassbot hiding behind an
anonymizer.
