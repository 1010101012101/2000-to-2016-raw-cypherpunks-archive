The threshold is a little higher, especially if you're not pushing a
cart
no where near a grocery story.

Ask them why they want it.  Then the social-linguistic ball is in their
court.
If they say something like, for an investigation, ask them why they're
suspicious
of you.  Put them on the defensive, ask them questions, learn what you
can.
If you're not pulled over while driving, *you* are in control, not them.

Don't be so cowered by uniforms.
