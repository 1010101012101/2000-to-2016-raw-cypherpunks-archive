In that particular story, art is not imitating life, but quoting from it.

The Onion story:
  http://www.theonion.com/onion3736/freedoms_curtailed.html
  "all Americans -- not just outspoken talk-show hosts like Bill Maher
  -- must watch what they say"

The WH spokesman's real quote:
  "There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch
   what they say, watch what they do, and this is not a time for remarks
  like that; there never is."
