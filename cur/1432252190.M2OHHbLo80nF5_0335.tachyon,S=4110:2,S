Or someone who works at a car insurance company - they (at least in MA) have
access to all that stuff.  If you have a good reason, you might even talk
someone into doing it without said "contribution".  If you know your agent
well, (assuming you have a car and insurance) you might even try calling them
up and asking if they know any simple way to get that information without
bending rules.
