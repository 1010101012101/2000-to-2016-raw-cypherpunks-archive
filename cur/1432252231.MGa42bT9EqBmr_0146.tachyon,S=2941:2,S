Yes, I understand all this - mushroom cloud != nuclear explosion.

If I were in Jong's slippers, I would not discuss it - I would just do it,
and let everyone draw their own [obvious] conclusion.  Remember, his
pattern has been to only discuss things (even when already obvious to
everyone else) only when _he_ felt like it.

This conflicts somewhat with a previously expressed opinion (Shaddack?).
I was under the impression that underground tests, unless performed with
very tiny nukes at very great depth, produced visible clouds from the
blast waves.
