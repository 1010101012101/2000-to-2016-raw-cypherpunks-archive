In other words, the cost of anything is the foregone alternative?

You get what you pay for?

:-)


The risk-adjusted transaction cost of a new payment mechanism, or of
any market using those payments, has to be significantly cheaper than
anything it replaces or nobody will give a damn. Think of the
enormous cost differential between batch or interactive book-entry
settlement and the former physical delivery of paper bearer
certificates if people want a good example of that kind of
supply-push phenomenon.

Path dependency, is, of course, a crock, or we wouldn't have
progress. The reason that Windows, or VHS, or QWERTY won is because
they're the same cost, or cheaper to use, than Mac, or Betamax, or
Dvorak, and just simply because everyone uses them already and
they're too 'stupid' or 'lazy' to change to something 'better'.

Nonetheless, the accumulated comparative advantage of a
currently-universal transaction method like book-entry settlement can
become considerable over time, which is why I don't think simple
anonymity, even in specialized internet markets, like those for
information goods and services -- or illegal transactions -- is going
to ever sell very well all by itself.

In order for the adoption of anonymous payments, universal or
otherwise, those payments have to be valuable to *everyone* in a
given marketplace. Even if early adopters might have special
circumstances for trying them in the beginning, those transactions
have to be cheaper, and less risky, than any other way of exchanging,
clearing, and settling a given transaction. That's for each and every
single user of that transaction, and not on some nebulous,
transfer-priced "social-cost" basis, but in the raw reduction of
transaction cost at the time of the transaction's execution, and in
the reduction of risk in the period between the transaction's
execution and its clearing and settlement.


Fortunately, there are lots pieces to the transaction-cost
calculation, and they are all breaking our way at the moment, hard
though that may be to see right now through all the smoke and debris
and panicked attempts to maintain order at the expense of personal
freedom.

As we saw during the multi-day NYSE "holiday" in September, the risk
of *not* having an instantaneously-settled, internet-dispersed
transaction mechanism has gone up considerably in the past month or
so. The resulting market distortion and its economic effects would
probably have even been worse if the NYSE had actually been up and
trading at the time. Millions of shares worth of transactions would
have executed, but might not have then been unable to clear or
settle, which could have caused damage to the entire planet's
financial system, collapsing float times and inter-market custodial
links being what they are these days.

This is nothing new for long-time subscribers to this list. As Eric
Hughes kept saying when I first got here in 1994, it is immediate and
final settlement that attracts the capital and payment system markets
to cryptographic protocols like Chaum's blind signatures, and not
particularly anonymity.

Of course, as cypherpunks probably knew even back then, if you set
out to create an instantly-settled network-dispersed transaction
settlement mechanism, you converge, quite rapidly, to the use of
internet-based financial cryptography protocols which create a
pre-authenticated bearer asset transfer, a transaction which
executes, clears, and settles all at once, and which, as a result, is
completely identity-independent. In fact, it's so secure that you can
do the transaction anonymously, which, not entirely coincidentally,
is what the best of those protocols were designed to do in the first
place. So, ceterus parabus, it's cheaper to operate these anonymously
than it is to operate them "transparently" by adding on ledgers and
audit trails to something that already works without them. And,
anonymity is what we end up with, whether it's what nation-states
want or not. Physics causes finance, which causes politics, and not
the other way around.

That, I believe, will be the great, thumping paradox in all of these
erstwhile constrictions on personal freedom.  The steadily increasing
requirement for absolutely secure, transaction-risk-free robust
transactions using the internet will eventually create transactions
that regulators can't use at all in law-enforcement, much less
repression, and precisely at the time regulators intend to rely on
increased transaction surveillance to accomplish their job the way
they used to. Even more strangely, the use of those transaction
protocols will be inexpensive because they don't require the
supervision of regulators -- at all -- in order to prevent
transaction fraud. Transparency, as a result, ends up increasing
risk-adjusted transaction cost, instead of reducing it.


So, that said, I disagree with the crypto-winter scenario, even
though as late as last week, and, certainly looking around in
September, I would have probably agreed with that distressing
assessment.  However, I do agree that it's probably time to crawl out
from the rubble and make stuff happen again, though for other reasons
than the crushing of individual liberty at the hands of a rapacious,
totalitarian nation-state...


There will almost certainly be further incidents of terrorism, but
even now they're already part of the universal background radiation,
as it were. If bin Laden and company had nukes they would have used
them by now, for instance. If someone, Moslem or not, had figured out
a way to aerosolize biochemical agents, rather than putting them into
the mail, they would have done that by now as well. It doesn't mean
that people won't try, or even succeed later, and maybe even on a
larger scale than September 11th, but certainly things aren't going
to all fall down immediately, and, in the meantime, making the world
safer for freedom, or more properly using freedom to make the world
better, is the same priority it has always been, and can be attended
to much easier for the time being, with Al Qaeda undergoing a massive
reorganization of its staff at the moment.


So, as has ever been the case, whoever builds a robust,
instantly-settled, identity-independent, internet-ubiquitous
transaction mechanism that actually works in production for assets
people want to trade in large quantity is going to do quite well for
themselves by saving the entire economy a whole lot of money, and not
just people suffering from the depredations of an increasingly
powerful nation-state. In fact, it's probably safe to say that if
further acts of terrorism do happen, they will only accelerate demand
for such a system given the technological and economic paradox I
talked about about above, and not just from criminals,
revolutionaries, or any infocalyptic horseman in-between.


It's certainly legitimate to argue, as some do, that freedom is some
kind of quasi-religious inherent good. But, as LaGrange said to
Napoleon's question about the place of god in celestial mechanics, we
have no need of the hypothesis to get the result we want. To my mind,
at least, freedom is a necessary and sufficient thing, but it's not
*ethically* necessary, or, at least, the ethics of requiring freedom
are more economic than mystical, which is as it should be.

The reason free economies so dominate the landscape today is because
they're more ferociously efficient than tyranny ever is at at
developing and allocating resources, precisely because they make
their citizens more money in the process. See Mancur Olsen's "Power
and Prosperity", for some nice stuff on this idea. His first
assumption, that a prince is a bandit that doesn't move, should
resonate warmly with cypherpunks everywhere, for instance, and his
description of exactly how Stalin was able to compel phenomenal
industrial output from an enslaved Soviet labor pool -- and why it
didn't matter in the long run -- is a warning to modern thinking
Americans if there ever was one.

So, seen that light, Britain was much more dangerous than Napoleon or
Bismarck ever could have been. America was more dangerous than the
Kaiser, Hitler, or Stalin, or Mao, or their successors.

And, now, the emerging geodesic market, including America and the
rest of the West, and, more important, an increasing number of
meta-national businesses large and small, -- and in spite of a gaggle
of quasi-governmental "non-profit" organizations, including, of
course, all of Al Qaeda's organizational remorae -- is currently
proving itself more dangerous than any neo-feudal totalitarian,
national, trans-national, or otherwise.

For lack of a better way of putting it, each of those oppressors,
like King George and Caligula before them, were bad for business.

The technology of economic liberty, including modern finance,
ubiquitous internetworks, and secure anonymous cryptographic
transaction protocols, will always win over oppression in any form --
political or theological.


Cheers,
RAH
