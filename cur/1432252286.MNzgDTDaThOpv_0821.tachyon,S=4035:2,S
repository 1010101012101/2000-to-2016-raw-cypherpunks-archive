Whoever taps SMTP/POP3 bitstreams is hardly less-resourced. The only adversary
you need to worry about is the resourceful one.

Any massive deployment of crypto is subvertible. I see no way around it - it's
like microsoft windows' vulnerabilities. To be safe, crypto needs to be
diverse, custom-made and manual. The brain cycles you spend when encrypting are
the only real defense.

Very few run their own SMTP. Your own SMTP on your own box is not much
different from PGP eudora plug-in autoencrypting. But you cannot use this
argument to preach benefits of under-the-hood crypto - when almost all internet
mail traffic uses ISP-owned SMTP servers.

I predict that first attempt to apply this on the
gnutella/morpheus/kazaa/napster scale will lead to clampdown. Which is the
reason that no one did it. We don't want osama sending orders that way.
