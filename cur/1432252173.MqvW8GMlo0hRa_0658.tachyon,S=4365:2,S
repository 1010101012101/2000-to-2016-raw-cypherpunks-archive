Back when LaRouche was being a leftist, it was obvious that
the Evil Rockefeller {Commie/Capitalist} Jewish Bankers' Conspiracy
must be running the world, because everybody from wacko lefties
to rightwingers like the Birchers and the more extreme rightwing wackos 
said so.

The SPLC may have its problems, but it looks a lot like
Pravda's problem with them is that they're Jews.

Bush Sr. was the guy who got us into the whole New World Order biz;
to see his son, elected because of his father's clout (ok, and the
lack of any credible Republican opposition) and surrounded by his
father's cronies, do anything else would have been highly surprising.
