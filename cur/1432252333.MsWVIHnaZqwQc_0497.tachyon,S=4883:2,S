No, it _doesn't_ work. Clicking on your "mutt-positron" icon 
presented to me in Eudora caused Microsoft Word to launch on my 
system. Which gave me this message:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Does this work now, Tim?  It seems that Mutt insists on changing the
content-type of messages when it signs them.  My choices were
multipart PGP/MIME (the one I used up until now, which seemed to
disagree with Eudora Pro) or application/pgp (which broke nmh, the
mailer most people here use).

In any case, I modified Mutt to give the option of sending PGP signed
messages as content-type text/plain, so this should work for you.  In
fact, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know if it does, and I'll
assume that no response means my attempt at fixing this problem was
unsuccessful.

By the way, if anyone wants my patches (against Mutt 1.2.5), e-mail me
privately and I'll send them to you.

So, you might say, "it works." Nope. Problems:

1. I ain't gonna read messages that require me to launch my word 
processor. Mail shouldn't need external word processors or text 
editors.

2. Your message is encrusted with MIME junk, formatted text, etc.

I suggest you drop all the signing crap. As Bram Cohen pointed out in 
his recent message about "nobody bothers with key revocations," the 
sad fact is that nobody cares about message signings, at least not at 
the level of lists like this.

I may have signed one or two of the messages I've sent out in the 
last 8 years of list traffic. Has my lack of signings _meant_ my 
messages were assumed to be from someone else?

Fact is, PGP and SMIME went the _wrong_ direction when message 
signings started to require RTF, MIME, HTML, etc. (I realize these 
are not all the same thing. The real issue is "non-ASCII.")

ASCII is where it's at, at least for e-mail.

P.S. Please don't run your messages through Choate's ssz node, 
either. His "CDR:" encrustations are also a fucking waste of bits.

("Re: CDR: Re: Sunders point on copyright infringement & HTML")

I'm sending this through algebra.com, so Choate's CDR: may get stripped off.

Thanks.

(However, Riad, I probably won't make this effort to read your 
messages if you don't fix the main problems covered above.)
