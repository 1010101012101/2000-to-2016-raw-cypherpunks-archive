Once again, you can't answer a simple question.
Once again, you responded with a cryptic question.
You are the only person for whom it is not cryptic.

No one knows what you're talking about,
why you posted it, why you pester us.

All your stuff was clearly attributed with a '#'.

The central thesis of the article whose URL you posted
was "MONEY" was responsible for screwed up kids.

When asked about it, you utterly failed to communicate
why your posted the URL, what your position was on the
article you posted about.

You are incoherent regarding the articles you yourself
are posting. Is it any wonder you are hated?
