The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its p|an to

mi|estones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap International revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca||s from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|l savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
involvement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cel|u|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a global sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
