Mr. Dumbass appears to be channeling the Earth Liberation Front:

Quotes from: http://www.stopecoviolence.com/words.htm
------------
"If I knew I had a fatal disease, I would definitely do something 
like strap dynamite on myself and take out Grand Canyon Dam. Or 
maybe the Maxxam Building in Los Angeles after it's closed up for the
night."
      - Darryl Chernery, Northern California Earth Firster, 
CBS News Sixty Minutes, March 4, 1990 

"Are you terminally ill with a wasting disease? .Don't go out 
with a whimper; go out with a bang! Undertake an ecokamikaze 
mission."
      - Excerpt from an article that ran in the Sept. 1989 issue 
of the Earth First Journal, urging terminally ill activists to 
go on "eco-kamikaze" suicide missions 
----------------
Google on "eco-kamikaze" for more.

It's worth noting that despite over a decade of this rhetoric, 
not a single terminally ill American has done this, so far as I
am aware.

The *only* even vaguely simlar cases I'm aware of are in 
India and Sri Lanka, where young Hindu widows (who, in 
traditional Hindu society have very dim prospects for 
a happy life) are recruited as suicide bombers by the 
Tamil Tigers. I think Rajiv Ghandi's assassin was 
such a woman.
