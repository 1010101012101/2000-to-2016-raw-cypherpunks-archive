             WPI Cryptography Seminar

  Elliptic Curve Cryptography on Smart Cards without
                   Coprocessors

                  Christof Paar
                       WPI

             Wednesday, September 27
                 4:30 pm, AK 218
            (refreshments at 4:15 pm)

This talk describes joint work by Adam Woodbury, Dan Bailey, and
Christof Paar.

This talk will discuss how an elliptic curve cryptosystem can be
implemented on very low cost microprocessors with reasonable
performance. We focus in this paper on the Intel 8051 family of
microcontrollers popular in smart cards and other cost-sensitive
devices. The implementation is based on the use of an optimal
extension field (OEF) which is particularly suited for low end 8-bit
processors. Two advantages of our method are that subfield modular
reduction can be performed infrequently, and that an adaption of Itoh
and Tsujii's inversion algorithm is used for the group operation. We
show that an elliptic curve scalar multiplication with a fixed point,
which is the core operation for a signature generation, can be
performed in a group of order 2^134 in less than 2 sec. Unlike other
implementations, we do not make use of curves defined over a subfield
such as Koblitz curves.

This work was also presented at the CARDIS 2000 Smart Card Conference
which was held last week in Bristol, UK.
