Maybe *that's* the reason for holding meatings at the SFPD.
To keep everyone from naming future corpses.

So kill David Berg might be incitement?  Hmm, he was a public figure.
But  "kill all Jews" could easily be justified on religious grounds -fatwas
are protected speech.

The ability of a persecutor [sic] to conjure up a conspiracy
(complete with hip name) could be most interesting.

rational self-interest.

Did you plan to call someone while running some kind of sniffer,
or could the box have been empty?  :-)  The problem of the
modern industrial photographer: all chips look the same.
