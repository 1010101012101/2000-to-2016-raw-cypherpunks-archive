Have you done this since 9/11?  I know that in my [red]neck of the woods, I
would without question be spending a few days in the system for this.
Interestingly, the first nullification pamphlet I ever received was from a
cop I know: he was also handing these out at one time (a loooonggg time ago).
Not all LEAs are without clue, just the vast majority of them :-(
