If you *required* injected messages to be PGP-encrypted, you 
have a hashcash-like cpu cost, plus you perform the 'human value'
of increasing encrypted traffic and possibly increasing PGP's
deployment.  And AUP-legit botwriters can handle this.

I suppose 'credits' from a distributed-computing project (fubar@home)
would work, if you could work out how to reliably associate those people
with your ephemeral ones.  Or partner with a Process Tree (tm) -like
commercial
dist.comp. company.  Also contributing hand-prepared pages for the Gutenberg
project, or indexing some content, or evaluating other contributors'
offerings for validity.  

Cheers,
