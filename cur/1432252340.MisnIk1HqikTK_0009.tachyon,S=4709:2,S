"Won't get Fooled Again" by The Who.

Most of us are familiar with the version on 
"Who's Next".  However, it was originally 
written for Pete Townshend's "Lifehouse" 
project, a hugely ambitous and prescient 
work about escape from a dystopian society, 
only recently released.

Also consider "Ever Breath You Take" by
the Police.
