Perhaps I'm unclear on what you are proposing... but if this is really a
private system, as soon as the mail exits, it's obvious that it came from
you, no matter how much you mixed it around in your basement. So what's
the point?

It's been discussed here before. Ian Goldberg and others talked about
disposable exit hops, Steve Schear on temporary remailers, other people on
inexpensive, auto-configuring "remailer on a chip" designs that could be
surreptitiously introduced to random networks...

Unfortunately, you'll find that these ideas aren't new, and the answers to
their problems aren't easy.
