Eh.
If terrorists were really sending a lot of money around we'd see stuff 
blowing up in New York all the time, because a few cops 100 feet away from 
the mid-town tunnel entrace ain't going to be able to do much about a guy in 
a loaded van with a dead-man switch.

In other words, when potential terrorists get to the States, that Hawala is 
probably used to funnel untaxed money into actual businesses.

MwG always want to depict the terrorists as everywhere and themselves as 
just barely holding back a tide of destruction.
