Not a question of wisdom- the 14th basicly says, thou shalt no longer 
make state laws that ignore the constitution.  Note- this didn't 
happen until the civil war.  Prior to this it was well understood 
that states could pass whatever laws they darn well pleased.

Something that many don't realize is just how much the 
constitution/our government has been molded and changed since it's 
creation.  In it's original form it was very clearly treated as a 
tool of the states, not the people.  It was given just enough 
strength that it's decisions could be made to stick if a decision 
went against a particular state (this was the problem with the 
articles of confederation).

LOL.  It's a priority queue, designed for easy distribution of labor 
when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan.
