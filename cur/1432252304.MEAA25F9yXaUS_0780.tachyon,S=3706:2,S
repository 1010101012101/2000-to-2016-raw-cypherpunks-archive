Cpunks,
I am using slingshot as a secondary ISP because my Verizon DSL sucks.
It's has served me well. A good product with good tech support.
You need to buy 1 CD for each machine you use.
If you have access to a local # it comes to about 2 cents per min.
Using to 800 # is 3X the cost.
Bandwidth is only about 33K but good for a backup ISP with complete
anonymous Internet access.
