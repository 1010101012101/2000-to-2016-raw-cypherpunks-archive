To be fair, this sort of attack is much more involved and must be planned
much farther in advance.

This would remove one of the more serious barriers to running an SSL 
site - the Verisign protection money.

The problem with all of these things is that they are still based on
creating an association between a domain name and a key, when in fact what
you want is an association between some abstract concept of a counterparty
which exists in an end user's mind (like, say, amazon) and the ownership
of a machine that user's browser is talking to.

Unless that problem is fixed, man in the middle is hardly made more
difficult - for example, Mallory could break into some random machine on
the net and steal it's public key, then hijack local DNS and when someone
goes to amazon.com redirect them to amazon.hackeddomain.com, and then
proxy to amazon.com - now even SSL says the connection is safe.
