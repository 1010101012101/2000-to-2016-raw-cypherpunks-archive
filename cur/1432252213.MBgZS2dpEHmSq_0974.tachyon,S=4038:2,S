In 3.0 (out around Dec. 1st) you have jakarta-tomcat and jserv ports
that might be what you need. I don't use it myself though, so I don't

I think Linux is better at this.

What about www.rubberhose.org? Works best on linux it seems.

I'll play around with it sometime during the next two weeks when I get
the new SuSE Linux.

Plan 9 looks really, really cool too, though. ;-)

Have a nice day
