This "green light" story is a commie lie (originally a Baathist 
lie, but these days mostly repeated by commies)

Nathan Folkert exposes it at some length in

In fact Glaspie told Saddam that if he invaded Kuwait, the shit 
would hit the fan.

(That was not her words.  Her words were "subject of concern",
which the kind of thing that diplomats say when what they
actually mean is "We are going to cut off your head and nail it
to a lamp post with a nine inch nail")
