The problem is that reporters want to be made into a special class of people 
that don't have to abide by the same laws as the rest of us.  Are you a 
reporter?  Am I?  Is the National Inquirer?  How about Drudge?  What about 
bloggers?  Which agency will you have to apply to in order to get a 
Journalism License?  And will this License to Report entitle one to ignore 
subpoenas from federal grand juries?

Reporters should have no rights the rest of us don't have.  It's hard to 
imagine the framers of the constitution approving an amendment that said 
freedom of the press is granted to all those who first apply for and receive 
permission from the government.
