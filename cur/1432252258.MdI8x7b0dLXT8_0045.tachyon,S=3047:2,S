"The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props
The audience that lifts you when you're down
The headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops
The sheriff who escorts you out of town
The opening when your heart beats like a drum
The closing when the passengers won't come
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
No where could you have that happy feeling
...
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
The show!
The show!"


Anyone who thinks for a nanosec that this is anything but showbiz is a total idiot.
