Your onion or your clearsite?
How do you establish that your onion and clearsite host the same content?
How do you federate changes from your onion to your clearsite?
What do you do if your clearsite gets seized and used to serve up TAO
payloads?
How do you prevent your upstream from logging the IP addresses that hit
port 80 and 443? The size of those messages (you know the https sizing
attacks which can reveal which particular pages your visitors are on,
right)?

How do you make your visitors aware of the above and more? How do you
ensure that they saw your message?
