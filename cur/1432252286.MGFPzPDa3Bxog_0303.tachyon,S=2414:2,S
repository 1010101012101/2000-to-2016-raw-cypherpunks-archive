You were telling us that the USG's terrible mistreatment of 
Saddam is a great shame on the US, which whatever it sounds 
like to you, sounds to me very like "poor little victimized 
Saddam"

And you still have not told us your take on the fall of the two 
towers --perhaps like Chomsky you are going to tell us that it 
was a great crime -- which Americans should be terribly ashamed
for forcing Bin Laden to commit?
