I've been working on a similar, but safer, system called Tethr.us (as in US,
not USA) for the past 6 months or so. I'm at the point of looking for
funding to build a prototype.

It's a satellite modem (BGAN) with OpenBTS, wifi access point and a gateway
server called Tethr.org. Any piece can be powered off individually via the
admin UI. It has NO mesh networking and all radios, by default, run at
~100mW so they don't travel far enough to be a huge security risk. The
onboard server provides DTN or sync services so that the system is useful if
you just connect with a wire and only turn on the radios once in a while. On
the backend, everything is optionally proxied out via TOR (to conserve
bandwidth we don't do it on the gateway side, but we could).

I've targeted it at journalists who understand the risks of running radios
in a hostile environment, but anyone can certainly benefit. I know the
limitations of BGAN and would love to replace it with something else, but
the ubiquity, battery capacity and antenna size make it suited for this sort
of work.

If anyone is interested in hearing more, let me know and we can talk about
it on another thread here or off-list.
