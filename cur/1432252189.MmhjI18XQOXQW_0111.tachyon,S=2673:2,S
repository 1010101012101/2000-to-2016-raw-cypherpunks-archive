(Basically, a poster calling himself Xinoehpoel on the
alt.prophecies.nostradamus news group started making noise about a big
event to occur on 9/11. He also said he would be "going away" on this 
date.)

The thread is pretty disturbing. If this guy wasn't actually involved with
the attacks, I bet he's wishing he'd kept his mouth shut.
