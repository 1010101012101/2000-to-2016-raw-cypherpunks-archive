NSA-Intercepted E-Mails Helped Convict Would-Be Bombers
The three men convicted in the United Kingdom on Monday of a plot to  
bomb several transcontinental flights were prosecuted in part using  
crucial e-mail correspondences intercepted by the U.S. National  
Security Agency, according to Britainbs Channel 4.

The e-mails, several of which have been reprinted by the BBC and other  
publications, contained coded messages, according to prosecutors. They  
were intercepted by the NSA in 2006 but were not included in evidence  
introduced in a first trial against the three last year.
