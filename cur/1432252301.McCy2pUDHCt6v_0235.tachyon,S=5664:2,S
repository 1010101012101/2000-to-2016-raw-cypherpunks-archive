Depends on what you mean by "as designed" really.  Personally, I'd presume
as designed is to slow down or hinder an adversary, which would probably
fit in this scenario.

Meh, strictly speaking, yes, but if we're talking in practical terms it may
be the case that they've figured out how to break some cryptographic
primitive in significantly less time than the original design
specifications but it would still take more computing oomph than they
currently have.  Fairly sure there was similar considerations about 64-bit
RC5 in the late 90s - people knew it could be cracked by brute force, but
took a distributed effort to prove as much (may have details slightly wrong
as was long time ago and I can't be bothered looking it up).

The scenario is not particularly likely though.

Hehe... "NSA constrained by laws", erm, yeah, I suppose there's a first for
everything ;-)

In reality, they've probably got a lot of uses for more computing power and
the chances of us ever finding out in our lifetime are slim.
