"The Department intends to begin the electronic passport program in 
December 2005. The first stage will be a pilot program in which the 
electronic passports will be issued to U.S. Government employees who 
use Official or Diplomatic passports for government travel. This pilot 
program will permit a limited number of passports to be issued and 
field tested prior to the first issuance to the American traveling 
public, slated for early 2006. By October 2006, all U.S. passports, 
with the exception of a small number of emergency passports issued by 
U.S. embassies or consulates, will be electronic passports."

It sounds like it's fairly safe to get a new passport after Halloween...
at least until January.
