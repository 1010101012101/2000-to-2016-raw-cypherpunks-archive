I am an American citizen.

In 30 years I have never given a valid social security number to anyone.

I can't.

I don't have one.

I hold a regular high-paying job.  I get a paycheck.  My employer uses ADP.  I have a driver's license.  I have a bank account.  I have good health insurance.  I pay my taxes.

Not once have I had a real problem.  Any minor problems that have come up over the years, and there have been very few, always go away when ignored dilligently.

Just give those facists a fake number.

Good luck.

Signed,
