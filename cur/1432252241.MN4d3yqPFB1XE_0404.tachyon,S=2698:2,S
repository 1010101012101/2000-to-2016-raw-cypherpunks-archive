Tor is not practically untraceable.  The Tor documentation itself
asserts the contrary:

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination.

http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/design-paper/challenges.pdf

In contrast, the "obfuscation" attained with a nym server is
attributable precisely to the high random latency and traffic mixing
of the anonymizing remailers through which the nym is operated.
