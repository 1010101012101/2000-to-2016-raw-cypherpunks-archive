The only almost-safe portable phone I can imagine is a purely VoIP
phone, and that comes with a ton of caveats and precautions. It's a
very difficult problem.

That whole corporate-locked-in-baseband thing seems to throw a
curveball at any ideas I can think of when trying to execute a secure
cellular device.

I am, however, excited to see Zimmermann involved.
