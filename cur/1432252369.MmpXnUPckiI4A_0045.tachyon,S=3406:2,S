Like it mattered at all that they were there? Except for the superficial
effect of comforting the poor scared sheep I didn't see anything
effective, I didn't see anyone searching trucks or opening car trunks.
Form over function. Same as airport security. Psyops. Like the warnings
to keep people off balance. Should we start a pool to see who can guess
when ashcruft will put everyone 'on highest alert' next? It'll probably
line up with an ACLU attack on the USAmaPATriarchalRIOT act. Only a
commie traitor could object to le power grabs at a time when alerts are
clearly critical to the survival of the entire nation and its way of
life!
