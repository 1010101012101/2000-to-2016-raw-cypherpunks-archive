protection of community is a different mindset but yay you can have the
blood thirsty murder lover fucker there too of course

state dont like check points by community ... UK use to do shootings at
community checkpoints and pretend they were a protestant or vis versa a
catholic just to fuck with the community security effect

all of this points to why i think there needs to be many theories developed
around solution in all sectors of society not just one base theory to solve
one issue then we are all good and we live in nirvana.... work on
everything you can all the time

work on mindset ... so restorative justice is like that it tears at the
underlying mindset of getting off on murder and blood lust... mediation
shit ...calling out people that take power instead of standing there mouth
open drooling

this is being taught now in primary schools

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; American. Especially if the government institutes a standi=
ng<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; penalty of, say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing=
 an<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AP donation, I don&#39;t think we will have the millions o=
f small<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donations that AP requires. The situation would be a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prisoner&#39;s dilemma: No individual donation of $10 or e=
ven<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $100 is going to make the difference between a target bein=
g<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; killed or not, and so there would be no reason for the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average person to use AP. The fact that the donations coul=
d<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be made &quot;safely&quot; is not enough; the government w=
ould surely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; institute eavesdropping measures and would punish anyone w=
ho<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even visited AP sites.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I selected Murphy because you mentioned Friedman&#39;s hard problem of=
<br>
&gt; privatizing defense without the presence of state actors. Your<br>
&gt; solution is crowdfunding assassinations of anybody who is<br>
&gt; unpopular. This does fit within the paradigm of Friedman&#39;s<br>
&gt; approach.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would argue that Murphy&#39;s approach of collectives banding<br>
&gt; together and entering into private arbitration agreements with<br>
&gt; private defense contractors is more reasonable in preserving<br>
&gt; liberty and security. By entering into said private arbitration<br>
&gt; agreement with a private defense force, you also have aspects of<br>
&gt; private jurisprudence. The arbitration clause can have stipulations<br=
>
&gt; for certain scenarios and how they are dealt with (e.g., trials,<br>
&gt; fines, etc).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Democracy is the tyranny of the majority, and assassination<br>
&gt; politics is dangerous in that regard when they are coupled. Private<br=
>
&gt; arbitration agreements with private security forces wherein<br>
&gt; mobility has reciprocal agreements (similar to current travel)<br>
&gt; seems more reasonable.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would suggest you consider the countereconomics work of SEK<br>
&gt; (e.g. agorism) and Vaclav Benda. Benda is an interesting case<br>
&gt; because he did his work on parallel structures while under the<br>
&gt; Soviet Union.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The conclusion was that -- in the presence of an oppressive state<br>
&gt; -- a robust solution was an overlay of private and hidden societies<br=
>
&gt; as opposed to direct overt warfare with the state.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My replies inline: Simply put, I don&#39;t think Vroman or=
 Bell<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realize just how nutty and horrible the AP idea seems to t=
he<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average American. I should point out why I view Murphy&#39=
;s<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comment as being wacky, in itself.=C2=A0 The &quot;average=
 American&quot; is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fairly familiar with the deficiencies of the world&#39;s s=
tatus<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quo.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think your assumptions regarding the average American are wrong,<br>
&gt; but that is my opinion. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of memetic<b=
r>
&gt; warfare, neurolinguistic programming, and general propaganda.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But he may not be aware that it has been estimated that in the<br>
&gt; 20th century, about 250 million people DIED, killed by the actions<br>
&gt; of governments.<br>

&gt; Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow &quot;okay&q=
uot;? I<br>
&gt; very much doubt he&#39;d say that was acceptable, and he probably<br>
&gt; couldn&#39;t argue much with the numbers themselves.=C2=A0 But suppose=
<br>
&gt; those &quot;average Americans&quot; were FIRST fully informed of this =
fact,<br>
&gt; even simply as an estimate.=C2=A0 THEN, suppose it was explained to hi=
m<br>
&gt; HOW a functioning AP system wouldn&#39;t allow that to happen, if<br>
&gt; necessary by killing whatever number of government employees were<br>
&gt; necessary to stop this, the &quot;Democide&quot;.=C2=A0 =C2=A0If those=
 &quot;average<br>
&gt; Americans&quot; were reminded that the death of a government employee =
is<br>
&gt; no more unfortunate than the death of ordinary citizens, then<br>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t it be reasonable to conclude that to save 250 million<br>
&gt; ordinary citizens, it would certainly be acceptable to kill 25<br>
&gt; million government employees, and certainly 2.5 million government<br>
&gt; employees?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;average American&quot; has been aware, during an=
d since the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1960&#39;s, that the citizens of many major governments ha=
ve been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under a nuclear terror.=C2=A0 Now, it seems, we simply acc=
ept it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as it is a reality.=C2=A0 As shocking as that may see, per=
haps<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s made more understandable by the fact that there h=
as not<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed to be anything we can do about it. Suppose, then,<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these &quot;average Americans&quot; were told that a funct=
ioning AP<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system would make any nation&#39;s holding of nuclear weap=
ons<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; absolutely impossible:=C2=A0 They are in the control of SO=
MEONE,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or maybe hundreds and thousands of someones, and such peop=
le<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be targeted by AP until those weapons are finally shut=
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down, and dismantled, and permanently rendered safe.=C2=A0=
 As<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many government employees could be killed until that occur=
s.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No limit whatsoever. So, where does Bob Murphy get off say=
ing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the &quot;Average American&quot; would find AP &quot;=
nutty and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; horrible&quot;?=C2=A0 I say, to the contrary, that a _well=
-informed_<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;average American&quot;, informed of what I say AP co=
uld<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; accomplish, would find Murphy himself and his arguments<br=
>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;nutty and horrible&quot;.=C2=A0 Why should the citiz=
ens of the world<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tolerate the killing of 250 million more people by<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; governments, beyond the 20th Century&#39;s toll?=C2=A0 Why=
 should the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; citizens of the world tolerate continuing to be held as<br=
>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nuclear hostages, targets of 2000 nuclear bombs, just to k=
eep<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a few governments in power?=C2=A0 Clearly, Murphy views th=
e<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world&#39;s citizens&#39; &quot;natural state&quot; to bei=
ng owned and held<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hostage by governments, and certainly not the opposite!<br=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; Especially if the government institutes a standing =
penalty<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of, say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donation, I don&#39;t think we will have the millions of s=
mall<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; donations that AP requires. The situation would be a<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Murphy, here, is beginning to show his &#39;inner paranoid=
&#39;.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;They would never let us do it!!!&quot;Which, is one =
reasons we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MUST do it. I would say, to the contrary of what he said,<=
br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that if &quot;they&quot;, the governments, don&#39;t want =
us to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something SO MUCH, then that&#39;s all the more reason we =
should<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disregard those governments&#39; official desires.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jim Bell<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There are arguably technical countermeasures to his argument. E.g.<br>
