Somebody might then argue that education received in a private institution
cannot be guaranteed to include social/moral/whatever lessons which are to
be expected in a society and so private education should not be recognized
as valid. Of course, this is nonsensical from an American point of 
view. From a Finnish one, not as clearly - Finnish universities and far over
90% of schools are governmental institutions, so making the above move would
force people to attend a public school in order to be eligible for further
education. In fact, private schools based on the Steiner and Montessori
pedagogies fought quite a fight to be recognized, here.
