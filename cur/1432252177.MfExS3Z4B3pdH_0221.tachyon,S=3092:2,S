A little dose of paranoia for a Thursday morning. Nothing new around
these parts, you understand, but, sometimes, when you stare into the
obvious long enough...

Cheers,

Suppose you are a domestic terrorist because you have made noises,

written newspapers, put Ron Paul stickers on your bumper, you are an

Oath Keeper," a member of JPFO, ad-nauseum:
http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=96916

Now suppose your house has been located by one of the 170,000 people

working for the census and coordinates given to your front door:

http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=97208

Now suppose some problems break out in your area between angry

citizens and our Mother Culture.imagine that somewhere out there

a pilot is typing your name into his plane or choppers computer, the

one that controls Precision-guided munitions (PGMs, smart munitions,

smart bombs, guided bomb units or GBUs) you know, the ones being

perfected over in the Mid-Eastyour name and coordinates are set:

Better yet, maybe the pilot just flies, and someone in Homeland

Security at some darkened monitor somewhere types your name.heres

what happens:

Id suggest activists might want to leave their homes for a while should

disagreements break out between the Mother Culture and her charges.

Lets listen to Ben Franklin a moment, should you wonder if our
government

is capable of this stuff: Never trust a government that doesn't trust
its
own

citizens with guns. Then ask yourself: Does your government trust you,
or

does it seem just a little paranoid?


This is rather bizarre....target on your back? Nope....heh....target on
your

front door...
