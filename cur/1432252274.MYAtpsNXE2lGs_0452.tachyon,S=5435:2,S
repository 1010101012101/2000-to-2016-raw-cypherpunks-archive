Not necessarily. Consider 'small world' networks. The only people who know
(necessarily) of a given remailer are the operator and his users. They
share a set of keys so traffic can be source encrypted. The remailer
operator shares a seperate set of infrastructure keys with some of the
remailer operators that they know (as distinct from the users of that same
remailer/operator). Consider that sender/receiver know each other and can
use yet a third encryption layer that is independent from the other two
(ie the target address does not have to be known to the initial remailer
operator though it will be in the header going to the first remailer. None
of the intermediate remailers need to ever decrypt that far until the TTL
reaches zero/one (depending on design taste).

Now couple this with Plan 9's ability to completely distribute both
process and file space and 'where' a remailer might be, or even 'who' is
running it become a rather sticky point since it doesn't necessarily run
on the 'operators' hardware.

But the only place they can trace messages in a 'small world' model is at
source/destination link, which means they're already on top of you. If
they're out fishing all they'd see is a bunch of packets sent between
remailers with the body encrypted several layers deep with keys held by a
variety of people.

The beauty of the 'small world' model is it does away with the 'trust
transivity' issue completely. All the intermediate remailers can do is
drop a packet. Which will get recognized pretty quickly because of the
inherent secondary (ie personal interaction) network that sits behind the
remailer network itself.

With Plan 9 that would require them to outlaw using a particular OS. Maybe
in a lot of places, but not in the US.

If you stick with current paradigms.
