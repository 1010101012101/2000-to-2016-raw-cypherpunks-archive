You have this garbled.

According to
http://www.royalarmouries.org/extsite/view.jsp?sectionId=1025

by the fifteen hundreds, the very finest armor could deflect almost
all bodkin arrows - but very few could afford a complete set of the
very finest armor - and the battle of Agincourt occurred well before
the fifteen hundreds.

Presumably the armor improved (and became heavier and more expensive)
in response to the battle of Agincourt.
