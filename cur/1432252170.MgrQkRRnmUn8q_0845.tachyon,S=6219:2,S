In one of many threads, mine being 'dirty pool', there is forming a
good variety of such morals to live by and areas of action to pursue.
HS operators banding together to compare the above logs is one
of them. You could conceivably throw the logs/pcaps from many
relays and onions into a splunk.onion instance and try to mine some
knowledge out of them that way. Tor is a jointly owned wide area
infrastructure... seems time to apply the traditional net/sec tools
to it and see what's up on your own network.
