Not a problem.  Its legal to use any name you wish, including those that 
use gyphs and sounds which cannot be represented by standard Roman and 
non-Roman alphabets (as is common in some African tribes).  So, those that 
wish to avoid this data base nightmare can legally adopt name which does 
not conform.
