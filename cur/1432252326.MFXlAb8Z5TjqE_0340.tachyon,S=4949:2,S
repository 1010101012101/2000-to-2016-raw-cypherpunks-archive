hi,

thanx for the replies.
one doubt escpecially on this.

can u pls explain how they have statistical
signatures,pls-


 may be using SPN's, i have tried ANSI X9.17 key
generation with GOST-it did have a negligably small
skew-it makes me wonder what statistical signature
they have.The negligable skew is a weakness but not
high enough to compramise the security of the key used
from the ANSI x9.17 key gen method.
pls explain.
thank u veru much.

Regards Data.
