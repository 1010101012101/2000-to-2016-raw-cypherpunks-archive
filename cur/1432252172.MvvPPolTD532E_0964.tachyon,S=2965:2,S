Hey 	
I want to see if my girl is cheating on me by hacking into her e-mail 
account at school. Now i know enough about here to bypass her pass pretty 
easily but i however don't know the best way to go about getting to her 
account. She uses a network based e-mail account through Eudora 4.3. How do 
I get through their firewall. The school is a small
private catholic high school so their firewall is not teh best out there i 
am sure of that.
						Thanx
							mike
