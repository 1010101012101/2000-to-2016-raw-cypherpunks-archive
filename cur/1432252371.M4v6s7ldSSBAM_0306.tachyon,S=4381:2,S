Hello coder,

I've developed a small mailinglistmanager called ciphermail that works
with gnupg to encrypt and pseudo anonymize all communication between the 
listmembers and ciphermail.

it's not much code (yet) and it's written in perl with crypt::gnupg and
mime::lite, so it needs a cryptographic filesystem for /tmp because of
the created temporary files created by these modules.

There are a bunch of ideas out there what ciphermail should do in the
next release, so we need some help to implement and improve it ;)
Maybe someone has some spare time to commit a patch or two...

i've set up a webpage under
https://rijndael.killall5.de/~jules/ciphermail/ with more information
about ciphermail, so maybe you're interessted in.

Hmm. I hope my english is not to bad to get my intention for this mail
;)

Bye,
jules
