This is cool!  I love the combined distribution of providing a hosted
version, and encouraging people to host it themselves.

I looked into the code to understand more about how it works.  Is it
fair to say that you use WebRTC with SRTP for the transport
encryption, and then a homebaked AES-GCM-based protocol with RSA
public keys to do the encrypted chat/actions/invites, and also to
distribute/authenticate the WebRTC fingerprints?

We made Subrosa in response to the mass surveillance revelations programs, and to address the difficulty of current tools for the average user. Oh, and it supports group video chats.

We think there's a place for an end to end encrypted messaging platform usable by *everyone*.

For end to end encryption to be widely adopted, it needs to convince people who don't care about it as well. And that means it can't be any harder, or more confusing than popular offerings.

RSA keypairs are stored on our servers, with the private key being passed through PBKDF2 with the user password (not sent). Messages are encrypted using exchanged AES keys, with VOIP/video chats encrypted with SRTP.

Subrosa's client is fully open source however, and you can (and should!) run a local copy of the client. We use the ForgeJS library. http://github.com/subrosa-io/subrosa-client
