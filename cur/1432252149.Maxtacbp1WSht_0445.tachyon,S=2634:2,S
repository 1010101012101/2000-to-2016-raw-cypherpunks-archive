VIA CNN this AM:
(somewhat paraphrasing)

Bush Sr., speaking to some corporate collection of cronies: "We'll also have to look at this Internet thing you all know so much about, and review our policies..."

Gephardt: "We don't have to, we don't want to change the Constitution, but there will need to be a shift in the balance between freedom and security..."

The planes have hit the towers but the shit has yet to hit the fan.
