Well, I'm not totally retarded but I still don't always follow JYA that
well. I'll keep trying.

Did the OH guy have a lawyer? If so, did he follow the advice he was
given? 

While I would not myself send the guy to prison for his writings however
goofy or sick I may find them, a person who writes this stuff runs a
serious risk of my interpreting even the slightest action on his part as
intent and of getting himself gutted in the spot.

The thoughts color the interpretation of the actions.
