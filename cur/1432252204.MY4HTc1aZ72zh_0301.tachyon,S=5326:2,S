  He sounds like one of the victimized voters from Florida. Illiterate,
uneducated people who are allowing themselves to be used to throw an
election (or draw things out, as the Clinton/Gore administration tends to
do).

  If we get rid of the Electoral College then we may as well throw out all
the States and just call ourselves federal citizens (not that we are very
far from that state of affairs anyway).

To make inexpensive guns impossible to get is to say that you're
putting a money test on getting a gun.  It's racism in its worst form.
