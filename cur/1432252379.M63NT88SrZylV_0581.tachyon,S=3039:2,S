A company I am involved with has been on the distribution list for the 
FBI's Project Lookout watch list, the list being shared with banks, 
electronics companies, consulting firms, transportation companies, and 
1100 other firms.

Cross-indexing with the CP subscriber list, I find 17 names on both 
lists.

We must be vigilant! Civil rights are only for innocents, not guilty 
persons.
