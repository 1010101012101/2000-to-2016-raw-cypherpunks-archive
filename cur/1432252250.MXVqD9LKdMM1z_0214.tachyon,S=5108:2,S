The real question is whether, given the current policital system, Libertarians
that are elected would not be corrupted by the same influences before making
any substantial gains.

As much as I generally respect what Harry Browne says, I dontated money to
his campaign only to see it squandered on expensive DC consultants who were
'friends of the party'.  Nary a penny made it to drive-time radio ads,
which are by far the most cost effective communication medium for reaching 
voters.

Radio is cheap and hot.  When was the last time you heard a Libertarian
sentiment on radio (except talk radio).  The closest I've heard are the "Vote 
Freedom" ads by Charleton Heston.

Sad that the generic NRA ads speak louder for libertariansism than our
best blood, sweat and tears efforts.

Hats off to CH and NRA for those ads, even though I'm still pissed about
the instant background check bullshit.  Next time I want to excercise
my right to free speach lets see if I need an instant background check.
That particular compromise enabled the FBI to stop all gun sales by
simply bringing down the database.  (Not to mention unconstitutionally
keep all records, making it a de-facto registration system.)
