>Hi Dave
>
>Over the last nine months, I've seen many reports allege bin Laden is
>responsible for virtually everything short of global warming that goes
>wrong in the world.
>
>Last January, retired Admiral David Jeremiah, claimed: "Increasingly,
>people like Osama bin Laden will be able to acquire capabilities on
>satellites". Jeremiah took over the Rumsfeld Commission from Donald
>Rumsfeld when the latter became Defense Secretary-Designate. The
>Commission's concern was that the US would face a "Space Pearl Harbor".

>
>Given the push for yet more controls on freedom's bulwark in the
>information age, crypto, this quote from James Bamford's new book on the
>NSA is jarring.
>
>"According to information obtained for Body of Secrets, NSA regularly
>listens to unencrypted calls from suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden,
>in hiding in Afghanistan," Bamford writes.
>  "Bin Laden uses a portable INMARSAT (satellite) phone that transmits
>and receives calls over spacecraft owned by the International Maritime
>Satellite Organisation.
>  "According to intelligence officials, bin Laden is aware that the
>United States can eavesdrop on his international communications but he
>does not seem to care. To impress cleared visitors, NSA analysts
>occasionally play audiotapes of bin Laden talking to his mother over an
>INMARSAT connection."
