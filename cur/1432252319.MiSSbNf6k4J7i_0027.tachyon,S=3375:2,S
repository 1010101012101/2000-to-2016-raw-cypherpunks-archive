As Senior Wences(sp?) used to say, "Eeesy for jou to say, for me, ees
deeficult!)

Okay, so it does searches and replaces on *characters* and doesn't just
insert buzz words per se, which means, like the website of the same name
says, it does dialectizing, and not jargon per se.

>From the Mac source (Chef 1.1) I found on info-mac, the Swedish Chef one's
pretty simple, with just a few character substitution rules. The hardest
one I found, from a quick perusal in Google, is Cockney, with something
like 600 rules, which I haven't actually looked at, yet.

Creating text which sounds like me -- much less John Young -- may (or may
not :-)) be "eesy". Though, it does remind me of the concordance
text-biometric stuff people around here used to fool around with to
identify anonymous cypherpunk messages from, um, various cranks...

:-).

Cheers,
