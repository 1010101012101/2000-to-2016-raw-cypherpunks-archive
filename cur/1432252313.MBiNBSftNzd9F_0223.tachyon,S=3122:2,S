Considering that the new edition of "True Names" is just about to 
appear, and has a bunch of related essays in it, I certainly wouldn't 
have paid $25 for the pb.

A _physical_ used book store? Surely you are kidding. My experience 
is that used book stores are employers of low-wage 
people...suggesting slim profit margins.

If you are suggesting an Internet service, you wouldn't even have to 
leave the computer biz. OTOH, other companies are already offering 
such matching services. Powell's Books, for example.
