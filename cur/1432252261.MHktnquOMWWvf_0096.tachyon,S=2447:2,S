   mrogers writes "USA Today has a story describing how the NSA looks for
   [1]suspicious calling patterns in the [2]huge volumes of traffic data
   it [3]collects. "Templates" such as a call from overseas followed by a
   flurry of domestic calls are used to identify leads, which are
   forwarded to the FBI for investigation. There have been complaints
   that low-quality leads are drawing agents away from other cases, and
   similar pattern-matching approaches have been [4]found wanting in the
   past. Can data mining identify terrorists?"
