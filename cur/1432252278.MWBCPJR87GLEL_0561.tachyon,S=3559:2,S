Or to say the same thing in slightly different words, all CAs are
perfectly and equally trustworthy, and all users are
untrustworthy.

This system is inherently authoritarian.  Because that authority
must be restricted for it to be useful, it is inherently a pain in
the ass to administer, with inherently high administrative costs.
Like socialism, S/MIME results in bureacracy, delay, expense, and
inefficiency.
