Mathew,

	Are you so ludicrously insecure that you have to resort to publishing put
downs from private email?

	I called Theroux's institute a crank tank in public. If he could support
his claims he would have made his reply public.

	The 'open letter' Theroux refers to is not in support of the Margolis crank
book as he claims, it is in support of Microsoft - a very different matter.

	The rhetoricaln tactics are so close to those of the IHR, where is Barry
Shien when you need him? The claim 'if you disagree with me it can only be
because you are stupid'.

	Paul Krugman can explain very complex economic theories to a lay audience
in the NYT. I have several degrees including a Doctorate in Nuclear physics.
If Theroux cannot justify the claims he makes except by reference to subject
authority then he is full of it.

	What this is really about is the political claim that economists have an
expert mystical power that only they can understand that gives them and only
them the ability to comment on political affairs, and that to ask them to
ustify their ludicrous and contradictory claims is to show oneself to be a
fool. Sounds like a couple of tailros who once worked for a certain emperor.
