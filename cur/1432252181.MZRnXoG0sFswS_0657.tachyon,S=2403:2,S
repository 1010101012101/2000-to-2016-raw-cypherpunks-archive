So I'm sitting in the airport listening to the latest
Vice Presidential Hunter Safety Program TV news,
and there's a commercial about the FAA's www.fly.faa.gov website
which lets you sign up to get near-real-time airport status information,
including giving them your cellphone number to get updates.
It looks fairly innocuous (and says to contact your airline
for details about your specific flight, so it may not be fully operational),
and it also has a pointer to http://waittime.tsa.dhs.gov/index.html
which is the TSA's site for getting estimated papers-in-order wait time.

Are these purely honest services (maybe)?
Or are the TSA Internal Passport folks tracking travellers
who provide their info (maybe, maybe not, but if not,
they'll certainly start abusing them once they realize they can)?
