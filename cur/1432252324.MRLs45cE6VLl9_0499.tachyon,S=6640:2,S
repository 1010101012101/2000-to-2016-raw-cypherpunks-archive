Okay...  So, you're writing cypherpunks to get somebody to explain Caps Lock
and apostrophes to you, right?

I HAVE 2 LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN MOLESTED BY THEIR STEP
GRANDFATHER. THEY HAVE  TALKED TO BY THE SHERIFFS DEPT. AND THEY WERE
CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO ORAL SEX, BUT NOT ACTUALLY
PENETRATED. THE DEPUTY SAID  THE CASE WORKER WAS WALKING ON THIN ICE, AND IT
PROBABLY WOULD NOT HOLD UP IN COURT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY FOUR AND FIVE
YEARS OLD. WHEN I CALLED TO SEE IF THIS MAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED, THEY TOLD ME
IT WAS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I AM WILLING TO GO TO JAIL BEFORE LETTING THESE
GIRLS GO BACK TO THIS SITUATION. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS. I
CANT BEAR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO EVER HAVE TO SEE THIS PERSON AGAIN, BUT MY
SON, THEIR FATHER DOES NOT HAVE CUSTODY. AT THE MOMENT HE HAS THEM, BUT
THEIR MOTHER WILL NOT COMPLY WITH DFS SO THEY CAN GET COUNSELING. THE DFS
HAS SENT THE MEDICAID CARDS SO THEY CAN GET THE COUNSELING, BUT SHE HAS TO
SIGN THE CONSENT, AND SHE WONT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE DOCTORS FOR AN
EXAM, BECAUSE SHE ALSO WONT SIGN FOR THAT. THE LAWS OF THIS LAND ARE
COMPLICATED, AND IM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE THE REASON FOR THIS CONSENT FROM THE
MOTHER, IS APPROPRIATE, BUT AT THIS TIME, I AM FRUSTRATED THAT THEIR MOTHER
AND HER NEW HUSBANDS FAMILY ARE ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE LAW . WE NEED TO
PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ANYONE THAT IS NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR BEST
INTEREST. THESE ARE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND DESERVE TO HAVE A FUTURE,
UNMOLESTED.  CATHERINE M. HALL GRANDMOTHER   BOSSLION @MSN.COM
