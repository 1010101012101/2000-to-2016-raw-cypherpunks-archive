1) ARTICLE - HOW TO QUICKLY AND EASILY CREATE YOUR OWN INFORMATION 
PRODUCTS FOR 
FUN ANDPROFIT
By Terry Dean 

To take maximum profits away from the table in your own internet business, 
you must be the prime source of a hot product or service. What I am going to 
present to you today is one easy step-by-step system to create your own product 
that is 100% easier than writing a book or creating a report. 

Information Products are the ideal business to start if you are looking 
for an online business...They are easy to produce, simple to ship, and 
can enjoy high markups because people are not paying for the physical 
form the product is delivered in. They are paying for the valuable information 
contained within. 

Although most people only see reports and books when we speak of information 
products, I want you to see just how versatile this market can be. You could 
produce software, videos, audios, newsletters, secret sites, and more. 
The only limitations in this business are the ones you create yourself. 

You may say to me, "But Terry, I just don't know how to do anything that 
people want!" Well, I have a solution for that problem. If you have found 
a market that wants a product of a certain nature, contact an expert and 
do an interview with them...then sell that tape! (Most experts will do the 
tape with you right over the phone for just the cost of consulting 
Usually $100 - $1000). 

If you do have knowledge that people want (Which I highly expect is true 
even if you won't admit it to me)...then you can do your own audio tape course. 

Below I am going to give you a quick 6 step system for creating your own 
tapes...and then we will do a short overview on how to contact an expert 
and get them to do a tape with you. 

Step 1 - Make a list of your hobbies, interests, and problems which you can solve. 

Do people come to you often and ask for your advice on certain things? 
If so...there is a product idea! Design a product that solves their problems. 
Find a Problem or a Desire people have that you have overcome, and then the 
system you followed is the basis for your product. 

Do you train dogs? There's a product. 
Do You Build Model Airplanes? There's a product. 
Do You Save Money through Auctions? There's a product. 
Did you figure out how to set up a web site? There's a product. 
Do you Get Top 10 Rankings on Search Engines? There's a product. 
Do you write killer sales letters? There's a product. 

Product ideas are all around you...There are probably at least half a 
dozen products inside you waiting for the chance to come out! 

Step 2 - Research Your Targeted Market to Find Out What they are Interested in. 

If you plan to sell your product online, make sure there is a market for 
it first before you ever create the product. Visit forums and newsgroups 
using http://www.forumone.com and http://www.dejanews.com and do some research. 
Prepare a short Questionnaire and give something away free to people who 
answer it for you. 

Corporations spend millions of dollars a year in research...but as a 
small home business you can do your research for free online through 
contacting and networking through newsgroups, forums, and mailing lists. 

Step 3 - Purchase the necessary equipment. 

You don't have to go to a studio to record your tape unless you have an 
unlimited budget. If you can afford a studio, it will produce a little 
better tape, but for most people starting out that is just another undue expense. 

Go down to your local Radio Shack and purchase high quality audio 
tapes and a dynamic microphone. A good one will probably cost you 
between $40 and $100...Ask one of the sales representatives to recommend a good 
one. If you need an adapter for your tape recorder, get one of those as well. 

If you don't own a double cassette deck, you will probably want to get one 
of those...Why? You can also dub your first couple of tape sales right there 
in your home and wait to send it out to a duplicator until you know for sure 
it is a real hot seller. 

Notice that you don't need expensive equipment to get started in this 
business...although you may upgrade later as you go on. 

Step 4 - Make An Outline. 

When you did your research in step 2, what were your potential customers 
interested in most? Now, create a product that gives a step-by-step training 
on how to overcome that problem or achieve that objective. 

Rack your brain and come up with steps that will take your customers to 
their desired solution. You have to make it simple. This is probably the 
most difficult part of your product...You have to boil down all of your 
research, your experience, and come up with a simple system people can 
follow to achieve their objective. 

Step 5 - Record your tapes. 

Now, shut off the phones...and set-up your little recording studio. 
Make a time on your schedule to do your tape or your series and stick to 
it...because you will probably want to procrastinate the process into oblivion. 

Sit down and record under 60 minutes for the tape (Note most tapes 
actually have 62 - 64 minutes on them). You have to be careful to stop 
way before the end of the tape so that there is room to record an intro 
or a "Please turn the tape over" message. 

Step 6 - Start marketing today. 

How much is your tape worth? You can sell an individual audio tape 
for $9.95 - $29.95 depending on the subject OR you can produce a 
series of tapes...I have seen these sell for as much as $495 if they 
were on the right topic. You really have to test your price. 

Any secretarial service can transcribe your tapes for you if you 
want to produce a higher priced product out of them. You do a little 
bit of editing to them, combine your new manual to the tapes, and you 
have a higher valued product to sell. 

This is not the only way to create information products by any means, 
but it is enough to get you started. Are you going to make some 
mistakes...YES....but you will have started in the right direction. 
If you follow this process, you will have your own hot product to 
sell online for years to come. All you have left to do is write the 
ad...but that is a subject for another day.

4) ARTICLE - TERMS WITHIN MULTI LEVEL MARKETING (MLM)
In this article some terms within Multi Level marketing (MLM) will be 
described. The first term we really need to understand is

SPONSOR
As a noun (my sponsor) it is the person who introduced you to the business. 
As a verb (I sponsored Fred) it also means to introduce someone into your 
networking business.

COMP OR MARKETING PLAN
The compensation, marketing or pay plan. This is the payment structure used 
by the company to allocate commissions and bonuses to their distributors. 
Its important to understand it as quickly as you can. Understanding equals 
more income! Some networkers have been known to say things like "Dont worry 
about the plan its complicated - just get on with the business and youll 
earn the money" RUBBISH! You wouldnt take a job without asking about the 
salary and finding out when it was paid would you? A really good question 
to ask here is What is the potential maximum payout? And what was the 
actual payout percentage last year The higher the second figure is - 
the more it is possible for you to earn. With most companies the percentage 
that can be paid out to someone at the top position on their plan is 
around 40-60% (that is of the wholesale product value) The actual percentage 
paid out overall is often less than half that! Partly because few people 
bother to understand the plan and so never benefit from it properly and 
partly for less obvious reasons which Ill cover sometime when Im feeling brave!

UPLINE
This is your sponsor and the people above them, that sponsored them. 
In most companies youll have at least 3 upline business advisors. 
Any of them will help you. Some of them may be more successful than others and, 
just on a personality level, you may get on with some better than others. 
It doesnt matter which ones you work with. This is networking not 
conventional business. Youre not going over your sponsors head - 
youre expected to work with more than one of your upline. 
In conventional business you have advisors; accountant, solicitor, 
bank manager - in networking you have all those too, but also at least 3 
people who specialise in the networking business. They have already succeeded 
and they can help you to do the same. If for any reason they arent helping 
you - complain to the company - they are earning money on your efforts - 
you are entitled to their help. Theyre not psychic though so you need to 
contact them regularly and tell them what you need from them.

DOWNLINE
The people youve introduced into your business, their people and so on. 
Its a collective noun, like a gaggle of geese or a pride of lions you have 
a downline of distributors.

LEG or LINE
All the distributors downline of one of your frontline or first level 
personally sponsored distributors. A section of your business in other words.

LEVEL
The people you sponsor will be on your first level - the people they sponsor 
will be on your second level and so on. This should not be confused with a 
generation which is used to calculate the higher levels of bonus. 

B.O.M. or MEETING
A Business Opportunity Meeting, goodness they were dreadful! 
The way that many people used to recruit for their downlines. 
If youve ever been dragged along to one of these boring events - 
take heart. Times have changed and many companies have now abandoned them. 
Theyve been replaced with modern tools like videos, audios, fax on demand, 
auto-responders on the internet, telephone conference calls and internet 
presentations. All of which can be viewed or listened to at a time that suits 
you from home -Far more civilized!

STARTER PACK
A kit of information and often some products that you can purchase from a 
company to start your business properly. Dont even think of trying to do 
without it - youll fail.
