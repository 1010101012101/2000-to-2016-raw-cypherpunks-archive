Dear Joe,
As far as Erik Rosser in concerned, he made his mark in Tailand and Taiwan. 
He took videos with him having sex with preteen girls, some as young as 8 or 
9. Yahoo clubs is a haven for hosting club that cater to pedophiles wishing 
to swap pictures of child porn. All you need to do is become a member using 
a false e-mail address (I suggest you set one up through hotmail. Yes this 
is totally legal) so you can gather information on those clubs. If you do 
this, keep track og the URL's of the clubs and turn this information over to 
us so we can check these clubs out and get those perps busted. As soon as 
you receive your application, fill it out and return it to the address 
provided in the e-mail you receive. If I may ask, do you have a background 
working with children and if so, what do you do? We look foward to receiving 
your application. If your application is approved, (in this business, we 
must check out all new members throughly. This is for all concerned) you 
will receive an e-mail from Mr. Echols giving you useful and valuable 
information on how to carry out your work with BAM. You will also be given 
the names of of three Assistant Executive Directors, along with Mr. Echols, 
are experienced with working with new members. All of use are glad to work 
with new members until they get their "feet wet" and can handle being on 
their own. Please feel free to contact me at the address below or at the 
address you just used if you have any more questions.

Dear Mr. Terry,

Thank-you for responding so quickly to my earlier email.

It is disheartening to learn that BoyChat is trying to reestablish
itself.  Our children are indeed, as you said, out greatest resource,
and no effort is too great to prevent them from being preyed upon
by perps.

I did have one question, which I forgot to include in my earlier
message, however.  I read a message on another chat board saying
that BoyChat was down from a "Massive DDoS Attack."  What kind of
attack is that, and is it something BAM will teach me when I join
so that I can make pedophile sites go down too?

I didn't catch America's Most Wanted last night, but it makes me
physically ill to think of the unspeakable acts Mr. Rosser is doing
to the children in Spain.

I haven't see any child pronorgraphy on the Web yet.  But there is
lots of adult pornography which opens windows in my browser faster
than I can close them and then I have to reboot.

God Bless you and Mr. Echols, and the wonderful work you are doing.

Sincerely yours,
Joe Cypherpunk
