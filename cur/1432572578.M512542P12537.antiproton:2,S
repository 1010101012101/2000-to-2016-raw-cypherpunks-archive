We don't need the money, the money needs us, and I expect something like
6,999,999,900 redundancies will suddenly find themselves with various forms
of basic income guarantees once the money finally figures out it's automating
itself out of job, and realizes it needs to start giving the HCF (human
confinement farms) money or humans are going to stop spending it, and this,
my friends, would be the end of money.

What's important for this cypherpunk is to figure out how to make sure we have
alternatives and free choice to leave the HCFs and choose among many basic 
income systems, or make the choice to not use money at all.

Are blockchains a reasonable thing to build a basic income system on? How do
you ensure a blockchain private key is held or controlled by only one person,
so that one cannot simply create many anonymous IDs and collect several hundred
basic income guarantees? 

It seems there must be a human factor, and something that looks a lot like a
government, but I can't quite wrap my head around how to make sure each of
those 7e9 redunancies can only create 7e9 basic income generating accounts, and
do a moderately good job of identifying and stopping those that try to collect,
via force, coercion, or deceit, more than their share of basic income.
