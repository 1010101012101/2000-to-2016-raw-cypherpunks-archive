It does approach that.  One of the proofs offered by Beleivers is
that it is impossible for human beings to pass through the Van
Allen belts and live.  Because they have been called "radiation"
belts and as we all know, radiation is deadly.

1969 and later, actually.  :D

Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/
directional high gain antennas followed the missions from Earth
orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice
and telemetry signals.  The cost of sending transmitters to the
Moon, and maintaining a constant stream of 100% believable signals
all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.

Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.

Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.

Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the
Soviets could not have kept a lid on something like that.

:o)
