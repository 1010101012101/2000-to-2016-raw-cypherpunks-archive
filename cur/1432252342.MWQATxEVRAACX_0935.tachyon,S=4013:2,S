TEMPEST really refers to two kinds of technology -
keeping equipment quiet, and reading signals from not-quiet-enough
equipment.  The former category is the main thing that would
apply to private citizens, and it's not addressed here.

I suppose there's also the issue of whether police can use
evidence eavesdropped by private citizens, but there are
probably similar cases dealing with cameras.

Agreed.  The decision sounded like it there'd have been no issue
if the police had obtained a warrant first - after all,
they could have no-knocked on the door and come in,
if they'd had any actual evidence.
And they could have lurked outside the house watching for
suspicious-looking visitors if they thought this was commercial.

And unfortunately, just because the guy won in the Supremes
doesn't mean he gets his dope back :-)
