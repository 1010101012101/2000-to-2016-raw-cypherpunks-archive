The bombing in Omagh was attributed to the 'Real IRA' a breakaway group who
I believe are generally considered to be more hard line than IRA.

As far as I understand it they are not the same organisation.

Myth.

29 people were killed in an real IRA bombing in Omagh in 1998. This
was a shopping High Street full of people.

The warning given was incorrect and _increased_ the number of deaths
because the terrorists said, probably on purpose, the wrong end of the
street and the people were moved towards the bomb.
