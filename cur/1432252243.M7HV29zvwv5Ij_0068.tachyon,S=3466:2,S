After the cherubim and the seraphim,lou Cipher had to fall for you.

You see right through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn,
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn.
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show.
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know.
Nobody will ever let you know,
When you ask the reasons why.
They just tell you that you're on your own,
Fill your head all full of lies.
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn.
The gates of life have closed on you and there's just no return.
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away.
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day.
Nobody will ever let you know,
When you ask the reasons why.
They just tell you that you're on your own,
Fill your head all full of lies.
You bastards!
Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow; life is killing you.
Dreams turn to nightmares, heaven turns to hell.
Burns out confusion, nothing more to tell.
Yeah.
Ev'rything around you, what's it coming to?
God knows as your dog knows;Bog blast all of you.
Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, nothing more to do.
Living just for dying, dying just for you
Yeah.
