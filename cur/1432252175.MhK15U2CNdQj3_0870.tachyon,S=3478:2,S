The concept of a networking technology or a network which is specifically
used
for illegal information is an interesting concept, for example Tim May
"blacknet" [1, 2, 3] and Biddle, et al. "darknet" [4].  If you would like to
use "darknet" to mean something else then I can't stop you, but I would like
to
talk about that concept so I need a word for it.

P.S.  The most salient difference between blacknet [1] and darknet [2] in my
opinion is that blacknet is a market, in which participants are motivated by
economic gain, and darknet is a more general concept, in which the
motivations
of participants may be various -- including but not limited to friendship.
