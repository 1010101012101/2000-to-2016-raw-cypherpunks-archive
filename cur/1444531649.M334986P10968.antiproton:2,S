More info and explanations of the USA's gig is nearly up (and I'm
pretty sure their last estimate of 2023 lates, is certainly much
further into the future than the actual reset/collapse of US dollar):
http://english.pravda.ru/business/finance/08-10-2015/132278-us_treasury_swap-0/

"There are $630 trillion in outstanding derivatives globally according
to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland. That
is, about $630 trillion in bets placed on about $100 trillion in
stocks and bonds."

I'm guessing that's the global position - so the USA govt, wall street
etc account for about half of all the world's debts and derivatives -
I assume these figures are just for US dollars. There are perhaps
other, much smaller, currency markets - bitcoin of course, but perhaps
other currencies too.
