Aside from May, who woulda thunk it? One could argue that the investment banks
were not self-regulating after all, but perhaps the fault boils down to a
plain-and-simple statist approach to the money supply. There is no "economic
stimulation" knob after all, or if there is the economy eventually cancels out
external stimulation so that the stimulation is temporary.

Actually, the US economy is arguably not a hell of a lot different than a
crack whore: The government gives it periodic toots of blow but it has built
up a tolerance and the old tricks don't do it no more.

Arguably, a government MIGHT be able to facilitate economic growth through
things like education and perhaps some infrastructure. But growth doesn't come
in a can and this governmental imposition of ultra-leverage hasn't done much
but redistribute wealth into the Hamptons and the upper East side...these are
the pimps that have to be paid in order for the defense industry to have a go
tryin' a little anal with ole' Lady Liberty.
