Anti pollution laws do not apply to government or to government officials 
acting in the course of their duties.  If the government spreads deadly 
pollutants everywhere, then the government is innocent, but all private 
businesses that somehow facilitated the action of the government, perhaps 
by supplying it with equipment, or by allowing it to confiscate the land 
which it polluted, or by having the pollution spread upon their property, 
are guilty.
