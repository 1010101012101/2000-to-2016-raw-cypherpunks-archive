Last year I used a duffel bag as a carry-on that I occasionally use to transport firearms. I was pulled out of line at the checkpoint and they spent about 10 minutes swabbing the bag and examining it before I was allowed to board the plane.

Airport chemical "sniffers" apparently look for the signature of nitrogen
compounds, not "explosives," per se.  I've often wondered how many weekend
gardeners have gotten hassled and delayed because of trace amounts of
ammonia-based fertilizers on their person and effects.  If you plan to fly,
be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before heading out for the airport if
you have been shoot, gardening or house cleaning.
