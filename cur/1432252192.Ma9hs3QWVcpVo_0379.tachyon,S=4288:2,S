Dear  ,

developerWorks is constantly looking for ways to expose you to 
forums about open standards and cross-platform technologies.  
Solutions, The IBM Technical Developer Conference, is a great 
opportunity to do just that. Thousands of developers from around
the world will meet at the conference to trade information, 
share knowledge and -- most importantly -- find answers.  
Knowledgeable experts will address issues related to enterprise 
infrastructure, integration, open standards, Web services and 
interoperability.  

Well respected technology leaders - like 
Kevin Curley, Doug Tidwell and Kelvin R. Lawrence - will lead 
discussions on the application and advancement of JSP(TM), 
EJB(TM), and Java(TM) technologies, Servlets, J2EE(TM), XML 
and Web Services, to name a few. Choose from 372 hours of 
technical sessions on WebSphere(R), Lotus(R) Domino Rnext, 
Tivoli(R), DB2(R), and more; take in-depth labs on IBM's open
middleware; and tap into IBM's vast technical resources to help
build a powerful e-infrastructure.  Enhance your resume by 
taking one (or more) of the 130 IBM Professional Certification
Tests offered.  Arm yourself with the skills and tools you need 
to succeed.

Mark your calendars for August 13-16, San Francisco, CA.  
Register now to save $200 with the Early Bird discount!
