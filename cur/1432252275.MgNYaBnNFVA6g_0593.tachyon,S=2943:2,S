No privacy is lost in the gmail system; no information about either
party is disclosed to any third party.  The information contained in the
message still remains private to the sender and recipient (well, to the
extent that any web-based mail can be considered "private").  Exactly
what "traditional legal guarantees" do you think would be lost in the
gmail system?

So what?  The average sender doesn't understand that mail is
"intercepted and parsed" by each SMTP or POP server encountered in the
path from sender to recipient.  Or that their message is written to the
hard disk of each of those systems as well.  What the average sender
understands is irrelevant unless there is some bearing on his
expectation of privacy in the message contents.

Really, what's the difference between scanning the message in order to,
say, render HTML tags it may contain, and scanning it in order to
generate targetted advertising based on keywords it contains?  The
latter could also be considered as merely part of the rendering process.
