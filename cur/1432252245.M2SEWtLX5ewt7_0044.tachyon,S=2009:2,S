Amusingly, you can't search for "pedophilia", but "paedophilia" works 
fine.  Apparently sexualizing European children isn't as filthy as 
sexualizing American children.

You can't search for "naked children", but the first hit on "lolita," 
which you can search for, is an advertisement for pictures of naked 
children.

"Preventing child pornography" is a no-no. "Sex offenders" works.  
"Protecting kids from sex offenders" doesn't.

"Bestiality" is blocked.  But "sodomized by a horse" returns all sorts of 
hits, including one about a man who died of massive internal injuries 
while tresspassing at a stud farm.

Am I the only one who thinks ask.com is being silly here?  For every 
blocked term, there is an nearly identical unblocked term you can search 
for.
