Political figures in most countries have been using their personal email
accounts to conduct business 'under the radar' in order to avoid
information being subject to oversight, most probably because its
illegal, unconstitutional or at the very least not good for the image of
governments.

When they started to do this, they threw the book on ethics in the bin
and opened themselves up to any abuse of their personal life that may
happen.

If people in power act properly in their professional dealings then
their is an argument against d0xing their personal information but once
they start to try to hide information then it's open season on every
aspect of their life.
