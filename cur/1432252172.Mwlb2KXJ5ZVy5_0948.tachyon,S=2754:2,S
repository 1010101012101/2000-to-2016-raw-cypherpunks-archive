I'm thinking about a WiFi repeater...

Imagine I work on a high floor in an office tower, but I know that very 
nearby, on the ground floor, there's a public WiFi hotspot.

Now let's say I want to be able to access that hotspot, but I'm currently 
out of range due to the height.

DOES THERE EXIST something like a WiFi "repeater", which will allow me to 
"reach" that public WiFi spot without my being within 200 feet or so? (I 
deploying one or more repeaters throughout our offices so that I can reach 
the public hotspot.)


Of course, it's also better if that repeater masks who I am to the real 
hotspot, and terminates encryption on both sides. But of course, I don't 
want it to cost a ton, and I probably don't want anyone else to be able to 
use it either.

One nice application of this is to be able to regularly send messages from 
this public spot, but without anyone every actually seeing me. And if the 
"last" repeater is in these (private) offices somewhere, it's doubtful 
anyone would ever be able to tell that this is occurring.

Or so I believe...
