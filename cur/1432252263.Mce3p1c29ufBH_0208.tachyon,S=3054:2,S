Didn't find anything in Calif codes.  Might be in case law, where someone
argued the livingg section of their RV was not part of the car.  

Did find this unconstitutional bauble: 


401.  Every person who deliberately aids, or advises, or encourages
another to commit suicide, is guilty of a felony.

I encourage the author of that law to commit suicide.  "Encouraging"
is speech.
