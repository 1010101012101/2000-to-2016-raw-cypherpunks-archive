Granted, this thread is probably about as old and dead as it can get.

I've had an electronics engineer, a former professor of mine and someone 
who claims to have worked on the original cruise missiles, tell me that, 
and I'll paraphrase as close as I can get to a quote, "one drop on the 
tongue of a dog is enough to kill a man".  From what he provided, these 
things tend to cause cancer, and the dirt underneath old transformers, 
should those transformers have become leaky, is probably adequately 
tainted, and already needs clean up anyway.  Impound a few ounces of 
alleyway dirt with the car.

Then you're doing the planet a Service.  Boxing up preexisting contaminated 
waste.

Good luck,

Sean Roach
