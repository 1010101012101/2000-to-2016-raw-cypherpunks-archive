"I think that's the source as well - when the most recent of the
TWINKLE and TWIRL papers came out, Lucky Green was talking about
whether it was still safe to use 1024-bit keys,
and $1B for 1 key/day is similar to Shamir & Tromer's estimate of
            ( http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cbtwirl.pdf )
$20M upfront plus $10M for a 1 key/year capacity."

My first question is, how easy is it for them to estimate the key size of an 
encrypted message?

Can they do this without actually "chewing" on the message for a while? (ie, 
if it doesn't crack in x minutes then there's a 99% probability of the key 
being Y in length...)

Second question: Is it possible to make a message appear to have been 
encrypted with a shorter key than was actually used?
