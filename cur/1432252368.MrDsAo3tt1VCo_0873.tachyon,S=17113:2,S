I gather from this that you and "The Idjit" share a common upstream
path?  Let's see now: you're [supposed] to be a reasonably "bright" guy -
It didn't occur to you that the upstream NSP was contacted because they
are the next in line from the ISP?   Are you saying [with a straight
face] that you don't know what you are looking at?

Disingenuous.  Totally.

Bzzt.  I complained to the upstream ISP, and their upstream NSP.  Normal
practice and procedure: I personally have to look at several thousands of
these a day at work...

Look again Declan (clue: the email I complained about *is _clearly_
visible, in your original tirade about me - see below*.  Nowhere did we
complain about you: anyone with the reading abilities of an
armchair could see what we were bitching about.  Sorry that UU has an
abuse desk staffed with dropouts from the short bus, but such is
life...  Maybe you should have pointed ot the obvious to them, ya?  Of
course, it's obviously *much* more satisfying for you to yell and scream
like a 4 year old who has been rejected from the Romper Room Playtime
Games...

Then maybe you need a new provider.  We, like everyone else, gets
complaints.  A responsible upstream is going to actually *examine* any
complaints for validity before taking any action.  If your ISP doesn't
fall into this category then you shouldn't be doing business with them
should you?

Wrong:  *OUR* part.  But unlike us, you are apparently unwilling to accept
your piece of responsibility.  You went off half cocked, with no looking
back, and now it has [rightfully] bitten you in the ass.  You have abused
your position as a "journalist" here.  You have sullied your own
reputation here.  And you did it all by yourself.

I made an honest mistake, and acknowledged it openly when it was pointed
out.  

You went off on your little revenge kick, and now that the world can see
you in the dark colors you have painted yourself with you are pissed off
and looking to dump YOUR responsibilities. You want the world to think of
you as a responsible, honorable, and *honest* journalist?  After THIS?  

Yeah.  Right.

Why don't YOU be more careful before accusing someone of being
Censorhappy?

Pot. Kettle.  VERY black.

As I said before: I am *very* disappointed in you - I *thought* you were
better than this.

Yours, 
J.A. Terranson
sysadmin@mfn.org

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
