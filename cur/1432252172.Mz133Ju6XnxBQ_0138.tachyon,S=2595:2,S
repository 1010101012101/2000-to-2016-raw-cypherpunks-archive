As I'm feeling chatty this morning, I'll comment on another trend I've 
been seeing a lot of. While reading the Andrew Orlowski piece on Robin 
Hanson and the PAM/terror futures thing

( the URL is <http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html>  )

I got to thinking about "What ever happened to Max More?" (the founder 
of the Extropians group)

I did some Googling and found out he and his wife (Natasha 
Vita-More...the Extropians often change their names to more 
future-sounding monikers) are some kind of "motivational coaches" or 
involved in software to do the same.

Then while Googling on Omnivora Policy Systems, or whatever that 
"disappearing ink" company is, I ran across the name Jeff Ubois, the 
guy who attended some of my parties. His resume is chockfull of 
references to "motivational' and "coaching" and similar squishy-soft 
consulting gigs.

Way too many people think they can become the next Tony Robbins, that 
Neanderthal on late night t.v. selling motivational tapes.

The good ideas, the good companies, the good technology...it comes from 
good ideas and good products, not from EST nonsense, not from 
motivational coaches, not from late night hucksters.

Having talked to some of these folks, though not for the past few 
years, it really bugs me to see them going down this bullshit path.

warrant." --John Stuart Mill
