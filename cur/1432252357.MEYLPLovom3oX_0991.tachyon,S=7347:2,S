A weasler. You previously claimed that remailers routinely allowed 
this. Note that they usually don't, and certainly not without the 
remailer blocks present. Given that virtually no such messages made 
to the CP list have included such blocks, clearly what you claimed 
was not feasible.

This is a lie. Plain and simple. There was Kremvax, but this predated 
Julf's PENET service by a couple of years. At the time of Julf's 
service, roughly 1992 to its shutdown in 1996, there were no other 
such systems. Please name one if you can.

Your language above shows that your are you just bullshitting. You 
can't name a viable competitor, because there weren't any.

And Julf's system has been down for four years. A lifetime in 
Internet years. Certainly of no relevance whatsover to your plaintiff 
calls for people to use reply-enable remailers if they wish to post 
to the list.

Duh. Are you just now figuring this stuff out?

Duh. Get back to us when you figure out how chained remailers work, 
with PGP-nested messages. On second thought, _don't_ get back to us.

You have zero understanding of the issues involved.

I regret having wasted even ten minutes today responding to you.

This is rich. See my 1992 presentation on Chaumian remailers, given 
at the first Cypherpunks meeting, in September. See the earlier cited 
memos from 1988-91. See the features I described in detail. Compare 
to the reality of extant remailers. Then repeat your above comment 
with a straight face.

Fucking newbies.
