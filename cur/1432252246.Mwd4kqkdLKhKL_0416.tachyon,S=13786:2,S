            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ICONIP'02, SEAL'02, and FSKD'02 will be jointly held in Orchid Country
Club, Singapore from November 18 to 22, 2002. The conferences will not
only feature the most up-to-date research results in natural and arti-
ficial neural systems, evolutionary computation, fuzzy systems, and 
knowledge discovery, but also promote cross-fertilization over these 
exciting and yet closely-related areas. Registration to any one of the 
conferences will entitle a participant to the technical sessions and 
the proceedings of all three conferences, as well as the conference 
banquet, buffet lunches, and tours to two of the major attractions in 
Singapore, i.e., Night Safari and Sentosa Resort Island. Many well-
known researchers will present keynote speeches, panel discussions, 
invited lectures, and tutorials.

About Singapore
---------------
Located at one of the most important crossroads of the world, 
Singapore is truly a place where East and West come together. Here you 
will find Chinese, Indian, and Malay communities living together, 
their long established cultures forming a unique backdrop to a clean 
and modern garden city. English is spoken everywhere and is the common 
business language of all. Few places on earth promise such a delight 
for the palate, with gourmet cuisine from over 30 countries. Exotic 
resorts in neighboring countries are only a short bus/ferry ride away.

Orchid Country Club (OCC)
-------------------------
The venue for this year's conferences is at one of Singapore's 
premier country clubs, a 25-minute bus ride from the city. Away from 
the hustle and bustle of downtown Singapore, the tranquil setting of 
the resort is ideal for serious technical discussions with an 
accommodating space and ambience for relaxation. Not to miss out on 
the splendor of downtown Singapore, the organizer has also secured 
good quality and affordable accommodation in the heart of the city 
with pre-arranged transport to/from the OCC. For golf enthusiasts, 
OCC is equipped with the largest computerized driving range in South 
East Asia and boasts of a 27-hole golf course with facilities for 
night golfing, ideal for relaxation after each day of technical 
discussions. Visit the OCC website at http://www.orchidclub.com

Night Safari and Sentosa Resort Island 
--------------------------------------
It is said that a visit to Singapore is not complete without making 
a trip to two of the Republic's famous attractions. The only one of 
its kind in the world, the Night Safari provides a setting for 
visitors to experience what it is like to observe animals in their 
nocturnal habitat. The island of Sentosa offers some unique 
attractions and a visit there will also provide a glimpse and 
imagery of Singapore's past and present. Visits to these two 
attractions will be included as recreation for the joint conference.
