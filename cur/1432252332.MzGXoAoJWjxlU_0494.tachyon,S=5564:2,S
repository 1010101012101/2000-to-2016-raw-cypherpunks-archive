I didn't really need to be reminded of that...  Now I
have diet coke all over my keyboard.  Shame on you.

Oh, wait. We have cell-phones now and so should rather
telephone the local constabulary and let _them_
apprehend the miscreant.

On the other hand, we could save lots of money if we
used bullets that have been drilled out and filled
with mercury.  True, we might have to deal with
PETArds getting in a uproar over the heavy-metal
poisoned wrecks littering the sides of the roads, but
we can write that down as an opportunity cost.  Fight
fire with fire, I say.

I think so, but I should probably go back and refresh
my memory.  Just to be sure.

But if I submit a terrorist report to one of those
places will it eventually end up registered in their
terrorism database?  Probably not.  Obviously, they
need a 1-800 number or something that goes straight to
the DHS.

If they don't have a good enough dictionary for their
filters now, they never will.

"you - the meat blob."  How flattering.

That can't be good.  Is the measure of proximity to
"real terrorists" on a scale that uses a linear
scalar, or a logarithmic one?

I imagine that it would be too hard to screen for
criminals and terrorists completely, rendering the
idea of a private forum moot.

No shit.

Sounds like bad management if that's still the
problem.  Maybe the cops should hire a few management
consultants and tune their workflow system.  We should
tell them, though, that if they do that they must
remember to brief the consultants thoroughly on the
other consultants from the private sector -- the ones
that are _already_ involved with various things
related to law enforcement.  Good consultants hate
surprises.

How about a presidential order that says that they all
have to run and use Peoplesoft (or something similar)
to facilitate better interoperability?  That might
work too.

I suppose that last bit depends somewhat on the number
who are going into the private sector, as opposed to
those who are going into a `true' retirement from
work.

It's likely they just haven't gotten around to doing
it yet.  Maybe it'll get done for the next major
release.
