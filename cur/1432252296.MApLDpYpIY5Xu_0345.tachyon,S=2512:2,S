Hello all.

I have a question about RADIUS, including portmaster, especially
authentication system.

How RADIUS system protects his system and user's information from sniffers
when the NAS sends some information including user's password which has
eccrypted with MD5. I want to know the system against "replay attack" from
attackers.

If you vave any infomation about my question, please tell me.

Thank you.
