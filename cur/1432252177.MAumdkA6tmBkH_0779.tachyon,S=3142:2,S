hi there,

i would be happy if anyone knows details or can point me somewhere to
get to know more about the facebook sim card:

http://fr.sitestat.com/gemplus/gemalto/s?tel_facebook&ns_type=pdf

http://gigaom.com/mobile/facebook-sim-card-uses-sms-gemalto/

do you know of independent technical documents, academic papers or other
good sources of information?

fyi: this is one of the ways how facebook is getting access to new users
that are using so called "simple phones", the ones without even j2me
capabilites. and this user group is huge in many parts of the world.

if you are interested in the general trajectory and technological set up
of facebook how to reach more mobile phones, this text is really good:

http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/

fb has developed solutions for all the different types of phones and
uses the fast growing mobile telephony market e.g. in some african
countries to lock-in users at their first contact with mobile media.

thanks,
oliver
