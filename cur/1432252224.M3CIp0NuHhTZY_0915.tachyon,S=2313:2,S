Hi list
Does anyone have any idea what NOOS stands for in connection with the US
Department of Commerce?

The letters NOOS was spotted in a round badge -- NOOS in the middle, US
Department of Commerce along the circle in the bottom - four words in the
top -- but I don't know which.

Any help?

Yours
Bo Elkjaer, Denmark
