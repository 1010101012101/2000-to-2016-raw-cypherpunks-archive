What a crock of horseshit!  The 650th MI group is a counterintelligence =
unit; it chases spies and terrorists.  It is not an intelligence =
analysis organization and does not conduct signals intelligence or =
coordinate SIGINT wiht anybody.  This Dane was drinking too much Gamel =
Dansk when he wrote the story.
