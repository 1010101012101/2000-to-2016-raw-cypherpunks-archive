That's the point.  There is no link to SSL or PKI.
The only thing in common is the objective - to
protect the user when browsing.  Secure browsing
is now being offered by centralised database sans
crypto.

Sure, I think it is a piece of junk, myself.  But I
am not important, I'm not an "average user."
The only thing that is important is what the user
thinks and does.

When Netcraft announced their plugin had been
ported from IE to Firefox last week, they also
revealed that they had "60,000 downloads in
hours."  That tells us a few things.

Firstly, users want protection from phishing.

Secondly, Netcraft have succeeded enough
in the IE world in creating a user base for their
solution that it easily jumped across to the
Firefox userbase and scored impressive numbers
straight away.  Which tells us that it actually
delivers something useful (which may or may
not be security).  So we cannot discount that
the centralised database concept works "well
enough" by some measure or other.

So now we wait to see which model wins in
protecting the user from spoofing.
