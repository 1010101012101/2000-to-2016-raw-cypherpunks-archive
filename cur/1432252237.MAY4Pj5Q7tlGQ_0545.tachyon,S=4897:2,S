  Sameer Parekh is best known for being the founder of C2Net Software, Inc.

  Sameer Parekh went to high school in Libertyville, IL. He was an active
  participant on the Ripco BBS in Chicago when it was raided by the Secret
  Service during Operation Sundevil. This was at about the same time as the
  raid of Steve Jackson Games (where Parekh's friend and co-founder of C2Net
  Douglas Barnes was to eventually work.) and the forming of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation. In his high school he published an underground
  newspaper called The Free Journal, which promoted free speech and other
  libertarian ideas.

  Parekh moved to Berkeley, CA in 1993 to attend school at the University of
  California, Berkeley and joined the cypherpunks. In his second year at Cal,
  he started C2Net.

  After selling C2Net, Parekh traveled around Central and Eastern Europe in
  2001 on a DJ tour. He played in countries such as Poland, Serbia, Croatia,
  Latvia. During his travels he discovered how people new to freedom don't
  take it for granted quite as much people in the United States. On September
  11th, 2001 he was staying in the Backpack Hostel in Budapest, Hungary as he
  watched the World Trade Center collapse live on CNN International.

  He then finished his degree at Cal, getting an undergraduate degree in
  Economics.

  He moved to Arizona in 2005 and is now pursuing a commission in the United
  States Marine Corps.
