Who on this list has not done so?<br>

Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which gene=
rally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. Thunderbird dete=
cts the nearest wifi networks .<br>
<br>
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby wifi=
 networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against the data =
collected by google during street view surveys.<br>
<br>
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the auth=
orities with the closest street address to where you are using Thunderbird,=
 and pictures taken from the street very close to that address. =C2=A0Thus =
the authorities not only have your email, which being sent in the clear has=
 no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of building that you are sit=
ting in when sending the email.<br>
