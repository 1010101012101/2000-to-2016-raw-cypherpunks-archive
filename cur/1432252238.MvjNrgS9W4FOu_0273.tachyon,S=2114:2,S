Here, its not NAT turning people into consumers (cf Walker's Speak
Freely rant),
but a no-server policy which seems to be too broadly implemented --legit
uses are also blocked.

Maybe time for UDP protocols, or TCP-to-UDP proxies.  Over DNS ports :-)

When SYNs are outlawed, only outlaws will SYN.

There are some legitimate uses that are stifled as a price for reducing
illegitimate uses," said John Vaughn, executive vice president of the
Association for American Universities

One student who asked not to be named said he was upset that he can no

regularly joust with 15 others, but the school restricts using a
computer as a server, so he's given up the activity.
