	You are digging yourself deeper =)

	My position is radically different to that of quinn and his
	mob and yet you think we are both 'likeable'? Your opinions
	here are absurd.

	Not to mention, again, that you think that a totalitarian piece
	of shit like quinn is a good guy. Since you believe that, your
	moral judgements are a bad joke...which shows what you really
	stand for.

	Fine. I'm not tolerant either. I don't tolerate stupidity and
	evil intentions or acts. As to being 'open minded', again, I'm
	certainly not open minded to stupidity. Being 'open minded' to
	stupidity is hardly a virtue.

	Not sure who you are calling radical? The nazis? The problem
	with the nazis were not that they were radicals. Or that they
	were 'boring'...

	I don't think your explanation changes anything. You want to
	ignore this particular poll because it doesn't paint the
	americunts in a good light. But the poll is completely
	consistent with americunt 'culture'. If anything the real
	numbers are prolly higher.

	No need. You won't get anywhere =)
