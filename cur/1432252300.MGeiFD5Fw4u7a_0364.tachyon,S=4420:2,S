That's a really interesting question. My off-the-cuff answer 
would be 'no'. The constraints which say that the problem is 
randomly generated by a computer and the answer also evaluated 
by a computer are the killers. Any problem which one computer 
can create, and solve, can also be solved by another.

Perhaps one could generate the solution, and find a problem 
which is solved by that solution, but finding a type of 
problem which humans will always solve one way, and
computers another is the rub.

You refer the the problem of recognizing a photo of an animal. 
It used to be said that no computer program could reliably 
distinguish between a dog and a cat, but I'm not sure that's 
the case since the development of neural networks.

Almost any question which has a solution which is clear, 
unambiguous, and easy determined by a human can probably 
also be solved by either a regular program or a neural net.

What you are really attempting to find is a reliable, fast, 
single-question Turing test. I'm far from sure this is 
possible.
