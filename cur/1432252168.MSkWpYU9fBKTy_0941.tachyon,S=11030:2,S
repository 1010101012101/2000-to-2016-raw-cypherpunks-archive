Subject: [drone-list] DHS FOIA on Privacy from Drones
X-Mailer: Microsoft Office Outlook 11

DHS (US Dept of Homeland Security) came out TODAY with a FOIA document
internally dated Sep 2012, regarding Privacy from Drones.

http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/foia/working-group-to-sa
feguard-privacy-civil-rights-and-civil-liberties-in-the-departments-use-and-
support-of-unmanned-aerial-systems-uas-s1-information-memorandum-09142012.pd
f 

I started subscribing to news of OTHER people FOIA regarding drones.
Occasionally I see some very interesting info there.

I downloaded it, naming my copy "DHS Drone Privacy 2012 Sep" (I name based
on institution, topic, vintage)

I don't see any copyright notice, limiting re-distribution.

It is 3 pages, 221 k, informing us about a working group led by:

*        CRCL = Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties

*        PRIV = Privacy Office

*        Alphabet soup of organizations within DHS which use drones, or plan
to use them.  There are some unfamiliar acronyms there, which I will be
working on finding translations for.

 

This working group will address privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties
issues, with drones, which people have been screaming at DHS for years to
address.

They just thought this would be a good idea to do.  I suspect some of the
screaming directed via Congress may have something to do with the timing.

 

CRCL and PRIV are aware of

*        CBP (US Customs and Border Patrol) allegedly operates approx 10
Predator drones at and along US borders.

*        USCG (US Coast Guard) helps train CBP, and is evaluating their own
future drone acquisition.

*        S&T (I am guessing this refers to Science and Technology
Directorate of DHS) which oversees a partnership with local law enforcement
and first responder drone usage.

o       I learned about S&T of DHS at
http://www.gizmag.com/homeland-security-predictions/24452/ 

 

They do not believe that DHS has any other active drone programs, but
recognize things may change in the future.  I will be checking my notes,
because that list looks awful small.

*        DHS = US Department of Homeland Security <http://www.dhs.gov/> [1]

o       Some US states also have departments with the same name.

o       DHS is one of the largest departments in the US government.  Its
mandate includes:

*        Anti-Terrorism Domestic

*        Border protection

*        Citizenship

*        Critical Infrastructure protection

*        Cyber Security

*        Emergency Management - FEMA

*        Immigration

*        Ready dot Gov

*        Transportation Security Agency (TSA)

*        US Coast Guard

*        US Secret Service, which protects the Currency, President, and
other key officials

o       DHS is one of several federal departments and agencies supposedly
flying drones over US National Air Space (NAS).[2]
