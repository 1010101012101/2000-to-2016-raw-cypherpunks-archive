The folks who worked at the federal building were far from 'plain' folks.
It isn't like they walked into a corner grocery.

In addition, the plain fact is there is a considerable underground
movement in this country today which is in direct and potentialy violent
opposition to this countries current political infra-structure.

Ask yourself this, how could a fugitive who is wanted for several bombings
stay un-found for four years? He certainly isn't working by himself and
there is considerable funding available clearly.

Minimize the politics as you may, it's just sticking your head in the
ground. These sorts of incidents are just the tip of an iceberg.

What legal ground was lost through the execution, apprehension, and
presecution of these people?
