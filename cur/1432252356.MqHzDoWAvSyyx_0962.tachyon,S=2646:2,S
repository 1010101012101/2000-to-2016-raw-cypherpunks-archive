Subject: UK Crypto Meet

I intend to arrange a short Cypher/Coderpunks-style meeting in London
during ApacheCon, which is 23-25th October at the Olympia Conference
Centre.

The main purpose of the meeting will be to discuss whether we should
have real crypto meetings in the London area, and how/where/when to do
that.

If anyone plans to come, then let me know (I'll need to know numbers so
I can book a room). If anyone cares which day/time, let me know. If
anyone wants to talk about anything in particular, let me know.

If no-one plans to come, I'll give up on the idea, so do tell me if you
are up for it!

Cheers,

Ben.
