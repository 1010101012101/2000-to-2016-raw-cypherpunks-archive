Well the point here is that the data encryption in GSM is not relevant to
the people running the network.  The authentication is secure,
so there is no fraud, so they still get the money from network
usage.  Privacy was never really there since
the traffic is not encrypted once it hit the base station, so the
relevant government agencies can be kept happy.
The encryption was only relevant to protect the consumers
from each other.
