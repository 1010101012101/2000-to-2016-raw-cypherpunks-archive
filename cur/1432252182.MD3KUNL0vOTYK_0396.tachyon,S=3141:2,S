It'd be a fine way to finance Assassination Politics, except the people
advertising that way are also the primary targets :-)

Most of those annoying things use JavaScript, which you should
normally keep turned off unless there's a page you *really* want to see
badly enough that you're willing to risk allowing to run dangerous stupid code
on your browser.  Some of them may use Java instead.

A slightly cuter technique is to pop up the new advertising window *behind*
the windows with the real content.  When you're done reading the
real windows and close them, the ad's sitting there politely waiting for you,
trying to sell you that X10 camera yet again.
