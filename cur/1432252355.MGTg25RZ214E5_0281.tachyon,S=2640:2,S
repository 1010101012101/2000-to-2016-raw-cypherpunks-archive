I think it's called OCR.

Paper ballots, marked by the voter, not by software, then counted by
software:

- the ballot and the audit document are one and the same - no opportunity
for software to mess with the printed record

- option for a quick and dirty recount by feeding the ballots through a
different counting machine (maybe with different software, from a
different vendor)

- further option for a manual recount of the original ballots (which are
probably more legible than any machine-printed receipts)

Oh, and by the way, these are the only kind of electronic voting machines
approved, so far, in Mass.
