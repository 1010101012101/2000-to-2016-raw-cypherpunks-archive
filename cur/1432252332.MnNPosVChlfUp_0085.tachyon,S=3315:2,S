Sorry, TEXASMAN8012, we are stll fulfilling the "help me make bombz" 
and "send me kiddie porn" requests of many before you.

After we fulfill the request sent in by Hackerdood, aka Stockton 
Police Department, and after the many requests of Cryptogrrllzz, aka 
Patterson, NJ Child Crimes Unit, and the many other PDs and DA's 
offices, we will get to your request for bomb information.

On the other hand, some are arguing that we simply kill cops and 
narcs like you.
