The way they changed the access to the data was pretty sleezy too.

That list was purchaced by any company that wanted to do direct marketing
to you via the mail and ghod who knows who else.  They wrote the rules so
that the marketing droids could still get the list, but the common folk
could not.  (You had to show a "need" to get the list.)

It used to be that you sent them some trivial amount ($50, if I remember
correctly) and a couple of 9-track tapes and you got the list.  Then
someone posted the list to the web and people got all freaked about it.
(Much more so than when the information was used to stalk and kill someone
famous.)

I guess the World Wide Web *is* the Fourth Horseman(tm)...
