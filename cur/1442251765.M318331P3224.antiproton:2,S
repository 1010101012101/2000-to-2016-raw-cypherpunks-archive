Maybe manufacturers aren't sure what they should be building in order to
genuinely and honestly be able to market as 'Respects Your Privacy'.
It sounds simple but when you look at the ultimate level of privacy
protection then you are talking about open source hardware, software and
manufacturing processes and proper auditing of all of these.
For a company to manufacture and market a device under these conditions
is likely to be hideously expensive and have a very small customer base
who are willing to pay such a large price in cash terms.
What might be a good idea is for a community such as this one to create
some sort of scale which describes the methods, materials and processes
to achieve some sort of scoring which would range from 'NSA Spying
Device' (0 out of 10) to 'Complete Privacy Protection' (10 out of 10).
This would then allow manufacturers to work to a specific score and
advertise as such.

cheers,
oshwm.
