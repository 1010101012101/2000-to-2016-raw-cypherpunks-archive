Right you are, unless the tokens are centrally cleared.  Dupe message-ids are 
only a violation if you get caught by the same server, so power spamers will 
sort their lists into bombing runs of one address per victim SMTP server and 
only need one token per run.  Doesn't eliminate their work factor, but it 
does reduce it.

Don't think so. Dates can be duped along with message-ids and they still get 
one trip around the servers on the same token.  I don't see this working 
without some kind of online clearing.  Hey, you DBC guys... how do you 
stiffen up an offline clearing protocol like this?
