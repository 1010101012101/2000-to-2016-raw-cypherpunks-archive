Some Secret: Open House, Open Bar



Remember a while back when it came out that intelligence agencies such as
the National Security Agency -- the supersecret spy crowd -- did not have
the resources to keep up with the flood of intercepts to be able to
translate terrorists' chatter on a timely basis?

This naturally caused a big fuss, and Congress pledged big bucks to get the
spooks up to speed. Seems to have worked out fine, judging from an invite
we got to attend an open house Dec. 7 at the National Cryptologic Museum
behind the Shell station at Fort Meade.

Lots of fine finger food to be had, including a "brie encrote with brown
sugar and pecans," some "Swiss cheese and chablis stuffed mushroom caps," a
bit of roast turkey with cranberry mayo and "mini pumpkin cheesecakes."

Our very fine invite with the NSA gold-embossed seal notes "Open bar."

Must have passed some kinda big supplemental.
