  IBM to Offer Encryption System
  Based on Chips for PCs, PDAs

  By WILLIAM M. BULKELEY

  April 10, 2006; Page B4

  International Business Machines Corp. expects to announce a chip-based
  encryption system that could simplify and cut the cost of how information
  is secured on personal computers, cellphones and personal digital
  assistants.

  The technology, "Secure Blue," is a method of designing part of a
  microprocessor to encrypt or scramble all the data it handles.

  The new encryption system is being launched as companies and governments
  are dealing with numerous instances of stealing of private data from laptop
  computers. Last month, a laptop containing unencrypted personal data on
  196,000 customers was stolen from a Fidelity Investments employee's car.

  The design, IBM says, can foil skilled hackers who might try to
  reverse-engineer its circuits. "If someone tries to access the chip by
  tampering, it can commit suicide on the spot," said Tim Ravy, a vice
  president in IBM's technology-collaboration solutions unit. IBM said it has
  a customer who already is using the system, but it declined to name the
  customer.

  Encryption software is one way to thwart unauthorized access to data. But
  except in powerful, large computers, running encryption software can be
  time-consuming and inconvenient.

  IBM said its engineers will work with processor makers to design the
  security features into their products. Mr. Ravy declined to speak about
  pricing.

  IBM has implemented Secure Blue in its own Power processors, which it sells
  to other companies, and in two other processors. It said it plans to
  approach other processor makers and companies in the defense,
  consumer-electronics, financial-services and digital-media markets. "The
  need to protect content is growing exponentially," Mr. Ravy said.
