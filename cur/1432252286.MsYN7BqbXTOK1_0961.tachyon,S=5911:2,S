PENTAGON MOVES TO COMBAT THE "INSIDER THREAT"

The Department of Defense has issued a new Instruction defining its
response to the "insider threat" from Department personnel who engage in
unauthorized disclosures of information or other activities deemed harmful
to national security.

The new Instruction assigns responsibilities and authorities for
systematically detecting "anomalous" employee behavior that may be an
indication of an insider threat.

An insider threat is defined as "A person with authorized access, who uses
that access, wittingly or unwittingly, to harm national security interests
or national security through unauthorized disclosure, data modification,
espionage, terrorism, or kinetic actions resulting in loss or degradation
of resources or capabilities."

A subset of the insider threat is the counterintelligence (CI) insider
threat, which refers to an authorized individual who uses his access on
behalf of a "foreign intelligence entity."

A foreign intelligence entity (FIE) is "Any known or suspected foreign
organization, person, or group (public, private, or governmental) that
conducts intelligence activities to acquire U.S. information, blocks or
impairs U.S. intelligence collection, influences U.S. policy, or disrupts
U.S. systems and programs."

All heads of DoD components are now instructed to "implement CI insider
threat initiatives to identify DoD-affiliated personnel suspected of or
actually compromising DoD information on behalf of an FIE."

All military departments are expected to "conduct anomaly-based detection
activities."

See "Countering Espionage, International Terrorism, and the
Counterintelligence (CI) Insider Threat," DoD Instruction 5240.26, May 4,
2012:

	http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/i5240_26.pdf

The new Instruction complies with a congressional mandate in the FY2012
defense authorization act that was passed last year in response to the
WikiLeaks disclosures.
