already countered, Justin did not specify the time frame.

So S2 already.

An example?  A prime example?  Every few pages?  What book?  What page?
What citation?

Where did the "the" go?

Try

      On the quote in question, I have a copy of Clive Ponting's Churchill
      book balanced on my knee right now, and I can confirm that the quote
      is word for word, except that the emphases have fallen off it with
      the loss of italics ('an innocent record and' 'altogether
      disproportionate' 'mainly acquired by violence, largely maintained
      by force').

      Strike one to Chomsky.

this, from the lbo-talk list, I welcome anyone to parse their publicly
archived list and prove me wrong.  I'd give a url, but fuck james, I
want him to work for it.

 >And while he is at it, <snip>

You are a broken record.

Are you a former student of Chomsky?
A failed student, perhaps?
