According to the article at 
<http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010412/wr/tech_fraud_dc_1.html>, the 
International Chamber of Commerce's Commercial Crime Bureau and Cybercrime 
Unit - which apparently "polices all financial and intellectual property 
rights breaches on the Internet" - has identified "the problem with the 
Internet", specifically -

"The problem with the Net is that it is not secure because Internet service 
providers don't run identity checks on their clients . . . [i]t is very 
easy to set up an email account and web page on an ISP offering free web 
space and no checks are done on the people setting them up."

That's funny. I was just thinking that the problem with the Internet is 
that it gives every control freak with a tinfoil badge and an AOL account 
the idea that they ought to "police" people and things they've never seen 
or heard of.
