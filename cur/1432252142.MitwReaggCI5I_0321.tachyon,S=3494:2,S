Hello Aimee,

Who might the "we" include?  You and who else?

But to comment on your statement-  Have you ever viewed the after 
action notes of FBI HRT member Lon Horiuchi after he shot Vicki 
Weaver in the head while holding her infant daughter?  Horiuchi's 
diagram of what he saw clearly shows the outline of Vicki in the 
doorway to their cabin- (Made on a hotel notepad.)  A clear 
indication that Horiuchi did in fact target her and not hit her by 
accident as alleged in the official report.

I'd have respect for the Bureau if they upheld the constitution and 
the rule of law over the blue wall of silence.

Regards,  Matt-
