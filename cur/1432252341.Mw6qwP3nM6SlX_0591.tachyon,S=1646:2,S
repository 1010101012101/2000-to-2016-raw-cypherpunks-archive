Oof, let me think a little more about this. I really hesitate to spam
people who may not have given half a care about Cpunks for the last 15
years, especially since there are still seemingly a good 250+ valid
email addresses among the 1600+ comprising the list of yesteryear.

Note that visiting the old URL shows the updated domain name, which
may sufficiently allay the concerns of at least some who are tempted
to return.
