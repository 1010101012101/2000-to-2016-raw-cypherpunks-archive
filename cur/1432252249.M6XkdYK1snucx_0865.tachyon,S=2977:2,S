I'd wish you wouldn't lay on the exegesis of the Sacred Document quite so
heavily. Reason: your prophet stinks. Please spare your's and our neurons
for more worthwhile endeavours.

If the stinking thing ever comes through you can always burn midnight oil
in efforts on how to misuse is in the best possible way. Meanwhile, the
amount of floorspace so far allotted is way overblown.
