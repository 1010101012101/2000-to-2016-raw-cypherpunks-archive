Anyone who expects a legal person on the long run to maximize anything else
than
shareholder value short-to-mid-term needs her head examined.

If they don't bend over backwards to cooperate with TLAs (for a corporation,
that would a first in known history) they're certainly a one-stop shop to
pick up information for any TLA that cares. You don't have to subpoena if
you tap upstream -- does anyone here doubt that all search engines are
tapped upstream? That would be criminally incompetent, wouldn't it.
