Using as little javascript as possible, not visiting JS sites (this
doesn't mean I am not pwned).

btw, the link you gave made laugh, from it:
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"
integrity="sha384-R4/ztc4ZlRqWjqIuvf6RX5yb/v90qNGx6fS48N0tRxiGkqveZETq72KgDVJCp2TC"
crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


Observe that they are loading it from HTTPS and after that they verify,
lol. Is this public admission that HTTPS is broken beyond repair?

As someone already pointed out, ``mobile code'' is tricky stuff.

If the quoted script had |eval(stuff)|, the signature is pointless,
since the code is dynamic.
