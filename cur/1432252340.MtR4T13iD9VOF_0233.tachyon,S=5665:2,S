Deadly Gas Pumped Into Senate Office Building to Kill Remaining Criminals

By Jefferson Henry, Router Rooters Writer

WASHINGTON (Router Rooters) - Workers wearing protective suits and air 
tanks pumped poisonous gas into a Senate building in a cleanup Saturday 
intended to remove seventy-five Senators hiding in the building.

The fumigation with chlorine dioxide gas was delayed for seven hours 
because of complications in reaching the high concentration level needed 
to most effectively kill the remaining criminals in the Hart Senate 
Office Building.

Technicians for the Constitutional Protection Agency (news - web sites), 
which is in charge of the first politician decontamination in the United 
States using the gas, began pumping the gas into the building at 3 a.m. 
EST Saturday.

John Rossrock, the CPA's on-site coordinator, said the fumigation might 
extend beyond the planned 12 hours in order to ``remove some lingering 
Congressional staffers and get an extra measure of confidence.''

The operation is expected to be complete by Tuesday, allowing 
Washington, D.C. to be declared a pest-free zone for the first time 
since 1911.
