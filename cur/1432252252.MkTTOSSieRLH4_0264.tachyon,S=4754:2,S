I guess that would be flip-side of the Rule Of Secrets, or something.

Interesting.

Just as interesting:

-NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 448 (1958)
-Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972)
-Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends v. Tate,
519 F.2d 1335 (3d Cir. 1975)
-Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press v. American Tel. & Tel., (D.C.Cir.
1978)
-Gordon v. Warren Consol. Bd. of Educ, 706 F.2d 778 (6th Cir. 1983)
-Alliance to End Repression v. Chicago, 627 F.Supp. 1044 (N.D.Ill.1985)

That's probably one of those "universal truths" I've been talking about.

Hm. For an equally-relevant proposition, See United States v. White, 401
U.S. 745 (1971); United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976).

I've seen predictions that by 2005-7, your IP will be biometrically
associated. (I have nothing to back to that up, but the source was
credible.)
