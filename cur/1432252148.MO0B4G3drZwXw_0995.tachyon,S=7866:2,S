No.  Other examples: FISA actions, internally dropped IRS investigations etc.

Technically speaking, if the homeowner is justified in using deadly force
otherwise (fear of imminent harm to life or property etc.) and in the absence
of a clear identification of the intruder as an officer, (verbal or otherwise)
contemporaneous street justice is the only thing that the homeowner needs to
fear.  (Note of course the requirement for "retreat to capacity" and such in
your state of residence and other use of deadly force ramifications).

I think you probably mean Mr. Sandfort.  I never took any position on that
issue or involved myself in the previous squabble that I believe you are
referring to.

It's "Happy-fun-court" not "Mr. Happy Fun Court" and insofar as that's a
metaphor for circumstances technically legal but subjectively ugly, yes.  I
doubt anyone here will contend that the shooting of a police officer (even an
off duty police officer committing a felony) will be treated like any other
shooting incident.  Fair enough to say that shooting police officers- in
whatever circumstances- might be tantamount to "taunting Happy-fun-court."

Agreed.

Beefing up security in conjunction with the commission of a crime is certainly
taunting Happy-fun-court.  No different than the old "why use crypto if you
have nothing to hide" argument, just a different (denser) audience than usual.
The rest of your implication about my position is overreaching on your part.
