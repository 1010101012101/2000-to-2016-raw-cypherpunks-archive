Again, I'm trying to cut out all the lawyers, contracts and so forth, there
are other ways to regulate, but it's all variables: a combination of nym
alternative dispute resolution, escrow concepts (money, and ID) and
reputational systems. Participants can choose disclosed, an
agency-infomediary or a "zeroknowledge" participation level, and define who
they are comfortable dealing with... just what you guys talk about, and just
like real life.

Exactly, and this is where I run into trouble. However, as long as SOMEBODY
is accountable, the goat of the wrongdoer isn't always required for the
transacting party. I am more concerned about policing the community, but I
do think it's possible outside of traditional legal and transactional
frameworks, reverting back, as Tim made reference to (as I have I, damnit)
the old polycentric merchant society frameworks.

Eh, I was just trying to envision a live pitch opportunity. An intelligence
development contract seemed in the ballpark for serious bank, and
privatization changes might be breeding some opportunity. Clearly, an open
source information mercantile system is already making the intelligence
agenda. I find it "not unthinkable" that Tim's agora will first see the
light of day as part of a legitimate intelligence endeavor.
