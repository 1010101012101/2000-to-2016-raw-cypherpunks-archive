It does appear that the law in England is not as "demanding" as I believed:

http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/legaltender.htm

<<The concept of legal tender is often misunderstood. Contrary to popular

parties to a transaction, but rather a legally defined means of payment that
should not be refused by a creditor in satisfaction of a debt.>>
