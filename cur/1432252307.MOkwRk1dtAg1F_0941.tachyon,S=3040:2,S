      In a segment airing on CBS' 60 Minutes II (www.cbsnews.com)
Tuesday night, April 3rd, 2001, various experts will be interviewed
regarding the growing number of business owners who have
stopped withholding federal taxes from their workers' paychecks

Revenue Service Commissioner (www.irs.gov ), Joseph R. Banister,
C.P.A., a former Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation
Division Special Agent (www.freedomabovefortune.com and
www.josephbanister.com ), a spokesman from the Cato Institute
(www.cato.org ), Al Thompson, owner of Cencal Aviation Products
www.cencal.com ), and others.  Check your local listings for exact
