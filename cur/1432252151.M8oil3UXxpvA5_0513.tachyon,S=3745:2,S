    Are you kidding? That's not much different than what lot's of people
carry around in their car trunk. And pretty reasonable for anyone in
today's world -- especially if you're hanging around in a soft target

aren't doing likewise, I guess that's just the darwinian/stupidity
factor proving itself, eh?
