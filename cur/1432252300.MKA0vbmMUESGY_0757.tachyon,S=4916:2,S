Another proprietary key format. Why not base such a system on OpenPGP?

Hmm. AES-256 with SHA-256? Children, what's wrong with the balance in this

How does a user verify authenticity of another user's public key?

Aside from being incompatible with anything else on the net, how is this
different or more secure than Hushmail? Than Cryptomail.org?
