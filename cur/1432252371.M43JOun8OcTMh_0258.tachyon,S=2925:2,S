In this forum, it is unlikely that anyone speaks on anyone elses behalf
:-/

In all seriousness, except for the commonality of the CP agenda,
self-identified "Cypherpunks" could not be categorized by any common
property.

I Wrote Code, and now help others to Write Code as a deliberately radical
act in furtherance of my personal political agenda.

I believe that only in *action* can a human claim the right to exist free
of fetters, and that the most efficient action I can take is the one that
impacts the most people with the least effort: code.

In the end, I think that the code will set you free.

brink of destruction.'
