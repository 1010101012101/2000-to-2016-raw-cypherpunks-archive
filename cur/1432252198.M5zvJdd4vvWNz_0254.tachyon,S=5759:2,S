While it's understandable that people want to avoid being swept up in 
hysterical backlashes against people involved in this morning's terrorist 
activity, it's worth remembering - especially for people interested in 
aiding law enforcement - that a lot of investigations begin and move 
forward with anonymous tips which are later corroborated by witnesses 
willing to testify. Given the clear indifference for human life shown by 
the terrorists, the ordinary witness-protection steps taken by law 
enforcement may not be comforting enough to allow aiders and abettors of 
this morning's actions to report their knowledge with confidence - so it 
may be more important than ever that the remailers continue to operate.

Given that, does anyone have any tips for compiling the current Mixmaster 
release under FreeBSD or OpenBSD? The make fails for me on both platforms - 
it looks like a failure related to the recent integration of OpenSSL into 
the standard BSD distributions, which I've been unable to remedy thus far.
