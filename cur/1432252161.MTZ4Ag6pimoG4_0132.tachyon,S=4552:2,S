other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards of $120
mil|iOn in deve|opment expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supply
upwards of 17O,0O0 Mw of e|ectricity annually for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,0OO homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,00O tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 milli0n for a

deve|opment of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
