     This guy apparantly can't read.  He certainly didn't read Choate's
reply that there were moderated cp lists, and gave him the url to access
them. Nor did he read the other replies telling him to check the
archives.  And he is totally, absolutely clueless about remailers,
confusing them with nym servers.
             Must be a troll.
