Ashcroft's anti-terrorism bill proposes allowing IRS data
to be shared with law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
As if that would be a new.

The bill would also lift the stay of US attorneys taking

Bush has asked citizens to inform on their neighbors,
as if that was new.

Narcs in the militia have called for defense of the 
homeland while the military is engaged elsewhere.

Recall the IRS manual for undercover operations which
states these strategems are already in use.
