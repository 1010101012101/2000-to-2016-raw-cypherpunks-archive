Ken: 

I'm sure the apparent discounting of the US murder rate by some American
list members seems inexplicable to you. At the risk of being extremely 
non-PC, I think I can explain why.

The distribution of murders in the US is very heavily skewed towards
groups which are unlikely to be on the list, or acquainted to people
on the list. In short, there is a large disparity in the murder rates for
white, educated professionals (who make up most the membership of
this list) vs poor blacks or latinos.

If you look at the murder rate for white middle/upper class folk, you'll
find its
quite comparable to Britain and other European countries. No person
I have ever known personally has fallen to murder, a statement which
I expect could be made by most the American posters to this list.

While it's sad that people don't factor in the societal risks borne by
'other groups' in this country, it's just human nature.
