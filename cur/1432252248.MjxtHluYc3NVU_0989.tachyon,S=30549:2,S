=A0=A0=A0 I spent well over 13 years in prison, and not only was I not guil=
ty of nearly all of the crimes of which I was charged, I was actually a vic=
tim of crimes committed by various Federal government employees.=A0 Not onl=
y was I assaulted on November 25, 1997 by a government stooge and informant=
, Ryan Thomas Lund, in order to force me to accept a plea agreement in case=
 97-5270, Tacoma Federal Court, I was also the victim of an amazing forged =
(falsified; fictitious; fake) appeal case (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, =
case 99-30210) that was initiated by corrupt government and court employees=
, and whose pre-April-2000 existence was concealed from me until about June=
 2003.=A0 Naturally, I concluded that something must be done about this.=A0=
 =0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 The current population of United States Federal prisons=
 is approximately 220,000 inmates.=A0 (In 1980, that population was about 2=
0,000).=A0 Each year, somewhat more than 70,000 new defendants are charged,=
 and the large majority (perhaps 95%) are convicted.=A0 Yet, you might be s=
urprised:=A0 There are only about 3,500 Federal criminal jury trials in Ame=
rica each year.=A0 The reason for the apparent difference is that in the va=
st majority of such cases, the defendant or defendants accept a plea agreem=
ent, which the news media wrongly refers to as a 'plea bargain':=A0 In real=
ity, it's not a 'bargain' for the criminal defendant, and it certainly isn'=
t a 'bargain' for the American taxpayer.=A0 See the "Prisoner's Dilemma". =
=A0 It's actually a financial disaster of the first magnitude, one which th=
e majority of the American population doesn't know about, and certainly doe=
sn't understand.=A0 But the reason the defendants are motivated to accept t=
hose deals is
 simple:=A0 The Feds threaten them with time far greater than what they'll =
get if they deal.=A0 So, the very large majority of them deal.=A0 And so, a=
ll of us are poorer as a consequence.=A0 The average sentence, we can calcu=
late, is 220,000/70,000, or a bit over 3 years per sentence.=A0 (This is on=
e way to calculate an 'average sentence', there may be others.)=0A=0A=0A=A0=
=A0=A0 It costs approximately $35,000 to keep a prisoner in Federal prison =
for one year.=A0 So, for the 220,000 current prisoners, that's a total cost=
 of about $7.7 billion dollars.=A0 If that population could be brought down=
 to the level it was in 1980, or 20,000 prisoners, about $7 billion dollars=
 would be saved. =A0 Even better, it would be far harder to extort people, =
people such as Barrett Brown (journalist), Kim Dotcom (Megaupload),=A0 Brad=
ley Manning (Cablegate), Ladar Levinson (operator of Lavabit), Edward Snowd=
en (NSA leaker), Ty Warner (Beanie Babies, just convicted of tax evasion) o=
r (now) Ross William Ulbricht, alleged operator of 'Silk Road'.=A0=A0 And, =
of course, thousands more that are less well-known.=A0=A0 Many of these peo=
ple have either not committed any crime at all, or even if guilty of someth=
ing, they shouldn't be punished to the extent the system would want to do.=
=A0 Or punished at all.=0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 I was pondering this problem in m=
y prison cell one day, and I got yet one more of my 'awfully wonderful, won=
derfully awful' ideas.=A0 (Quote from:=A0 "How the Grinch Stole Christmas")=
=A0 I was almost as energized, and as enthusiastic, as I was in early 1995,=
 when I got the idea that I later turned into my "Assassination Politics" e=
ssay. =A0 I thought, what if every Federal defendant could be motivated to =
refuse to deal, to refuse to accept the deal that's usually offered.=A0 The=
 figure of $5,000 popped into my head.=A0 What if every Federal felony crim=
inal defendant were offered money, let's say $5,000, if they would plead no=
t-guilty (which is their Constitutional right) and to demand a jury trial (=
which is also their Constitutional right).=A0 The current system has troubl=
e putting on 3,500 Federal felony criminal jury trials per year.=A0 How wou=
ld that system increase that number significantly?=A0 The number of Federal=
 courtrooms is somewhat fixed, the
 number of U.S. Attorneys is rather limited as well.=A0 And, Federal court =
time has to be shared with civil cases, too.=A0 So, it would be hard to ima=
gine a great increase in the number of Federal criminal jury trials held.=
=A0 If the number of persons convicted could be dropped from 70,000 per yea=
r to 4,000 per year, that should save the American taxpayers well over $7 b=
illion per year in prison and jail costs.=A0 Well over 90% of Federal priso=
ns would have to shut within 5 years.=0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 How much would this=
 cost?=A0 Well, assuming a cost-per-offer of $5,000, and perhaps 4,000 tria=
ls per year, the cost would be $20 million per year.=A0 For an individual, =
that's a lot of money.=A0 But for an entire country, that's peanuts. =A0 Ye=
t, it would save the nation $7 billion.=A0 In other words, for every dollar=
 offered to a criminal defendant, the savings to the public would be: =A0=
=A0 $7 billion/$20 million =3D $350. =0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 These estimates are no=
t set in stone.=A0 Of course, under this kind of pressure 'the system' woul=
d tend to allocate its resources, the limited number of courtroom-days avai=
lable, and would probably select only the most serious cases for prosecutio=
n.=A0 So, while it's possible that some residual amount of plea-bargaining =
would remain, this same pressure would tend to force officials to accept th=
at defendants serve smaller average sentences than they've been getting, wh=
ich of course are already much lower than they'd probably like to get.=A0 E=
ven if the resulting average sentence rose to 4 years, the overall populati=
on of Federal prisons would drop from 220,000 to about 16,000.=A0 (4 years =
x 4,000 trials/year).=A0 This would be a great improvement.=A0 =0A=0A=0A=A0=
 =A0 =A0=A0 The big question is, "Who would pay for this?". =A0"Therein lie=
s the rub", to quote Hamlet.=A0 Don't expect bigtime drug-dealers to donate=
:=A0 Their ability to make money would be thwarted if their products were r=
endered de-facto legal.=A0=A0 However, illegal-drug users would be greatly =
benefited.=A0 The price of their favorite pastime might very well drop by a=
 factor of 5-10, if the likelihood of getting arrested and charged with pro=
viding it was drastically lowered.=A0 That would surely occur if this syste=
m was expanded to include state jurisdiction, which is about 10x larger tha=
n the Federal system, and thus a cost 10x higher:=A0 $200 million per year.=
.=A0 Another group of people who would benefit would be tax-evaders.=A0 The=
 Wikipedia article on "Tax Evasion in the United States" indicates that the=
 approximate money 'lost' (and thereby gained by non-payers) is $305 billio=
n in 2010.=A0 If only 1/100 of a penny for each dollar thus saved was paid =
into
 a fund, that would be $30.5 million, which would be plenty to make sure th=
at Federal tax evasion would be extremely difficult to prosecute.=A0 As wel=
l as every other Federal crime.=A0 Most accountants would see that as a goo=
d investment, and should advise their clients accordingly.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=
