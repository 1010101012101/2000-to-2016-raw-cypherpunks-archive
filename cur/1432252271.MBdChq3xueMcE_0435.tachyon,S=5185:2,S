Right.  And I fail to see how any of this is dangerous.

Clearly people are free to sell information they create to anyone they
choose under any terms they choose.  (For example the iDEFENSE promise
of the author to not otherwise reveal for 2 weeks to give iDEFENSE
some value.)

This commercialisation seems like a _good thing_ as it may lead to
more breaks being discovered, and hence more secure software.

(It won't remain secret for very long -- given the existance of
anonymous remailers etc., but the time-delay in release allows the
information intermediary -- such as iDEFENSE -- to sell the
information to parties who would like it early, businesses for example
people with affected systems.

Criminal crackers who can exploit the information just assist in
setting a fair price and forcing vendors and businesses to recognise
the true value of the information.  Bear in mind the seller can not
know or distinguish between a subscriber who wants the information for
their own defense (eg a bank or e-commerce site, managed security
service provider), and a cracker who intends to exploit the
information (criminal organisation, crackers for amusement or
discovery of further inforamtion, private investigators, government
agencies doing offensive information warfare domesticaly or
internationally).

I don't see any particular moral obligation for people who put their
own effort into finding a flaw to release it to everyone at the same
time.  Surely they can release it earlier to people who pay them to
conduct their research, and by extension to people who act as
intermediaries for the purpose of negotiating better terms or being
able to package the stream of ongoing breaks into more comprehensive
subscription service.  

I think HP were wrong, and find their actions in trying to use legal
scare tactics reprehensible: they should either negotiate a price, or
wait for the information to become generally available.
