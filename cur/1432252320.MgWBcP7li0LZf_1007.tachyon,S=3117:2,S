Hi everyone,

We've got a new 0.4.1.2 release out and about with a bunch of
bugfixes, tools to help monitor the health of your node, reduce
memory churn, and help cut down on the per-hop message processing
time.  I don't expect any sort of revolutionary performance
improvements with this, but I do hope it'll make the latency a bit
smoother.  Upgrading is highly recommended.

The full list of whats been added since 0.4.1.1 is up and available
at http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/i2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD

Its all backwards compatible, and duck has been helping me test out
these updates as they've been made (as well as gather truckloads of
stats to help identify the bottlenecks on his fairly active router).

As always, the goods are up @ http://www.i2p.net/download
