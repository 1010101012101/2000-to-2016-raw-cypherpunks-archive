discoveries we'll get to enjoy, with the appropriate shocked, shocked!
theatrics:

- The Known Tools Have Few Controls and Intentional Secrecy
not only are the Stingray/IMSI catcher devices not properly
controlled, but they are actively shielded from oversight through
non-disclosure / trade-secret / and national security trump card
arguments that don't hold water.

- The Known Tools Hint at Deeper Invasive Techniques, Also Lacking Oversight
not only is location / metadata (penregister) information obtained,
but similar programs with private industry selling advanced tools to
law enforcement will uncover even more egregious violations of law
extending to full content (wiretap) collection without sufficient
authority or oversight.

- The Lawless Intercepts and Unlawful Invasions Of Privacy Shielded by
Prosecutors and Judiciary using Reverse Forensics
 the synergy of "parallel construction meets illegal intercepts" will
uncover the ways in which initial aggressive legal interpretations are
further distorted, and secrecy further applied paramount, to serve the
interests of prosecutor careers and public face over actual justice
and respect for law.

- Truly In-discriminant and Whole-sale Invasions of Constitutionally
Protected Communications Are Routine Fed Behaviors
and not just routine but the expected side effects of military
blunt-force intelligence gathering systems aimed at domestic targets
illegally. these military systems covertly re-purposed for domestic
surveillance at the federal level enjoy FBI DITU running front-man and
cover for all the exceptional secrecy this programs entails. (and why
such truly aggressive offensive techniques applied indiscriminately
have yet to reach state and municipal LE need to know.)
