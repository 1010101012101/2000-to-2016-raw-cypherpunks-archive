Of course - that's the point.  Brits are no less violent than USAns, no
less likely to be criminal, no more polite or neighbourly  (in fact
rather less). But we are *far* less likely to be killed or seriously
injured by our neighbours, or by the State.  And part of the reason for
that is that "normal" people don't have guns in Britain.
