	The easiest way to do this would be to have the ballot books 
only contain numbers, and the sample ballots mailed to each 
(allegedly) registered voter provide the mapping from name/issue to 
number.


	Then have a *lot* more numbers on the ballot & ballot 
booklets than in the sample ballots. x+1 punches in the wrong hole 
and the entire ballot is discarded.

	No sample ballots available at the polling place.

	This would mean that to vote in a deliberate way (i.e. not 
punching holes at random) you would have to retain your sample ballot.

	Oh--and your sample ballot goes into a shredder by the door.
