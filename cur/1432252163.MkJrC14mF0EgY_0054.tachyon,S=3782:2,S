Most of the murders are committed by blacks and latinos, especially blacks 
and most of the victims are blacks and latinos.

The black murder rate, though extraordinarily high by western standards, is 
lower than that of typical black countries, for example it is lower than 
that black countries near the US, such as Jamaica or Haiti.

The murder rate among white Americans is comparable to the murder rate 
among white canadians, and the murder rate among black Americans is 
comparable to the murder rate among black canadians.
