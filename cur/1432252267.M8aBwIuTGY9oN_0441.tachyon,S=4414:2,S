... which is something that I've found odd.  Up here in the Great
White North, it's the Queen who is the nominal victim of transgressions of the
criminal code.  Of what philosophical benefit is the transfer of `harm' from
the actual victim of a crime to another entity?  Of course, it doesn't change
the nature of the offence but it does provides a flesh-and-blood victim-object
for offences where there would otherwise be none.  Is it merely a
philosophical holdover from a time when the visible head of state was
considered `superhuman'?

Philosophically speaking, what part of common law permits the state (or
its officers) to evade responsibility for harming an appellant as a direct
result of the legal process -- regardless of the eventual finding of guilt, or
as it was in this case, where the state declined to pursue the charge.

That the charge was laid in the first place is another matter entirely.
Certainly an indicator of impropriety on the part of the state prosecutor
who failed to demonstrate the safe use of brain cells, synapses and dendrites.

Steve
