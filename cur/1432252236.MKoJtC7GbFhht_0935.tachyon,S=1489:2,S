U.S. agents also sought, without warrant or subpoena, to obtain ABCNEWS
field tapes. Two agents showed up at night at the San Diego home of a
freelance cameraman, Jeff Freeman, who worked on the project.

"They first identified themselves as FBI agents, which it turns out they
weren't," said Freeman. "They wanted to know if I still had the tapes I
had shot for ABC and if I could turn them over."
