I assume you are addressing me.

If I had my druthers,  I would hang him from a lamp post by one 
arm for the Iraqi populace to use as pinata.

The geneva accords are an agreement between honorable warriors 
to treat each other honorably in war and victory, and a 
explanation of what constitutes honorable war fighting.  I
doubt too many heads of state qualify.  I am quite sure Saddam
does not.

Nothing like a bit of pinata thumping give youthful energy and
high spirits a safe outlet.
