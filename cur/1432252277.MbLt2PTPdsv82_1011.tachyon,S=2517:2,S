The government always exempts itself from laws, or ignores the laws, or 
is not pursued by "law enforcement."

At the trivial side of the scale, this is what allows cops to speed on 
the roads for no actual need. They are used to going fast when they 
want to, so they do. Other cops either ignore them (for various 
reasons) or give them "professional courtesy" as soon as they identify 
themselves as fellow cops.

On the more serious side of the scale, governments run drug operations, 
ship contraband, smuggle arms, torture suspects, conspire with criminal 
regimes around the world, and set up criminal enterprises to benefit 
themselves and their friends.

And on the most serious side, governments force taxpayers into Ponzi 
schemes for their retirements while carefully exempting themselves and 
their own retirement funds.

It is for this last kind of sin that Congresscritters should be dealt 
with so very harshly. So very harshly. Too bad the most important 
flight got delayed out of D.C. and didn't make it to the most important 
target.
