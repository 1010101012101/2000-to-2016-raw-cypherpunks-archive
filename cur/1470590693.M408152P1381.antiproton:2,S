No, there's no "prediction". They can discover later that both sides saw
the expected spins. It's vaguely like you're flipping coins, and someone
on Mars is also flipping coins. And later you share notes, and find that
you both got more or less the same sequence of heads and tails. Not
perfect, but substantially better than chance. But neither side can
choose the order of heads and tails, so they can't create messages.

It's entangled electrons in diamonds, not photons. And you can only test
each pair of entangled electrons once. Because after that, they're no
longer entangled.

As I understand it, no information transfer is possible.
