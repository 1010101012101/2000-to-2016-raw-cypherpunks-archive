Yes, but he's got the "Hey, how did somebody from the *public* get
one of the public slots on the board of directors?!?!?" seat
on the board, and the cabal is trying to prevent anybody like
that from actually happening again :-)

The current Capability-based operating system project is
EROS, the Extremely Reliable Operating System, www.eros-os.org
(I think it's .org.  You can't just look for www.eros.com for obvious 
reasons:-)
I know it was active a year ago; not sure what they've done lately,
but the last I heard, their ringleader was at a university professorship,
so there may be grad students developing it some more,
and they were looking at making it microkernel-based.

One of the other well-known capability-based systems was KeyKOS;
some of the main folks from that are at Agorics.com.

There are three or four main kinds of attacks/failures for the domain system -
- Failures/Attacks on the servers themselves
- Attacks on the data transmission - various technical attacks such as
         spoofing DNS requests, adding extra records to responses, etc.
         DNSSEC and similar kinds of authentication are important for 
preventing these.
- Attacks on the data, e.g. forged change requests - that's another very strong
         reason for authentication technology, whether it's PGP or dumb 
passwords.
- Social engineering attacks on the system, such as UDRP abuse by trademark 
holders
         trying to reverse-cybersquat, as well as cybersquatting abuses,
         and delaying the extra TLDs.

Depends on what you think their original mission was :-)
If your initial goal is World Domination, mission creep's no problem...
I've been especially concerned with their grab of the IPv6 numberspace
and the price-fixing that's prevented almost anyone from buying it.

There was a while that MAE-East was in a parking garage in Maryland,
with not much more than chain-link fence for protection.
