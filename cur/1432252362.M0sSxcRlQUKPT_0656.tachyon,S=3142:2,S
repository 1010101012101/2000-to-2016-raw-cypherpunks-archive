There is a deeper point that needs to be made you're glossing right over.

It has to do with that term 'free' or 'freedom' you keep throwing around.
Your application does not do justice to the meaning of the term.

The reality is that 'freedom' means (even in crypto-anarchy circles) the
right (note that word Timmy) to engage in whatever behaviour one chooses
so long as it is consensual and doesn't abridge anothers right to
expression.

Trying to 'shun' somebody for their non-invasive behaviour (e.g. two dykes 
kissing in a ball park) is the peak of anti-freedom. If a person really
respects freedom it is more than 'freedom for me but not for thee'.

The kissing of the girls was nobodies business, in or out of the park in a
FREE society.

Tim, you're a bigot and a hypocrite.
