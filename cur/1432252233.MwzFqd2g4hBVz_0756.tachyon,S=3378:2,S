For my first year of law school I'm taking Contracts, Criminal Law,
Legal Writing, and Torts. The books for the first three subjects aren't
too bad from a "lawyers are scum" perspective, but both of my torts
books had me screaming within twenty pages. In one, the authors argue
for greatly increasing the scope of tort offenses and reducing the
permissible defenses [1]. As if the US doesn't have enough frivolous
and nonsensical lawsuits. In the other, on page 3 yet, the authors
argue that if someone is injured such that he can no longer work,
_someone_ should be held financially liable because society has lost
the first person's wages [2]. That seems just half a step from saying
that the people are the property of the state. Maybe I'm reading too
much into poorly-phrased paragraphs, but I haven't seen anything in
either book to contradict the bad impression.

plaintiff's lawyers.
