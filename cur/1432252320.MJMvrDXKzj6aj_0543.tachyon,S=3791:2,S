Another way to think of g^a is as the a'-th root of g, since (g^a)^a' = g
mod n.  If we instead use k instead of a', then Alice gets k and the kth
root of g.

In my notion, she publishes her kth root of g, Bob raises it to the rth
power, and Alice then raises it to the kth power to recover g^r.

No, given g and the kth root of g, she clearly can't find phi(n), because
every RSA signature supplies such a pair.

I think this is OK too.  See the Strong RSA Assumption, for example at
http://www.zurich.ibm.com/security/ace/sig.pdf.  Basically this says that
you can't find kth roots mod an RSA modulus without knowing the factors.

You might want to ask this on sci.crypt, they are pretty good with pure
math questions like this one.
