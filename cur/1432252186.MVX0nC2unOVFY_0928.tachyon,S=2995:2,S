The DMT Rand system knows if client X43967 transfers money to client 
X98987

It also know that client X43967 transferred money to or from a bank 
of America account, rendering client X43967 no longer pseudonymous.

Similarly for client X98987

Thus it can discover that Truename Bob transferred money to truename 
alice.

With Yodels, this cannot be discovered.
