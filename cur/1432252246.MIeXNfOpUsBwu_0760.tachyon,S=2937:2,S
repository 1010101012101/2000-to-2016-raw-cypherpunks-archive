This is to mix up banking and payment systems.  Enzo's
description shows banks doing banking - lending money
on paper that eventually pays a rate of return.  In
contrast, in the DGC or digital gold currency world,
the issuers of gold like e-gold are payment systems and
not banks.  The distinction is that a payment system
does not issue credit.

So, in the e-gold scenario, there would need to be
similar third parties independent of the payment system
to provide the credit moving in the reverse direction to
the goods.  In the end it would be much like Enzo's
example, with a third party with the seller, a third
party with the buyer, and one or two third parties who
are dealing the physical goods.  There have been some
thoughts in the direction of credit creation in the
gold community, but nothing of any sustainability has
occurred as yet.
