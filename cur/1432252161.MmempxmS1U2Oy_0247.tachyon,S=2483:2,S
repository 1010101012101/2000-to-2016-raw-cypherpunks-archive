You'd have to piggyback this on some P2P app.  Otherwise, the lender
would have to run an accessable server.  That can be a trick if you're
behind a NAT or your ISP takes exception to unsolicited incoming packets.
Also, how do you handle check-in, or more importantly, lack of check-in?
Timeout?  Can you queue checkout requests?

Interesting idea, but it sounds kind of cumbersome to roll out.
