NOT!!!

IT WAS SO WEIRD,

I LOOK IN THE SEARCH ENGINE AND TYPED IN "DJETERNALAND" (WITHOUT TYPING 
WWW.COM) AND FOUND THIS SITE THAT WAS LIKE A SCARY MOVIE INTRO.I DONT KNOW 
IF IT WAS MSN OR YAHOO BUT ANYWAY,,
I WENT THERE AND THERE WAS LIKE TV CHANNELS OR SOMETHING WITH MUSIC, MIXES 
AND STUFF..
I GOT SOME SPAM FROM THAT SITE A WHILE AGO AND AT FIRST I HATED IT BUT.AS I 
SEE IT ITS KINDA KOOL. DIDNT MEAN TO BOTHER YOU I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD LET 
YOU KNOW..

(YOU CAN FIND ALOT OF THINGS IF YOU JUST TYPE IT IN THE ADDRESS BOX. JUST 
THE WORD AND THATS IT!)

BYE NOW
