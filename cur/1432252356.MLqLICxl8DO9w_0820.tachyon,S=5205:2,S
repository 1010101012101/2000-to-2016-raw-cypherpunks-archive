It seems you have alot to say - unfortunately no knowledge of what you are
talking about.

As I made clear to Declan - I was there from the beginning of the Soviet
invasion.  I was there when the americans began active sponsorship of the
various mujahadin - including our evacuation of children maimed by the
soviets.  An evacuation which was mainly supported by the US military.

Ben Laden was in fact there at the begining and he was actively supported
by the US Military.  They were the best of friends at the time.  The
support was in weapons and included strategic assistance against the
soviet red army.

Laden does not hate freedom - he was a "freedom fighter" and has an
excellent reputation in the arab world as being a freedom fighter.

Your military analysis of the Soviets is also out to lunch.  The soviets
expended a considerable number of military resources and were rewarded
with lots of body bags in return for their efforts.

Nikolai Kovalyov, the former head of the Russian FSB security service, has
just warned the US that an attack on Afghanistan would fail to capture
Osama bin Laden, and would backfire on the US. "In Afghanistan's 
mountainous terrain it takes a trainload of explosives to destroy three 
militants," he said. "The chance of hitting bin Laden is zero."

So in short James - if the U.S. invades - get the body bags ready.

I find it insulting James that you would argue from an ignorant position
and just say things off the top of your head without any idea of the
consequences involved.  As I have said before, the only way to win a war
in afganistan is to nuke it.  And I predict that will bring the nukes to
american soil - if they are not there already.

This is a serious situation james.  Alot of boys are going to die as a
result of this invasion and it's ignorant people like yourself who fuel
the fires of victory which some day like vietnam will end up bringing
shame to the american public.  This is not a game james - this is
reality.  A harsh reality that if ignored will result in more pain and
suffering in america.

joe
