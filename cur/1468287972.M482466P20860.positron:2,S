I run a low bandwidth tor relay (150K), just for kicks. It's not an exit node because I don't want the hassle that goes with that (my node name twentysevendollars). Sometimes I like to run network programs through torsocks for a little potential anonymity.... otherwise
I don't even use tor much myself. I never made any promises to anyone about true anonymity.

Am I a Pentagon employed duplicitous Americunt?   Or just someone that likes to fuck around on his freebsd server?
