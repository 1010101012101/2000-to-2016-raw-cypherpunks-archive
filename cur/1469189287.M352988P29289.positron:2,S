Those seeking politically correct Western newspeak have been warned!



Syrian opposition asks US-led coalition to halt strikes after reports of
mass civilian casualties

Nice attack’

"
 Western coalition forces knew they were attacking an area inhabited by
 civilians and yet they carried out a bombing. How can 30 airstrikes be
 a mistake? How can they all be a mistake, political commentator Marwa
 Osman asked RT.

 The Syrian Foreign Ministry has written to the UN blaming US and French
 warplanes for the deaths of more than 100 civilians near the city of
 Manbij.

 The alleged French act of aggression claimed the lives of more than 120
 civilians, most of them children, women and elderly. The fate of scores
 of other civilians still under the debris is unknown. The letter also
 mentioned the French air strikes came a day after US warplanes
 conducted a bombing raid, which Damascus claims killed 20 other
 civilians.
