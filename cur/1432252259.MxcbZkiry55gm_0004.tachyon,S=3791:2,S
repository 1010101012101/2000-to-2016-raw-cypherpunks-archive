     I am curious to know the maximum size of graphs than can be solved by 
     existing computers (electronic or DNA-based).
     
     Also, what would be the commercial fallout of finding an algorithm to 
     solve the Hamiltonian path problem rapidly for big graphs (500 points 
     and over) ?
     
     Thanks in advance,
