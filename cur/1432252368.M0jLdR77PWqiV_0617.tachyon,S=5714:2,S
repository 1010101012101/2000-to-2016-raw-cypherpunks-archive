Without interference from a save-the-"X" crowd, they'll actually be able
to act.

Oh, I dunno.  Self-sufficiency, maybe?  One for all, before all for one?
Pull your weight, we'll help but goddamit pull your own goddamned weight?

Easy commute for the workers, and a large pool to draw workers from?

What, because CA lacks foresight and has it's head up its ass, it has
suddenly become a capitalist plight?  Since when has CA been a paragon
of capitalist virtue?  It seems that, despite several big (read corporate) 
names being based there, they have been the source of many non-capitalist 
things.

Another consideration, for building closer to where the demand is.
These are self-evident considerations.

Another manifestation of myopia.  Checked www.fuckedcompany.com lately?

Any delay in earnings, harms.  Corporate earnings do more than line the
pockets of a nameless, faceless board of directors somewhere.  If that
is allowed for, isn't this really just another example of how piglets
want to have their cake and eat it too?  CA'ans want electricity, but
they don't want the powerplant (in their back yard), or the higher rates
of a (potentially) volatile market?  Just exactly how do you spell welfare, 
anyhow?

S-U-B-S-I-D-I-E-S????

Capitalists have been trying to build plants for years (the need for more
ability to generate electricity was recognized a decade ago) and have been
dissuaded by CA rules & regs (too much red tape and environmentalist wacko 
interference).

Go wash out your mind with soap, you've been dallying with the dark side.
