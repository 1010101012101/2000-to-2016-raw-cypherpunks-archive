Islam says that Islam should have dominion.  Muslims should
be better off, more civilized, richer, more powerful, more
culturally influential, than unbelievers.  They are not.
This is a crime against islam that must be remedied.

This is not a defect that is unique to Islam.  If some alien
people are rich and free, and one is poor and unfree, one can
believe it is one's own fault or their fault.  Naturally one
is inclined to believe it is their fault.  However Islam
gives divine sanction to this belief, and in some variants of
Islam, divine command to do something about it.
