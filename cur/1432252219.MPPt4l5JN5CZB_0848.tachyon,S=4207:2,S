I agree that the signer does not need to understand the
mathematics or underlying technology for digital signatures to
be viable.  However, what good is an agreement when the parties
do not know what the terms of the agreement are?  A signature
(digital or otherwise) generally indicates that the signer not
only made an agreement, but also understood the agreement.

A digital signatures must involve a conscious decision by the
signer to keep their part of an agreement.  I maintain that
this requires user intervention to verify that the signer knew
that they making an agreement - a "click of understanding" or
pass phrase.
