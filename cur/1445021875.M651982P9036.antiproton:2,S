I take that part back, that's not a fair comparison. Snowden exposed
national security secrets including those necessary for cyber defense
(including preventative measures and identifying attacks before they
happen) of critical infrastructure i.e.  the energy grid, internet
backbone, potentially exposing assets and risk their lives etc and strain
diplomatic relations across the globe.

Whereas here, the consequences are you bitching and moaning about *not
being unsubscribed from a list*. Which is the "end result" of a troll,
somehow. Because spammers want to unsubscribe you from mailing lists. On
the plus side, I guess I won't hear from you anymore about this supposed
troll? .... I guess that's a fair deal.
