Since we don't depend on the government for food, steel, concrete, or
medical care (60% private money not much actual government acre delivery);
why would we think that teaching by government employees would be
efficient.

We can argue about payment later (although taxing the poor to pay for the
college education of the rich seems unfair), but no rational person can
argue that socialist provision of services is superior to market provision
in case like this.

I can pick any public school teacher at random and cross ex them on the
stand and establish that they don't know diddly squat.  The concept that
one should institutionalize one's children for 8 hours a day so that
public officials can attempt to modify their knowledge, understanding, and
physical and psychological deportment is the worst kind of child abuse.
At future war crimes trials America's parents will have to answer for
their crimes.  (For those of you who attended slave schools, that last is
a joke.)

Can you seriously argue that governments do a better job of education or
that it's safe to trust them with the souls (in the religious and
non-religious sense) of the innocent.

Apart from everything else one can say, attending slave schools subjects
the child and the family to the full force of government record keeping.
If you are not on the dole and you have no children in slave schools, your
chances of having any sort of interaction with the minions of the coercive
state apparatus are very substantially reduced.  Much safer.

Yes, just like the employment choice of "slavery" should not be available
because it's wrong (at least within my proprietary community).

What's the community got to do with it?  I should give up money and
children because people who are demonstrably stupider than I am think it
would be a good idea?  I don't give barbers who can't cut my hair the way
I want my money or my hair.  Why on earth should I do it to my children?

The slave school teachers of those making that argument did at least that
part of their work well.
