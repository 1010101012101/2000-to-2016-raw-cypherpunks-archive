Are you asking if the remote random number is
authentic? That would make it similar to a key
exchange over an insecure channel and asking: are the
keys exchanged authentic & untampered?
   In classical cryptography, there is no way of doing
a secure key exchange without a pre-shared secret.

 Tor uses onion routing but eventually you will need a
pre-shared secret with the PRNG server, to ensure that
the number you receive is authentic.
