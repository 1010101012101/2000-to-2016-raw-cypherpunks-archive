The rental agency has no(!!!) authority under law to enforce speeding
regulations. If they find that a leasee has violated a law by getting a
ticket or whatever then they certainly have the right to protect their
property by refusing or raising rates on future rentals, but to impose
'fines' is simply wrong, they do not represent the civil authority in
charge of the road. It would certainly be sufficient evidence to bring
charges of reckless driving or whatever, but the final determination of
'guilt' and the consequences thereof are up to the CIVIL authorities and
not the owner of the property.
