Excuse me for top-posting, but it is my message I'm doing it to, here. =C2=
=A0I wanted to add an additional comment. =C2=A0I take back nothing I said =
about the Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the case that rule=

 except in case of imminent action. =C2=A0(Say, in a riot.)However, I shoul=
d point out that legal decisions do occasionally tend to go in and out of f=

ed, at least once, since the Brandenburg decision was issued. =C2=A0And som=
e twice. =C2=A0http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/members.aspx
If I still had easy access to the process of "Shepardization" of legal deci=
sions =C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard%27s_Citations =C2=A0, I c=
ould look to see various citations of the Brandenburg case in subsequent Su=
preme Court cases, to see if it has been limited or modified in any way. =
=C2=A0Right now I am unaware of any such changes, but it would be wise to d=
o that Shepardization if you can do so.
Even so, I can agree that given the rather volatile times in which we live,=
 a little caution is still in order. =C2=A0Perhaps we should call them "Wel=
l-funded anonymous unlimited prediction markets." =C2=A0 Well-funded? =C2=
=A0Essentially unlimited in amount that can be donated to the prediction fu=

ly, so that ordinary people could use them without fear that the NSA or GCH=
Q be able to identify either the donors or the winner of the prediction con=
test. =C2=A0Unlimited? =C2=A0So that there are no relevant restriction plac=
ed on these markets: =C2=A0either externally or internally. =C2=A0If an ind=
ividual or individuals want to place a prediction on the death of even the =
most well-known or politically-correct person, they should be able to do so=
 in unlimited amounts without fear that a government or governments can eff=
ectively act to stop that. =C2=A0 And this should be true, even if the oper=
ation of individual predictions may seem to be accelerated by external even=
ts.
Most importantly, the organization or organizations that run these predicti=
on markets should not be able to reject any proposed prediction market; the=
y should be initiated by individuals outside the organization, and cannot b=
e stopped by the organization itself.

While the first few collected rewards would probably be in the tens of thou=
sands of dollars range, after a few hundred are collected I think the price=
 could easily drop to the low thousands. =C2=A0One reason is that once it i=
s clear that government has no effective defense, it will also be clear tha=
t soon enough, the government(s) will surely fall. =C2=A0The main reason a =
given "special bettor" might hesitate to act is the possibility that he wil=
l be stuck in prison, if identified and caught. =C2=A0 But the entire proce=
ss could be over in just a few months, with the government(s) yelling, "We =
surrender!". =C2=A0One condition for that surrender will certainly be the r=
elease of all the hostages. =C2=A0

Another tactic which could be used to strengthen the resolve of potential A=
P winners is to arrange the bounty system so a portion of all bets also wil=
l be used to target anybody who is part of the prosecution of any caught pe=
rsons, or for that matter anyone who kills or even arrests them: =C2=A0The =
judges, prosecutors, and other court staff, as well as hostile witnesses. =
=C2=A0Even unsuccessful defense attorneys: =C2=A0The possible threat of dea=
th would provide an automatic appeal issue. =C2=A0What about a standing pub=
licly-offered reward for $10,000 for any juror who votes to acquit, if that=
 vote doesn't result in a subsequent prosecution. =C2=A0(And it can't, if t=
he vote is unanimous for acquittal.) =C2=A0Anyone who holds out for a convi=
ction wouldn't get any money.
=C2=A0As was stated in the movie Dr. Strangelove, =C2=A0"Deterrence is the =
art of producing in the mind of the enemy the FEAR to attack". =C2=A0If the=
 only tool they have is to prosecute people, make them FEAR to do so and so=
on enough, they won't dare. =C2=A0
What is the economics of all this? =C2=A0Consider that in 2014 a record 3 t=
rillion dollars in taxes was collected by the Federal government. =C2=A0If =
those who paid those taxes were willing to donate 1% of that value once, to=
 have it stopped, forever, that would amount to $30 billion. =C2=A0If the a=
verage amount that had to be paid for a single death was $50,000, that woul=
d amount to 600,000 deaths. =C2=A0Does anybody seriously believe that the U=
SG (or any other government, for that matter) would even try to survive suc=
h a blow? =C2=A0Clearly not: =C2=A0They would resign.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Jim Bell

Note to the ones monitoring: =C2=A01969 Supreme Court decision Brandenberg =
v. Ohio =C2=A0 https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/444=C2=A0 =
guarantees as 'protected speech' under the First Amendment even encourageme=
nt to others to commit crimes, as long as a riot-type situation is not goin=
g on. =C2=A0There is no riot here, and I haven't encouraged anybody to comm=
it any crime. There is no imminent lawless action anticipated.

[Quote from Brandenburg:]
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919. From 1917 to 192=
0, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territ=
ories. E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the Unit=
ed States 21 (1939). In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of=
 California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code =C2=A7=C2=A7=C2=A011=
400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio.=
=C2=A0Whitney v. California,=C2=A0274 U.S. 357=C2=A0(1927). The Court uphel=
d the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means =
to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the securit=
y of the State that the State may outlaw it.=C2=A0Cf. Fiske v. Kansas,=C2=
=A0274 U.S. 380=C2=A0(1927). But=C2=A0Whitney=C2=A0has been thoroughly disc=
redited by later decisions.=C2=A0See=C2=A0Dennis v. United States,=C2=A0341=
 U.S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principl=
e that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not p=
ermit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law=
 violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing =
imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.=C2=
=A0[n2]=C2=A0As we=C2=A0[p448]=C2=A0said in=C2=A0Noto v. United States,=C2=
=A0367 U.S. 290, 297-298 (1961),the mere abstract teaching . . . of the mor=
al propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is =
not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to suc=
h action.See also Herndon v. Lowry,=C2=A0301 U.S. 242, 259-261 (1937);=C2=
=A0Bond v. Floyd,=C2=A0385 U.S. 116, 134 (1966). A statute which fails to d=
raw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by=
 the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation spe=
ech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control.=C2=A0Cf=
. Yates v. United States,=C2=A0354 U.S. 298=C2=A0(1957);=C2=A0De Jonge v. O=
regon,=C2=A0299 U.S. 353=C2=A0(1937);=C2=A0Stromberg v. California,=C2=A028=
3 U.S. 359=C2=A0(1931).=C2=A0See also United States v. Robel,=C2=A0389 U.S.=
 258=C2=A0(1967);Keyishian v. Board of Regents,=C2=A0385 U.S. 589=C2=A0(196=
7);=C2=A0Elfbrandt v. Russell,=C2=A0384 U.S. 11=C2=A0(1966);=C2=A0Aptheker =
v. Secretary of State,=C2=A0378 U.S. 500(1964);=C2=A0Baggett v. Bullitt,=C2=
=A0377 U.S. 360=C2=A0(1964).Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndical=
ism Act cannot be sustained. The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teac=
h the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishi=
ng industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display =
any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission=
 of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriet=
y of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" =
with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndica=
lism." Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jur=
y in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime[p449]=C2=A0=
in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent law=
less action.=C2=A0[n3]Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute wh=
ich, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and =
to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to a=
dvocate the described type of action.=C2=A0[n4]=C2=A0Such a statute falls w=
ithin the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The contrary=
 teaching of=C2=A0Whitney v. California, supra,=C2=A0cannot be supported, a=
nd that decision is therefore overruled.Reversed.
