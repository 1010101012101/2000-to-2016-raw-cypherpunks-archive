Dear Cheri,

How about buying yourself a two Franck Muller watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
http://brownyhj.977mb.com

We are offering wholesaler prices on all watches during the month of January 2009.

Our Franck Muller watches have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Land
