In a less aggressive vein, I've been waiting for a spamactivists.com
site to emarge with "Picket Spammers at Their Homes" days, calls to
family members, spammer creditors, etc. No harassment, just conveying
factual information in a non-threatening manner.

For verification purposes, most spam blacklists have records of past
spamming activity (SpamCop keeps a year or so). That shifts the trust
problem, but it doesn't seem insoluble.
