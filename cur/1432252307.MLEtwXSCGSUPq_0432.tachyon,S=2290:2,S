Walk into an airport in baggy pants with powdered expolosives in a leg bag which can slowly be dispersed as you walk (perhaps controlled by some sort of string control like POWs scattered excavated soil in "The Great Escape").  After walking around in the lobby it should soon be tracked to the security checkpoints and interfere with any current swab or automated detection methods.
