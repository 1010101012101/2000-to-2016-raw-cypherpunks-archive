Compassion doesn't come from the state.

Compassion comes from individuals.  I don't see what difference
a cryptoworld makes.  Philanthropists exist there too.

Before the state, and before the welfare state you've lived your
life in, there were social networks ---families, friends, guilds, etc.
They will exist after the state, too.

Well, how reasonable that is depends on the social environment at the time.
Ever been in a rioting area?

Don't know what you mean by ultra-conservative, but its only the fundies
who get their panties in a bind about abortion.  If by ultraconservative
you are trying to map cypherpunks' typical libertarianism into
the demopublican left vs. right farce, you'll find you need a different
dimension ---statism.

[Of course, you could substitute religious authorities for state authorities,
and there are some in the world who would consciously do that substitution.
They are indistinguishable if they will also use violence to get their way.
The only difference might be the noises they emit to justify it.]
