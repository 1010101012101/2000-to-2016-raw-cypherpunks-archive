No, not really. Until you can show me an Internet Draft for a solution 
to phishing that requires that we give up SSL, I don't see any reason to 
do so. As a consumer, I'd be very reluctant to give up SSL for credit 
card transactions because I use it all the time and it makes me feel safer.

If you don't know what we can do about phishing, why do you think that 
getting rid of SSL is a necessary first step? You seem to be putting the 
cart in front of the horse.
