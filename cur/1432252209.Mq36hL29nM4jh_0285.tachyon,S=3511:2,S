Somebody seriously needs to make a test case out of this idea. I can
just see the headline: "EvilHackerTerrorist sues Symantec over
unlawful circumvention of the content protection scheme used by his
copyrighted ScrewTheDMCA virus!"

Sorry this is off topic but this was way to good :-) 

          Virus writers can use the DMCA in a perverse way. Because
   computer viruses are programs, they can be copyrighted just like a
   book, song, or movie. If a virus writer were to use encryption to
hide
   the code of a virus, an anti-virus company could be forbidden by
the
   DMCA to see how the virus works without first getting the
permission
   of the virus writer. If they didn't, a virus writer could sue the
   anti-virus company under the DMCA!
