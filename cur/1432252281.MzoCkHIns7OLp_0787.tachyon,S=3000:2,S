There's a slashdot article about the digipeater on the ISS.
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/12/2054254&mode=thread
You basically send packets up and it repeats them back down.
More technical details on http://www.ariss.net
It's a low-volume thing, and only works when the space station is visible
	( http://www.heavens-above.com/ to locate the station )
but would be an interesting hack for remailers.
There are already a few repeaters that take the packet radio
downlink and mirror it to the Internet.

Heavens-above.com also has a list of a few dozen amateur satellites,
though it doesn't say which if any are used for packet data
as opposed to voice.
