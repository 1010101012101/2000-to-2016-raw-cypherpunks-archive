It took me less than a minute to retrieve several articles with quotes 
from members of the interim government. Here's just one of them:

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011228/ts/attack_dc_1192.html

If you challenge someone to "show a reference to this" you should have 
at least spent a minute looking.

You haven't seen a reference? Then you haven't looked, have you?

It took me another 30 seconds to find this (though I remembered it from 
seeing Bush's comments today in Crawford):

"With operational commander Gen. Tommy Franks at his side at his 
Crawford, Texas, ranch, Bush said he expected U.S. forces to remain in 
Afghanistan ``for quite a long period of time.''"
