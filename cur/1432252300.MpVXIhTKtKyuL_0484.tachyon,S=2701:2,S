It would be nice to see at least one example of something nasty that
could be done with an anonymous remailer in the next few years where
you couldn't get the same effect at the corner phone booth or dropping a
letter in a public mailbox.  So far there have been no prohibitions on
sending information anonymously via those mechanisms.  Why would email
be singled out?
