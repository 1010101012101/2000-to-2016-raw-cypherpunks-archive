Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2000 with a view to become

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a large gr0up of pheno|ic secondary 
metabo|ites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,0OO different known 
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vessels inc|uding capi|laries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 20O4-2OO5 are more then  $1OO milliOn USD

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
