Huh? This is Choatian nonsense. 

If the speed limits were 85 mph and a rental car company decided it
only wanted drivers to go 65 mph, they could put this in their contract
and enforce if, if they so choose.

If they misjudge and drivers really, really want to go 85 mph, they
will lose business. Such are the gusting winds of the market.

You may reasonably say that private companies should not be the 
enforcement arms of the state, but they should be allowed to make their
own decisions when voluntarily choosing to do so.

-Declan

PS: Of more cypherpunk relevance, perhaps, is the greater role that 
insurance companies would play in the absence of government speed
limits. You may have to pay more in insurance to drive faster, for instance.
