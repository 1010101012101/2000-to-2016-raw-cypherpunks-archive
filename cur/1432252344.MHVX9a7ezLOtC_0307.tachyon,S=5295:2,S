NATO SUMMIT MEETING IN CHICAGO, AND MORE FROM CRS

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will hold its 2012 summit meeting
in Chicago on May 20-21.  The meeting, hosted by President Obama, will be
closed to the public.  The assembled heads of state are expected to discuss
the future of the conflict in Afghanistan; NATO defense issues, including
the possible reconsideration of the role of nuclear weapons in NATO; and
other matters.

A preview of the NATO summit meeting was presented in a new report from
the Congressional Research Service.  See NATO's Chicago Summit, May 14,
