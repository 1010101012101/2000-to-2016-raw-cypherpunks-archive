you ask interesting questions Dan, and draw useful conclusions :)

some items to note:
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? don't think so. deadline is FY 2013.
- is this DUAL_EC_DRNG? the market for closed source, proprietary
crypto solutions is small (and growing smaller, :(
- is this XSTORE? it's been a while. but never should have been used
directly. see mtrngd with MSR bits set no whitening, max sample, max
freq. into mix + conservative estimate before /dev/random write.

some cryptographers and cypherpunks have become despondent or dejected
or demoralized by these events.

i see a larger picture: never before have so many been doing crypto less wrong!

;P
