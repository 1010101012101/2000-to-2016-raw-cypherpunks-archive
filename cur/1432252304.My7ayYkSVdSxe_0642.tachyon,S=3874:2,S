   from the fbi-just-along-for-the-ride dept.
   [1]daveschroeder writes "According to [2]this Indymedia.org article
   and [3]AFP report, the request to seize Indymedia servers hosted by a
   U.S. company in the UK (covered in this [4]previous slashdot story)
   originated from government agencies in Italy and Switzerland, not the
   United States. Because Indymedia's hosting company, Rackspace.com, is
   a U.S. company, the FBI coordinated the request and accompanied UK
   Metropolitan Police on the seizure under the auspices of the [5]Mutual
   Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), an international legal treaty, but,
   according to an FBI spokesman, 'It is not an FBI operation. Through
   [MLAT], the subpoena was on behalf of a third country.'" Read on below
   for more.

   daveschroeder continues: "Rackspace's statement reads, 'In the present
   matter regarding Indymedia, Rackspace Managed Hosting, a U.S. based
   company with offices in London, is acting in compliance with a court
   order pursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), which
   establishes procedures for countries to assist each other in
   investigations such as international terrorism, kidnapping and money
   laundering. Rackspace responded to a Commissioner's subpoena, duly
   issued under Title 28, United States Code, Section 1782 in an
   investigation that did not arise in the United States. Rackspace is
   acting as a good corporate citizen and is cooperating with
   international law enforcement authorities. The court prohibits
   Rackspace from commenting further on this matter.'"
