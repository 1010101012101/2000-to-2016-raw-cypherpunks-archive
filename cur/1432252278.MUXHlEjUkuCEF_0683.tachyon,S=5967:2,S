I bought one, and I know of several others who have bought them. As to 
whether they are _currently_ selling any models, I can't say. But this 
doesn't change my "fax effect" point.

Yes, of course. We know things like this.

You clearly don't understand the usual meaning of "fax effect." Fax 
machines have existed in the form you describe for close to a century. 
This was not what writers in the early 90s were referring to when they 
spoke of the "fax effect."

Naive. Faxes were available in the 1970s, and earlier. They did not 
"change the world overnight." For one thing, they were not accepted as 
legal docs. For another, transmission speeds were too slow.

(We had fax machines to our remote plants in 1974, but we almost always 
used TWX and Telex transmissions. And they didn't "change the world 
overnight." They were just another channel.)

The fax effect is the same as the phone effect. Your analysis would have 
had the first two phone changing the world overnight. No. What changed 
was when a significant fraction of one's suppliers, delivery agencies, 
shipping companies, customers, etc. all could be reached via a 
compatible, interoperable standard. The "phone effect."

Irony is wasted on some people.
