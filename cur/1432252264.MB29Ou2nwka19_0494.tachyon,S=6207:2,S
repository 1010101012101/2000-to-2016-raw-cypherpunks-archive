Just some thoughts.  I wasn't able to find my original post asking
that question...

The NSA/Snowden disclosures is a very dynamic area and our
understanding is changing as new info comes in.

FWIW, I think this is more likely the case:

NSA successfully moved the world across to *standards based* ECC.
This concentrates the target, and gave them a chance to influence the
nature and direction of the production of constants, sizes and so
forth.

Back in the early 2000s, ECC was hot, as the CEO of RSA has infamously
said, and everyone just took the wisdom of NSA without question.  But
now there has been a lot of work done by a lot of open mathematicians.

What they are discovering is that ECC is quite finicky, and the
standards-based curves are rapidly starting to look less shiny.

Hence, picking an independent effort that utilises all this
last-decade work, and generates independent curves, is possibly a
better way to go.

(Remember, however, you have to decide how much you care about the NSA
as being your threat model.

   1. Is it a sole, life threatening threat?
   2. Or is it just a great target?
   3. Or is it meaningless?  They have the data anyway?

There are very few systems that are building for the first case.  Most
of us would be happy with choosing the type 2 threat model, in which
case we can just pick the state of the art (curves) implement and move
on.)

I disagree. The history of agility has been poor, IMHO.  Instead, I
suggest that you lock yourself into the best possible system on
today's knowledge -- it's your job, do it! -- and then plan on a
complete refit in say 7 years time.  Any problems that come up won't
be predictable, and you'll not be able to do more than complicate
everything anyway.

Good work has sustained far better than we typically give credit for,
and bad work has been maintained into a dog's breakfast, without
giving damnation due to it.

That's a separate question -- where the authentication resides.  As a
thought experiment, I really like the conceptual approach taken by
tcpcrypt which (in short) does an ephemeral lower layer, and provides
the params up to a higher layer (application) at which the auth
questions can be handled.  As it states, authentication is an
application level concept, not a lower layer concept.
