    As much as I personally dislike ID cards of any kind,
    the failure of the US to establish a secure,
    biometric-based National ID card will eventually prove to be
    suicidal. Occasional abuses of federal databases like
    the NCIC, or the widespread forgeries of inferior
    identity cards, are not excuses for doing the job
    correctly. The current abuses and forgeries are not
    going to abate; it may be possible to create biometric
    ID, but it will not be registered: bingo! <p>

    Opponents of National ID have their heads in the sand:
    any police office can demand positive ID, which if not
    provided, then presents an option of detainment under the
    'John Doe' statutes -- in the event of criminal charges
    this constitutes a justification for denial of bail. <p>

    That same police officer, presented with a driver's
    license, can pull up <u>everything</u> on the
    individual. With the increasing computerization of the
    police forces, the information can be accessed directly
    from a patrol car without hassling a dispatch officer
    with the usual delays. <p>

    There are two principal opponents of National ID cards
    (or, for that matter, any ID cards): <ol type=a><p>

    <li> libertarians, often fringing on the anarchist,
    who resent any authority and who fail to accept/realize that
    the rest of mankind are not as 'perfect' as they are;
    and <p>

    <li> the ACLU and the multi-culturalist advocates and
    their ilk who are against mandatory ID as they believe
    it is unfair to immigrants, the poor, the downtrodden,
    and the rest of the liberal agenda. <p>

    It may be unfair to claim they support illegal
    immigration and crime, but the results prove otherwise
    and the procedural delays on deportation are
    absurd. </ol>

    America must deal with its alien problems, from both the
    workforce and the terrorist aspects. A verifiable
    biometric national ID, required for the issue of visas,
    would place a hold on many terrorists who today are
    not even fingerprinted at US consulates abroad.<p>

    Lastly, biometric ID can eliminate identity theft if
    the process of issuing the ID is secure --eg: sufficient
    proof of identity, not just the wholesale issue of
    National ID to current driver's license holders.

    Calls for a national system of identification cards
    sparked by the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
    Center and the Pentagon have gained little traction,
    failing to win endorsements from the Bush administration
    or congressional leaders. <p>

    Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison attracted
    national attention by calling for such a system in the
    wake of last month's terrorist attacks and offering to
    donate the database software that would be needed. <p>

    After a series of interviews touting the plan, Ellison
    continued to push his idea in meetings with
    U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
    U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and others, including the
    database giant's first customer, the CIA.  Ellison said
    last week that future White House meetings were planned. <p>

    But Bush spokesman Jimmy Orr said the administration
    wasn't considering a mandatory ID program, and Feinstein
    is backing away from reports of her support. <p>

    The Justice Department said Tuesday it has no position
    on even a voluntary card and isn't planning anything of
    the sort. <p>

    "That high-level administration officials are somehow
    directing this, I think is a far cry," a department
    official said on condition of anonymity. <p>

    Feinstein said Tuesday that she is preparing legislation
    that would call for mandatory IDs with fingerprints and
    other biometric data only for noncitizens entering the
    U.S., along with a new database that would allow
    immigration authorities to check information from the
    CIA as well as state criminal files and other records. <p>

    "It's just for people coming into the country,"
    Feinstein said. "I think this is where we should start." <p>

    Some other improvements in the nation's patchwork
    identity system are probable, such as the expanded use
    of "smart cards" for military and law enforcement
    personnel. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
    Paul Takemoto said the agency is considering adopting
    smart cards with extra digital information for special
    airline passengers, such as police officers. <p>

    This week, the U.S. organization for driver's license
    officials is meeting in hopes of hammering out
    recommendations to standardize the 50 state systems and
    toughen requirements. <p>

    "Your driver's license has become your de facto ID card,
    like it or not," said Jason King, spokesman for the
    nonprofit American Assn. of Motor Vehicle
    Administrators. <p>

    King said that group's top priority is a system that
    will allow states to connect.  Building such a system
    will take new federal and state laws and tens of
    millions of dollars, he said. <p>

    "If you have a nationwide unified framework, you will be
    able to, for the first time, uniquely identify that the
    person is who they say they are," King said.  "We're
    trying to come up with a strong uniform voice to go to
    Congress." <p>

    Several in the Capitol, including Senate terrorism
    subcommittee chair Feinstein, have made comments
    favoring a stricter national ID policy since the
    attacks.  They have been buoyed by polls showing a
    majority of the U.S. would support such a plan. <p>

    Ellison was one of the earliest advocates of a new
    identification system. "We've been so busy protecting
    ourselves against our government that we have made it
    impossible for our government to protect us," Ellison
    told Oracle employees in a speech posted to the
    company's Web site. <p>

    Other technology firms, from small credit card hologram
    makers to Silicon Valley stalwart Sun Microsystems Inc.,
    have been promoting potential security services to
    federal authorities and the press. <p>

    But the idea of a national ID has run into many of the
    same criticisms as in previous decades, when it was seen
    as an answer to illegal immigration and other
    problems. Both civil liberties groups and many
    conservatives oppose it. <p>

    "A national ID card is one of those third-rail issues of
    national politics," said David Banisar, a Harvard
    researcher and deputy director of ID card foe Privacy
    International. "It tends to die pretty quick." <p>

    Opponents cite fears of racial profiling as police begin
    demanding cards of anyone who appears suspicious. <p>

    And they say the history of large government databases
    and identity cards is filled with cases of mistaken
    identity and improper use. <p>

    A case in point is the FBI-run National Crime
    Information Center, which compiles information on
    suspects and arrest records from all 50 states. <p>

    Some 500,000 officials have access to the database, and
    a 1993 General Accounting Office study found that the
    FBI didn't keep track of misuse. The GAO, an
    investigative arm of Congress, nonetheless turned up
    systemic problems, including the lack of personal
    passwords for people using the computer terminals. <p>

    Among the hundreds of cases of misuse, the agency found
    that operators were selling information to private
    detectives, helping criminals, and in one case,
    assisting a former law enforcement officer who used the
    data to track down and kill his girlfriend. Just this
    year, an FBI manager in Las Vegas and nine others were
    charged in a scheme to sell FBI files to criminal
    suspects. <br><br>
