I have admitted that to myself.  I support socialized healthcare.  I
just don't see us moving in that direction (unfortunately).

No one forced them to create an insurance company (or to purchase
insurance company stock).  Again, the primary reason for having
healthcare in the first place is not to make money.  It is to keep
people healthy.

A small dip in stock prices vs. people dying because of lack of
healthcare.  For me, at least, it's easy to see which one is worse.

OK, so what?  Insurance exists so that people put in x dollars, and if
they get sick, the insurer pays for their medical bills.  That is the
purpose of insurance.  Again, I see that as being more important than
the insurance company making huge profits.
