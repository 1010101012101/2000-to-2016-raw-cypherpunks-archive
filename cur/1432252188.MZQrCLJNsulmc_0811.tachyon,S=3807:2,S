It's called illegal entry.  Probably most countries have such laws, although
whether they are quite so actively enforced as southwestern US is a
question.

In the last day or two, Gore promised (in response to Bush's criticism) that
he wouldn't increase the size of the Federal Government.  (Don't know the
exact wording, but I think it was based on the number of employees.)
Sounds reassuring?  No way.  Over the last 10 years the US military has
shrunk due to the end of the Cold War, etc.  As it should, and in fact it
should probably shrink a lot more. ( I wish I had the exact figures with
me.)  But what has happened is that many ex-military-types were simply
shifted to other areas of the Federal Government.  Sure, the overall size of
government is smaller, but not nearly as much as it could have been if the
non-military areas of government were fixed in size and did not help absorb
the overflow.

If anyone has the statistics, I'd like to read the details.
