"I haven't added you next
to Choate and profv yet, as you sometimes have a point, but keep working
it, and the cost of your postings will outweigh the utility of reading
them. Will you then rant about Jamie's killfile?"

Well I had two reasons for saying this. First of all, May suggested I stop 
posting due to the fact that I had "nothing to say". Well, even if that's 
true, he seems to be exposed to only pieces of my posts that get quoted by 
others, and in this particular case out of context. So if he's going to 
suggest I have nothing to say while I am supposedly in his kill file, then 
it's fair game for me to point out that from his vantage point he can only 
be full of crap.

The next point has to do with him (again) telling me not to post. And from 
what I can tell, most of the people who've been around for a while and are 
regular posters have been 'plonked' by the King of the Anarchists, Mr May. 
That leaves only newer people who either don't have an opinion on anything, 
or who don't post, or who don't disagree with him. (OK, maybe there are 
exceptions...) So again I get the distinct impression that Mr May is 
verbally trying to suppress minds that have any opinion that he didn't 
already give them. And that's OK, as long as he doesn't try it on me.
