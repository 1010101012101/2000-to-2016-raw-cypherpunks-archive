You're trying too hard.
Gambling has always been a convenient money-laundering technique,
as long as the casinos accept the kinds of money you're trying to launder.
That's also why spook agencies get anti-money-laundering laws passed.

If the casino will take your ecash and give you chips,
and you want to make a pretense of gambling rather than
just turning the chips back in for conventional euros,
go bet ~half the chips on red, ~half on black,
some insurance money on green, and tip the croupier,
and the casino collects their 1/37 or 2/38 cut.
... Your winnings, sir.
