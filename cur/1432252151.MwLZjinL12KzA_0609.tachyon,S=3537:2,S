This just smacks of an apologetics piece; maybe even something the NSA  
themselves might write.

Nobody but the most willfully delusional apologist could possibly look  
at the history of this agency, especially but not limited to the last  
year, and believe that the NSA is an agency with "good intentions".  
Self-serving, corporate and political protectionists, yes. Good  
intentions, nobody really believes that.

Lastly, isn't it a little (or a lot) arrogant to believe that an  
agency that's fooled Congress and the President, lied to the American  
people, and undermined the security of worldwide communications,  
couldn't fool you too? What did he think? That they would simply open  
up and fess ip to their abuse because they respect who he is?

Thank you, Ft. Meade for the latest comedy show.
