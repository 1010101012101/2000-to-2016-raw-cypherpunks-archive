The problem is, of course, that the US simply cannot keep their dicks
out of the affairs of other countries. We are obsessed with controlling
how the world develops, so as to guarantee to force countries to evolve
in such a way that is beneficial to the US. Such is an inevitable hazard
of becoming the last remaining super-power; we know we can control the
world, and have now (with the declaration of war in Iraq) let the world
know that there's nothing anyone can do about it. 

The US wants the world to operate like a giant corporation run by old
white fudge-packers who smile on TV and fuck us all behind closed doors.
Terrorism, as you say, is the response of other countries who violently
resent American involvement in affairs that, at their core, have nothing
to do with the US. Unfortunately, the US's "war on terror" completely
misses this point, and only serves to further the problem. 

Sure, we might kill a few existing "terrorists", but where do
"terrorists" come from? Won't these actions create a larger and more
hostile breeding ground for more people to lash out at US involvement in
foreign affairs? The US government just doesn't understand, or just
doesn't care.
