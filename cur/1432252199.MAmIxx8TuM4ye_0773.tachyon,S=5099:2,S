observation:  with regard to illegal and fraudulent tactics used in
your prosecution, court case, appeal, etc. it is wondered if the
corrupt actions of individuals may go beyond a severawl government
employees acting this way in isolation, and instead involve a hidden
or structural approach, such as a domestic FISA-like program, where
their actions are protected and so they are not concerned with issues
of their own wrong doing because they are acting as part of a larger
organized, coordinated effort. perhaps beyond normal processes though
still 'legal' due to secret laws or secret hearings or decisions
allowing this activity to occur. it seems more likely that activity
like this is signed-off-on by someone with authority than not, unless
there is total lawlessness within government and bureaucracy. i do not
know enough to know though tend to believe the fraudulent activities
must be structural not anomalous, given their coordination and purpose
to convict and create endless problems with the bureaucracy.


about the V2V cars- what is the likelihood that automobiles are _not
tagged in some way, just like computers, given that location or other
data is critically important and perhaps more easily accessible or
tracked outside of a particular environment, say run-ups to meetings
or whatever, the timeliness of data as it approaches a meeting point,
thus ramps up in criticality, say if a cellphone conversation decides
actions minutes before an encounter. or, to scan a city for someone
via satellites, pinging the missing submarine from satellite. given
highest priority to own every computer, how likely is it that vehicles
are not already being tracked, regardless of 'known technology' that
then brings this tracking into the open. even if via passive means,
giant RFID in the sky/net, say serial #s that reflect back with
vehicle title databases, mapping geographies this way, 100,000
vehicles return signals, as if looking at asphalt and concrete heavens
using astronomy software to parse star/car-names. either installed in
new vehicles by default, or when serviced if a focused customer.
perhaps not advanced beyond passive ping, though are vehicles really
driving around autonomously besides redlight cameras and speed traps?
doubt it.
