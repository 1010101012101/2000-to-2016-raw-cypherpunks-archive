In this context I meant "personality" as in demeanor and attitude, not 
scholarship and competence. Frankly I don't really care if someone is rude, 
cranky, disrespectful, flippant, etc. around here as long as they can put 
together a halfway decent argument more often than not. If they can't, too 
bad. And on the other hand, if people want to reasonably mull over 
something they find utterly fascinating that bores me to tears, more power 
to em.  I can't see how my not going out of my way to involve myself in the 
discussion is indicative of some great moral failing.

So do you keep on finding more of the same or have you got on to something 
of more value to you?

Well we all do whether we intend to or not: no matter how much you try 
there's no getting out from under your experience. You wouldn't 
be "yourself" without it. If something interests you, it's only natural 
that you want to know more about it: not to ever accept anything blindly, 
but to avoid re-inventing the wheel. "If I have seen further than
others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants." you know?

Recommending books, on the other hand, has to do with getting people to 
share an aspect of your mental context. Like that book I recommended on 
MOUT awhile back: it's not that I agree with its conclusions or the 
ideology behind it--it's just that it made a powerful impression on the way 
I think about some of the issues that are most important to me, and went a 
long way toward providing valuable information I didn't already have. Why 
wouldn't I be interested in spreading it around.

Maybe it came across that way, but if you knew me you'd know I read a lot I 
don't recommend. And if I recommend what I find valuable and/or agree with? 
Anything less is wasting everybody's time.

I'll get around to issues in that other half sometime, it ought to be 
interesting...
