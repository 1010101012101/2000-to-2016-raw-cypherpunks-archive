Not quite A. vonBernhardi, but apparently it'll do.

Someone at FC this year told me that he kills it periodically to bounce
spam. A likely story, but it'll do in a pinch.

Apparently, he's done his time as an associate in a law firm in Chicago and
now works for a hedge fund in Jersey.

Or something.

Cheers,
RAH
