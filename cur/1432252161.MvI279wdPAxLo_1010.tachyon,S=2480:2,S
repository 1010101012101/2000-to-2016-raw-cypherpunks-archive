It's fairly possible, if the adversary know what he's doing and takes the
time and effort, to disguise the mail's origin pretty well. (Think eg.
open HTTPS proxies or a hacked box.) Now, you irked someone. That someone
forges a spam mail advertising your business.

Prove your innocence!

Do we need laws for that? Software is easier to upgrade/change than laws,
less likely to misfire, and easier to deal with when it misfires.

Laws won't help in recognizing legitimate and non-legitimate mail.
Artificial intelligence will be more effective than the Congress. (On the
other hand, *anything* is usually more effective than the Congress.)

The law in question will be TOO easy to use as a weapon.
