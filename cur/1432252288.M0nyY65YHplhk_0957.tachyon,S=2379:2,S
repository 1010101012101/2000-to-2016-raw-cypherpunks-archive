Except Utah is not in the South by anybody's definition.

I was going to mention Prof. Usher in a follow-up I was mentally 
planning a few minutes ago.

For those who may not have heard about him, he's a retired astronomy 
prof. who included a .MP3 of one of his own songs on his Web site. The 
record company conglomerate representing the negro minstrel named 
"Usher" somehow found his site, found that it had .MP3 files, and made 
the assumption the site was pirating the minstrel Usher's music. They 
fired off threatening letters and demanded action.

Had Orrin Hatche's seek and destroy software been available, his site 
would have been toast.

When the record company was informed of the truth, they proposed to 
send him a free Usher t-shirt. Just what a retired white astronomy prof 
wants, the t-shirt of a negro rap crapper.
