Yes, it is.  Despite the disk manufacturers' intentionally misleading
spec sheets, most hard disks are not very much faster than 30 MB/s.
For example, the new Barracuda V transfers between 23 and 44 MB/s,
depending on where on the disk you read from.

Even if the disk were infinitely fast, the Firewire interface is
limited to 50 MB/s.

I think this product would be extremely useful, if it is trustable.
