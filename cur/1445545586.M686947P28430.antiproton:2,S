Where in the stack are you attacking?

For behavior, consult old Phracks on neuro-lingustic programming. A brush
of the hair, a touch of the elbow, anything that builds rapport and makes
the mirror neurons light up. Simple tricks used by street magicians and
con-artists - script kiddies of the mind. Only works against soft targets.

Below behavior, ideology. Surprised to see religion and states listed here
- both applications consuming the API of currency. Have enough money - or
appear to - and anything can be leveraged. Belief in the value of currency
is universal. Riyals, dollars, euros, bitcoin, shiny rocks and gems, common
stock, Yazidi slaves, it doesn't matter - given the right amount of the
right commodity, you can get what you want. Even easier if it's not real -
counterfeit bills, gold paint, or better yet fake commas on a screen.
Transfer complete, here is your passphrase.

Below ideology, biology. Dopamine pathways can be trained to respond to
stimuli without ever leaving kernelspace. Salt, fat, cum, phenethylamines,
sucrose. With the right amount of give and take, control is as easy as
ringing a bell.

And if your target is an asexual billionaire vegan with a TA-CD vaccination?

The answer is simple - scopolamine and DMSO.
