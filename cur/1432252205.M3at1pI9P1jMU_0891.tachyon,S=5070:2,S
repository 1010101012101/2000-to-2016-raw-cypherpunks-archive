Greetings from EDGAR Online!

Your trial continues! Since registering for the two weeks 
free a couple of days ago, you've already received the IPO 
Express Daily Report, with an after-market overview of 
what's happening in the IPO market. But that's just the 
beginning (literally - an S-1 filed with the SEC is the 
first step when a company wants to go public). EDGAR Online 
offers you complete access to the business and financial 
data reported to the SEC throughout the year by over 15,000 
U.S. public companies.

Interested in tracking your competition? Set up your EDGAR 
Online Personal portfolio at www.edgar-online.com/watchlist.asp. 
Select your company, your entire industry or sector, your 
region, form types, or any combination of 10 factors that 
you need to monitor and you'll receive a real-time email 
alert about new filings that match your criteria.

Need to watch the IPO market? EDGAR Online IPO Express 
emails you Daily Reports and Weekly Summaries that recap 
the latest news and let you know what to expect in the 
weeks to come. IPO Express covers all IPOs, not just the 
big deals reported in the media.  Find out which companies 
have filed, priced, or are expected to go public now at 
http://www.edgar-online.com/ipoexpress/ .

Are you looking for a job, a raise, or a new hire? EDGAR 
Online People Search gives you the details on the salaries, 
stock option plans, bonuses, and background of company 
executives and individuals mentioned in SEC filings. Find 
out what your peers are earning, what stock options other 
companies are offering, and what you should be asking for. 
Go to http://www.edgar-online.com/people/default.asp. 

We'll be contacting you throughout your trial with more 
information and helpful hints on how to get the most out 
of your free trial. After the two weeks, you can choose to 
become a subscriber for just $9.95 a month and maintain 
complete access to EDGAR Online.
