As Ian has noted, self-auditability and uncoercibility seem to be to be 
mutually exclusive requirements.

If you're going to assume that the whole system is untrustworthy,
you're still screwed despite the receipts - if the website says that 
yes, your vote counted in the final total, that still does not tell you 
that the right candidate was declared the winner. That would only 
happen if enough voters pooled their verifications to show that that
had to be the case (this is equivalent to a recount).

In a close-run two candidate race, if a number of voters equal to 
half the gap between the the candidate's totals failed to verify
and report that their vote was recorded correctly, the result
is still untrustworthy.

....and any system which relies on advanced mathematics
will be unintelligible and mistrusted by the average voter.
