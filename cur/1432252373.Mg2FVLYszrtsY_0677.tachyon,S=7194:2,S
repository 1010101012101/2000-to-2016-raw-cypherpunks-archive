	I had assumed greenwald was a progressive/liberal (now leaning
	more libertarian) but looks I was partially wrong. A quick
	search suggests he was a bush supporter of sorts? And he used
	to write for salon.com. And for what it's worth, wikitrash
	now lists him as libertarian. So...kinda mixed.

	Well, everything should have been put in the public domain
	from day zero. But Snowden thought that would hurt
	the interests of the american nazi state. Or maybe he didn't
	want to be killed like a dog. Who knows.

	I'm guessing that's sarcasm =P - No, I don't think greenwald is
	starving either.

	My point is that I'm not sure how they are making money off the
	snowden docs...except if they are being paid to not publish
	them (which is a possibility)

	Also, I don't think greenwald and poitras are too loyal to the
	US government at this point. The ebay owner on the other hand...
