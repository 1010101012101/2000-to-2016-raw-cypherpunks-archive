So, its been a day since this was posted.  It appears as though neither JYA 
nor Cryptome have been compromised and the posts and tweets that have 
followed appear to be authentic JY.

I've been a bit busy today, so - have I missed it?  John's explanation of 
why he would keep access logs going back to 1996, when it was posted on 
Cryptome itself for years that logs were deleted daily or better - and he 
gave an affidavit to a grand jury stating that he had no such files?  Or 
perhaps why he wants to sell out in the first place?

If he's tired of doing it, I get it.  If he wants to enjoy his remaining 
time on the planet instead of dealing with this BS, more power to him.  But 
why go out this way?  The legacy he has built with that site is being 
crushed.  Without Cryptome, there would likely be no Wikileaks.  No 
Manning, no Snowden.

This isn't just about being identified in the logs, but their very 
existence.  Those of you who insist on trying to divert the conversation 
away by blaming people for not being behind 7 proxies are just wasting 
space.  We know, we preach it too!  That is not the point.

Personally, I don't give a fck if my info is in the log files.  If I did, I 
surely would not be posting to public lists about it.  I'm probably on 
enough "watch lists" already that visiting Cryptome isn't going to make a 
damn bit of difference.

No, I'm concerned for sources that gave info and documents to Cryptome.  
For people in countries where they possibly face dire consequences for even 
viewing such info (jail, torture, even death.)

It's not funny, and it's not right.  From what I've heard, a bunch of us 
would really appreciate an explanation from John - in plain English.
