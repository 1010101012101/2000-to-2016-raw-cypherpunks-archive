Unless their approach to factoring is radically different.  I've seen some
extremely clever ideas leak into the non-classified press, like holographic
systems for realtime off-aspect optical pattern matching for targeting
systems.  Simple tricks that reduce the theoritical n-GFLOPS/MIPS of
computing time to a few clocks.  Factoring is such a fundamental operation,
I can't accept that the NFS is the optimal attack.

Under some circumstances, I guess they aren't.  In my case, my employment
NDA was conventional and very simple, and we regularily used our
certification as a marketing point with defense contractors.  In this case,
I don't mind mentioning what I did, I just make sure I'm careful not to say
more than we used in marketing.  This doesn't violate anything I signed.
