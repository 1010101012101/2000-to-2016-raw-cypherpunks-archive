Absolutely. More than that, I try to never take a job unless I'd be willing 
to do it for free. All free-market principles aside, if you're just in it 
for the paycheck, what's the point? I'd rather do something I love that's 
meaningful to me than just make a pile. Even better not to have to choose 
at all. (Not there yet, so #1 it is...)

This won't be too interesting to all the venerable greybeards out there, 
but you'd be surprised what kind of work you can end up with by taking an 
unpaid volunteer internship first. If there aren't any available, find 
someone to talk to, create a work plan and propose one yourself. If you can 
scrape by, trading your free labor for experience isn't always a bad 
bargain...it's worked for me more than once, and I sometimes I eventually 
ended up on the payroll. And I know I never would have got where I am 
without building up my resume that way. Also, even if you find yourself 
unemployed or stuck in a 9 to 5 rut, sitting in on college classes to gain 
skills (programming, networking, higher math etc.) gets you experience 
that'll move you toward doing more of what you want. Most professors aren't 
too uptight about letting you sit in for free, it's probably a refreshing 
change to teach somebody who's there because they want to be. That's my two 
cents, anyway...

Has anyone ever been in the position of turning down work because you 
didn't want to apply for clearance? I seem to remember some people here 
saying they already have it, was it a hard decision for you? I don't really 
have a problem with the idea of facing a background check (though I don't 
imagine anyone looks forward to it), it's the pre-publication review board 
requirement that bothers me.
