And I notice that hanging on the wall to the right in the photo is the 
"New York Times -- Baghdad Bureau" photo. "All the news that's fit to 
simulate."

And to think some people still think we actually _did_ go to the moon

(P.S. I wonder how long it will be before publishing a photo debunking 
someone's Potemkin Village is a violation of the DMCA?)
