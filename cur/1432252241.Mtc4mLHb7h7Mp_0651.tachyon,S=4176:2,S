You are quite idealistic. Neither the Constitution nor case law matters. Neither constrains the 
behavior of law enforcement.

"ACLU of CO Sues Federal and State Law Enforcement

Agencies Over Illegal SWAT Raid on Family
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ednesday, February 20, 2002

DENVER--The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado filed a lawsuit today alleging that federal 
and state law enforcement agents violated the constitutional rights of a Pueblo family when they 
conducted an illegal SWAT-type raid on the family's home with no warrant or other legal authority.

Once again, the war on drugs misses the target and instead scores a direct hit on the 
Constitution, said Mark Silverstein, Legal Director of the ACLU of Colorado. These government 
agents had no search warrant, no arrest warrant, and no lawful authority whatsoever.

They carried out this armed home invasion in flagrant disregard of the Fourth Amendment, which 
forbids unreasonable searches and arrests without probable cause.

According to the ACLU lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of Dan and Rosa Unis and their two 
college-aged sons, on August 19, 2000, the family was peacefully enjoying the privacy of their 
home when black-masked, black-helmeted men brandishing automatic weapons and wearing all-black 
uniforms with no insignias suddenly burst into the house unannounced, kicked the family's dog 
across the floor and ordered the entire family to "get on the fucking floor."  "

Don't forget to be patriotic.
