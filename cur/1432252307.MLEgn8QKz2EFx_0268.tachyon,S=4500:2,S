I'm not religious about a gold standard, but the fluctuations in world 
supply of gold are quite small. Nearly all of the gold extant in the 
world has existed for a long time in the hands of man (and governments, 
companies, churches, etc.). Even those mining technology has gotten 
better, the riches veins of ore--and most of the nuggest sitting in 
streambeds, etc.--have long been exhausted. I'm sure that 10 or 15 
minutes spent with a search engine, maybe much less, would show the 
number of tons of gold mined each year versus the total amount of gold 
already held.

Money things are just objects with certain beliefs and expectations 
attached to them.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
