In that case the charges are completely without substance -- but then we 
already knew that was the case.

No, it was to cause cost and inconvenience to Declan, to deter people from 
reporting the kind of stuff than Declan reports.

It deterred me.  I have avoided mentioning the name of the person charged, 
in this list and in another place, for fear that someone might churn out 
subpoenas on the basis of a groups.google.com search.

Declan's news articles contain nothing that is not better attested by the 
defendant's own postings.  The subpoena is just routine harassment of 
political enemies, same as in the PGP grand jury, and some of the hearings 
on the communist conspiracy.  Repression as usual.
