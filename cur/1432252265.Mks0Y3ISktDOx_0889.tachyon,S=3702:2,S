Not based on just their stupidity, as their own stupidity per se is 
not violative of the rights of others. If and when they act to steal 
the property or rights of others, via food stamps or welfare or 
whatever, then of course they need killing.

The crack hoe who takes my tax money to fill her crack pipe should be 
exterminated like the rat she is. Ditto for the gun grabber, the 
election stealing politician, etc.
