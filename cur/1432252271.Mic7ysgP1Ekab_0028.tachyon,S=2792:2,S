I thought the appearance of a tornado in Maryland (killing two)
shortly after the WTC/pentagon[1] fireworks was telling.  With the
background 
of gay plagues and the anoxia in the Gulf of Mexico... and the 
programmers calling "let my people go" about Dimitry... and darkness
falling over california...

But Jah could still be on our side.  He cleaned up the dotcom arrogance
for us...
though he left Larry Ellison alive.. perhaps to test us.
