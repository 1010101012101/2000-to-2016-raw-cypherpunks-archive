There was once an effort here to list CP relevent prose.
How about a list of CP relevent moving pictures (and why
relevent)? 

Enemy of the State ---for surveillance and conspiracy
GATTACA ---for biometrics, identity fraud, surveillance

more? 

[NB: this isn't moot; I've bought book$ on the recommendation/
reputation of some here; I'd certainly rent a videotape, 
though not a DVD..  :-]

[PS: please *don't* recommend "hacker" (fnord) crap like 
swordfish, sneakers, gag, etc.  I am uncertain whether to 
encourage (e.g., documentary) TV segments --there are lots of these but they may be harder to find.  Probably for the sake of Future Historians
they should be accepted.]
