I found this:

http://www.disa.mil/Services/SATCOM/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/SATCOM/SCO/MSS_Customer_Ordering_Guide.pdf
I guess in theory, with the ISDN module - you could have location
"anonymity" limited to a given spot beam and then the CryptoPhone ISDN
could be used for content confidentiality. That seems almost OK if
you're able to point your transmitter directly at the bird.

I'm still game to acquire one - I guess that DISA (?) won't sell me one?
Will they sell them to the general public?

While sorta unrelated - this seems worth mentioning:

All the best,
Jacob
