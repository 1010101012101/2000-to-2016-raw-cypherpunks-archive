It can?  I thought that DMA was there to let you avoid
bothering the CPU.  The Alternate NIC card would need to have a
CPU of its own to do a good job of this, but that's not hard.

There's also the difficulty that, while it might be good at DRM,
it might or might not be good at letting users write programs
that are good at security.  It's certainly never been a Microsoft specialty.
