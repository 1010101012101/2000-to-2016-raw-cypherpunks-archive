It's rather obvious, but:

ABmod(b^n)

Where A and B are your seeds/keys.

b is the number of elements in the alphabet.

n is the number of digits you want in the answer.

You could add a trusted hashing function in there as well,

(Hash(AB))mod(b^n)

Hope it helps.

As to random number generators, I'm fond of the radioactive and the
physicaly chaotic sort (they tend to be non-transportable and rather
large). Drip rate and magnetic pendulums being my favorite.
