For CPunks what's needed is a DIY Electron Beam Litho apparatus. Its basically an electron microscope in reverse. For relatively simple chips it could be more than adequate as its possible eliminates the need and complexity, chemistry, etc. for masks and can perform most all process functions (doping, implantation, etc.) and attain feature sizes commensurate with current foundary tech. AFAIK, its possible to build from used e-microscopes though maintaining calibration and linarity is something best learned in a working environment at someone else's expense. :) One of the main shortcomings of EBL is its low production  rate since all features must be developed by "writing" them, like an old stylevector display, on the substrate.
