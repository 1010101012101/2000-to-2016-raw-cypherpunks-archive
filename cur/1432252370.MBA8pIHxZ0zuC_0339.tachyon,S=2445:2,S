Dear 

You have inquired about working from home in the past!
Have you found what you are looking for?

I am looking for people who want a change and are teachable!

We have a turn-key Internet business that is worldwide!
We are currently doing business throughout the United States 
and in 51 countries around the world.  If you look at where you 
are and things have not changed in your bank account in the past 
5 years. It won't, unless you do something different!

This is fun, simple and magical!

For a Free Booklet either:

   go to our website 
         www.mailorder-workfromhome.com
  
   or call toll free 1-800-930-7309.

Thanks for your time, .

Dreams do come TRUE!!
