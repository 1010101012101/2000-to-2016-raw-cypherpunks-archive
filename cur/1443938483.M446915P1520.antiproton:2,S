This was discussed on the old fulldisclosure list

IMHO at least one of these will happen

(A) usa kicks the bucket.
(B) somebody tries to save the usa, the way this already happens in
greece.

In (A) almost sure hyperinflation occurs, usa companies sold cheap,
affects people in most of the world, but not oligarchs. likely NSA
becomes criminal gang not controlled by .gov.

(B) likely would be the greek way, but not sure how long it can last
before going to (A) (lol, are greeks just beta testers...)

In Bulgaria advanced socialism fell in 1989 and basically the (A)
scenario happened.

I am surprised why the chinese still pour money in a Ponzi scheme, there
might be an agreement of some kind.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_United_States

has very outdated data, not sure how worse it is now:


The financial position of the United States includes assets of at least
$269.6 trillion (1576% of GDP) and debts of $145.8 trillion (852% of
GDP) to produce a net worth of at least $123.8 trillion (723% of
GDP,)[a] as of Q1 2014.
