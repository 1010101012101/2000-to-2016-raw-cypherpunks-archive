Presumably cybersec wizards have warned about the ubiquity
of AWStats and access log files online, or maybe not, just quietly
exploit them. There are hundreds of thousands listed on Google's.
tip of the iceberg.

Beyond the simplistic AWStats and access logs to snapshot traffic
for the amateur pryer, peddler and peeper, there are those which log
much more about visitors' behavior, desires, secrets, hook-ups, adulteries,
informing, cheating, avoiding, perambulating among personal device
records, types and models of equipment, passwords, attempts to
anonymize, encrypt, hide, evade.

Search engines, social media, TLAs, archives, drops, clouds, server
farms, corporations, NGOs, AVs, Gorgon-headed bots, heavily-followed
and handsomely paid Schneier-Mitnick-grade global traveling gov-advising
security entrepreneurs are hardly alone in aggregating users nonchalant
share of data for those running their own Amazons of quick supply to
media, advertisers, spies, govs, invest vultures, In-Q-Tel, oligarchs,
and to swap with others operating in rogue nations and below and
beyond the superficial Dark web.

Presumably there is material in the Snowden dump, or withheld by
Snowden to "not harm national security," which shows the great range
of data available for grabbing, manipulating, exploiting, bargaining,
ransoming, doctoring, pre-positioning, threatening, monetizing,
shaping economic and political policies. And what similar holdings
are held by the opposition in a stand-off of first use of digital
mutual destruction.
