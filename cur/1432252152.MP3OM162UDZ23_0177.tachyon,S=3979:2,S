Documents and images. No kiddie porn, but there are still three
other horsemen to choose from. Absolutely legal for now, bar
retrospective legislation, but that won't stop the horse trainers
from pretending otherwise. Constitutionally protected in the US,
but that doesn't mean you won't cop flak from ISP higher-up and
other organisations regardless of where you live.

If you'd be happy to mirror cryptome.org, then you'd probably be
happy to mirror this material.

Depends on interest. We can use dns tricks to shape traffic to
reflect your resources.

The anonymous push nature of the mirroring software. We can support
non-unix pull mirrors too, provided there are enough push mirrors
to feed from. The software could be ported to other operating
systems without too much difficulty, but that's another project.

An ability to create mail-aliases, gpg, perl5, and a good sense of humour :)

Cheers,
Julian.
