Indeed, if I ran a flight school I would probably answer any questions 
the FBI might have, even if I were fairly certain none of the attackers 
had trained at my school. Ditto for a handful of other situations, where 
being helpful to the FBI would be the right thing to do.

But if were just an Arab, or just a Muslim, or just a Cypherpunk, then I 
would certainly not answer any questions whatsoever, especially not when 
a general throttling of civil liberties and a search for scapegoats is 
going on.

(I chortle when I read about stegonography. I posted the first 
description of the LSB method in images and sound files in a 1990 
sci.crypt posting. I later developed the idea further. Now I see bozo 
journalists theorizing that OBL used stego, when in fact there's no 
evidence his agents used computers for more than simple AOL mail. I even 
see Bruce Schneier sagely opining about "dead drops." Do a search on 
"digital dead drops" in my 1994 Cyphernomicon...I explored these options 
for freedom fighters a decade ago.)
