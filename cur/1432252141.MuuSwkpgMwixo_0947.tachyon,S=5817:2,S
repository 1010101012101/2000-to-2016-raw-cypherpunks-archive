Yes, that is why Tony's remark was somewhat tongue-in-cheek and used
 "solid mathematical foundations" within quotes.

The buyer. CAs (read Verisign's CPS or any CA's CPS, or bank contracts
and -- above all -- see the US UCC) are not responsible for producing correct
results but just for using correct methods. Where "correct methods" are
what others consider correct -- even if they are proved wrong later on
by a one mathematician working in his attic.

This paragraph was also Tony's contribution, not mine. It reflects a
case I often make -- to what extent are we ironing out diversity and
thus creating an artificial and useless model rather than a real-world
model that would have real-world significance?  "The emperor is nude",
needs to be heard more often IMO, in e-commerce.  Before, if possible,
more of our economy and even lives depend on it.
