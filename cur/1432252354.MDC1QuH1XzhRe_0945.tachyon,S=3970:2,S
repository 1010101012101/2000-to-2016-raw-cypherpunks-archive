If you put the tag at the end of the line, not the beginning,
it doesn't break sorting - all the articles of a given thread
stay together.  One difference between what you do and what
some other mailing lists do is that cypherpunks uses multiple list servers,
and yours munges the Subject: lines while the others don't.
Most mailing lists that label their traffic use just one server;
if they're using multiple servers, they're administered identically,
so you don't have a mixture of munged and undamaged topics.
