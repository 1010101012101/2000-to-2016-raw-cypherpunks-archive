I thought that DynCorp was Blackwater re-branded. But they are something 
totally different! Revenue in 2010 was 3 billion. Wow. Business must be 
booming.

I wonder what it is that costs 3 billion. From operational income of 
120mil in '08 to 3 bil revenue in '10 means what? With 17.000 employees 
they are about as big as the CIA. So, maybe, if they reserve 2 bil for 
paying them employees, so they they pay pretty well; around 120k. The 
rest is write-offs on their 1.5 Bil in equipment. Which takes about 
three years. Sounds about right. Leaves about 400mil for operations. 
Basically moving stuff, and acquisitions.

WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

That reminds me of a guy I knew. Big guy. Ex- Blackwater employee. Nice 
guy. Told me that they go to war because they had too much equipment and 
bullets and stuff. Inane, right?
