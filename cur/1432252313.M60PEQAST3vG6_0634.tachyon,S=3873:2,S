Ron is far more than that: He's also out of house counsel for DMA.

I do; I was even at his 70th (I think) birthday party. I think the
odds that he's on this list are phenomenally low. Privacy leftists
(what you really mean when you're saying privacy advocates) don't like
him because they think that after some seminal work he did, he sold
out and now supports the idea that there are some valid reasons for
corporate data exchange, etc. Heresy!
