That is part of the solution, but not all, as noted below.

That is corrected in  draft-touch-tcp-antispoof, which contains the BGP 
focus of anonsec-00; anonsec-01 (to appear in about 2 weeks) focuses on 
just the anonsec portion of 00.

Thanks for that input; the claim that BGP in core Internet routers 
required intractible setup for TCP-MD5 has been refuted by experience 
noted during the TCPM WG meeting in San Diego as well. This section of 
tcp-antispoof will be updated accordingly.
