  Proliferation
  Of 'Shell' Companies
  Arouses Scrutiny

  By GLENN R. SIMPSON

  April 25, 2006; Page A4

  The U.S. has created a booming international market for a vehicle
  increasingly favored in financial crime: corporations that exist mainly on
  paper but come with American addresses.

  So-called shell companies "have become popular tools for facilitating
  criminal activity," the U.S. Government Accountability Office says in a
  report to be published today, citing data and reports from federal
  law-enforcement agencies. Last year, Russian and Ukrainian prosecutors
  filed more than 100 requests with the U.S. Justice Department for help
  investigating U.S. shell companies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation
  told the GAO that a majority of its 100-plus cases of market manipulation
  involve the use of U.S. shell companies. U.S. officials believe shell
  companies are being used to launder as much as $36 billion from the former
  Soviet Union alone.


  Of the 50 U.S. states, the GAO found, 42 impose no extra requirements on
  foreign individuals seeking to set up a U.S. corporation. In states
  including Delaware, Kentucky and Nevada, numerous local firms sell
  so-called limited-liability corporations to foreign buyers with few
  questions asked. Law-enforcement officials complained to the GAO that many
  firms submit fake names for directors and officers. The report found that
  not a single U.S. state seeks to verify the names of officers and directors
  submitted on new company registrations.

  "You have to supply more information to get a driver's license than you do
  to form one of these nonpublicly traded corporations," said U.S. Sen. Carl
  Levin, a Michigan Democrat who with Sen. Norman Coleman, a Minnesota
  Republican, requested the study. Many European law-enforcement officials
  have complained that the problem makes the U.S. look hypocritical because
  it is so vocal about financial crime. "Just the way we want overseas
  jurisdictions to be transparent, so we should have transparency here," Mr.
  Levin said in an interview.

  An FBI analysis provided to the GAO says U.S. corporate agents operate much
  like counterparts in offshore tax havens, "using nominee officers to keep
  the foreign beneficial owner anonymous." But the big advantage of
  U.S.-based companies is their address, which confers instant legitimacy in
  international commerce as well as easier access to U.S. bank accounts and
  dollars.

  Shell companies generally have no employees, products or physical assets.
  In the U.S., most shells are limited-liability corporations, a legal entity
  designed for small businesses that requires very little paperwork to set
  up. Now, 300,000 more of them are formed annually than are traditional
  corporations, and their total numbers nearly doubled between 2001 and 2004.

  A hybrid of a partnership and a corporation, they were first endorsed by
  Wyoming in 1977 to let owners of small firms enjoy the liability
  protections of big companies without bearing the paperwork and tax burdens.
  They have been an unqualified boon to U.S. entrepreneurialism and
  overwhelmingly are formed for legitimate purposes. But their simplicity and
  legal protections also make LLCs ideal shell companies for laundering money
  to hide its origins. In many states, they can be registered by foreign
  citizens via the Internet in just minutes without any ownership information
  being supplied. Among the states that U.S. authorities frequently cite as
  top concerns are Nevada, Delaware and Oregon.

  In one case reported to the GAO by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  agency, a Nevada LLC received 3,774 wire transfers for $81 million in just
  two years from locales such as Russia, Latvia and the British Virgin
  Islands, but agents were unable to even come up with a suspect because the
  company's true owner was never identified in any records.

  Top officials at the Treasury Department say they have begun working with
  state officials to address the longstanding problem, but no agreement has
  been reached. Registering companies has become big business in many states,
  much as it long has been in traditional tax havens such as the Cayman
  Islands or Isle of Man. The U.S.-based agents interviewed by GAO
  investigators said they generally collect contact information only from
  their clients. State officials told the GAO that asking for ownership data
  would drive away legitimate firms seeking confidentiality for competitive
  or other legitimate reasons.

  Foreign criminals use state corporation laws to evade key laws against
  financial crime passed by Congress in recent years, including the USA
  Patriot Act passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. While federal laws
  and international standards require banks to conduct investigations of
  anyone seeking to become a client and often to determine their sources of
  income, banks aren't required to find out the true owners of a company
  seeking to open an account.

  The GAO said "financial industry representatives," which it didn't name,
  told the agency that identifying the real owners behind would-be corporate
  customers "absorbs time and resources, because institutions must sometimes
  peel back layers of corporations or hire private investigators."

  As foreign police officials seek information on owners of U.S.-based LLCs,
  often the Justice Department turns them away empted-handed, the GAO says.
  Many states never ask who the true foreign owners are, so even a federal
  subpoena won't produce data that isn't collected in the first place.

  Mr. Levin said the system can be fixed without losing the advantages of
  LLCs. "If you don't want to pierce the veil of liability, that is all well
  and good, that is the whole purpose of corporations," he said. "But it is
  not acceptable for law enforcement to not be able to know who is behind the
  corporation in terms of tax evasion or terrorism."
