Which your nervous system has learned.  Other sounds it hasn't.

Yes, since the invaders have not learned what's 'normal'.

If it was something I worried about (I don't keep a loaded

Me too, similar circumstance, with a kid in the house too, though I'm a 
little ashamed  to admit it -its like decrying those who don't get vaccines
and then not getting one yourself.  But (using the analogy again) maybe
the frail shouldn't get vaccinated because of danger to selves.
(Assuming rational frail.)
I'm thinking about a high-up clock-safe though. Or a more expensive
(less reliable) finger-safe by the door.


All you P7 heads are too elite for me, but to each their own.
I've collected from NAA .22 to a wide (12 round) Makharov to H & K.  
No .45's; so sue me :-)
