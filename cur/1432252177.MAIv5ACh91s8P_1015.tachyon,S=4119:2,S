  FMNN OFFICER HARRY BROWNE DIES

  Thursday, March 02, 2006 - FreeMarketNews.com

  Harry Browne, former president of Free Market News Network, Corp., has died
  at home after a long illness. Mr. Browne, a best-selling author and
  Libertarian political star, was a leading force in FMNN's energetic growth
  in the mid 2000s; his television program, This Week in Liberty, routinely
  attracted praise for its moral clarity and political lucidity.

  In 1996 and 2000, Mr. Browne was the nominee of the Libertarian Party for
  President of the United States. He also served as Director of Public Policy
  for the DownsizeDC.org, and as a consultant to the Permanent Portfolio
  family of mutual funds. Throughout the mid and late-20th century, he was a
  popular public speaker who appeared on the Today show, Wall $treet Week,
  The Larry King Show, and hundreds of other national and local radio and
  television shows.

  Mr. Browne was little known in the investment world when his first book,
  How You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation, was published in 1970.
  Recognizing the disastrous monetary policy of the U.S. government, he
  warned that the dollar would be devalued, inflation could be severe, and
  gold, silver, and foreign currencies should skyrocket in value. The book's
  theme clashed with the prevailing wisdom, but it struck a chord with tens
  of thousands of Americans, and the book made the New York Times bestseller
  list. This was only the first of a number of Harry Browne bestsellers.

  In late 1994, Browne announced his Libertarian candidacy for president and
  received 485,759 votes on Election Day, the second highest total in
  Libertarian Party history. In 2000, he was again nominated to represent the
  Libertarian Party and garnered more than 382,000 votes, despite a tight
  race between the two major parties.
