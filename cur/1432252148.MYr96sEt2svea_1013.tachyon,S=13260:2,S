this may explain a little more

http://www.barefootsworld.net/seattle.html

yes "white terminology" holds white CONCEPTS as do words in my tribe
the blackfoot and other tribes languages i am also cherokee for
instance the word "floor" does not exist because things are noted as
actions so it is "flooring" because things are not stagnant they are

objects all are animate

you may hear people say the whites 'stole' the land but what they did

i know of these instances yes but the land was vast so ... they moved
on ... no i dont think they saw it as particularly 'ok' and they made
confederacies and agreements regarding these issues - they had
community agreements which they worked together to come to also fyi
they had chiefs yes but they had different councils that made
decisions they still function in this way and what your role was was
what you were naturally good at  - they didnt try to make people into
something they were not

F no and i dont think there was a big bang either or a beginning i

i think property is a coffin
BUT i understand what you mean how it could be seen that way actually
it really is a multidimensional issue but overall i see that history -
and my own inner gut - shows that having community is a more fully
effective way of living than individualism BUT also i think rulers
will turn anything they can into something fucked up

yes that was my point those are the people that are so interested in
property rights > hey ya know the largest land owner in manhattan ??
catholic church... know the second largest property owner in manhattan
?? episcopal church ... what i think they have socially engineered is
the protection of ruling class property rights and convinced the
people it serves them - it does not !! otherwise everyone would have
food and clean water and a place to live (its not that much to ask
for) really it doesnt serve humanity or life force either to have such
levels of separation between ppl because of who they were born to,
where etc
