Holy Shit! Did you forward this Hettinga? It actually makes sense and is 
relevant!

The fact that Bush's wiretapping might be technically "illegal" is of only 
marginal interest.

Remember that some of our bandits have probably been getting this level of 
info through Echelon: Remember, it's not illegal for the Brits to spy on US 
citizens. Receiving such info from our Limey bandits pals is probably only 
marginally illegal at best.

The only thing "new" here is that there are new subgroups of bandits with 
the info now obtained through conventional channels, probably more local, 
and who aren't too afraid to reveal that they have it. Thus look for arrests 
of various troublemakers and big-mouths whereas NSA probably woud have been 
mum unless absolutely necessary, and even though only through a careful 
process that didn't indicate how they got the info (thus precluding general 
bigmouth roundups).

Of course, this does have some practical implications. Time to update the 
hardware...
