From: jamesd

:The Taliban was not a spontaneous internal phenomemom, not a
:response to an outcry for law and order.  There were
:repeated, massive, and bloody efforts by foreign powers,
:primarily Pakistan, to "assist" the aghans in achieving law
:and order, and the Taliban is only the most recent, and most
:bloody, of these.

Well, of course I was speaking metaphorically, drawing a parallel with
having a tyrannical, repressive group "governing" a population - regardless
of how that group came into their position.

And of course, it must be distinguished between what those who fight to be
in positions of power imagine for themselves vs what those who will be
subjected to that power, imagine when they consider it.  And it must be
distinguished between what people in the U.S. (or in the 'free world')
imagine when they wish for law and order, vs what a religious,
fundamentalist group will imagine.

As libertarian/anarchistic types are aware, what people want when they call
for the establishment, or re-establishment, of 'law and order', is a return
to a definite situation where they can calculate the causes & effects of
human actions more predictably, with fewer nasty surprises, less uncertainty
in the outcome, greater expectations of positive and pleasant interaction
with others, and no intrusions into their monotony (joke).  This doesn't
necessarily mean that they spontaneously want a government, but that they
want the activities of life to proceed in a "governed" manner (and they
never expect that it will be themselves who will be among the governed -
only the bad guys will be caused to suffer it).  Having an institution
called "government" is the only thing that most can imagine in order to
achieve and maintain such a situation.

(As we know, the problem with these governing institutions is that, instead
of exercising a control over error, all liberty of action is reigned in, to
eliminate any kind of disturbance which they are unable to deal with, given
their scope of comprehension and competence).
