Pioneer DVR-S201

The DVR-S201 is the world's first DVD-R drive to support the recently 
released 4.7GB media of DVD-R Book Ver 2.0 for Authoring. The DVR-S201 
drive is designed for authoring DVD titles that utilize the full capacity 
of mass-produced DVD-ROM or DVD-Video media. A completed DVD-R disc is 
ideal to use a Press Cutting Master Disc. The DVR-S201 drive is also 
specially designed for authoring applications offering added convenience 
for creating DVD titles and content with increased efficiency.

The DVR-S201 drive is backward compatible, allowing continued use of 
conventional 3.95GB / Book Ver 1.0 DVD-R discs. This allows for maximum 
compatibility with existing players and drives.

Discs recorded using the DVR-S201 can be played on most DVD-ROM drives and 
DVD-Video players. The drive's ability to handle a 4.7GB DVD-R disc, which 
is equal in capacity to replicated DVD-ROM or DVD-Video discs, allows the 
entire content to be test prior to mass production. The drive is also 
useful for small-scale distribution of DVD content.
