Anarcho-Capitalism is a name given to a philosophy that some call 
"Free-Market Anarchism," or sometimes the less apt "Libertarianism." (Not 
all those who call themselves Libertarians are Anarcho-Capitalists. Kind of 
confusing, huh?)
Grammatically speaking, Anarcho-Capitalism is an oxymoron, which in my 
opinion makes it unsound as a philosophy. Anarchists are opposed to the 
economic policies of Capitalism, and anyone claiming to be an 
'Anarcho-Capitalist' simply does not grasp the true meaning of Anarchism. 
Usually calling themselves Libertarians, Anarcho-Capitalists are simply 
people who have no interest in changing the fundamental nature of society.

friedman.                                                   Font:
