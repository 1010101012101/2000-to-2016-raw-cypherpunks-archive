DNS has been giving me grief into the wee hours so I figure I'm pretty
slow myself but I'm thinking you just could be a mite clueless.

*When asked by parents why you're taking so long in the bathroom :

A: Oh, I'm just shooting up so I can put up with you guys at the dinner
table.


*When asked by the priest how you spent your weekend :

A: Oh we had an orgy and sacrificed a goat to Satan at midnight on
Saturday. The blood was really tasty. Then we stalked hot teen virgins
at the church picnic.


*When asked by the drug police how you spent your weekend :

A: Oh, we moved 100 lbs of crack from our labs to NYC and wasted a
prosecutor who was giving us a little grief in LA.


*When asked (observed speaking) by the counterterrorism official how you
spent your weekend :

When asked by a member of the Comittee to Stamp Out Violence in the
Media what your favorite movie is you launch into detailed descriptions
of Pulp Fiction and praise each scene lavishly and then challenge her to
a game of DOOM.

When asked about my opinion for what needed at the library in my town (
since I'm not responsible for doing anything about it but know a few
folks who are ) I say there should be more hardcopy porno and a better
IN connection. Then I don't waste my time answering questions that will
never be implemented anyway.

Is that enough?

So if false it is art and even if it is true, so what? Studying tactics
& methods is not planning some sort of an attack.
