People who think like "Anonymous" above should ask themselves a simple 
question:


"What would you think if _you_ were seized in a pre-dawn raid, held 
without charges, never allowed to confront evidence, not allowed to 
contact the attorney of your choice, cut off from communications with 
your family and friends, and held in jail for several weeks or more?"

I know I'd be out for blood, McVeigh-style.

My rough figure of merit is that for every _day_ that I am held 
unjustly, a member of the forces which held me must die.

If this means killing an office building of them for unjustly holding me 
for 30 days, so be it.

(Of course, I'd attempt to be more clever about it. But the morality of 
it is as I stated.)

As for "Anonymous," he's probably just another one of the "Anonymity 
should be banned" crowd, like the cretins at "Reason," the "Wall Street 
Journal," and so on. Funny how the most rabid statists often hide behind 
the very tools they want banned.
