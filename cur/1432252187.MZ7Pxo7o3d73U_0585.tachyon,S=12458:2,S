   U.K. Anti-Terrorism Law Imperils Hackers, Privacy
   posted by cicero on Saturday July 28, @06:34PM
   from the how-nice-that-hackers-are-covered-too dept.


   A U.K. law that took effect this year gives police far-ranging powers
   to make warrantless arrests, enter buildings without court orders, and
   punish people for having information that could be useful to
   terrorists.
   
   The measure, called the Terrorism Act of 2000, received royal assent
   in July 2000. It became law in February 2001.
   
   Parliament, after lengthy debate, defined "terrorism" as any threat to
   influence any government (U.K. or other) or group "for the purpose of
   advancing a political, religious or ideological cause." Actions that
   are punishable include those that threaten or carry out "serious
   damage to property," endanger public safety, or are are "designed
   seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic
   system."
   
   If you think that covers hackers, well, you're right. And it's no
   accident.
   
   A ZDNET article reports that: "Computer hackers could be classed as
   terrorists under a U.K. law." So does this Register writeup.
   
   An IDG article in February confirmed that the Home Office plans to
   prosecute hackers under the Terrorism Act.
   
   Unfortunately, the reporter never mentioned some of the more
   disturbing aspects of the law.
   
   It allows police to randomly stop people on streets, who are then
   required to give their names (so much for anonymity) or go to prison.
   Cops can seize any cash that they believe "is intended to be used for
   the purposes of terrorism," with no court authorization required. Gone
   is the traditional burden of proof: Judges are required to assume that
   contraband in the same building as the accused is owned by the accused
   "unless he proves that he did not know of its presence on the premises
   or that he had no control over it."
   
   Perhaps the most fascinating section restricts even owning information
   that could be useful to "a person committing or preparing an act of
   terrorism." If hackers are terrorists, better delete your copy of Back
   Orifice and bugtraq archives now.
   
   This Draconian law can be explained by the uneasy situation in
   Northern Ireland, which has been marked by recent car bombs and
   grenade attacks reportedly performed by IRA factions. (The law is,
   according to the Home Office, designed to be one uniform measure "to
   replace the existing, separate pieces of temporary legislation for
   Northern Ireland and Great Britain.")
   
   Americans, be warned. Congress is spending more and more time talking
   about bio-chem, Internet, and nuclear attacks. Soon you could be
   facing the same invasions of privacy and property.

   At least the spirit of John Locke isn't completely dead in his native
   land.
   
   "The legislation which gives the authorities extra powers should have
   to be renewed by parliament regularly rather than being permanent
   legislation. The definition of terrorism is also far too wide, in
   spite of significant efforts by Liberal Democrats and others in
   parliament to improve it," Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat Shadow Home
   Secretary, said in a statement. The Liberal Democrats are the third
   largest political party.
   
   In a discussion on a U.K. mailing list, Ross Anderson of Cambridge
   University said that the law was written so broadly that it could
   imperil his computer security work. Predicted Anderson: "So now we
   know. We are all terrorists now!"
   
   Another list member chimed in: "So interfering with an electronic
   system in order to advance a political cause seems to me to be
   covered, or at least it could be argued that it was covered. Is
   defacing a website 'terrorism?' Or distributing a stupid word macro by
   email? It looks as if, had the 'love bug' mail message contain a
   political or religious slogan it could be defined as terrorism by this
   standard.
   
   Below are some excerpts from the law. You can find the complete text
   at www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/20000011.htm, and a
   protest site at http://www.blagged.freeserve.co.uk/ta2000/index.htm.
