There used to be a little toy server run by Software Agents at
www.netbank.com.  It exchanged something called NetCash which had
the following format.

NetCash US$ 10.00 A123456B789012C

You could mail the server encrypting with its public key, and it would
send you back the results encrypted with any password you specified.

The server could do a number of simple things, like exchange tokens for
new ones, make change, combine a bunch of tokens into a single one, and
check tokens for validity.  You could deposit tokens and they would mail
you a check, or you could mail them a check, and they would issue tokens.

It was a cute little system, restricted to amounts under $100, and got
some use by BBS systems which accepted the tokens to pay for a
subscription.

Anyone remember this?

It apparently folded, and netbank.com is now a real bank.
