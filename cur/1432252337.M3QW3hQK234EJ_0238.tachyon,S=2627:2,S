"""
here's lots of news today about the (not particularly surprising)
revelations that AT&T may have helped monitor internet traffic for the
NSA. It's interesting to note, with this news, the side story that
AT&T also just revamped their privacy policy, allowing them to more
freely share whatever data they collect with government officials.
However, rather than discuss those two issues (which are being
discussed widely), a more interesting question is whether or not this,
along with the ongoing debates around net neutrality, will actually
lead more people to simply encrypt their internet traffic. It
certainly could open up quite the business opportunity for firms
providing encrypted VPN systems that basically scramble all your data
so your ISP can't snoop and can't prioritize (or downgrade) the
traffic.

poor chumps who buy the proprietary snake oil; true security requires
visibility, and alas there's not a big market for decentralized open
source security/privacy infrastructure (a paying market that is).

[sometimes virtue is its own reward.  and sometimes it at least gets
you beers and whiskey.]
