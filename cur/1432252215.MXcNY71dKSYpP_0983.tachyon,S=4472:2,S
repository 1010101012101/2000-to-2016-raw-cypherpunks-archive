Hello cypherpunks@toad.com!

Please do NOT reply to this message. To contact us, see the
instructions below.

You have received this message because this is the e-mail
address you provided when you registered for a Microsoft®
Passport at a site that participates in the Passport network.

Your Passport is a single sign-in name, password, and wallet
that you can use to sign in and make online purchases from a
quickly growing number of Web sites.

Check out the Passport Directory at
http://www.passport.com/directory.asp to see where you can use
your Passport.

NOTE: The rest of this message contains important information
about your Passport. You'll want to refer back to it
periodically, so please save it or print it out.

HOW TO USE YOUR NEW PASSPORT
Your new Passport sign-in name is: 
cypherpunks@toad.com

You'll need to provide your sign-in name and password
whenever you sign in. (For your security, we won't remind
you of your password here, but please make a mental note
of it.)

Passport is simple to use. To sign in, click the green Sign In
link on any Passport site. Type your sign-in name and password.
After you sign in to one participating site, you can sign
in to any other participating site with just one click--without
having to retype any information. To sign out of all sites you
signed in to, click the purple Sign Out link on any of those sites.

The wallet service is just as easy to use. You can store as
many credit cards and shipping addresses in your wallet as you
want, safely and securely. To make a purchase at a
participating merchant, click a Passport wallet button or
link, choose which credit card and shipping address you want
to use, and your information is sent to the online merchant
over a secure connection. You can create your wallet now at
https://wallet.passport.com.

IMPORTANT PASSPORT LINKS
To learn about Passport, get assistance, and view or update
your sign-in profile and wallet, visit Passport Member Services at

Finally, Microsoft is dedicated to protecting your privacy. We
encourage you to review our Passport privacy policy at

Thank you for using your Passport!
The Microsoft Passport Team
