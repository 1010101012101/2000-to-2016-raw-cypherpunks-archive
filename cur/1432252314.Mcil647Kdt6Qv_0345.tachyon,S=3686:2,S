At ultrasonic frequencies this can be a problem.  At lower freq, generally not.  When combined with the electrospray method which provides significant "pull" of the droplet from the nozzle reducing required piezo pressure and consequent cell wall damage. I've not tried it with anthrax but it can work well with ecoli.

No, but I have through a micro pipette and if the suspension is dilute (as I noted) it works fine.

Indeed.
