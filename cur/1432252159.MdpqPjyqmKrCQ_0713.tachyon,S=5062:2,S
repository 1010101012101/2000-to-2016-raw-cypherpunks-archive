War crimes, bad they though are, are not the same as similar crimes 
committed against an unresisting and disarmed populace.

Many governments have committed crimes similar to those committed by the 
nazis and commies in the course of fighting guerrilla wars, for example the 
recent war crimes in Guatemala  But when the guerrilla war ended, those 
governments ceased to commit those crimes.  With commies and nazis, the end 
of resistance frequently resulted in an escalation, rather than diminution 
of those crimes, as for example recently occurred after the communist 
victories in Cambodia and South Vietnam.

During the American war between the states, the feds created artificial 
famine in much the same way, for much the same reasons, as the Soviet, 
Cambodian, North Korean, and Ethiopian governments did, deliberately 
starving non combatants just as communist regimes did.  When the war 
between the American states ended, so did hunger, whereas in communist 
states, the famine intensified as resistance diminished.  The less the 
resistance, the greater the destruction.

The difference between the US regime and the Pol Pot regime was small 
during war, but obvious after victory.
