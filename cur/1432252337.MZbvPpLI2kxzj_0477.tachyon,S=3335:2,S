BTW, Mass. has always been "funny" about electronic surveillance. State
history is very interesting, and so is the law. (Early on, their police
wouldn't wiretap, it was not "gentlemanly." Ahem.)

Consider the traditionalist two-party states and ponder on the true nature
of the historical parallels at the time the recording statutes were enacted.
Ignore the legislative testimony and history, because it will just confuse
you.
