I recommend General Wesley Clark for those who have not seen it (was
new to me).  Lays out American government's plans shortly after 9/11,
to take down seven countries' governments; similar to Brzezinski's
book of predictions similarly a year or so prior (see below).

General Wesley Clark: Wars Were Planned - Seven Countries In Five Years
(Although I paste the transcript here, I find this interview quite
enjoyable to watch, and it's only 8MB, although the video does not
include the last couple sentences from the transcript, and the video
does add separate little section of its own, again General Wesley;
enjoy.)

"General Wesley Clark:
Because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten
days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary
Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say
hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for
me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, "Sir, you've got to
come in and talk to me a second." I said, "Well, you're too busy." He
said, "No, no." He says, "We've made the decision we're going to war
with Iraq." This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, "We're
going to war with Iraq? Why?" He said, "I don't know." He said, "I
guess they don't know what else to do." So I said, "Well, did they
find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?" He said, "No,
no." He says, "There's nothing new that way. They just made the
decision to go to war with Iraq." He said, "I guess it's like we don't
know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we
can take down governments." And he said, "I guess if the only tool you
have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail."

So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were
bombing in Afghanistan. I said, "Are we still going to war with Iraq?"
And he said, "Oh, it's worse than that." He reached over on his desk.
He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, "I just got this down from
upstairs" -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- "today." And
he said, "This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out
seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria,
Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran." I said, "Is
it classified?" He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Well, don't show it to
me." And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, "You remember that?"
He said, "Sir, I didn't show you that memo! I didn't show it to you!"
"

(Looking at youtube, there appears quite a few talks by General Wesley Clark.)

Turkey Intel Chief: Putin's Intervention in Syria Is Against Islam,
ISIS Is a Reality That We Accept
http://russia-insider.com/en/turkish-intelligence-chief-putins-intervention-syria-against-islam-and-international-law-isis
(This from October - last month.)
“ISIS is a reality and we have to accept that we cannot eradicate a
well-organized and popular establishment such as the Islamic State;
therefore I urge my western colleagues to revise their mindset about
Islamic political currents, put aside their cynical mentalité and
thwart Vladimir Putin's plans to crush Syrian Islamist
revolutionaries,” - Anadolu News Agency quoted Mr. Fidan as saying on
Sunday.
