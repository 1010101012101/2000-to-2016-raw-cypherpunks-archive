I haven't, but it does ring true.  You'd get 2 Khz as well as other
intermodulation products.  Standard EE stuff.

You've read about the company trying to sell highly localized
speakers?  They modulate two intense ultrasound beams, and the
air does the nonlinear mixing where they meet.

In the audiophile, lower-intensity case,
the ears' nonlinearity would do it.  Interesting info, Peter.
