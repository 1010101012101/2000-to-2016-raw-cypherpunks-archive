A more detailed summary of the Bioterrorism Protection Act is available 
here --- final bill has not been written yet -- though the pages are not 
sequential, so it's only for the brave:
http://vorlon.mit.edu/~declan/biobill/

Excerpts from that summary:
* "Evaluate need to vaccinate first responders against smallpox"
* "Utilize biometric techniques to identify suicide-biological-bombs"
* "Increase surveillance through development of sentinel strain. Create a 
network of interconnected databases for near-real time integration of 
threat indicator data"
* "Establish a perception management and economic market mitigation plan 
and resources"
* "Ensure isolated, genetically diverse pools of seed and livestock to 
replenish stocks destroyed in disease containment"
* "Assess and harden physical security of water-bottling facilites"
* "The handoff between intelligence and law enforcement agencies must be 
made smoother"
* "Use GPS and wireless identification systems to monitor commercial 
traffic in high-risk and border areas"
* "Ensure that private databases (SABRE, Amtrak reservations, etc.) are 
able to interface with law enforcement information stores immediately"

    Dems Ready Bioterrorism Bill
    By Declan McCullagh and Ben Polen
    2:00 a.m. Oct. 26, 2001 PDT

    WASHINGTON -- In an attempt to differentiate themselves from their GOP
    counterparts, House Democrats are preparing legislation they say will
    shield America from biological terrorism.

    As anxieties about anthrax mushroomed on Capitol Hill -- with the
    deadly bacteria discovered in five congressional office buildings so
    far -- House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Missouri) said
    Thursday that new spending and police powers are necessary to protect
    the public.

    At a press conference held in the open air away from any of the
    polluted buildings, Gephardt said his "Bioterrorism Protection Act"
    would earmark $7 billion for homeland security -- including $1.4
    billion on vaccines and antibiotics -- and provide police with instant
    access to private databases such as the airline's SABRE system and
    Amtrak reservations.

HOMELAND SECURITY TASK FORCE CHAIRMAN MENENDEZ ANNOUNCES BIOTERRORISM 
LEGISLATION
WASHINGTON, DC - Rep. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Vice Chair of the Democratic 
Caucus and Chairman of the House Democratic Task Force on Homeland 
Security, joined by Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt and Members of the 
Task Force, today announced the Democratic proposal to protect communities 
throughout America against future bioterrorist threats or attacks.
The Democratic Bill, the Bioterrorism Protection Act (BioPAct) of 2001, 
seeks to eliminate biological threats, secure our borders on land and at 
sea, protect our food and water, equip our communities with the resources 
to prevent and respond to bioterrorism, and strengthen our Intelligence 
through full coordination, using our most advanced technology to fight 
bioterrorism.
Menendez made the following remarks:
"I'm Bob Menendez, the Chairman of the House Democratic Task Force on 
Homeland Security, and I first want to thank the chairs and vice chairs of 
the working groups that helped write this plan: Bill Pascrell, Sanford 
Bishop, Bobby Scott, Jane Harman, Ike Skelton, Bob Borski, Lucille 
Roybal-Allard, Ellen Tauscher, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Mike Honda, Jim Turner, 
and Jerry Costello - and I want to thank the incredible work of over 80 
Members of our Task Force on this bill. These aren't just Members of 
Congress, they're husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, working to make 
our country and their communities safe and secure. And I think they've done 
a great job.
"What we've learned in the last few weeks is that no matter what we as a 
people are confronted with, we will overcome and defeat our adversaries. No 
attack, no threat, no evil will undermine our resolve and our strength. 
America stands proud and firm - our country and our people have served as 
an example to all of humanity. America has reacted to this unspeakable 
inhumanity with resiliency & humanity - humanity in the face of evil.
"We call the Bioterrorism Protection Act "BioPAct" because we know that 
every American needs to be a part of the fight, part of a pact to protect 
our Homeland. And if we're asking the public to be 'vigilant', then they 
need and deserve to be informed in full and given the chance to be a part 
of a dialogue with the officials who work for them. This bill does that.
(more) "BioPAct is a pact between the American people and their government, 
working together, called to national service, marshaling our vast 
resources, to keep America safe from bioterrorism. The plan doesn't just 
draw on government programs, but on the American spirit, intellect & 
creativity, breaking new frontiers, setting an example the world can follow 
in this new age.
"We're here to tell our fellow citizens that we can beat this foe - and we 
can protect our Homeland.
"The BioPAct will proactively assess the new threats and risks we face, so 
we make sure we target our funding where it's needed most. It will 
eliminate biological threats at the source, by helping countries like 
Russia and the other former Soviet states prevent their biological agents 
from getting into our enemies' hands. We will secure our borders on land 
and at sea by adding thousands of new border agents and by putting our most 
advanced technology at work to screen out terrorists and the weapons they 
might try to bring with them - whether they try to enter our nation at 
airports, on ships, by foot, or in a car. And BioPAct will keep our food 
and water supply safe and secure by putting a comprehensive new inspection 
protocol in place.
"We will make sure our local communities have all the resources they need - 
from greater hospital capacity, to police and firefighters trained in 
counter-terrorism.
"We can prevent disease outbreaks through early and rapid detection; and 
can save lives by making sure we have the vaccines and medicines to treat 
people - and a plan in place to get them where they need to go on a 
moment's notice. This bill does that. And BioPAct strengthens our 
Intelligence by ensuring our many government agencies coordinate 
information and planning. We need one comprehensive strategy - not a dozen 
different ones.
"This bill is a commitment to do all this, and a lot more - because we know 
there is nothing more important than keeping American families safe.
"This is the first in a series of proposals this Task Force and we 
Democrats in the House are putting forward to address Homeland Security. My 
colleagues and I look forward to working with the President and the 
Republicans to get the job done - in fact we met with Director Ridge 
yesterday, and I'm confident we can work together as one American team.
"And as part of that team effort, we also call on the President to use the 
funding already allocated to fight terrorism to begin a national threat 
assessment; to help local communities cover the unexpected overtime costs 
they have already borne in response to the new threat environment since 
September 11th; and to rapidly dedicate new resources to our Coast Guard, 
our border security, and our postal service. We can and will protect our 
Homeland.
"I'm now proud to introduce our Democratic Leader, Dick Gephardt, who had 
the foresight early on to work with our Caucus Chairman, Martin Frost, to 
create this Task Force - bringing so many Members together to work on an 
issue that's on the mind of every American. He's been an inspiration to 
this Congress and to our nation - Ladies and Gentlemen: Dick Gephardt -
"Thank you."
