How to be a sensitive journalist (US style)

Crying
                           If the interviewee cries, this is not
necessarily
                           a bad or harmful thing. Carry paper tissues
at
                           all times, and offer them as a caring
gesture.
                           One reason people feel self-conscious about
                           crying is nasal discharge, and offering them
a
                           paper tissue can help. A friendly touch on
the
                           arm is also often good.
