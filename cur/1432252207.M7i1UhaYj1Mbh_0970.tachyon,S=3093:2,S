The belief (faith) center is somewhere in the frontal cortex and that mutation
was essential for development of the civilisation as we know it, which
basically boils down to brainwashing believers into beating the shit out of
nonbelievers (and these, being independent individuals, never managed to
properly organise to resist), which is evolutionary sustainable (when the shit
gets beaten out of you it takes your mind of sex.)

So, technically speaking, it's more specialisation than mental illness.
