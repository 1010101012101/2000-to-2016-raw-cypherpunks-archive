LUG-Fest (Linux User's Group Festival) an expo style
event for Linux users in the bay area is going to
hold a large keysigning party. If any cypherpunks
are interested in attending here is the relevant
information:

LUG Fest April 21-22, 2001 at Nortel
Networks, Simi Valley, CA, USA!

Keysigning Party Press Release:

http://www.lugfest.org/gpg.cgi

"Sunday, April 22nd, 2001, 12:30 p.m, the Simi Valley Linux Users
 group will hold a GPG/PGP Key signing party during LUGFest IV.
 LUGFest IV will be held at Nortel Networks in  Simi Valley, CA.
 The LUGFest and the key signing party are open to the public, all
 are welcome to attend."


The lugfest press release links to the GnuPG Keysigning
Party HOWTO, which I wrote.  Constructive criticism of
that document is appreciated.  I posted in here once
before for review and got some good feed back.  It
lives at:

http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/gpg-party.html


I've been trying to get LUGs (linux user groups) around
the country to start holding regular keysigning parties
in the last 5 minutes of their meetings.  LUGs exist in
every major metro area in the US and meet regularly.
They are capable a providing an excellent backbone
(infrastructure support) for a strong nation wide web
of trust.  Local webs of trust formed by lugs can be
linked at conferences like LUG-Fest.  I strongly
urge everyone who can to participate in the LUG-Fest
party, and to thank LUG-Fest for holding it.  Also,
if you are a member of your local LUG, I urge you to
help it establish a keysigning tradition and a strong
web of trust.


Thanks,

	- VAB
