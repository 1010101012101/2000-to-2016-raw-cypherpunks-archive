In Speed Metal, Fastest Drummers Take a Beating
Few Humans Can Keep Up in Battle With Drum Machines
http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230459160457928853112603=

[q] When new technologies arrived, metal drumming standards entered the
realm of the physically impossible. [/q]

/* so i read the above article and it reminded me of some issues perhaps
correlatable with computing today.... i have thought about this a lot after
taking up electronic drums for music therapy, learning via self-study, to
benefit from the rewiring of circuits and coordination, etc. very much like
juggling actually, these two realms combining, and also extending into
processing concepts in terms of looping and sequencing of patterns.

first, there is so much going on that shares a fundamental limit with how
music is conceived of and limited to an outdated paradigm based on
perceptual awareness, that the framework of ordinary approaches normally
assumes an absolute frame of one-way movement in time of a coordinated
group led by a conductor, and this is how music is processed, organized,
how songs are defined, relations, instruments designed, etc. like a
rationalization in a given view that then may not allow other dynamics in
that controlled domain, even, if not due to heresy

what this leads to is a technical approach, to refinement, where virtuosity
is tied to speed and dexterity and memory, repeating over and over older
code performances as flawless as possible, within a range of interpretation
though in  a finite or contained or bounded way. this extended into radio,
recordings or copies of originals, and mp3s, copies of copies, then
carrying on this ~music or sound-information or patterning, people training
to repeat play the code via lifelong training of authority-based
instruction, yet the ideas and concepts fixed in a narrow range of
thinking, as if music itself has become its own notation. music as signage.
the language of music overtaking the music of music, as its truth. rote
performance in a sense.

so the assumption arrives at a song if successful, plays eternally, via
endless concerts and furtherance by others repeating the code. instead of,
perhaps a song only exists in its truth once, in a singular instance, and
then it is another song, and cannot be recaptured the same. also: that
there are experts or musicians, education needed to play complicated
instruments whose interfaces are cryptic to the uninitiated if not
musicians themselves, by technical design or engineers who make equipment,
yet the _musicological questions have been removed from these same
instruments, in their further development in an electronics-based context,
especially with computing, where now instruments ship buggy and broken,
designed to fail, and with artificial limits or constraints that prevent
anything beyond existing bounds from being explored, to control and shape
parameters that feed into existing industry automation, as if new music is
another can of soup on assemblyline, volunteered or subsidized, paid for

the ideal technical performer, to which technology itself aspires, is the
robot musician who can function at speeds and with memory and dexterity and
coordination humans cannot, and yet in this substitution or equivalence,
the truth of music as more than repeated patterns is lost to a reductionist
approach, where it is merely language as language, doing things yet at
another more detached layer, perhaps even disconnected from a relational,
emotional grounding via music, such that it becomes or is technique, only,
music as technology, audio engineering with a pleasing aesthetic layer
determined by polls and behavioral psychologists if it makes a brain wave
peak or entrances a heart rhythm, therefore determining it is effective as
an influence, meant to modify or control response, including salivation via
music-video

...thus, the future could be with a 'drummer' in a band that is a machine
or automaton, a puppet or animatronic model with increased capacity to
perform serial gymnastic sequences of patterns, and this could involve more
than four limbs in-sync, as part of a core band-setup.

(if you see a Chuck E. Cheese robot at a future concert- run!)

SO-- MAYBE THINGS ARE ALREADY THIS FAR GONE... in terms of destruction of
culture and robotic repetition of 'songs' as if babel, where meaning is
replaced by pattern matching as a potential condition where music is a
disconnect or escape or bubble condition or virtual layer of self that is
sustained in the parameters of music, though this in a context of
engineering and a loss of insight from music as music, or from 'new music
instruments' via electronics, beyond a given conception that locks it into
a realm of calculation and computation, versus a larger exploration of
ideas and truth beyond previous limits of what music was conceived of, such
that today music is a regression, several centuries caught in an inaccurate
framework that perhaps results in its being an inward or introvertedness
that is this interaction, lost to the reality of the present day, as if a
dream-state yet in a negative dynamic, via detachment, as if a higher state
or condition when instead perhaps ungrounded, unreal, fantasy, ego even, as
if everyone wants to read eachother's diary and relate on these terms, then
go buy stuff and copy one another and belong in the latest trend
engineering, as if on gerbil wheel, used as engine and energy for cultural
development in these devolved terms, against higher truth and greater
relation than only what can be achieved within the contained, forced
dynamics

it doesn't need to be this way, yet that is where it is heading, seemingly
without alternative, due to a status quo that is unquestioned (again, loss
of culture, language, communication, and awareness to reason and agree and
develop otherwise).
so the ideal tends towards the future of this guy:

...where, via archaic MIDI protocols, and further refinements, such an
'electronic drummer' or 'MIDI drummer' would be able to replace a drummer
by technically playing or ~performing a score, in place of a person, yet
able to do more than a person and at greater speed/accuracy if developed
this way, while lacking in other parameters, like being a human, relations
with others in the band on an intuitive level, (beyond those designed for
intercommunication and control). for instance, if built-out of specs
allowed it, perhaps such a drummer could keep up with "speed metal" genre
drumming, who knows- maybe even puffs of smoke could emit from eyes and
elbows, flames from ears, to bring in extra effects layers to bring the
point home of what is going on- the superman as robotic emulation that
surpasses functionality in a limited technical domain - minus actual
awareness, musical ability, beyond repeating code if mimicry, though
perhaps with AI, its own sensibility could develop, though as music it may
remain ungrounded beyond its being about matched patterning, or so it seems
highly likely that a gap exists between generating music off a midi-score
as interpretation and someone having insight about what a song means or is
about- though perhaps music is not this today or does not extend that
principle into its technologicalization, where technique replaces it, thus
the format, the hit song as pattern, remade over and over and over, played
over and over, that level of mindwashing and brainwashing of media,
commercials having more insight and truth than many songs in their at least
attaining authenticity, honesty in communication than other more
manipulative or hidden-profit behind fashion trends agenda of cult
engineering, this multimedia spanning all of consumption, from ego to
attitude to clothes to drugs to status to in-group out-group, as if
everything is mediated as if a school hallway scene, that level of
adolescence mainstreamed with geriatrics continuing the illusion,
ultrahipcool

(this is to critique music as marketing, as if a style that can be 'canned'
into formatting that then contains its essential quality or value (truth)
versus more superficial aspects of this that can involve mimicry or
repetition of previous patterns, language as music, or music notation as if
music itself, the code referencing itself for its validation and not
connected or external truth, which then can become ungrounded from culture
it supposed represents/describes. in this way it may not exist as general
'shared consciousness' as believed, even while marketed and profiting this
way, an engine of success or business model, versus of aesthetic truth that
communicates beyond these boundaries, into another realm of awareness,
understanding, perhaps involving musical communication between individuals
as a basis for computation or establishing social relations, a level of
shared awareness based on music as foundation for literacy in its
interdisciplinary depth)

the gap is what, then. where. how. who (cannot ask that question). why.
(probably not that either). the situation or context is... about a shift in
culture, values, perception, including loss of awareness and understanding,
governance, replaced by technical approaches, managers of other principles,
developed into a remotely administrated and controlled framework. music.
instruments. media. relations. skills. truth. consciousness. bound into
this, held back by it, captured and contained with it. detached from self,
group, and higher aesthetic functioning

so in a pre-electric context, 'drums' once used for communication and
signaling then evolve into a drum set, from marching band carrying around a
bass drum and others snares, to putting these on the floor in a given
arrangement and going at it within other parameters, that level of change
and new consideration- big band era, then moving into mics and mixers and
amplification-- and with electronics, presumably, the first drum machines,
not unlike a lot of repetition-based rhythmic processes that could be
programmed, yet with sound versus say telephone multiplexing via routers,
etc. sound engineering and music production then having overlaps, a large
electronics hobbyist dimension becoming an electronics industry in music
via all the electronic gear, do-dads, extras, that help establish or create
a given sound or noise, a signature, seemingly everything believed
justified the resulting 'end products', or not. in that 'shaping a unique
sound' may be at the expense or cost of retaining or accessing or
developing music principles within instruments themselves, that
functionality lost. instead turning to presets, of which add-ons then allow
to be further tweaked, 'refined' as a 'unique signal', though not
necessarily dealing with its production or possibilities prior to the
condition of notation, as language, within those de/con-fined parameters
and frameworks.

(so everything is really special, though not necessarily meaningful as
music, though as private communication that is capable of being modified to
n-degrees, that is an effect for that, and a chain of them will be your own
special sauce, as long as not sharing the electronics secrets though in
these days, logfile and receipt snooping, someone will be able to piece it
together and soon enough another clone of the sound will arrive out of
central music formatting inc, and replace efforts with a chart-topping
hypnotic hit, to selling fries at baseball games next. talk about the
patriotrism, worksong. talk about the commercialism, musical careers today,
infected by the celebrity worm as a basis for cultural communication within
these parameters then also framing questions of music, feedback only in
certain institutional views deemed ok to support the charade of one-way
authority over this process, keeping questioning at bay)

then things hit the wall. no progress beyond a certain point in music
instruments in this 'new and improved' electronics context. like everything
has been stuck in the 80s with equipment, excepting that of
midi-controllers which makes the computer into the instrument, and music
into a question of excel-like parameterization, and HTML-webpaged, canned
production via tools and endless varieties of hot-swap software circuits,
emulating plugboards & everything

thus, the disemboweling of piano into keyboard controller that requires a
computer to work as a sound-device, that can then be mapped to organ,
synth, piano, or other sampled sounds. and somehow, via MIDI, the keyboard
becomes the centerpiece and limit to further MIDI considerations, such that
the piano-roll defines music in terms of its notation (sign=3Dsign) and doe=
s
not question possibilities or concepts of music beyond those so far
technologized, such that dials, buttons, and switches, then map out this
quasi-instrument as 'reading/writing' tool yet only in a very limited
dictionary and with highly biased, warped selections to choose from and
within that finite realm-- all music is allowed, yet nothing outside of its
model is possible to explore. such that, sure you can play along to a
preprogrammed hip-hop pattern, yet it is not possible to split a note
geometrically, or move things in space-time, or program music in its code
outside its being a representation - tape-recorder playback of given
filtered action, in a linear, one-way, authority-based approach all based
on a narrow approach to time, this embalmed in the MIDI spec, basically
killing off potential for music in an electronic domain by turning it into
a technical question with a given response, rationalization, set of
choices; the question of music is absent in these tools, they are designed
instead to produce copies of what already exists within parameters that
already exist, that is the specific raison d'=C3=AAtre

the electronic drums and drumset being two different things, the ecosystem
never uniting beyond the parts, then moves into a computer-based context of
desktop controllers where people can play drums with their thumbs to 'set
down beats' with little capacity beyond this same level of dexterity in
terms of what it involves as a question of drumming, beyond say input via
tapping on a desk to get a beat, than say communicating larger longer ideas
than what fits into a given set of software fields for MIDI rhythms, the
foundation of the music. drums are more than this. though in a digital
audio workstation (DAW) context, sometimes not more than an arbitrary
string needed to generate others that are output as new songs, song as
information, information as communication. and perhaps that is all okay,
necessary even in terms of the situation, yet music involves vastly more
than this in terms of questions and shared cultural communication. though
it seems to have been made trivial, as if only a technical exercise, and
equated with meaning and skillls that go far beyond this and ground in a
larger framework or knowledge that potentially even some of these tools do
not allow

it is not to suggest taking away the freedom to explore music in varieties
of ways, instead it is to question the depth or shallowness of this
exploration as a standardized, normalized, and mainstreamed as music
produced and received as culture, dumbing-down awareness and then accepting
culture at a lower level than is necessary to relate within, socially,
mentally, emotionally. unless everyone is in a crib playing with shiny toys
and rattles, making noise, and that is the shared condition (perhaps
requiring being drugged out of your mind to not be bothered by it,
especially in terms of aesthetics and lack of insight, the din of 'music
noise'()

so this realm completely fascinates me, there is total potential to turn
this situation around via another conceptual approach, a paradigm that
meets the electromagnetic situation and reframes music within a more
accurate nonlinear/multilinear context, getting outside this narrow false
absolutist view from classical ideology and music training, its
institutionalization and into new parameters and functionality that opens
up the instruments for music literacy, understanding, development of
skills, interaction, relations, based on music as a shared practice tied
into with literacy, social development, awareness, technological advance
and refinement, and at its core, about aesthetics, thinking and ideas,
truth accessed and involved

for instance, take the robot drummer situation. compared to the Def Leppard
drummer who lost a limb in an accident and continued to drum one-handed,
via technological assistance. a similar condition exists with juggling,
where some believe that you need to juggle more balls than your hands to be
juggling, thus 2 hands require at least 3 balls to be 'juggling', and yet
it also is implied that less than 3-balls is not juggling, when anyone who
learns to juggle quickly realizes the steps it takes to get there involves
being able to juggle two balls with one hand, that this is a core skill
(and adept jugglers can juggle three balls if not more balls in one hand)

It is this kind of false limit that may keep people away from juggling
because not everyone is at the highest skill level or will achieve that
virtuosity yet could still benefit from juggling at a lower level as a
learning practice. and if someone only has one-hand, it could be legitimate
juggling to juggle 2 balls and is in essence the same as juggling with two
hands and three balls in that certain principles are involved and shaped
and can be explored in those parameters, such as movement, speed, height,
and so on. including with those two-handed, that learning to juggle
one-handed in each hand is a core skill and necessary to be effective at
juggling, as this ambidextrous condition is what is a challenge, mirroring
of various patterns in different directions, thus starting with one-side or
the other, as this effects brain processing, as if the pendulum is involved
or something that connects both hemispheres of the brain as the side that
is preferenced then moves into new relation with the other side,
neutralizing out bias given the amount of practice, developing new nerve
connections, brain cells, this changes memory circuits, functionality,
coordination, thinking or possibility, even, opening up options instead of
accepting given limits, and learning step by step how to go about this

drum sticks are very much like this, one hand biased and learning to use
both, coordinate, and explore basic patterns, from the most basic, single
tap here, single tap there, to multiple tap sequences then mirrored across
to the other side, as with changing direction in juggling a given pattern,
reversing it, so too, using drumsticks to tap out rhythmic structures in
reverse using opposite hands, and learning from this as a skill, process,
many dimensions involved

so the big failure of 'the drummer' in the intro article is that they
cannot keep up with the MIDI score, and a better clock is needed or
metronome so others can play in sync together 'as a band', thus the
computer solves the technical problem. the drummer as instrument not good
enough, supposedly, in a high-tech context. what is needed instead is a
Shiva-like multiarmed character with insane speed and processing ability,
then the band would look good while the drummer flails and generates smoke
and heat.

the thing is- as with early photography studies by Muybridge of horse hoofs
on the ground- the time-lapse of a drummer is indeed this multi-armed
epiphany doing what to most is physically and mentally impossible to
coherently understanding in real-time, even if it is dissected, because the
issues of dexterity and awareness may be so beyond what most people are
capable of, that it is really a unique skillset and capacity to be able to
take this functioning on at a higher level, requires special skill or
talent or dedication to attain that performability,

and yet, slowed down, it can also be more manageable for others at a
different skill level or way of playing that does not just rely on speed or
given styles of playing. drums are not just a particular sound, style,
genre, or format, it could be opened up to more than is questioned today in
terms of the instrument - in that instead of emulating and rationalizing a
style or particular approach to drumming, it could be requestioned based on
more knowledge than an extended linear progression of a given trajectory
allow - such that separation of drum machine from electronic drum set may
not be structural, only a choice, and likewise others

so in a non-profane context of serious issues with the way equipment is and
its technical limitations, consider the sculpture of Shiva in terms of its
capturing this increased capacity that is some inherent limit in the given
technical approach for ~electronic drumming...

Multi statue arm=C3=A9e en Tha=C3=AFlande
http://fr.123rf.com/photo_11044455_multi-statue-armee-en-thailande.html

so consider again the issue of time. if this was a many-instanced view,
most drummers would have a sequence very much of this many-armed approach.
though if a score is sped up so fast, at some point only a multiarmed robot
or a superfast two armed robot could feasibly drum at a certain pace,
beyond human capacity, due to time, energy, ability to process information.

it is perhaps a classic case of multitasking though within a group-subgroup
dynamic of (drumset (drums)) where a certain limit is approached to what
can be performed in terms of given parameters of functioning.

not sure if it is evident yet, though this is a condition also existing in
computing, whereby there are large gaps between tasks that have no larger
relation to one another beyond certain limits or parameters, incompatible
or unintegrated software or frameworks or approaches, thus atomizing
everything into a separate domain or task or chore, and thus losing
efficiency, whereby 'speed' is the ability to coordinate in that framework,
keep it coherent, and get things done simultaneously, not unlike banging
out a sequence on drums

where is this going? there is a physical and mental limit to what can be
done and it can be reached and then hold back functioning, as a barrier,
yet also people can be judged against what is an institutionalized
inefficiency or false constraint, due to design, that forces these
dynamics, which can then turn against efforts, such as making 'work' less
productive, etc, even when home computing was sold as an efficiency device,
to make things easier when instead it becomes more and more time-wasting
chores and routines, upkeep, hassle, etc as if an ulterior motive designed
in from the start, its dysfunction programming and formatting user
dysfunction. in this way, the problem with tools shaping the user via
negative influence, the dynamics set up in a devolutionary or regressive
way, via detached, ungrounded, unreal, or otherwise inferior approaches
that then become standardized, the norm to follow, etc

so this is about time, about tools and technologies in a context that are
interacted with, communication, and about intent or symbiosis between a
person and technology, perhaps bridging into a larger organization of
others and other technology (playback, etc)

the electronic metronome is basically the keystone to electronic drumming
in a band in so far as it relates to music notation, a style of playing,
the shared 'music score' as code & program. that a person would have to
play so fast to keep in sequence is akin to GHz and CPUs, as this relates
to design parameters, is it really better or a design approach leading to
other values.

though the central idea is that timing and drums are structuralized in the
framework of a band and a drummer performs an advanced metronome function
within the band, that today for some a machine can replace and extend into
other functionality that may or may not be manageable by or with a drummer
at the helm. in place of a drummer, some have a PC with software tracks,
hooked into mixer, controlling drums via software interface. others have
drummers with triggering of additional samples or patterns, to allow this
information management via sticks hitting trigger/sensors in the drum kit,
to activate a given sound or sample or recorded playback.

so the upper limit appears to be- a physical entity aka drummer cannot
feasibly play this or play it as needed , thus some electronics equipment
or tools will do it, and perhaps there is no need for a drummer in the
band, they are not fast enough or cannot manage the sounds, (perhaps even
there is irregular timing or something, cued other than by drums, etc).

so here is a bit of clarity on this situation: no where does it say there
has to be only one approach or direction with 'time' in music, and yet it
is a forced perspective that has now become the structure for all
electronic music instruments, in a one-way flow of time that moves into
'speed' as a view of increased or advanced processing. as if linear flow is
all of it.

music has no perspective, no dimensionality, it is a flattened realm of
inquiry stuck within an 16-18th century notion of space-time that is
pre-Einstein, perhaps pre-Copernican even, as if everyone needbe sitting at
the feet of Beethoven then evolving to churn out rap songs next in endless
strings of concatenation of themes, structures, values, as if 'composers of
reality', eventually by way of merely saying or singing language to various
melodies and tunes, as if music and song is definable in fixed parameters
endlessly extendable, never stale, rotting and the ruins of culture,
festering and stank in its role and importance, loss of connection with
truth beyond finite beliefs shared in-group, scaled to consumerist ubiquity
& for sale

why could there not be 'many clocks' at once, perhaps moving in different
directions within a drum set. in an acoustic context this is not possible.
in an electronic drum set it is possible yet not able to be explored given
the way things are designed and structured for emulation and extension of
previous styles. the depth of music buried under an emptiness of its value
and insight by a genre past its time, yet repeated endlessly on the radio
and online as if eternal, vs. cultural tyranny of noise that seeks to mask
out other views, stand in as if 'the standard' when instead this is
conceit, based on power politics, control over media, enforced authority
and forced perspective, that somehow everyone holds certain musical truth
in common, as if aesthetics and shared awareness can be engineered for and
scaled to populations via expert propaganda of repeat iconic performance,
tv-specials, awards, superbowl halftime shows

i have several ideas about a new approach to electronic drums as an
ecosystem of various components, including mixer, looper, sequencer,
sampler, metronome, and drums combined into a single instrument interface.
much like a web server that spans another virtual machine or process, to
manage or access another dimension, so too, why not allow a drummer to have
'multiple arms' via the tools themselves, by allowing a drum machine to
capture patterns that the drummer plays, set them up as a loop in
real-time, and then add and subtract and shape this information while it is
live within the equipment. many clocks, different directions for the sound,
starting one pattern in certain instruments and send it in a given
direction and then another with different sounds in another direction, and
let them go on their way while playing yet another sound, different
rhythms, within this layered context. hell, who needs a band, even, if you
have such a drum set. this is more like drumming as programming though in
haptic or even neuro-feedback or voice-control interface, prototype for
future computing even in its communicative function, if considering
performance could be over the network and thus local and remote via HDTV
connections. so shared work model in teleconferencing into music, new MIDI
standards allowing multiple times, though far more is involved than can be
sketched here in these parameters.

the larger point of it is that even though it is not allowed, 'the music'
of drumming exists in a context beyond the way the equipment is now
designed, yet could be reconsidered, once again questioned for what is
going on in musicological terms, the substance of instruments, and then
open up these parameters for music to breath within versus be stifled by
lack of ability to do anything other than playing as fast as possible as
the innovation path available, versus multilinear and ecosystem and other
dynamics that could also be possible, if these situations would be
evaluated in their truth, versus just as profit for the automated machine
and music-production ideology that formats these tools as formulaic,
calculator-like devices that produce endless strings of self-same limited
parameter computations over and over, as if equated with heightened
awareness and grounding of culture by mere communication.

in other words, maybe virtuosity of expertise in a given instrument is not
the aim or goal and instead literacy of music via instruments and as a way
of forming and shaping awareness and consciousness and forming a basis for
shared communication at a greater depth than existing culture allows though
has historically been achieved and held with great reverence, in that music
forms the centre of shared experience, brings many together in one relation
and that instruments can do likewise.

(in this regard, some of my ideas include people being the performance
themselves, musicians as networks of multiple timed looping patterns and
interacting as ecosystem, being able to move through music at any point or
path as with software models thus the song is interpretable, non-repeatable
even, an environment that is navigated, this could include performance,
headphones allowing positioning or moving around acoustic space, etc.
software tools anyone can use to learn musical principles. musicological
instruments that redevelop existing types along more fundamental musical
structures and principles, such that music instruments are reading/writing
instruments, gaining that level of interaction and ability to communicate
beyond existing notation parameters that deter such developments)

a drumset that is grounded in its electromagnetic context and can access
the truth of this condition in that parameters of music allow it to be
tapped into, explored, understood, and experimented with, then potentially
relates to a next-level of computation of the sensor-based environment
requiring orchestration from within chaos, into order, via looped patterns
of tasks and routines of separate elements (whether tom-tom, sequencer,
metronome, or pantry, computer, e-ink wall display). the larger dynamics
involve similar principles, how to manage multilinear flows of information,
shape them, program them, secure functioning while existing or starting in
another framework. how to make the transition, what is the conflict in
ideas or ideology, what if the difference in values, in control,
management, authority, is truth driving the process or its representation
that can be warped, subverted, and what if what today does not work
together at all instead could be naturally, organically cohesive as an
ecosystem, harmonious, due to recognizing shared principles, functionality,
parameters and functionality that are symbiotic, and provide feedback in
shared frameworks that benefit the whole infrastructure which is scalable,
because it is based upon shared truth

this truth of music is truth of life, truth of culture, truth of people,
truth of society, that is the value that has been replaced by another set
of principles moving in an inhuman direction that then holds people against
its values as if inferior when it is the opposite- these tools need to
serve people, not the other way around. they should free the imagination
and open-up options, not deny or break these connections to maintain some
other agenda or priority;

and yet music like everything else has become trapped in this realm of
falsity, held captive to mimicry and substitution of a false-view, seldom
do i hear music of my own nature anymore

and thus these words about future instrument design, what is needed, within
these ruins of civilization and its- our- lost culture

[q] Drum: It is an instrument frequently used in rites and rituals; its
rhythmical sound is sometimes (e.g., in Buddhism) equated with the hidden
sounds and powers of the cosmos. Often (e.g., among black African peoples)
the drum served magically to call down heavenly powers; the war drum in
particular was closely associated with the symbolism of LIGHTNING and
THUNDER. -- In China the sound of the drum was related to the course of the
SUN and especially to the winter solstice (i.e., that point when the yin
principle exerts its greatest influence but also when the sun, and hence
the yang principle, begins to increase its influence again). See YIN AND
YANG. -- The drum is the symbolic heart of the universe for Native
Americans. [/q]  --- The Herder Dictionary of Symbols, p.62

DRUM  A symbol of primordial sound, and a vehicle for the word, for
tradition and for magic (60). With the aid of drums, shamans can induce a
state of ecstasy. It is not only the rhythm and the timbre which are
important in the symbolism of the primitive drum, but, since it is made of
wood of 'the Tree of the World', the mystic sense of the latter also
adheres to it (18). According to Schneider, the drum is, of all musical
instruments, the most pregnant with mystic ideas. In Africa, it is
associated with the heart. In the most primitive cultures, as in the most
advanced, it is equated with the sacrificial altar and hence it acts as a
mediator between heaven and earth. However, given its bowl-shape and its
skin, it corresponds more properly to the symbolism of the Element of
earth. A secondary meaning turns upon the shape of the instrument, and it
should be noted that it is in this respect that there is most variation in
significance. The three essential shapes are: the drum in the form of an
hour-glass, symbolizing Inversion and the 'relationship between the two
worlds' (the Upper and Lower) ; the round drum, as an image of the world,
and the barrel-shaped, associated with thunder and lightning (50). [/q]

s arrived, metal drumming standards entered the realm of the physically imp=
ossible. [/q]<br>

<br>/* so i read the above article and it reminded me of some issues perhap=
s correlatable with computing today.... i have thought about this a lot aft=
er taking up electronic drums for music therapy, learning via self-study, t=
o benefit from the rewiring of circuits and coordination, etc. very much li=
ke juggling actually, these two realms combining, and also extending into p=
rocessing concepts in terms of looping and sequencing of patterns.<br>

<br>first, there is so much going on that shares a fundamental limit with h=
ow music is conceived of and limited to an outdated paradigm based on perce=
ptual awareness, that the framework of ordinary approaches normally assumes=
 an absolute frame of one-way movement in time of a coordinated group led b=
y a conductor, and this is how music is processed, organized, how songs are=
 defined, relations, instruments designed, etc. like a rationalization in a=
 given view that then may not allow other dynamics in that controlled domai=
n, even, if not due to heresy<br>

<br>what this leads to is a technical approach, to refinement, where virtuo=
sity is tied to speed and dexterity and memory, repeating over and over old=
er code performances as flawless as possible, within a range of interpretat=
ion though in=C2=A0 a finite or contained or bounded way. this extended int=
o radio, recordings or copies of originals, and mp3s, copies of copies, the=
n carrying on this ~music or sound-information or patterning, people traini=
ng to repeat play the code via lifelong training of authority-based instruc=
tion, yet the ideas and concepts fixed in a narrow range of thinking, as if=
 music itself has become its own notation. music as signage. the language o=
f music overtaking the music of music, as its truth. rote performance in a =
sense.<br>

<br>so the assumption arrives at a song if successful, plays eternally, via=
 endless concerts and furtherance by others repeating the code. instead of,=
 perhaps a song only exists in its truth once, in a singular instance, and =
then it is another song, and cannot be recaptured the same. also: that ther=
e are experts or musicians, education needed to play complicated instrument=
s whose interfaces are cryptic to the uninitiated if not musicians themselv=
es, by technical design or engineers who make equipment, yet the _musicolog=
ical questions have been removed from these same instruments, in their furt=
her development in an electronics-based context, especially with computing,=
 where now instruments ship buggy and broken, designed to fail, and with ar=
tificial limits or constraints that prevent anything beyond existing bounds=
 from being explored, to control and shape parameters that feed into existi=
ng industry automation, as if new music is another can of soup on assemblyl=
ine, volunteered or subsidized, paid for<br>

<br>the ideal technical performer, to which technology itself aspires, is t=
he robot musician who can function at speeds and with memory and dexterity =
and coordination humans cannot, and yet in this substitution or equivalence=
, the truth of music as more than repeated patterns is lost to a reductioni=

, who knows- maybe even puffs of smoke could emit from eyes and elbows, fla=

what is going on- the superman as robotic emulation that surpasses function=
ality in a limited technical domain - minus actual awareness, musical abili=
ty, beyond repeating code if mimicry, though perhaps with AI, its own sensi=

having insight about what a song means or is about- though perhaps music is=
 not this today or does not extend that principle into its technologicaliza=

rom ego to attitude to clothes to drugs to status to in-group out-group, as=
 if everything is mediated as if a school hallway scene, that level of adol=
escence mainstreamed with geriatrics continuing the illusion, ultrahipcool<=
br>

<br>(this is to critique music as marketing, as if a style that can be &#39=
;canned&#39; into formatting that then contains its essential quality or va=
lue (truth) versus more superficial aspects of this that can involve mimicr=
y or repetition of previous patterns, language as music, or music notation =
as if music itself, the code referencing itself for its validation and not =

it supposed represents/describes. in this way it may not exist as general &=
#39;shared consciousness&#39; as believed, even while marketed and profitin=
g this way, an engine of success or business model, versus of aesthetic tru=
th that communicates beyond these boundaries, into another realm of awarene=
ss, understanding, perhaps involving musical communication between individu=
als as a basis for computation or establishing social relations, a level of=
 shared awareness based on music as foundation for literacy in its interdis=
ciplinary depth)<br>

<br>the gap is what, then. where. how. who (cannot ask that question). why.=
 (probably not that either). the situation or context is... about a shift i=
n culture, values, perception, including loss of awareness and understandin=
g, governance, replaced by technical approaches, managers of other principl=
es, developed into a remotely administrated and controlled framework. music=
. instruments. media. relations. skills. truth. consciousness. bound into t=
his, held back by it, captured and contained with it. detached from self, g=
roup, and higher aesthetic functioning<br>

<br>so in a pre-electric context, &#39;drums&#39; once used for communicati=
on and signaling then evolve into a drum set, from marching band carrying a=
round a bass drum and others snares, to putting these on the floor in a giv=
en arrangement and going at it within other parameters, that level of chang=
e and new consideration- big band era, then moving into mics and mixers and=
 amplification-- and with electronics, presumably, the first drum machines,=
 not unlike a lot of repetition-based rhythmic processes that could be prog=
rammed, yet with sound versus say telephone multiplexing via routers, etc. =
sound engineering and music production then having overlaps, a large electr=
onics hobbyist dimension becoming an electronics industry in music via all =
the electronic gear, do-dads, extras, that help establish or create a given=
 sound or noise, a signature, seemingly everything believed justified the r=
esulting &#39;end products&#39;, or not. in that &#39;shaping a unique soun=
d&#39; may be at the expense or cost of retaining or accessing or developin=
g music principles within instruments themselves, that functionality lost. =
instead turning to presets, of which add-ons then allow to be further tweak=
ed, &#39;refined&#39; as a &#39;unique signal&#39;, though not necessarily =
dealing with its production or possibilities prior to the condition of nota=
tion, as language, within those de/con-fined parameters and frameworks.<br>

<br>(so everything is really special, though not necessarily meaningful as =
music, though as private communication that is capable of being modified to=
 n-degrees, that is an effect for that, and a chain of them will be your ow=
n special sauce, as long as not sharing the electronics secrets though in t=

ters then also framing questions of music, feedback only in certain institu=
tional views deemed ok to support the charade of one-way authority over thi=
s process, keeping questioning at bay)<br>

<br>then things hit the wall. no progress beyond a certain point in music i=
nstruments in this &#39;new and improved&#39; electronics context. like eve=
rything has been stuck in the 80s with equipment, excepting that of midi-co=
ntrollers which makes the computer into the instrument, and music into a qu=
estion of excel-like parameterization, and HTML-webpaged, canned production=
 via tools and endless varieties of hot-swap software circuits, emulating p=
lugboards &amp; everything<br>

<br>thus, the disemboweling of piano into keyboard controller that requires=
 a computer to work as a sound-device, that can then be mapped to organ, sy=
nth, piano, or other sampled sounds. and somehow, via MIDI, the keyboard be=
comes the centerpiece and limit to further MIDI considerations, such that t=
he piano-roll defines music in terms of its notation (sign=3Dsign) and does=
 not question possibilities or concepts of music beyond those so far techno=
logized, such that dials, buttons, and switches, then map out this quasi-in=
strument as &#39;reading/writing&#39; tool yet only in a very limited dicti=
onary and with highly biased, warped selections to choose from and within t=
hat finite realm-- all music is allowed, yet nothing outside of its model i=
s possible to explore. such that, sure you can play along to a preprogramme=
d hip-hop pattern, yet it is not possible to split a note geometrically, or=
 move things in space-time, or program music in its code outside its being =
a representation - tape-recorder playback of given filtered action, in a li=
near, one-way, authority-based approach all based on a narrow approach to t=
ime, this embalmed in the MIDI spec, basically killing off potential for mu=
sic in an electronic domain by turning it into a technical question with a =
given response, rationalization, set of choices; the question of music is a=
bsent in these tools, they are designed instead to produce copies of what a=
lready exists within parameters that already exist, that is the specific ra=
ison d&#39;=C3=AAtre<br>

<br>the electronic drums and drumset being two different things, the ecosys=
tem never uniting beyond the parts, then moves into a computer-based contex=
t of desktop controllers where people can play drums with their thumbs to &=
#39;set down beats&#39; with little capacity beyond this same level of dext=
erity in terms of what it involves as a question of drumming, beyond say in=
put via tapping on a desk to get a beat, than say communicating larger long=
er ideas than what fits into a given set of software fields for MIDI rhythm=
s, the foundation of the music. drums are more than this. though in a digit=
al audio workstation (DAW) context, sometimes not more than an arbitrary st=
ring needed to generate others that are output as new songs, song as inform=
ation, information as communication. and perhaps that is all okay, necessar=
y even in terms of the situation, yet music involves vastly more than this =
in terms of questions and shared cultural communication. though it seems to=
 have been made trivial, as if only a technical exercise, and equated with =
meaning and skillls that go far beyond this and ground in a larger framewor=
k or knowledge that potentially even some of these tools do not allow<br>

<br>it is not to suggest taking away the freedom to explore music in variet=
ies of ways, instead it is to question the depth or shallowness of this exp=
loration as a standardized, normalized, and mainstreamed as music produced =
and received as culture, dumbing-down awareness and then accepting culture =
at a lower level than is necessary to relate within, socially, mentally, em=
otionally. unless everyone is in a crib playing with shiny toys and rattles=
, making noise, and that is the shared condition (perhaps requiring being d=
rugged out of your mind to not be bothered by it, especially in terms of ae=
sthetics and lack of insight, the din of &#39;music noise&#39;()<br>

<br>so this realm completely fascinates me, there is total potential to tur=
n this situation around via another conceptual approach, a paradigm that me=
ets the electromagnetic situation and reframes music within a more accurate=
 nonlinear/multilinear context, getting outside this narrow false absolutis=
t view from classical ideology and music training, its institutionalization=
 and into new parameters and functionality that opens up the instruments fo=
r music literacy, understanding, development of skills, interaction, relati=
ons, based on music as a shared practice tied into with literacy, social de=
velopment, awareness, technological advance and refinement, and at its core=
, about aesthetics, thinking and ideas, truth accessed and involved<br>

<br>for instance, take the robot drummer situation. compared to the Def Lep=
pard drummer who lost a limb in an accident and continued to drum one-hande=
d, via technological assistance. a similar condition exists with juggling, =
where some believe that you need to juggle more balls than your hands to be=
 juggling, thus 2 hands require at least 3 balls to be &#39;juggling&#39;, =
and yet it also is implied that less than 3-balls is not juggling, when any=
one who learns to juggle quickly realizes the steps it takes to get there i=
nvolves being able to juggle two balls with one hand, that this is a core s=
kill (and adept jugglers can juggle three balls if not more balls in one ha=
nd)<br>

<br>It is this kind of false limit that may keep people away from juggling =
because not everyone is at the highest skill level or will achieve that vir=
tuosity yet could still benefit from juggling at a lower level as a learnin=
g practice. and if someone only has one-hand, it could be legitimate juggli=
ng to juggle 2 balls and is in essence the same as juggling with two hands =
and three balls in that certain principles are involved and shaped and can =
be explored in those parameters, such as movement, speed, height, and so on=
. including with those two-handed, that learning to juggle one-handed in ea=
ch hand is a core skill and necessary to be effective at juggling, as this =
ambidextrous condition is what is a challenge, mirroring of various pattern=
s in different directions, thus starting with one-side or the other, as thi=
s effects brain processing, as if the pendulum is involved or something tha=
t connects both hemispheres of the brain as the side that is preferenced th=
en moves into new relation with the other side, neutralizing out bias given=
 the amount of practice, developing new nerve connections, brain cells, thi=
s changes memory circuits, functionality, coordination, thinking or possibi=
lity, even, opening up options instead of accepting given limits, and learn=
ing step by step how to go about this<br>

<br>drum sticks are very much like this, one hand biased and learning to us=
e both, coordinate, and explore basic patterns, from the most basic, single=
 tap here, single tap there, to multiple tap sequences then mirrored across=
 to the other side, as with changing direction in juggling a given pattern,=
 reversing it, so too, using drumsticks to tap out rhythmic structures in r=
everse using opposite hands, and learning from this as a skill, process, ma=
ny dimensions involved<br>

<br>so the big failure of &#39;the drummer&#39; in the intro article is tha=
t they cannot keep up with the MIDI score, and a better clock is needed or =
metronome so others can play in sync together &#39;as a band&#39;, thus the=
 computer solves the technical problem. the drummer as instrument not good =
enough, supposedly, in a high-tech context. what is needed instead is a Shi=
va-like multiarmed character with insane speed and processing ability, then=
 the band would look good while the drummer flails and generates smoke and =
heat.<br>

<br>the thing is- as with early photography studies by Muybridge of horse h=
oofs on the ground- the time-lapse of a drummer is indeed this multi-armed =
epiphany doing what to most is physically and mentally impossible to cohere=
ntly understanding in real-time, even if it is dissected, because the issue=
s of dexterity and awareness may be so beyond what most people are capable =
of, that it is really a unique skillset and capacity to be able to take thi=
s functioning on at a higher level, requires special skill or talent or ded=
ication to attain that performability, <br>

<br>and yet, slowed down, it can also be more manageable for others at a di=
fferent skill level or way of playing that does not just rely on speed or g=
iven styles of playing. drums are not just a particular sound, style, genre=
, or format, it could be opened up to more than is questioned today in term=
s of the instrument - in that instead of emulating and rationalizing a styl=
e or particular approach to drumming, it could be requestioned based on mor=
e knowledge than an extended linear progression of a given trajectory allow=
 - such that separation of drum machine from electronic drum set may not be=
 structural, only a choice, and likewise others<br>

<br>so in a non-profane context of serious issues with the way equipment is=
 and its technical limitations, consider the sculpture of Shiva in terms of=
 its capturing this increased capacity that is some inherent limit in the g=
iven technical approach for ~electronic drumming...<br>

so consider again the issue of time. if this was a many-instanced view, mos=
t drummers would have a sequence very much of this many-armed approach. tho=
ugh if a score is sped up so fast, at some point only a multiarmed robot or=
 a superfast two armed robot could feasibly drum at a certain pace, beyond =
human capacity, due to time, energy, ability to process information.<br>

<br>it is perhaps a classic case of multitasking though within a group-subg=
roup dynamic of (drumset (drums)) where a certain limit is approached to wh=
at can be performed in terms of given parameters of functioning.<br><br>

<br>not sure if it is evident yet, though this is a condition also existing=
 in computing, whereby there are large gaps between tasks that have no larg=
er relation to one another beyond certain limits or parameters, incompatibl=
e or unintegrated software or frameworks or approaches, thus atomizing ever=
ything into a separate domain or task or chore, and thus losing efficiency,=
 whereby &#39;speed&#39; is the ability to coordinate in that framework, ke=
ep it coherent, and get things done simultaneously, not unlike banging out =
a sequence on drums<br>

<br>where is this going? there is a physical and mental limit to what can b=
e done and it can be reached and then hold back functioning, as a barrier, =
yet also people can be judged against what is an institutionalized ineffici=
ency or false constraint, due to design, that forces these dynamics, which =
can then turn against efforts, such as making &#39;work&#39; less productiv=
e, etc, even when home computing was sold as an efficiency device, to make =
things easier when instead it becomes more and more time-wasting chores and=
 routines, upkeep, hassle, etc as if an ulterior motive designed in from th=
e start, its dysfunction programming and formatting user dysfunction. in th=
is way, the problem with tools shaping the user via negative influence, the=
 dynamics set up in a devolutionary or regressive way, via detached, ungrou=
nded, unreal, or otherwise inferior approaches that then become standardize=
d, the norm to follow, etc<br>

<br>so this is about time, about tools and technologies in a context that a=
re interacted with, communication, and about intent or symbiosis between a =
person and technology, perhaps bridging into a larger organization of other=
s and other technology (playback, etc)<br>

<br>the electronic metronome is basically the keystone to electronic drummi=
ng in a band in so far as it relates to music notation, a style of playing,=
 the shared &#39;music score&#39; as code &amp; program. that a person woul=
d have to play so fast to keep in sequence is akin to GHz and CPUs, as this=
 relates to design parameters, is it really better or a design approach lea=
ding to other values. <br>

<br>though the central idea is that timing and drums are structuralized in =
the framework of a band and a drummer performs an advanced metronome functi=
on within the band, that today for some a machine can replace and extend in=
to other functionality that may or may not be manageable by or with a drumm=
er at the helm. in place of a drummer, some have a PC with software tracks,=
 hooked into mixer, controlling drums via software interface. others have d=
rummers with triggering of additional samples or patterns, to allow this in=
formation management via sticks hitting trigger/sensors in the drum kit, to=
 activate a given sound or sample or recorded playback.<br>

<br>so the upper limit appears to be- a physical entity aka drummer cannot =
feasibly play this or play it as needed , thus some electronics equipment o=
r tools will do it, and perhaps there is no need for a drummer in the band,=
 they are not fast enough or cannot manage the sounds, (perhaps even there =
is irregular timing or something, cued other than by drums, etc).<br>

<br>so here is a bit of clarity on this situation: no where does it say the=
re has to be only one approach or direction with &#39;time&#39; in music, a=
nd yet it is a forced perspective that has now become the structure for all=
 electronic music instruments, in a one-way flow of time that moves into &#=
39;speed&#39; as a view of increased or advanced processing. as if linear f=
low is all of it.<br>

<br>music has no perspective, no dimensionality, it is a flattened realm of=
 inquiry stuck within an 16-18th century notion of space-time that is pre-E=
instein, perhaps pre-Copernican even, as if everyone needbe sitting at the =
feet of Beethoven then evolving to churn out rap songs next in endless stri=
ngs of concatenation of themes, structures, values, as if &#39;composers of=
 reality&#39;, eventually by way of merely saying or singing language to va=
rious melodies and tunes, as if music and song is definable in fixed parame=
ters endlessly extendable, never stale, rotting and the ruins of culture, f=
estering and stank in its role and importance, loss of connection with trut=
h beyond finite beliefs shared in-group, scaled to consumerist ubiquity &am=
p; for sale<br>

<br>why could there not be &#39;many clocks&#39; at once, perhaps moving in=
 different directions within a drum set. in an acoustic context this is not=
 possible. in an electronic drum set it is possible yet not able to be expl=
ored given the way things are designed and structured for emulation and ext=
ension of previous styles. the depth of music buried under an emptiness of =
its value and insight by a genre past its time, yet repeated endlessly on t=
he radio and online as if eternal, vs. cultural tyranny of noise that seeks=
 to mask out other views, stand in as if &#39;the standard&#39; when instea=
d this is conceit, based on power politics, control over media, enforced au=
thority and forced perspective, that somehow everyone holds certain musical=
 truth in common, as if aesthetics and shared awareness can be engineered f=
or and scaled to populations via expert propaganda of repeat iconic perform=
ance, tv-specials, awards, superbowl halftime shows<br>

<br>i have several ideas about a new approach to electronic drums as an eco=
system of various components, including mixer, looper, sequencer, sampler, =
metronome, and drums combined into a single instrument interface. much like=
 a web server that spans another virtual machine or process, to manage or a=
ccess another dimension, so too, why not allow a drummer to have &#39;multi=
ple arms&#39; via the tools themselves, by allowing a drum machine to captu=
re patterns that the drummer plays, set them up as a loop in real-time, and=
 then add and subtract and shape this information while it is live within t=
he equipment. many clocks, different directions for the sound, starting one=
 pattern in certain instruments and send it in a given direction and then a=
nother with different sounds in another direction, and let them go on their=
 way while playing yet another sound, different rhythms, within this layere=
d context. hell, who needs a band, even, if you have such a drum set. this =
is more like drumming as programming though in haptic or even neuro-feedbac=
k or voice-control interface, prototype for future computing even in its co=
mmunicative function, if considering performance could be over the network =
and thus local and remote via HDTV connections. so shared work model in tel=
econferencing into music, new MIDI standards allowing multiple times, thoug=
h far more is involved than can be sketched here in these parameters.<br>

<br>the larger point of it is that even though it is not allowed, &#39;the =
music&#39; of drumming exists in a context beyond the way the equipment is =
now designed, yet could be reconsidered, once again questioned for what is =
going on in musicological terms, the substance of instruments, and then ope=
n up these parameters for music to breath within versus be stifled by lack =
of ability to do anything other than playing as fast as possible as the inn=
ovation path available, versus multilinear and ecosystem and other dynamics=
 that could also be possible, if these situations would be evaluated in the=
ir truth, versus just as profit for the automated machine and music-product=
ion ideology that formats these tools as formulaic, calculator-like devices=
 that produce endless strings of self-same limited parameter computations o=
ver and over, as if equated with heightened awareness and grounding of cult=
ure by mere communication.<br>

<br>in other words, maybe virtuosity of expertise in a given instrument is =
not the aim or goal and instead literacy of music via instruments and as a =
way of forming and shaping awareness and consciousness and forming a basis =
for shared communication at a greater depth than existing culture allows th=
ough has historically been achieved and held with great reverence, in that =
music forms the centre of shared experience, brings many together in one re=
lation and that instruments can do likewise. <br>

<br>(in this regard, some of my ideas include people being the performance =
themselves, musicians as networks of multiple timed looping patterns and in=
teracting as ecosystem, being able to move through music at any point or pa=
th as with software models thus the song is interpretable, non-repeatable e=
ven, an environment that is navigated, this could include performance, head=
phones allowing positioning or moving around acoustic space, etc. software =
tools anyone can use to learn musical principles. musicological instruments=
 that redevelop existing types along more fundamental musical structures an=
d principles, such that music instruments are reading/writing instruments, =
gaining that level of interaction and ability to communicate beyond existin=
g notation parameters that deter such developments)<br>

<br>a drumset that is grounded in its electromagnetic context and can acces=
s the truth of this condition in that parameters of music allow it to be ta=
pped into, explored, understood, and experimented with, then potentially re=
lates to a next-level of computation of the sensor-based environment requir=
ing orchestration from within chaos, into order, via looped patterns of tas=
ks and routines of separate elements (whether tom-tom, sequencer, metronome=
, or pantry, computer, e-ink wall display). the larger dynamics involve sim=
ilar principles, how to manage multilinear flows of information, shape them=
, program them, secure functioning while existing or starting in another fr=
amework. how to make the transition, what is the conflict in ideas or ideol=
ogy, what if the difference in values, in control, management, authority, i=
s truth driving the process or its representation that can be warped, subve=
rted, and what if what today does not work together at all instead could be=
 naturally, organically cohesive as an ecosystem, harmonious, due to recogn=
izing shared principles, functionality, parameters and functionality that a=
re symbiotic, and provide feedback in shared frameworks that benefit the wh=
ole infrastructure which is scalable, because it is based upon shared truth=
 <br>

<br>this truth of music is truth of life, truth of culture, truth of people=
, truth of society, that is the value that has been replaced by another set=
 of principles moving in an inhuman direction that then holds people agains=
t its values as if inferior when it is the opposite- these tools need to se=
rve people, not the other way around. they should free the imagination and =
open-up options, not deny or break these connections to maintain some other=
 agenda or priority;<br>

<br>and yet music like everything else has become trapped in this realm of =
falsity, held captive to mimicry and substitution of a false-view, seldom d=
o i hear music of my own nature anymore<br><br>and thus these words about f=
uture instrument design, what is needed, within these ruins of civilization=
 and its- our- lost culture<br>

<br><br></div>&lt;&gt;---- reference ---&lt;&gt;<br><br><div>[q] Drum: It i=
s an instrument frequently used in rites and rituals; its rhythmical sound =
is sometimes (e.g., in Buddhism) equated with the hidden sounds and powers =
of the cosmos. Often (e.g., among black African peoples) the drum served ma=
gically to call down heavenly powers; the war drum in particular was closel=
y associated with the symbolism of LIGHTNING and THUNDER. -- In China the s=

<br>DRUM=C2=A0 A symbol of primordial sound, and a vehicle for the word, fo=
r tradition and for magic (60). With the aid of drums, shamans can induce a=
 state of ecstasy. It is not only the rhythm and the timbre which are impor=
tant in the symbolism of the primitive drum, but, since it is made of wood =
of &#39;the Tree of the World&#39;, the mystic sense of the latter also adh=
eres to it (18). According to Schneider, the drum is, of all musical instru=
ments, the most pregnant with mystic ideas. In Africa, it is associated wit=
h the heart. In the most primitive cultures, as in the most advanced, it is=
 equated with the sacrificial altar and hence it acts as a mediator between=
 heaven and earth. However, given its bowl-shape and its skin, it correspon=
ds more properly to the symbolism of the Element of earth. A secondary mean=
ing turns upon the shape of the instrument, and it should be noted that it =
is in this respect that there is most variation in significance. The three =
essential shapes are: the drum in the form of an hour-glass, symbolizing In=
version and the &#39;relationship between the two worlds&#39; (the Upper an=
d Lower) ; the round drum, as an image of the world, and the barrel-shaped,=
 associated with thunder and lightning (50). [/q]=C2=A0 --- A Dictionary of=
