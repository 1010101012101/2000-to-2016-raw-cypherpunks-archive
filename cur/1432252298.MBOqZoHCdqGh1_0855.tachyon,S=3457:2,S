"The Ten Cannots" 
By William Boetchker 
(From a pamphlet, "Lincoln on Private Property," 1916) 

I. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.

II. You cannot strengthen the weak by destroying the strong.

III. You cannot help small men by tearing big men down.

IV. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.

V. You cannot lift the wage-earner by pulling down the wage payer.

VI. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than your income.

VII. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.

VIII. You cannot establish sound social security on borrowed money.

IX. You cannot build character and courage by taking away a man's initiative
and independence.

X. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and
should do for themselves.
