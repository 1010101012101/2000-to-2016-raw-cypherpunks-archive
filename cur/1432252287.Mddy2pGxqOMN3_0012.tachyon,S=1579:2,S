"Nextel, the official mobile provider to both conventions, is deploying its iDEN
network with encryption codes used by the National Security Agency to make sure
no one eavesdrops on all the deal making."

Anyone know what's up with this? I'm guessing this just means AES, or maybe
Skipjack, but it would be interesting (and very strange) if they were using
BATON or JUNIPER.
