It is possible for any current governmental agency to hijack the entire
system, due to their access to supercomputer infrastructures and/or immense
budgets. This will however become less and less possible while bitcoin
continues to grow and is already a massive and technological challenge which
I do not see any governmental institutions execute proper.

It is also strange to say these transactions are "untraceable". Nothing is
less true. Governments have complete transcripts of all sent data (USA, GB
and AUS have a neat little system for this set up, catch all emails too),
and every transaction is signed by the money's owner, it needs to be
processed. Sure one could create many different unique signatures (bitcoin
adresses) but those could all be traced moving out of the house. It's just
immensely more tedious to do than tracking, say, bank transactions and so
many agencies will just not be technical enough to do this.

Funny enough the same internet security things will help as with all
internet things Tor on your neighbors network with IPSEC and SSL "behind 7
proxy's". (even then the network will need to process your transactions and
agencies can just follow along with that, they just can't really trace the
transactions back to you; if you use different bitcoin adresses)

So kids; go crazy, be paranoid and have fun,
Best regards,
