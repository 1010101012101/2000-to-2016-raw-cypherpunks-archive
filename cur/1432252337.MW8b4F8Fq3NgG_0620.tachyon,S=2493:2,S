FAS falls.

fas.org's Project on Government Secrecy, has not only pulled 200
documents from it's web-site (including crude NSA HQ maps),
but has apparently lobbied Google to remove fas, in its entireity,
from the Google cache. FAS and Aftergood have now fallen to the
trolls. Long cherished thorns in the US intelligence oligarchy's
backside, PGS has become an oxymoron.
