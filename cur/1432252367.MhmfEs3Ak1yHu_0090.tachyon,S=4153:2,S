I haven't misrepresented anything. You've never defined it. I just assumed
you were speaking english.

Clearly my mistake, I keep forgetting you're like Tim; always re-defining
what a word or term means and then not telling anyone. Then when they use
it in some way that you don't like it's 'their' failure.

Coerce - from L. coercere, 'to restrain', in modern usage it means
something along the lines of 'to compel or dominate by force or threat'.

'force' has no requirement to be physical, any more than 'violence' does.

What you're doing is using a very restricted definition to mean 'physical
force' or 'physical consequence'. Unfortunately this isn't a broad enough
definition to be useful. To claim that psychological coercion is of no
consequence, as your statement implies means that it is you and folks who
use your definition who are missing the bigger picture/problem.

The crypto-anarchy claim that if we'd only get rid of government coercion
all will be good is the real view that doesn't get it.
