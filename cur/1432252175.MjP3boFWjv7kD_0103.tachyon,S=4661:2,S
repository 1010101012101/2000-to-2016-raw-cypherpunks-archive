Specious, 'control of' is not 'responsible for', neither does 'right to
decide for' equate to 'absolute control of'.

If for no other reason that you can't control a child 24/7 unless you do
something like stick them in a closet. The consequences of this (as
exemplified by regular CNN cover stories) are easily understood, the child
is removed from the parent.

See responce to #2, only if it can be shown that to do otherwise would
harm the child. For example, children must attend school, but it doesn't
have to be a public school, and it doesn't have to be a private school.

No, there is only one position with multiple facets. Your attempt at
dissecting them into orthogonal componants is what is at fault.
