I think there is probably more value in signed mailing lists than =
encrypted.

If it is encrypted, and the process is anything less than absolutely =
seamless and transparent, it is likely to drive away a large fraction of =
the readers.

I hardly have time to read or respond to the messages as it is. Add even =
a few second per message and I would drop out.
