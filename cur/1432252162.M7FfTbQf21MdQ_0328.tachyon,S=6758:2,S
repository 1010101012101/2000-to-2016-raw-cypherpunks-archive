Oddly enough, this is topical to cypherpunks -- or it was before
people heard the answer twenty times here in the last almost 10 years
- - -- as the answer points out something people have said here all
along: the increasing futility of "hiding" your own money in an
increasingly politically-enforced book-entry global financial system.
Buy financial cryptography and not your congressman, and all that.


So, to contribute to the steganographic clutter, it seems to me that,
since the US at least *used* to be the world's greatest tax-haven, as
long as you're not an actual citizen of the US you should just move
home, leave your money here, and don't forget to take your American
Express card.

I say "used to be", because Uncle has been making every other
tax-haven take its pants down for a little digital-anal probing,
and, as a result, there are fewer tax-havens out there to choose
from, thus making changing Uncle Sam into a financial version of
Uncle Ernie (may John Entwhistle RIP). You might want to talk to your
friendly local Arthur Andersen partner, or the local "Cheshire Cat"
money laundry and hawala franchisee for details. Reciprocity's a
bitch, and all that.

Unless, of course, you fancy yourself riding out of the ether on an
infocalypse-horse, or you're from one of those seven dirty countries
whose name you can't say on television without the appropriate
perjorative, in which case all bets are off, same as they ever were.
In that case, expect a little probing yourself when leaving for home,
if not every second Thursday from now on for posting a question here
in the first place, "anonimo", or not, traffic analysis being a
bitch, as well...


The only reason you'd *want* to become a citizen is if you want to
stay here for good, while taking the odd jaunt to troll your good
fortune around the Old Country. I mean, you can almost buy a gun
here, our roads are still pretty good, our girls ain't all ugly, they
still haven't nuked us yet, and, frankly, it's only immigrants like
you who actually work for a living around here anyway, while
correspondingly making significantly more money than others in their
social "strata" -- but it appears, from the size of the roll in your
pocket, you've noticed that already, or were at least happy to see
us.

If you *do* get a US passport, and go back home to live on the cheap,
and your former home government puts you in jail for farting upwind
of the local jefenisterie, the only thing our government is likely to
do is make indignant mewling noises in your general direction, like
they do about the odd naturalized Chinese who is foolish enough to go
back and "dissent" against a country which still fancies itself a
communist state, thankyouverymuch.


Stir political fluids in the opposite direction for America de la
Sur, YMMV, IANAL, ya get whatcha pay for, etc., yadayadabingbang, and
so forth and so on...
