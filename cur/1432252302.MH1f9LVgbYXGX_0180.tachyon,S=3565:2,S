We don't feed cyberpass directly.  I don't remember if
there was a problem feeding it or if I just didn't turn it on.
I've turned it on now.

One drawback of the decentralized kludged-up CDR system
is that it's difficult to trace problems.
All I can tell is that all the cpunks mail left here in the usual time.
What happened on the other nodes I can't say.  Maybe
the operator of the cyberpass node can?
