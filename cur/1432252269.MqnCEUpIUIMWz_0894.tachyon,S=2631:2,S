Doing this would allow vote buyers to verify a voter voted the way  they 
wanted.

That is one of the main reasons you can't take a copy of your paper ballot 
home with you now.

One option might be to give the voter a MAC of their ballot and then print the 
MAC's in the paper. The voter could check to see if their vote had been 
altered.

I still think far better methods for improving voter turn out other than 
Internet voting are:

1.  A National Election Holiday (but in the middle of the work week so people 
can't use it to extend a vacation).

2. Couple the Election with a National Lottery with local, state, and national 
prizes. With appropriate delink of voter's identity from the way they voted 
of course.

(I'm not claiming that this would actually improve things overall, just 
increase voter turnout).
