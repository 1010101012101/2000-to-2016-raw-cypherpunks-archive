The @eff is pretty fucked up

The anomizers history is intertwined with that of the USG

I find their budgets vague

They funded tor numerous times thru the years which i find strange

They do no boots on the ground work that i am aware of

They have been supra-nationalistic which is strange

I cld go on but... yay lets all be grateful for what exsists sure YAY!
however having a critical eye should be a main job of any one of us ... o
whats that saying?... i cant remember .... oh yay >>> trust no one
