It should be massive fun when the RIAA sues someone
who has an open WiFi network inhabited by unknown
users.  We await this defense.  Doubleplus fun if the
RIAA victim doesn't know he's sharing his bandwidth.

We also anticipate someone being sued for downloading a rip
of a song they have a vinyl.  Ie, that they have legal rights to
own a more convenient copy of.
