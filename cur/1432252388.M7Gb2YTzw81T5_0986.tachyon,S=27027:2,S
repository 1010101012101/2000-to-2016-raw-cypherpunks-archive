yay to think the military would not want to expand its mandate when rummy
fought so hard for them to get ahead of the cia ... competition is weird
though it is possible - what are the thoughts on the cia as opposed to the
military running the drone program in this regard ? the pentagon was gonna
run it then it was decided no...

the competition between different agencies in the us is bazzzarrio i cannot
imagine how they deal with all the subcontractors - i am sure they figure
out ways to be cruel to them

the thing is that there are different entities 'running the show' mostly
its your good ole transnational corporations and fucking autocrats - basic
mafia shit the junta aspect of the so called gov is just an arm of the
transnationals... ever been to the straight of hormuz?

to put the military beyond the transnationals is beyond naive its complete
blindness

&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0It gradually became apparent to me that in the months a=
fter<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Edward Snowden began releasing information about the go=
vernment&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0foreign intelligence surveillance activities, the NSA w=
as being<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0severely -- and unfairly -- demonized by its critics. R=
ather<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0than being a rogue agency that was running amok in disr=
egard<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0of the Constitution and laws of the United States, the =
NSA was<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0doing its job. =A0It pained me to realize that the hard=
-working,<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0dedicated, patriotic employees of the NSA, who were oft=
en<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0working for far less pay than they could have earned in=
 the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0private sector because they were determined to help pro=
tect<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0their nation from attack, were being castigated in the =
press<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0for the serious mistakes made, not by them, but by Pres=
idents,<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0the Congress, and the courts.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Of course, &quot;I was only following orders&quot; is n=
ot always an<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0excuse. =A0But in no instance was the NSA implementing =
a program<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0that was so clearly illegal or unconstitutional that it=
 would<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0have been justified in refusing to perform the function=
s<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0assigned to it by Congress, the President, and the Judi=
ciary.<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Although the Review Group found that many of those prog=
rams<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0need serious re-examination and reform, none of them wa=
s so<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0clearly unlawful that it would have been appropriate fo=
r the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0NSA to refuse to fulfill its responsibilities.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0Moreover, to the NSA&#39;s credit, it was always willin=
g to engage<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0the Review Group in serious and candid discussions abou=
t the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0merits of its programs, their deficiencies, and the way=
s in<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0which those programs could be improved. Unlike some oth=
er<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0entities in the intelligence community and in Congress,=
 the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0leaders of the NSA were not reflexively defensive, but =
were<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0forthright, engaged, and open to often sharp questions =
about<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0the nature and implementation of its programs.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0To be clear, I am not saying that citizens should trust=
 the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0NSA. =A0They should not. Distrust is essential to effec=
tive<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0democratic governance. The NSA should be subject to con=
stant<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0and rigorous review, oversight, scrutiny, and checks an=
d<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0balances. The work it does, however important to the sa=
fety<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0of the nation, necessarily poses grave dangers to funda=
mental<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0American values, particularly if its work is abused by =
persons<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0in positions of authority. If anything, oversight of th=
e NSA<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0-- especially by Congress -- should be strengthened. Th=
e future<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0of our nation depends not only on the NSA doing its job=
, but<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0also on the existence of clear, definitive, and careful=
ly<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0enforced rules and restrictions governing its activitie=
s.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0In short, I found, to my surprise, that the NSA deserve=
s the<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0respect and appreciation of the American people. But it=
 should<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0never, ever, be trusted.<br>
