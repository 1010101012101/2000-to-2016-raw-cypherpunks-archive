You probably can do something like it in Tokyo right now.  There
are lots of cell phones with cameras built in there.  You just press a
button and send it as e-mail.  Not exactly streaming video, but 1 frame
every couple of seconds by 5 people could be done very easily.

I saw 10 year old kids playing with the things.  They were taking pictures
of their noses, and watching their friends on another train send pictures
back.  It felt like I was living in the dark ages coming back to the US!

Patience, persistence, truth,
