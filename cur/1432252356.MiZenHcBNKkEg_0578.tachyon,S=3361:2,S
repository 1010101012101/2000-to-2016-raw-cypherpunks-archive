Is this really a bad thing? Music is becomming a public service. When author
cannot control their works (as is happening now) the works basically become
a public service - and the way public services are funded is by govt taxes.=
 If
they stop trying (and failing) to control content and just use this - well
it's not perfect - but it's better than a DMCA/UCITA world.

My worry is that they distribute this money only to the big record companies
and screw the 'real musicians'
