http://www.powells.com/subsection/ScienceFictionandFantasyV.html
has Vinge books, including
ISBN 0-312-86207-5, published by Tor, which is the collection
with Vinge's novel and articles by a number of people including Tim,
Chip Morningstar / Randy Farmer, RMS, and others.

The original is on the net in several places -
http://home.earthlink.net/~whitestones/truename/truename.html
         in mostly-pure-ASCII HTML with illustrations from
         one of the editions of the book.  Back when cypherpunks were
         lamenting the fact that the book was out of print,
         and that publisher copyright issues were preventing reprints,
         I found a copy of that edition in a used bookstore and
         lent it to a heavyset bearded guy who never returned the hard copy.
         I have no idea if the events are related,
         though I've since found a copy of the original paperback
         which had different cover art...  (:-)

http://members.tripod.com/erythrina/ has interesting original artwork.
