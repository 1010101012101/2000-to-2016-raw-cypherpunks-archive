(In America, for you non-Americans, many forms of speech are 
forbidden. Speech which adovactes cigarette smoking is illegal in 
many contexts. Likewise for many other examples.)

I just noticed that a Las Vegas casino operator, Harrah's, has 
"voluntarily agreed" to restrict its advertising so that children and 
"those with gambling disorders" will not be exposed to the 
advertising. Hmmmhhh.

[My take on this is that the state is exerting continuous pressure on 
many market actors.]
