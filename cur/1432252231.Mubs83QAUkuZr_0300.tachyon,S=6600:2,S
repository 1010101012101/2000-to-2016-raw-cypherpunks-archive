  Anarchists launch major media offensive

  by C4SS.org admin, October 10, 2006

  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  A tiny think tank has set out on a project to provide ongoing news
  commentary in order to promote their set of views, known as market
  anarchism.

  AUBURN, ALABAMA - October 10, 2006 - Center for a Stateless Society - The
  Molinari Institute, a market anarchist think tank, today launched a new
  media effort aiming to put their agenda to abolish government front and
  center in US political discourse. Dubbing their project the Center for a
  Stateless Society (www.c4ss.org), institute officials laid out plans to
  publish and distribute news commentary written by anarchists with radically
  free-market oriented views on economics - taking market anarchism ou of the
  realm of academia and obscure internet blogs in order to put it in the
  public eye.

  Molinari Institute President Roderick Long explained For too long
  libertarians, and I mean anarchist libertarians, have treated market
  anarchism almost as an esoteric doctrine. Its time to put market anarchism
  front and center in our educational efforts, time to start making it a
  familiar and recognizable position. The Center for a Stateless Society aims
  to bring a market anarchist perspective to the popular press, rather than
  leaving it confined to scholarly studies and movement periodicals.

  Naming longtime radical libertarian activist and freelance web developer
  Brad Spangler as the first Director of the Center, Long unveiled the
  Centers new web site at www.c4ss.org for Molinari Institute supporters and
  the public.

  Said Spangler Im honored to accept the post. In anticipation of this
  moment, weve developed a database of thousands of US media outlets for
  email distribution of content which these publishers will be able to use
  free of charge. Additionally, the c4ss.org web site makes use of stable,
  reliable and free as in freedom open source web technologies. Weve
  developed the site in such a way as to make maximum possible use of social
  bookmarking services, web syndication feeds and search engine optimization
  techniques. With this site, we aim to awaken more Americans than ever
  before to the brutal reality that all governments everywhere are
  essentially nothing more than murderous bandit gangs - and show them the
  shining light of hope for a world without the State.

  ###

  ORGANIZATIONAL SUMMARY

  The mission of the Molinari Institute is to promote understanding of the
  philosophy of Market Anarchism as a sane, consensual alternative to the
  hypertrophic violence of the State. The Institute takes its name from
  Gustave de Molinari (1819-1912), originator of the theory of Market
  Anarchism. The Center for a Stateless Society is the Molinari Institutes
  new media center.
