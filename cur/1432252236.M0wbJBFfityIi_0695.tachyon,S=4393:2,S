There are a number of concerns with your legal declaration and protocol for
responding with interpreted register directives to this target when
emulating the intercepted communication. Though page 47 and Karo indicate
the likelyhood of no adverse impact on systems that interpret the shutdown
command, this should have had emphasis that the target (client) machine had
the option to interpret your injected "command" and statistical evidence
that only one version set of the tool existed and ideally 100% of clients
had verifiable and predictable results. There is no indication you studied
the possibility of "counterpart" systems existing to monitor your target and
preempted damage to user contexts. There is still option for this retalitory
intervention by the criminals to monitor and counteract your progress. It is
surprising that such an antique and legacy method of action even exists in
real world deployment, such techniques might have been common in the early
1990s but irrational except when deployed within a fully controlled
corporate network. There are a number of specific concerns to be relayed
upon your response to this message. The exploits and vulnerabilities which
make these criminal activities possible are intentionally designed and DO
NOT facilitate equal market opportunity nor advancement of commerce, these
provide exploits which sponsor organized crime and terrorism. -LEE
