David Friedman lacks empirical data.

I have some empirical data.

My empirical data is as follows:  Information about people's reputations
tends to be poor and unreliable, since one cannot report satisfactory or
unsatisfactory performance widely.  The worst people tend to be discovered
and excluded, however because one cannot exercise as much choice about
those one does business with as one would prefer, one needs the
temperament, physical size, and business associations that enables one to
make credible threats of breaking people's arms and legs.

Among the better class of people, illegal entrepreneurs who went to the
right schools and refrain from taking opiate drugs, one relies
overwhelmingly on reputation and character.  However among the worse class
of people, fly-by-night illegal entrepreneurs, and people who take opiate
drugs, one relies heavily on the threat of physical harm.

Illegal entrepreneurs tend to become snobs.  It is the only practical way
to operate an illegal business.
