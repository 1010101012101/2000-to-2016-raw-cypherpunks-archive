I believe FBI was a minor player, if any, it was IRS TAIGA's Jeff Gordon
and AUS Attorney Robb London who bird-dogged, planted a vehicle
tracker, surveilled, harassed parents and friends, lurked on, sent
messages and cherry-picked this mail list to subpoena cpunks and
gather evidence for grand juries.

Indeed, it would be helpful to see the investigative files never introduced
in court: some claim only 5% or less of "law enforcement senstive" are
publicly released to avoid disclosing means and methods to assure
conviction and chill others into lawful obedience, even if the judge
remains awake during trial -- which in Mr. Bell's case, did not. Instead
Judge Tanner (80+ years old), snoozed and periodically barked "Period."

OTOH, some folks say once you see what is in such files, it may be
prudent to let sleeping dogs lie. Shit your father, mother, friends,
enemies, informants and shop-your-ass-to-save-their-own supporters
say about you, reveal about you, lie about you, cover-up their own
evildoing, well, now.

No doubt, once the partially disclosed and redacted and doctored files
are in hand, nothing stops you from culling them, doctoring them,
fucking your tormentors by publishing your own version of FOIA/PA
as the law and courts encourage official and unofficial liars to do.

Admirable that Muckrock provides tutorials on how to do this, with
gobs of documentary evidence far exceeding Snowden team's
snow job.
