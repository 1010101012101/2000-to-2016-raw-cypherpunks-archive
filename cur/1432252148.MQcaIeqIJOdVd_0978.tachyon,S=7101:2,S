Jakarta to outlaw Papuan activists
By Don Greenlees, Jakarta correspondent
August 29, 2002
INDONESIAN police have drawn up plans to outlaw the main Papuan 
independence organisation in a crackdown on separatism aimed at preventing 
Papua from becoming a "second East Timor".
Minutes of internal police meetings and documents obtained by The 
Australian, reveal a strategy to put the Papuan Presidium, the leading 
civilian proponent of an independent Papua, out of business, possibly by 
arresting and prosecuting its leaders.

The 60-day operation, known as Adil Matoa, began this month with the aim of 
identifying separatists or separatist organisations, arresting and 
prosecuting individuals "committing treason or attacks against the state" 
and shutting down organisations conducting separatist activities.

According to the minutes of a three-hour meeting on July 5, attended by 16 
high-ranking officers of the Papua provincial police, the operation would 
seek to prosecute Presidium members "according to the law (by obtaining) 
clear evidence that their activities are towards the illegal separation of 
Papua from Indonesia".

It warns that police need to take action to stop Papua becoming another 
East Timor.

The moves to set up surveillance against Papuan political activists and 
pave the way for prosecutions come amid heightened determination in Jakarta 
to prevent separatist movements around the country building momentum for 
their causes.

Analysis by the armed forces intelligence agency has played down the risks 
posed by the ill-equipped, poorly co-ordinated and relatively inactive 
armed wing of the Papuan resistance. But according to sources, armed forces 
intelligence is concerned about the potential for the political wing to 
build support, particularly overseas.
There are fears that foreign lobbying activities could help change 
sentiment in countries such as the US and Australia, where governments 
support continued Indonesian rule based on Jakarta offering local 
autonomous rule.
Exerting pressure on the civilian political movement is seen as the most 
effective way of containing the growth of pro-independence activity. An 
order signed by the Papuan police chief, Made Pastika, on July 17, 
initiating the operation, states that activities to combat Papuan 
separatists are to be carried out within the province, elsewhere in 
Indonesia and abroad.
In this document, targets of the operation are cited as "suspected 
civilians and community organisations that have a vision and mission 
oriented towards the separation of Papua from the Indonesian republic and 
endangering the unity of the nation by violating national law".
It also cites civilians and community organisations that "object to 
government policy using the cover of violation of human rights (and) 
violation of indigenous rights" and conduct activities that can "undermine 
the dignity of the government and state".
Fearing the operation will trigger a round-up of civilian political and 
human rights activists, a national human rights group wrote to the police 
chief accusing the police of trying to turn legitimate human rights work 
into "a cheap issue to clamp down on innocent people".
The letter by the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence 
(Kontras) warns the operation will only lead to a repeat of the "crimes 
against humanity committed in the past, for which the state was never held 
accountable".
A written reply from police headquarters in Jakarta maintains there is a 
"strong reason" to run operation Adil Matoa because there is evidence 
"suspected individuals and community organisations have a mission (and) 
tried to build public opinion domestically and abroad to unify their vision 
for an independent Papua".
"We hope that those illegal organisations will disband out of their own 
conscience," the letter states, in what activists regard as a reference to 
the Papuan Presidium.
