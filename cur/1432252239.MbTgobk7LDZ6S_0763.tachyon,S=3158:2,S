Which is, of course, a major flaw.

S/MIME is of some value for internal corporate email for companies who can
run their own CA. (The sort of people who used to be Xcert's customers.)

S/MIME is of very little value outside of a closed intranet environment,
for the simple reason that public CAs are mostly incompetent,
untrustworthy, or both.
