Thanks, getting it to work was a real pain. PAX / grsecurity kernel
patches had UEFI-related bugs, and the most suitable UEFI signing tool
(sbsigntool) lacked support for 32-bit EFI binaries. All of this is
now fixed / integrated upstream (sbsigntool is used in Ubuntu, by the
way).

LibertC) ships its own Secure Boot certificate, which signs the GRUB
bootloader, and the trusted chain continues from there. After
experimenting with Secure Boot in OVMF builds, I think that enrolling
such a certificate is not difficult b it is not more difficult than
changing the order of boot devices in BIOS, for instance (back then
before a menu could be invoked by pressing a key). Most controversy
about Secure Boot support in Linux one finds online is about making
the process completely transparent for users, which requires either
using Microsoft-signed binaries (Fedora) / intermediate certificate,
or embedding one's keys in firmware (Ubuntu). If you forgo the
requirement of complete boot transparency, which I think is reasonable
for a special-purpose live distribution, using an own certificate is
an obvious choice.
