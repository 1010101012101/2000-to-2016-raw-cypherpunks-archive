Cyber Protests: The Threat to the U.S. Information Infrastructure
October 2001

Executive Summary

Political events and emerging international situations will
increasingly lead to cyber protests. The cyber protests that have
occurred thus far have had little impact on U.S. infrastructure. As
computing technology becomes faster and better, and hacking tools
become more advanced and easier to use, cyber protesting and
hacktivism will become more significant to U.S. national interests.
Cyber protesters are becoming increasingly more organized and their
techniques more sophisticated but, most likely, will continue to
deface web sites and perform DoS attacks. There will also be an
increase in the number of apparently unrelated hacking groups
participating in the cyber protests. National boundaries will not
always be clearly delineated in attacks on opposing organizations.
International activity will also tend to spill over into the United
States. Because the United States is a multicultural, world-leading
nation it will suffer from attacks on culturally related sites and
structures in the future.

Generally, the most popularly targeted sites are those belonging to
government, educational, commercial, and cultural institutions.
However, any site with an exploitable vulnerability will be
susceptible to a cyber attack. The infrastructure has been targeted in
other countries in cyber protests and it is expected that it will
eventually be targeted in the United States as well. Cyber protesters
certainly will target infrastructure more often and exploit
opportunities to disrupt or damage it.

Web sites that remain open to known hacking tools will have a higher
probability of suffering defacement. Network administrators must
remain educated and defenses must evolve along with the threats and
offensive capabilities. Although the cyber protests seen today have
already caused limited damage, the potential for future attacks could
bring about large economic losses as well as potentially severe damage
to the national infrastructure, affecting global markets as well as
public safety.

Introduction

In the last decade, with the explosion of the size of the Internet,
protests and political activism have entered a new realm. (1)
Political activism on the Internet has already generated a wide range
of activity, from using e-mail and web sites to organize, to web page
defacements and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. (2) These politically
motivated computer-based attacks are usually described as hacktivism,
a marriage of hacking and political activism.

In addition to the consistent activity of groups devoted to a specific
long-term cause, the Internet has also seen short-term periods of
intense political activity, which can be referred to as cyber
protests. Cyber protests have become a worldwide phenomenon available
to anyone with access to computers. Unrestrained by geographic
boundaries, protesters have an enormous forum in which to be heard.

Cyber protesters have a wide range of goals or objectives. Some
hackers want to expose government corruption or fundamental violation
of human rights; others just want to hack and cause mischief for fun.
It has only been since 1998 that cyber protests have skyrocketed in
popularity and become commonplace in today's computerized world.

The most common type of cyber protest comes in the form of web page
defacements. In such scenarios, a web site is compromised through some
security deficiency and the hacker is able to alter it, many times
placing propaganda, profanity, or pornographic images on it. This can
range from being a nuisance and embarrassment for an organization to a
major economic loss for an e-commerce business.

Protests and civil disturbances are nothing new. People unhappy with
their situations have always found outlets to spread their message, be
it a peaceful sit-in, letter-writing campaign, picket march, or
violent gang fight. Now, with the advent of the Internet and the
growing number of people online, it has become easier to organize
protests. That is not to say that every web defacement is an organized
event on the part of some political organization. Many defacements are
perpetrated by lone hackers that have no political motivation other
than to create chaos. Nation-states and their respective citizens have
also been involved in cyber protests. Several countries have waged
ongoing cyber battles against each other through web defacements and
DoS attacks. Mail bombing is a popular form of a DoS attack. Massive
amounts of e-mail or web traffic are directed against a specific site,
overloading it and causing it to crash. It should be noted, however,
that some parties involved in these cyber protests are not citizens of
the respective countries. They might hold similar views or they might
be involved just to participate in hacking different sites. Alliances
can be tenuous at best for some of these groups.

Chinese Hackers

One high profile incident occurred in May 1999 after the United States
accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia during
the NATO air campaign. U.S. web sites were defaced in the name of
China and massive e-mail campaigns were executed to gain sympathy and
support for the Chinese cause. Government web sites were primarily
targeted. The U.S. Departments of Energy and the Interior, and the
National Park Service all suffered web page defacements. In addition,
the White House web site was taken down for three days after it was
continually mail bombed. This action was relatively unorganized in
fashion, short in length, and affected a small number of U.S. sites.

Pro-Chinese hackers also acted against Taiwan during the Taiwanese
presidential elections in August and September 1999. Cyber protesters
and hacktivists compromised 165 Taiwanese web sites, mainly defacing
them, over the two-month period. Their ultimate goal, as it was
stated, was to negatively affect and bring down Taiwan's
infrastructure. Among the targeted sites were electricity, economic
institutions, telecommunications, and air traffic control. Although
teams began to develop and organize near the end of the operations,
the damage was relatively light, similar to the attacks on U.S. sites
earlier in the year. Importantly, strategic targeting and some
organization of forces became accepted strategies for future protests
and hacks. These hackers are likely to become more organized and more
successful in future incidents. (3)

In late April and early May 2001 pro-Chinese hacktivists and cyber
protesters began a cyber assault on U.S. web sites. This resulted from
an incident in early April where a Chinese fighter jet was lost at sea
after colliding with a U.S. naval reconnaissance airplane. It also
coincided with the two-year anniversary of the Chinese embassy bombing
by the United States in Belgrade and the traditionally celebrated May
Day and Youth Day in China. Led by the Honkers Union of China (HUC),
pro-Chinese hackers defaced or crashed over 100 seemingly random web
sites, mainly .gov and .com, through DoS attacks and similar exploits.
(4) Although some of the tools used were sophisticated, they were
readily available to both sides on the Internet.

Many defacements of U.S. sites included posting pictures of the dead
Chinese pilot Wang Wei and profane messages calling for the downfall
of the United States. ProUnited States hackers responded with similar
defacements, messages, and damage on 300 Chinese web sites. Of
interest is that some pro-Chinese hackers violated hacker etiquette by
wiping some compromised servers. (5) The rule of thumb is to deface or
crash a web site but to leave the information intact, otherwise it is
considered bad form. (6)

Israeli and Palestinian Hackers

In October 2000, Israeli and Palestinian hackers engaged in
adversarial hacking when the prolonged peace talks between the two
groups broke down. During this difficult time, hackers seized the
opportunity to attack web sites belonging to the opposition. Starting
October 6, 2000, 40 Israeli web sites and at least 15 Palestinian web
sites suffered defacements at the hands of opposing hackers. (7) This
coincided, of course, with physical violence in the region. It was
also a problem for U.S. based web sites. U.S. web sites will often
fall victim, regardless of their lack of proximity or involvement in
the events. For example, several U.S. sites were hacked by
pro-Palestinian hacktivists, including the take down of a lobbyist
group web site. The hackers then posted group membership information
and credit card numbers. (8) This activity did little to affect the
United States as a whole although it illustrates how a seemingly
unrelated event can potentially affect U.S. sites.

The level of sophistication ranged from low-level activity using
simple defacements to coordinated, relatively sophisticated attacks
such as potential root access penetrations. Several hacking tools were
developed specifically for this engagement. Any type of attack was
considered during this time, including the perpetration of viruses,
DoS attacks with e-mail bombing, and sustained, amplified pinging
attacks. Web sites containing these various hacking tools were readily
available for download to anyone who wanted to join the action.

Pro-Palestinian hackers hit any type of Israeli sites that they were
able to compromise, many times defacing them with messages such as,
"Free Palestine" or "Free Kashmir." (9) FloodNet software was a major
tool used by the Israelis. The cyber protesters simply visited a site
and FloodNet would repeatedly send requests to the targeted server.
This type of virtual sit-in is a popular form of a DoS attack. Many of
these attacks were successful as servers were bombarded and went down
repeatedly. Targets included ethnic specific organizational web sites
and those of financial institutions to disrupt the infrastructure.
E-commerce sites crashed and there was an economic impact reflected in
the Israeli markets. It was, however, the root access attempts that
were most dangerous for the defenders. Hackers who can gain root
access to sites give them unlimited freedom to do whatever they wish.
This is the highest level of penetration possible although no
successful root access penetrations were reported.

These events attracted a wide variety of hackers eager to join the
fight. Both sides were well-organized and used reconnaissance and
intelligence gathering techniques to maximize their effectiveness.
Even outside hacking groups, such as G-Force Pakistan, joined forces
with the Palestinians to lend a helping hand. This is increasingly
common. Some outside groups join an effort because they have similar
political or ethnic motivations, however, this is not always the case.
Some groups participate in hacks simply for the desire to hack or the
publicity, not out of a sense of loyalty.

Overall it can be expected that Israeli and Palestinian hackers will
be active whenever a stumbling block appears in the road to possible
peace between the groups. On the other hand, increased hacking might
also occur when the Israelis and Palestinians are close to a peace
agreement. System administrators must remain vigilant and focused on
providing effective network security.

Indian and Pakistani Hackers

Another example is India and Pakistan engaging in a cyber protest
caused by national and ethnic differences. After a cease-fire in the
Kashmir Valley hackers took it upon themselves to continue the
hostilities. In 2000, pro-Pakistani hackers defaced more than 500
Indian web sites. Conversely, only one known Pakistani site was hacked
by the Indians. This illustrates a large difference in technical,
hacking abilities or the willingness to use the skills to strike at an
adversary. In this event the apparent level of sophistication on both
sides is relatively low. Web site defacements are the leading form of
this protest. The group G-Force Pakistan was the most active group
claiming involvement in the events. 10

Japanese Incidents

Recently, Japan has been targeted twice in online protests. During the
first week of April 2001, pro-Korean hackers attacked Japanese
organizations responsible for the approval of a new history textbook.
The textbook glossed over atrocities committed by Japan during World
War II and the occupation of China and South Korea. The perceived
reluctance of Japan to accept responsibility for its actions triggered
these events. The main participants in this incident were Korean
university students, who used e-mail bombs in a DoS attack. The
students crashed several web sites, including Japan's Education
Ministry, Liberal Democratic Party and the publishing company
responsible for the textbook." These attacks were neither long lasting
nor were they largely organized.

In early August 2001, pro-Chinese hackers targeted Japanese web sites
after Japan's Prime Minister visited a controversial war memorial, the
Yasukuni Shrine. In a brief period of time, hackers defaced several
web sites belonging mainly to Japanese companies and research
institutes. 12 This indicates the continuing willingness of
pro-Chinese hackers to use cyberspace and hacking tools as a platform
for protests and cyber civil disobedience, as well as for displaying a
strong sense of patriotic nationalism.

Conclusions

While the cyber damage thus far has been minimal, the infrastructure
will certainly be a target of cyber protestors and hacktivists in the
future, with the potential goal being intentional destruction rather
than public embarrassment or purely political statements. Pro-active
network defense and security management are imperative to the
prevention of more serious damage to infrastructure assets.
International cooperation and private-public cooperation within the
United States is necessary to ensure the ongoing function of the
critical infrastructure.

FOOTNOTES:

1. Historically, groups have never had the global platform that the
Internet provides today. Bulletin boards and group subscriber lists
were the only computerized links protestors had from the 1970s through
the early 1990s. The introduction of web browsers supporting graphics
and multimedia content and the expansive growth of the Internet,
coupled with the growing number of home computers, gave organizations
a new outlet for distributing information or disrupting events for a
political cause. The fact that many organizations have a web site has
enabled them to spread their beliefs to a wider audience. It has also
enabled other groups to target them for attack.

2. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right protected by the
Constitution of the United States of America that should not be taken
lightly. Individuals and groups generally have the right to actively
and legally support those causes in which they believe. Many
protesters and political activist groups have used cyberspace to
organize and advance their memberships and activities. Using computers
and the Internet has greatly increased protesters' effectiveness in
spreading their message and achieving their goals. This paper deals
with past incidents in which cyber protests have led to the
destruction of property and other illegal activities, citing,
specifically, foreign protests.

6. This highlights the fact that although web defacements usually
cause minimal damage, they indicate a very serious breach in security.
A web defacement is, by definition, the manipulation of a web server's
data by gaining unauthorized access to that server. It must be
determined if the hacker installed a back door, introduced malicious
code, or affected the server in any other way. A seemingly low-level
hack could result in future problems if systems administrators do not
take positive actions to stop future intrusions and restore the server
to its previous condition.
