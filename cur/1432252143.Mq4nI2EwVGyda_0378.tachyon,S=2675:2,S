On the heels of the Efnext debacle, I just read this fascinating 
article in Wired News which purports to explain that Usenet is already
dead, and IRC will be next. 

http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,41077,00.html

Methinks some people are just a teensy bit too eager to announce the
demise of certain Anarchistic parts of the Net as a forgone conclusion.

Particularly those parts which are used for Horsemen-related activities, 
and exist in a more supervised and LEA accessible form from providers
like AOL.

I'm not buying.
