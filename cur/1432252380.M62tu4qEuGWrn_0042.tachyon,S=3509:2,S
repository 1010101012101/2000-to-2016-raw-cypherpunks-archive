   Certainly sugar has a large effect, chocolate, however, should be soothing.

  definitely not Oshkosh, such inovation would never be allowed by city
officials. People here are too dumb to ever come up with such an idea anyway, it
would have to become the norm everywhere else for a few years before it would be
adopted here. When we were working with the local gov't community garden
committee, and suggested that they quit applying chemical fertilzers and
pesticides to the garden areas, noting that the Madison community gardens had
gone organic 30 years ago, one of them stated "Oh, but that's Madison." Finally
got them to stop the chemicals, but they still insist on coming in every Spring
with heavy equipment to plow up all the plots, and, given the wet clay soil
there, can't do that until very late, so people aren't allowed into their plots
until May 25 -- in an area where you want to plant potatoes and peas mid
April. Our suggestions that people just be allowed to do it themselves with
tillers or by hand as they do elsewhere came to naught -- "But we've always done
it that way."
