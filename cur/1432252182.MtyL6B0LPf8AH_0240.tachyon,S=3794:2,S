Nobody said congruencly of world view was a requirement. Looking at it
like this is actually incorrect. The issue is NOT congruency (hence
proving my socialist/fascist point prima facia) but rather TOLERANCE of
existing world views.

Without some mechanism to control the violence and inherent xenophobia of
human psychology being able to 'move around unhindered' becomes THE
problem.

Anarchy would be the Jews and the Arabs going at it without the UN and
other mediating forces. This is a PERFECT example of why anarchy requires
a 'socialist' world view to begin with.

Anarchy would be 7 prisoners loose in Texas, who've already killed at
least one policeman and commited several robberies, with no police force
or centralized C4I mechanisms.

Anarchy = "Don't worry, be happy!"
