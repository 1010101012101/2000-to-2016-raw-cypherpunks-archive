It made it to the evening news. Which I missed (my info was from the news
at noon), and caught only this morning in the evening news rerun.

They just delayed it. Most likely timezone stuff. Local news take their
material from the standard newsfeeds; though it's fun to watch who
includes what details and how the spin differs by station. (Does anybody
here know if it's possible to receive the raw APTN and Reuters satellite
newsfeeds, and how?)

Local political scene was much less than homogenous in this issue. The
quarrels around it were quite amusing to watch (though it all boiled down
into if it will be better to kiss American ass or the European one, or,
better, if there isn't a way how to kiss both of them at once).

You don't know local administration. The troops can consider themselves
lucky if they get official thank you.
