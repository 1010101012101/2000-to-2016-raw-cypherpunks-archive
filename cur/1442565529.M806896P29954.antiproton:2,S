I assume POC means "proof of concept". =C2=A0Yes, the error is non-determin=
istic. =C2=A0It arises from the fact that bits are stored as different volt=
ages on individual capacitors in a chip, one capacitor per bit. =C2=A0 Thin=
k of a "0" as being zero volts, 1 is Vcc volts, where Vcc (the supply volta=
ge to the chips) is usually 3 volts. =C2=A0This represents a healthy differ=
ence, and could easily be detected. =C2=A0The problem is that the chip can'=
t have one voltage detector for each bit; usually there are about 1048 bits=
 per voltage comparator. =C2=A0When a given row needs to be read, the Row A=
ddress line activates, and those 1048 bits are each connected to their corr=
esponding "bit line", which is a tiny electrical conductor with a capacitan=
ce much greater than that of the individual bit-cell (capacitor). =C2=A0The=
 resulting voltage difference between a "one" and a "zero" bit might be onl=
y a few tens of millivolts, which is rather small. =C2=A0Then, the voltage =
detector amplifies the voltage difference, to restore it to either GND (0 v=
olts) or Vcc.

It's statistical. =C2=A0Probably =C2=A0the number of failures will be appro=
ximately proportional to the number of disturb-cycles done.

Perhaps just a little. =C2=A0Refreshing of an entire memory array is done o=
nce each 64 millisecond. =C2=A0(Used to be 2 millisecond in the 1970s.) =C2=
=A0 =C2=A0It is said that many tens of seconds can elapse before any given =
bit is disturbed, if refresh is turned off. =C2=A0There should be a lot of =
margin for loss of refresh, or an inadequate amount of refresh.

I don't think an external attack (with particles) is plausible.
