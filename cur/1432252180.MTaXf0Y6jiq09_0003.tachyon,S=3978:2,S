But the 14'th only speaks of 'priviliges and immunities' it never(!) uses
the term 'right' and a right is clearly not a privilige or immunity (read
the first two para's of the DoI for explanation of 'right').

If anything the 14'th would prevent states from making any(!) laws
respecting speech, even if we accept rights as priviliges or immunities.
