Does anyone have any suggestions for setting up an anonymous remailer? I
found a FAQ from a "Cypherpunks Home Page" mirror, but that's from
_1993_! I assume there's more recent work out there somewhere, but I
didn't see anything on Google or Packetstorm, nor mentioned in Phrack or
some other zines.

I'd like a HOWTO, suggesting software to use and how to set it up. I'm
pretty clueless as to what would be needed, but I have a FreeBSD box and
a DSL line with no usage restrictions. If need be I can set up another
box, dedicated to this purpose. I should have the means once I get
whapped with a cluestick.

I'd also like discussions of real-world problems that people have found.
What kind of things cause you to think about shutting down your
remailer? Technical abuse, legal difficulties, or what?


Thanks,
SRF
