   Yup. give wrong advice, and you look like a fool. correct someone 
else's wrong advice, and you make them look foolish (unless you make a 
mistake in your correction, which seems to be some sort of tradition for 
spelling flames :)
   Probably the only reason I even post is because I don't mind looking 
like a fool, if it lets me correct some misconception I am labouring 
under :)
