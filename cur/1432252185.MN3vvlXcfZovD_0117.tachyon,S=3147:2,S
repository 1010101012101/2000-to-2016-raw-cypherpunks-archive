regarding previous discussion about baiting TLA's and resource
consumption attacks / honey tokens this article is relevant:

http://www.defensetech.org/archives/002439.html
"It's not just about who calls who. The NSA phone-monitoring project
looks at how terrorists place their calls  and then applies that
model to everyone, to see who else might be a suspect. It's a form of
predictive data mining made famous by the notorious Total Information
Awareness project...

Today, we learn why everyone's calls had to be in the target set. The
NSA wasn't just conducting social network analysis. It was using a
more controversial data mining technique, dragged into the popular
imagination by Darpa's Total Information Awareness project, which
focuses on prediction, not connections.

Under this approach, sophisticated algorithms hunt for patterns of
terrorist behavior in information-trails, and then apply those
patterns to average citizens, seeing which ones fit. It doesn't matter
who you know. It's what you do that gets you in trouble. If you spend
money and buy plane tickets like Mohammed Atta did, then maybe you're
a terrorist, too. Same goes for the kind, and frequency, of phone
calls you make."


so, if you really felt like poking the bear, the task is simple: act
like a terrorist!

google news alerts will give you the necessary "terrorist behaviors"
that get the desired attention.  these activities range from paying
down significant credit card debt to researching critical information,
transportation, and power distribution infrastructure.

if anyone decides to try this i'd love to hear the tale of your
interrogation and/or temporary incarceration... *grin*
