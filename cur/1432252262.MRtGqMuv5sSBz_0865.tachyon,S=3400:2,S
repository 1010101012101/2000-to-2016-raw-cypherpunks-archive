A shitty account for it leaves out the crucial information about
money changing hands between WL and its partners, not even
under the ruse of underwriting "expenses." 

Assange's rage at MSM is about getting financially screwed not 
dissimulation of editorial and publication control. 

Assange wants his fortune just as much as publishers and journalists 
and the rest of us do. The nobility of getting information to the public
untainted by venality is ridiculous -- even as PR it is rancid bacon. 

Assange's chronic bitch has been from Day One of WL about getting 
those who use Wikileaks to pay handsomely for it. That was, and is, his
business model, not public service, at least no more public service than
the public service racketeers. It is not about getting press coverage simply 
but coverage for advertising what can be bought under the table and on 
the black market -- just like official and criminal managers of information
flow do -- spies the most generous payers.

The peurile Vanitry Fair gossip about the MSM struggling financially avoids
the real issue of paying sources like WL and hackers and insiders is as if 
there is a solemn compact to pretend that never occurs. Mutual love
and admiration it aint. 

Why be coy about paying WL, out with it. Maybe Daniel will spill those
secrets but not likely due to the money to be made by pretending to tell
all but not really, tell enough to become a player, then play to the max.

What might break the complicity of silence is what leads so many to
leak, getting financially screwed by your partners -- the ever present
threat to human intercourse, not limited to bed partners.

You can bet Bank of America or whoever knows what it will take
for WL not to publish financially damaging data. By now the targets 
have been given samples to ponder, just as the MSM were given.
And Assange will continue to shop in the black market what is 
merely advertised by public disclosures.

This is a well-established business model of hackers and publishing
and as we have seen in this noble training and bragging forum, security 
experts.

This is an ad, the good stuff is not available for free.
