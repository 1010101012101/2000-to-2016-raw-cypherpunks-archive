In the UK?  I heard that in one community in the UK, in order to catch a

rapist or somesuch, the police went around collecting DNA samples

and arresting anyone who refused.  After all, only someone with =
something

to hide would refuse.  Of course, this was television.

Yes, only the genetically pure deserve health care.  And you are sure

that the insurance companies won't opt you out when they get a good

look at your DNA?

Actually, that's your claim.  But I'm surprised that you'er so ignorant

of cooperation between government and corporations.  Maybe you

don't actually work for a living.  You are aware of drug testing in the

work place, aren't you?
