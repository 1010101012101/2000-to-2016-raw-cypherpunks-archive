This Swedish entity believes it has found the solution
(patented) to the long standing problem of effortless
micropayments for web content. The solution is -
skip micropayments! - but let the ISP´s pay tax to
the content providers, the amount calculated from
the size of the ISP's customer base, regardless of
which sites the particular ISP customers actually
visit. So you need a World Association of Approved
Content Providers (WAACP) to share the tax profits.

The tric(k) seems to be a method of technically
denying access to sites in the  WADCP domain
to users who's ISP is not paying the taxes.

One big problem is that providers of Not PC Content
naturally will be barred from the WADCP.

Even if it won't help the MS Masses it would be a
gift if their system were crackable.
