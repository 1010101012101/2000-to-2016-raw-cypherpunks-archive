I think he's done good. The next generation of whistleblowers
will be using a decentralized cryptographic filesystem. It's like
trying to take down BitCoin vs. eGold. Now if only journalists
weren't that technology challenged. But they'll learn, when their
more savvy colleagues keep snatching up the big fat stories 
from under their noses. 

Wonder when the first joker will actually implement AP a
la Silkroad. Hope not to soon, the authorities are already
breathing down our general necks for no damn reason.
