Yes, this is a somewhat interesting problem - probably not that difficult
considering that the goal here is to create plausible deniability in a
setting like a court of law.  Generating traffic patterns that convince
other crytpographers (or even sysadmins) is much harder than generating
traffic patterns that simply create reasonable doubt.

Exactly.  The ideal system would monitor in and outbound:

- web requests
- bytes transferred
- bytes per page
- pictures per page
- binary files transferred
- (all of those) / second

and generate pseudo-random browsing to smooth these variables over time.
Perhaps a script that chose random word pairs from the dictionary, googled
them, and browsed the pages that were returned would be a good platform.
