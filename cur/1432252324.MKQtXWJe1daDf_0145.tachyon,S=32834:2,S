.".&nbsp;&nbsp; To the contrary, my understanding is that a number of facto=
rs have combined with the net result that Bitcoin is hyper-deflationary.&nb=
sp; One major factor has been the shift of bitcoin 'mining' from computer C=
PUs, to video graphics processors (GPU's), to FPGA (Field Programmable Gate=
 Arrays), and ultimately ASICs (literally, "application-specific integrated=
 circuits"; what used to be called 'custom' IC's decades ago.)&nbsp; While =
I don't have a specific number, I would not be surprised to hear that an AS=
IC miner is 1000x faster than even the fastest x86 CPU.&nbsp; If that were =
the
 only factor, it would appear that new bitcoins should be 1000x more=0A ava=
ilable than in, say, 2009.&nbsp; However, I also understand that the 'diffi=
culty' of mining bitcoin has been algorithmically increased regularly, in o=
rder to make it more difficult to compute to find individual bitcoins.&nbsp=
;&nbsp; This is programmed into the entire bitcoin system.&nbsp; In fact, i=
t is to the point where the limiting factor to the cost of 'mining' bitcoin=
 is the electricity cost of running the machines, not the cost of the machi=
nes themselves.&nbsp; The bitcoin system 'programs' the appreciation of bit=
coin by gradually increasing the difficulty of that mining operation.&nbsp;=
 This translates into an increase in the market value of bitcoin.<br clear=
=3D"none">=0AIn fact, this is essential to the (theoretical) outcome of bit=
coin.&nbsp; I think of it this way:&nbsp; The system is programmed to only =
allow the generation of 21 million bitcoins.&nbsp; If bitcoin is ultimately=
 to be used to run the entire world economy (why not?) there should be at l=
east one=0A million times more.&nbsp; (Say, 21 TRILLION; 21,000,000,000,000=
 bitcoins, if we think of the ultimate value of a bitcoin as being roughly =
equal to the current value of the US dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, e=
tc.)&nbsp; But since they are limited to 21 million, by algorithm, the valu=
e of a 2013 bitcoin will have to be increased by a factor of 1000&nbsp; to =
stretch to the task of funding a world's market.&nbsp; And that means that =
the 2 million BTC currently in the wallet most likely owned by Satoshi will=
 presumably increase in value to $2 trillion&nbsp; (USD).&nbsp; "Nice work =
if you can get it".<br clear=3D"none">=0AIs this a problem?&nbsp; Who, inst=
ead, would claim that it ISN'T a problem!&nbsp; Bitcoin has many great feat=
ures, its possibility (through Zerocoin) of being anonymous one of the most=
 intriguing,&nbsp; but there is nothing about a digital currency that requi=
res that it deflates at the rate historically associated with bitcoin.&nbsp=
; I view this=0A deflation as being arbitrary and capricious, and wildly to=
o large.&nbsp; Like I've said, I don't begrudge Satoshi $1 billion (USD), b=
ut I DO begrudge him $2 trillion.&nbsp; If Satoshi's bitcoin rescues us fro=
m all governments (enabling 'AM'), perhaps he should be entitled to $10 bil=
lion (USD), but not $2 trillion (USC).<span class=3D"yiv9394267520HOEnZb"><=
