Quoting the Washington Post Article: To Attacks' Toll Add a
Programmer's Grief...

Contributing to [the guilt] is the hate e-mail [Zimmermann] got
Sunday night.

It began, "Phil -- I hope you can sleep at night with the blood of
5,000 people on your hands." PGP has become a "weapon of war," the
e-mail continued, leveling the playing field between powerful
countries like the United States and "zealots."

Zimmermann read the words over and over again the next day, trying to
think of a way to respond. But in the end, the man who is known in
the technology world for his rousing speeches and meticulous debates
didn't know what to say.

* * *

You have GOT to be kidding me.

How about: "Sorry, I only accept e-mail encrypted to my PGP key. You
can obtain my key at http://pgpkeys.mit.edu" ?

Grow a spine, Phil, you jellyfish. You think Ford is upset because
their U-Haul truck was used by Timmy to blow up the Federal Building?
Tears in the shower? Please... spare me. This isn't a fucking Dickens
novel or the goddamn string section of the orchestra in an Elgar
piece. Do we have to get Brando to slap you around in the smoky back
room and tell you to be a fucking man? Unreal.

Oh, how the great (or at least those with decent PR acumen) have
fallen. Sad, very very sad.

None of you spineless dilettantes deserve privacy or freedom. Nearly
30% don't mind detention camps for legal aliens to affect a review of
their status? Sheesh. The United States so richly deserve the police
state that even now approaches that it will be a piece of lyrical
poetic justice if it does in fact come to pass. Bittersweet poetry
perhaps, poetry none the less. Land of the free my ass. Home of the
slave, I should rather think.

People, until the libertarian or privacy or crypto or whathaveyou
movements develop the same lust for the political (and actual)
jugular commonplace among their opponents they will ever be a
fractional and sidelined distraction. Nothing more.

September 11, 2001 fails to mark the end of the privacy movement only
if its proponents grow a backbone. None seems forthcoming. Zimmermann
should have hit the lecture circuit immediately with passionate
resolve for his cause, rather than being reduced to a withering pool
of Jello by some 90 IQ random with an AOL account. What a farce. To
think I once had respect for the man.

Shame on you for fostering a thinly-veiled anti-crypto op-ed piece.
You could of at least gotten 30 pieces of silver, rather than
settling for the kind of public sing-song sympathy more commonly seen
from the audience on the Jenny Jones show or the afternoon TV viewers
of a tearful "I have sinned against you..." public confession. I hope
it was worth it, you invertebrate.

And really, in the end, how absolutely arrogant of you to think that
you somehow reach the level of importance in world affairs that could
genuinely self-attribute a significant degree of responsibility for
the events of September 11th.

Again, I hope it was worth it. The price the rest of us may pay for
your insatiable vanity might be dear indeed.
