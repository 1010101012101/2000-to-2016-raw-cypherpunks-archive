This is a great point, but it's worth remembering that even your opinions
themselves can be used to find you. Real example (details changed for privacy):
I have a friend who used to write for a financial magazine whom I wanted to get
in touch with again. I had no idea which aliases he was using, so the first
thing I did was look up a few keywords related to a current subject
that, if he were still posting, he was unlikely to resist: dollarization and the
financial crisis in Argentina. I knew his opinions on other subjects well
enough to pick him out of a crowd, but chose Argentina first, since not many
people posting online are well-informed and passionate enough to get a 
first-class tirade going about it. Hear somebody rant about something a couple
of times and you know what to look for. 

Sure enough, I found him on the very first search, railing away and breathing
fire as anticipated, almost as if on cue. All I had to do was jump right in 
the conversation and trot out my own crotchety old hobbyhorses in my own
style...that afternoon, I got a "hey Faustine, is that really you?" message. He
was quite pleased with himself to have found me! 

Harmeless enough, but I'm sure you can think of more sinister applications.

Anyone who is really passionate about specialist subjects is at a distinct
disadvantage to Joe and Jane Sixpack, whose opinions are largely interchangable
and indistinguishable within various broad parameters. (How else could marketing
turn this sickening conformity and predictability into a science?) Take an
inventory of all the unusual things that push your buttons--the opinions that
make you unique--and you'll be a step ahead.
