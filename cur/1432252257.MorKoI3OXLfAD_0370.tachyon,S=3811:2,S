Posting about guns and survivalism is a chick thing? Sure, whatever you say.

So I felt like writing about a few things from my experience that were "off
topic" this week, who cares. If you find them fatuous and irrelevant, there's
always the filter file. At the very least, you could stop writing substantive
replies to them that generate even more off-topic content. And I do happen to
think off-topic content is better than no content at all. You know, the kind
of post that says nothing apart fron bitching about someone else's. Like this
one.

You should be glad I've managed to avoid polluting the forum by wasting breath
responding to most of the gradeschool taunts/death threats losers seem to get
off on directing my way these days.

(I was about to include a whole paragraph of inflammatory comments regarding
the aforementioned, but thought better of it. What's the point? I'm too busy
and life's too short. To each his own. FOAD. Whatever.)
