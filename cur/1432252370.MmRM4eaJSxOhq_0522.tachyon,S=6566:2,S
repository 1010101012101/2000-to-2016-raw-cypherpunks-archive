This is a second informational mailing regarding NBC Internet, Inc.  
You have received this e-mail because our records indicate that you 
are a registered user of www.nbci.com.

NBCi is in the process of making certain changes to our portal 
offering that may affect the way you use the site.  We are making 
these modifications in light of recent changes in the Internet 
advertising and financial markets.  The following questions and 
answers will provide you with an update about upcoming changes.

A. As mentioned in the previous e-mail, make sure you have a backup 
of all data stored on www.nbci.com (such as your web site, shared 
files, address books, and portfolio), as well as on Xoom.com and 
SNAP.com.  Such a backup should be stored on your hard drive, on 
floppy disks or other web site hosting providers, but not on the 
NBCi site. Instructions for copying and printing the contents of 
your address book and portfolio are published at 
http://www.nbci.com/LMOID/resource/0,566,-5687,00.html.

B. Uploads to member pages are no longer provided.  Select an 
alternative web site hosting provider and ensure that your files 
are moved to the new provider before the end of the month.  At the 
end of July, we anticipate that you will no longer be able to view 
member pages.  NBCi has made arrangements with Homestead.com for web 
page hosting and XDrive.com for file storage to help make the 
transition a smooth one.

-For more information about Homestead.com for your web page hosting 
 needs, visit: 
 http://homesteadannouncements.homestead.com/NBCI.html
-For more information about Xdrive.com for your file storage needs, 
 visit: 
 http://plus.xdrive.com/target.html?path=signup.html,aff=nbci061301

C. Beginning July 18th, content currently supplied by some providers 
will be replaced with links that take you directly to the provider's 
web site and some content will be taken down.  These changes affect 
several channels on the NBCi web site (e.g., Shopping, Travel, and 
Health).  Please note, however, that the quality NBC content you 
expect, such as news from MSNBC as well as NBC TV highlights, will 
continue to be available at www.NBCi.com.  And, as always, the 
www.nbc.com url takes you directly to programming information about 
the NBC Television Network.

D.  Effective July 26th, the following services will no longer be 
available:
-Sharehouse 
-Clubs (with the exception of NBC TV clubs)
-Calendar 
-Clipart 
-Sweepstakes

How can you stay informed?

 questions are located at:

-If you have specific questions about your e-mail account, contact 
 mail.com (a separate company) directly using this form:

Note:  If you use the NBCi site through one of our ISP distribution 
partners, such as PacBell, Verizon or Prodigy, please contact your 
ISP directly for additional information.
