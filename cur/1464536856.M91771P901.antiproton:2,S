Seems a simple question: The more data you are hiding, and the more
capable one's adversary, the less likely that steganography will work.

I think "code book" steganography, where pre-determined messages from
a list of messages known only to the sender and receiver are
transmitted via fully visible message timing, content, etc. is very
likely to work until or unless a copy of the code book falls into
hostile hands.

Example: "Any forum post from me, transmitted during an even numbered
hour, is an emergency distress call. Any forum post from you
transmitted during an even numbered hour means "help is on the way,"
odd numbered hour means "sorry, you're on your own."

Hiding arbitrary data inside media files by flipping bits is likely to
fool a human observer, but unlikely to pass through a stego detection
filter without tripping an alarm.
