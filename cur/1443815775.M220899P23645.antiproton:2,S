	It says "building the kind of society" - *society*, not the
	state. Two different things.

	Well, that may happen although I don't think anarchists have
	built any *state*. For starters, if they did, they would not be
	anarchists, by definition.

	Oh yes. Without slavery, who would pick the cotton.

	Wait rysiek, you are copypasting the most laughable nonsense
	that anglo fascism (masquerading as 'liberalism') ever
	produced? 

	You know, the first requirement to win an argument is to pick
	the right side. And statism isn't the right side of the
	argument. 


	re : 'division of power' - the incentives for people who have
	power lead them to COOPERATE to maintain or gain more power, not
	to 'check' each other's power. ABC of economics.

	So, you are willing to 'cooperate' with the current criminals
	and justify them while accusing a bunch of anarchist of 'maybe'
	doing something that goes against their principles?
