Pretty soon, I suppose. I would have a hard time drawing the exact
line. This is, I guess, the thing that most bothers people with current
models of welfare, especially when somebody perceived as being an outsider
is taken within such a system.

The Western civilization supports individuals to such a degree that the
above does not apply. People can indeed be born to parents which could not
survive in the ideal libertarian society. In other parts of the world, and
in earlier times, I believe death precisely of the kind described above
do/did occur (e.g. the famines in Africa, often caused by those responsible
for the production of food acting purely in their own interest) and are
perceived as barbarian by us. That is one of the reasons why we measure a
society by, e.g., its infant mortality.

As for what this means purely within our hypothetical world of absolute
ownership and slim governments, we get proles dependent on the owning class
for survival. It is never in the best interest of the owner to kill the
dependent one, just to extort him/her. I perceive this as a very concrete 
threat to liberty.

That is a powerful argument against any personal motives I may have. But it
is still well documented that financial inequality is on a rise all over the
world, that is, the deserts are getting bigger. Might be that in a hundred
years, you would have been awarded a life of financial slavery.

I mostly agree. I do not like broad governments or legistlative bloat
either. I just can't seem to shake some of the less humane consequences of
liberalism.

Agreed. Paternalism *is* Bad.
