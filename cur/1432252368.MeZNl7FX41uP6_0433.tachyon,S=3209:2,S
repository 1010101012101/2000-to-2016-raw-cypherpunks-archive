>Participants and spectators in Jim Bell's trial next week in Seattle might 
be interested in this case, released by the Ninth Circuit today, concerning 
the use of a web page to publish addresses of third parties, and whether 
or not such publication is protected by the First Amendment where it's foreseeable 
that unknown persons could make use of the addresses to cause injury or 
embarassment -

I think Judge Kozinski's ruling can also be easily read in support of free 
speech by operator and participants in anonymous betting pools with political 
interests.
