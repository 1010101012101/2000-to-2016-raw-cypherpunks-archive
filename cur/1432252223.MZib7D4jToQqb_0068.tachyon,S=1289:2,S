Hi, Franz

I am looking for a man who can make me happy. I want to hear the
whisper of tender words in my little ears every morning I wake up. I
want to feel the tender touches of his strong hands every evening when
we are alone. I want to smell his  perfume and to see him
smiling when we are together out in the restaurant enjoying each
other. I want to make his life a miracle... I am looking for a husband
and I am here: http://datingforalonelys.com/inlovedpeople
If my words found an answer in your soul, I am waiting for your note.

The best of luck!
Karito
