Which actually misrepresents the facts. The fact is that Philips position
is one of power and authority, of course they will do this simply to
protect their monopoloy (not the consumers rights, which aren't the same
thing).

If you don't think Philips is looking at how to license their TM to others
wanting to add copy protection of various ilks then you are seriously
misunderstanding the dynamics of a 'Capitalist' market.

It's a matter of time & $$$, not ethical protection of consumer rights or
the obligation of inventors/creators to supply the public domain.
