Its angering how much lip service though little progress has been made 
since 1973 on freeing America from her chemical dependence on petroleum in 
general and mid-east oil specifically.  If the U.S. had no direct economic 
interests in the mid-east would it be propping up the governments of 
Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, or contending with Iran and Iraq, etc? 
More likely our response to problems in the area would be similar to our 
involvement in West Africa.  This dependance has made us little more than 
oil junkies and you know that junkies will do whatever it takes to get 
their next fix.  If America wants to break this cycle of state violence and 
co-dependency it needs to get energy therapy in a hurry.
