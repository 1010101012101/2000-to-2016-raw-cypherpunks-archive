A man in Florida has been infected with anthrax, according to the CDC.

<http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2001pres/20011004b.html>

But don't freak out, they say. Don't buy a gas mask or antibiotics.
Don't panic. Get back in your cubicle. Keep working. Stay at your
desk. 

Under no circumstances should you try to find some ciprofloxacin, an
antibiotic which might be useful in treating inhalational anthrax.
