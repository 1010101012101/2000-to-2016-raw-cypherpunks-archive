Non libertarian anarchy?

The trouble is that a lot of socialists call themselves  
anarchists either as a simple cynical lie:

(parody of standard commie liar)
: : 	"This time the state really will wither away.  
: : 	Trust us.  We are different.  Once we have total 
: : 	power over you and yours you will love it."

or, perhaps more commonly, as mere muddy thinking

(parody of muddle headed socialist)
: : 	"I am really opposed to concentrated authority,  
: : 	therefore when I and people like me have all the 
: : 	necessary power to do all the good we intend to  
: : 	do to those selfish ignorant ungrateful masses,  
: : 	it will be the opposite of concentrated  
: : 	authority."
