...or defining what is or isn't. It isn't the federals business to manage
the individual. It is their business to manage interstate commerce (of
both type), make sure all state governments are 'representative' (if that
doesn't bring the fed's into it nothing else will, how can a state
government be representative if some faction can't speak or they aren't
getting fair legal protection? Interstate commerce, second definition) and
handle foreign interests.

Perhaps, but it's incorrect interpretation. For example the 5th and 6th
say 'criminal' not 'federal' or 'state' (there is no specification as in
the 1st as to who can't do it).

To even quible over it is a fundamental abandonment of American Democratic
thought. Consider that one of the fundamental thoughts of 'American
Democratic' theory is 'equal protection under the law'. Consider why this
country revolted from Britian, unequal protection under the law. 

American thought is fundamentaly about 'if it ain't prohibited it's
permitted' and 'it can't be prohibited unless it can be shown to harm
anothers expression of rights (ie life, liberty, & pursuit of happiness)'.
It isn't about 'you can only do what is listed'. That's why we have a list
of things which are meant to not be listed ever(!).

I love current popular American political thought:

"The only way to protect Democracy is to give it up."

And the trains still won't run on time...
