Opposite ends of the same thing. You can't have one without the other so
in a very real way to eat a potato is to chew on a potato branch (in a
figurative way of course).

You draw a false distinction, the Constitution starts out with what
phrase?

     Section. 1.
     All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a
     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and
     House of Representatives.

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
