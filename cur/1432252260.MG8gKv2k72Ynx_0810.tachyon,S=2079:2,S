Organophosphates will still make it onto a plane, have been used
in Japan, and might be better used in stationary, more populated and
still dense places in the US.

Also, no one has really tested whether pilots will suffer 300 passengers

to die.  But there are groovier places to deploy the human pesticides,
jets
are so old-school.

And then there's the ultimate soft targets, grammar schools.

Those who lay with israelis die like israelis.  Karma ain't just for
