I presume tracking down people who're actually concerned about security and
take some troubles to conceal their identity would be a good bootcamp for 
beginner TLAings. Iterated tiger teams interactions will inbreed, so they
need a source of novelty. But tracking down competent h4x0rs will be no doubt far
more challenging.

What's the point of busting a wannabee? Just to earn some tinfoil stars, to
make your organizational unit look good? Doesn't compute. No one got
bitchslapped but the AP fellow.

If you have advanced remote-diagnostic and remote-exploit capabilities, you
never let your hand show on an insignficant target. Even if you camouflage as
a h4x0r, penetrating a well-secured box is bound to raise some eyebrows (you
don't see a packet logger in passive mode).

No doubt such capabilities are reserved for cyberwar and industrial
espionage.

P.S. Sorry about the MIME sig screwup. I forgot.
