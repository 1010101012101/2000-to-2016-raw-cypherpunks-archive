I would like to point out the SocialVPN project

http://socialvpn.org

It is basically a P2P VPN which creates direct encrypted tunnels to
friends. It currently uses the XMPP protocol for friend discovery and
public key exchange. This VPN thus creates a social graph where edges
are IP links. This infrastructure can be used as an enabler for many
other social services. Here are a few examples

1 - Instead of using Skype, you can use Ekiga with Avahi, Avahi
extension for Ekiga will discover online friends through multicast over
the social virtual private network, you can then place SIP call directly
over IP link.

2. For instant messaging, you can use Empathy or Pidgin with
Bonjour/Avahi support, as concept as above.

3. For video stream, you can stream a video over HTTP or RTP using VLC
and your friends can connect directly.

4. For social networking, you can run a wordpress blog locally and have
your friends connect to that, or you can write an social networking
application that communicates with friends over SocialVPN using Berkeley
sockets API instead of having to deal with building P2P library that
deals with NAT traversal, peer search and so on.

5. All data sent between peers is encrypted and authenticated, basically
the same idea behind IPSec if you support PKI certificate exchanges.

One of the hardest thing about building social P2P systems is having
with a user-friendly way to bootstrap these social links (or Darknets).
SocialVPN makes that step trivial so that developers can focus more on
making cool apps versus figuring out how to traverse NATs.

I hope this helps.
