Perhaps the issue was the quality of RF field strength meter.  It may've
been that the bug would detect motor-running condition, and broadcast for
n minutes after motor-off condition, burst mode or other.  Alternators
produce a considerable RF field themselves, stereo shops have a brisk
business in selling RF suppressors to do-it-yourselfers who upgrade their
automobile's stereo.
