   tl;dr: We want your books. Send them to us.

   In December 2014, over 500 books were brought to Chaos
   Communication Congress in Hamburg for an experiment:
   During the busy days of Congress, with over 12.000
   visitors, how will people react to a library of dead
   trees?
   In partnership with La Quadrature Du Th=C3=A9 and the Congress
   team, a cozy reading area was set up on the fourth floor.
   For us Dead Tree Lovers, to see all seats and carpet space
   occupied almost 24/7 by interested readers filled us with
   delight.

   The library lives on! And has considerably grown since. The
   database now contains over 666 titles. As a travelling
   library, we will bring it to places near you, to
   hacker events and hackerspaces, to other public spaces.
   It is currently hosted and accessible around the clock at
   OpenLab Augsburg, Germany, for free borrowing or cheap
   purchase, replacing existing books by other used copies.
   The database is limited in that it does not yet contain
   all of the historical material that we have so far
   collected on the earlier days of hacking, pre-80s. Thanks
   to Werner Pieper, a friend of Wau Holland and publisher,
   we have started to add rare material from the good old
   times when hacking was part of the broader political
   counterculture movement and not yet mainstream. Thanks to
   the CCC, we are now hosting a complete paper archive of
   the Chaos Computer Club publication 'Die Datenschleuder'.
   The Humanistische Union (HU) donated most (all?) of their
   publications.

   WE WANT MORE. The library needs your help. Please send
   us your books and reading suggestions for us to hunt down
   paper copies! Or better yet, send us offers first.
   We're open for anything tech, political, scifi, as long
   as you feel it influenced your life profoundly and is
   worth reading. The focus is hacker culture and its history
   in the broader sense. It is not necessary to give your
   books away forever, we can log the source and return
   it if and when you want it back.

   Dead Tree Lovers c/o OpenLab Augsburg e.V.
   Elisenstrasse 1
   D-86159 Augsburg, Germany

   JOIN! We have started a mailing list to discuss all kinds
   of book matters: book scanning, library software (or lack
   thereof), book recommendations etc.

                                   the DTL team // July 2015
