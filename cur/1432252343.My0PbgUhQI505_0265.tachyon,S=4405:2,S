chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are

With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and
