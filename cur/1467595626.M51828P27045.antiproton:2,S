	You don't know anything about me, apart from the political
	comments I've made here. Same thing for quinn. All we know about
	him is that he's a totalitarian american shitbag. Whatever your
	personal connection to him is, (if any) it's irrelevant here.

	It is absurd for you to conclude that I'm a 'good'
	person and that quinn is a 'good' person too, since we represent
	completely opposed views of what 'good' means.

	Is this so hard to grasp?

	'Religious' liars are not good persons. Lying is not
	good. 

	It's becoming clear that 'good' doesn't really mean anything to
	you.

	OK. "Good" means nothing to you.

	Tell me Cecilia, is it OK for governments to exist? You know, 
	the 'good' utopian governments that do stuff that you think is
	'good', like, I don't know 'free' schooling for poor children.

	
	If I recall correctly you said you are not an anarchist, but
	I'm making sure...before pointing out that you are in no
	position to call me 'aggressive' or 'intolerant'.

	What am I wrong about?

	OK - and the relevance here is? Or was that just one more random
	and irrelevant thought?

	It's not just about your family. It about the fact that TODAY
	there are lots of people who support that kind of attrocity.

	The ones who are saying it are the americans.

	So tell me again about how good countries are and how much
	respect they deserve?
