There's no law in Texas that requires me to use any of the city utilities.
There are other laws that limit my options however with respect to
alternatives.

You mean I need to have a toilet in my barn? Man are my cows going to be
happy or what...

Here in Texas it has to be a domicile or a place of business to be
required to have toilets. And if the building doesn't have them then it's
usualy grandfathered (at least until the next time you need a building
permit to do a mod).

> * electricity

Nada, call your electric company. Ask them what happens if you turn off
the electricity where you live? Nothing.

Of course you can avoid this by living outside a city. Generaly the county
building codes are not very restrictive. The strict city codes generaly
come from bad experiences like Mrs. Oleary's cow (though it really wasn't
the cow's fault).
