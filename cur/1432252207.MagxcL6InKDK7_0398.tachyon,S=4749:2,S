While almost any law can be abused, I think you'd need a really
odd situation for normal people to be able to use this one abusively.

For civilians, as far as I can see, it means that filing a totally bogus
SLAPP suit, or (for example) threatening to make false reports of child 
abuse to get leverage in a divorce are now punishable beyond what 
they already are.

Let us remember who the greatest abusers of law and the legal
process are: LEAs and prosecutors. It appears to me that this
law is far more a curb on the behaviour of bad cops and
over-zealous DAs than anyone else.  

DAs too often obtain false testimony against third parties or 
plea bargains by threatening trumped-up charges. Corrupt 
cops can similarly threaten false or totally overblown charges 
to obtain services from the weak and defenseless.

I suspect that in so far as far as any law can be considered 'good'
this is one of the less bad ones.

Of course, I rejoice that IANAL.

Peter Trei
