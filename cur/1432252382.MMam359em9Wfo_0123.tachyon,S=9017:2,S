Ideas are not generally protected in any major society.

(Certain _expressions_ of ideas are protected in specialized ways 
through the copyright and patent systems, which vary from society to 
society. But not general ideas.)

People generate ideas. Ideas are usually much more important than 
specific copyrighted items or even specific patented items are. When 
someone writes a book, with lines of reasoning, new ideas, summaries of 
old ideas, those ideas are not protected intellectual property.

Likewise, fashion and architecture and styles in general are not 
protected. (Attempts have been made, especially with the "look and feel" 
nonsense, but generally anyone is free to copy the "idea" of a 
miniskirt, or red tennis shoes, or skyscrapers.

Could ideas even plausibly be protected? The Galombosians, a fringe 
subset of libertarians, argue that ideas are protectable in this way. 
"You were influenced by my paper on crypto anarchy, so you owe me $25."

Ideas are even better examples of public goods. A good idea benefits 
many people, few or none of whom ever pay for the idea. Good ideas are 
in fact more important than nearly anything else. This has nothing to do 
with whether they should (or can) be protected as intellectual 
property...or subsidized by government, as I'll get to later.

Apply this reasoning to the general world of ideas and arguments.

Or, more prosaically, to mathematical proofs. Should we start charging 
for mathematical proofs? Should someone planning to use a chain of 
proofs pay a fee for the various lemmas and theorems he cites or uses?

> The traditional way to provide for public goods is by government.

No it isn't. People paint paintings even when the vast bulk of them 
never sell anything. (Even well-known painters like Paul Gaugain never 
made more than a few francs from his paintings...his fame came after his 
death. Examples like this abound.)

Most actors don't make enough money to qualify for their union. Most 
writers never sell _anything_.

Some of these works are used by others, inspire others, even are later 
sold by others.

Altruism? Have I written upwards of 20,000 articles on this list and 
others. At least some of them were and are useful for other people. And 
yet was I paid?  Was I generating a public good? Should I have demanded 
that government finance my generation of these public goods?

About 20 years ago the American program "60 Minutes" did a nice piece on 
how the Dutch government, using reasoning identical to yours,  was 
paying artists a stipend for their artistic output. Warehouses and 
warehouses were being filled with the crud generated by these subsidized 
artists.

So? Not my problem.

After all, most would-be writers and actors can't make enough money on 
their ideas and artistic expression to live on without also working as 
waiters and waitresses and driving trucks.

And to fill warehouses with CDs no one wants, with paintings no one 
wants, with stages where actors perform plays for each other because the 
public won't voluntarily pay, and with software programs which the 
market didn't want.

I have no problem with Microsoft or Apple or Autodesk attempting to 
protect their IP by requiring that I buy a dongle from them to attach to 
my computer, or that I provide a palmprint or retinal scan before their 
programs run. If they can do it, and get customers to go along, hey, 
it's a free country! People who are willing to mess with the dongles, or 
attach a palm scanner, or jump through whatever hoops the vendor is 
asking for will be doing so voluntarily. Those who won't, won't. Sounds 
fair to me.

(In fact, dongles have been tried. And may be tried again, as USB and 
FireWire make use of such dongles less awkward. It's a free country, so 
Digital Datawhack is free to do as they wish along these lines.)

However, it is NOT a function of a legitimate minimal government to 
*require* that I buy a computer with certain features.

To the extent the Hollywood-led push to adopt some form of DRM is very 
likely to also be a government _requirement_ for DRM, we should fight 
it. From what I have seen, the interests of Hollywood, Redmond, 
Washington, Beijing, and Moscow in DRM are coterminous.
