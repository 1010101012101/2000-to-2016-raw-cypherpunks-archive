Blackmail was already illegal; this just makes some kinds of
blackmail a Federal crime with enhanced penalties,
which I'm not convinced is particularly necessary.

The kind of abuse that's been in the papers that's probably what
this law is designed to make a show of opposing is
illegal immigrants being kept in indentured servitude by 
the coyotes who import them.  It's mostly Asians working in
the garment industry in California, but there are probably
other large groups like this as well.



				Thanks!
