The NSA Data Center is bit more complicated than the usual
commercial hotel or center, and perhaps is unprecedented,
thus haunted by errata.

It is composed of two apparently identical facilities, mirror
images of one another, connected by an administrative
block.

Each facility has a data unit, a pair of 16-generator units,
a bank of cooling towers, fuel tanks and appurtances.

There is a single conventional electrical sub-station for
the complex.

It is it not known if both facilities were affected or only
one of them.

Nor is not known whether the power surges came from the
conventional electrical power system or the generators,
or from testing the emergency shutdown of the conventional
and the kick-in of the back-up gen sets.

Perhaps both powered up briefly simultaneously, overloaded
surge protectors failed, excessive juice blasted the cables,
panels, processors. The relatively small dollar amounts
indicate that only some parts were affected.

An odd feature is the banana shape, with non-parallel
units, whether for aesthetics or to avoid some unknown
richochet of parallelism so common in DoD and most other
facilities.

Imagine that the lack of parallelism, surely due to the conceit
of crazed design architects eager to be different from insanely
rational engineers, caused bizarre effects, or the engineers
fought back with the customary make-work sabotage.

This theory is most pleasing to this nuthouse designer. It fits
the welter of new USG facilities worldwide which appear to
have been designed by and for the bureaucratcially insane,
aptly, expense not even considered, exemplary bloat essential,
security bollixed to the max, national debt boosting cost
over-runs and late completion obligatory for congressional
inspection junkets, followed quickly by applaudable manifold
jobs making repair of faults, corrections of errant design, IG
investigations squelched and bigger appropriations next time.

For evidence peruse the the bloated list of USG and
commercial work by the data center architects, KlingStubbins.
This is USACE and GSA heaven-sent pork unbridled by
modesty of pre-911 war-winding-down pecuniousness.

Then see the twisted edifice psycholpathology spread: the mirror-funhouse
new headquarters for Canadian Communications Security Establishment
in which the architects have been Boozed-Allened to barbarize disorienting
havoc in concert with the agency's mission to cackle and banshee at
the humongous wastage:

This is what has come from the massively copulating Internet,
data, metadata, teradata, supercalifornication data. Imaginary
only to be sure, processors idled, generators asleep, power
errantly dribbling like release of Snowden's imaginary booze
distillery.
