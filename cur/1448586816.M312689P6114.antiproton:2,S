Ron Paul is starting to be heard. It's a good sign.
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/ron-paul-neocon-wolf-door/ri11437

Especially when this is what the neocons currently controlling America
do to the voices of reason:
Former US Defense Chief Backs International Coalition Against ISIS (Chuck Hagel)
http://russia-insider.com/en/chuck-hagel-backs-international-coalition-against-isis/ri11463
(Sacked by Obama late last year.)


In other news:

Turkish Prime Minister declares he personally gave the order to shoot
down Russian jet the other day:
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/i-gave-order-myself-turkish-pm-downing-russian-plane/ri11456
(I was initially surprised and suspect Erdogan required Davutoglu put
his head on the public chopping block, but who knows ...)

The German media seem to be steadily getting it:
Evidence Is Mounting That Islamic State Is Offspring of the US
http://russia-insider.com/en/afraid-truth-islamic-state-offspring-us/ri11408

Depending on your mindset, may bring a smile to a weary face:
The Classic Rules For Combating Turkish Aggression
http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/classic-rules-combatting-turkish-aggression/ri11446

And a reminder once again, political discourse within Russian
population is -way- ahead of Australia, USA, etc (thank God there is
some discourse somewhere on a broader scale than a niche mailing
list):
How Ordinary Russians See the Western-Russian Stand Off

PS Not sure anyone noticed, but I am finding russia-insider.com to be
quite a good aggregation site, as well putting out their own articles
and opinion pieces here and there.
