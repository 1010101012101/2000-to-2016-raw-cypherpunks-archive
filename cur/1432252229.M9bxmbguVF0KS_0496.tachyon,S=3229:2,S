Yoel Marcus's man of the year.(extracts)
The "butterfly affect" has been proved true.A new year has begun in which 
lone individuals are
capable of changing,or at least disrupting,the new world order.At any given 
moment there is
someone in the world plotting to screw the system.The more technologically 
advanced the country,
the more vulnerable it is in the face of obsessed loners,Ideological 
fanatics and maniacs.
Capturing or killing Osama bin laden wont halt the phenomena or lessen the 
risk.Maybe just
the opposite.At a time when every psychopath is king,when civilization is 
the target and at
a loss for what to do,the person of the year is the anonymous loner 
masterminding the next
terrorist spectacular.(published in Ha'aretz and the age.)
