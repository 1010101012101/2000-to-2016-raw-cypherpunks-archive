**TeleSeminarsrus Presents The First Ever InternetSeminar, Featuring 
David 'Covered Call King' Skidmore**

	You enjoyed him for the TeleSeminar and you wanted more, well we talked 
him into doing an hour long InternetSeminar On Saturday Morning, December 8th.

Here is what some have had to say about David:

'I made $3,500 using David Skidmore's techniques after listening in on the 
TeleSeminar on November 8th.  Thank You TeleSeminarsrus.com' - John S., Part-
Time Trader, NC.

'I made $400 in 3.5 days playing NSM, one of David's picks.  David You Are The 
Man!'  - Michael B., 31, Founder of TeleSeminarsrus.com, Trader, K.C., MO

Here are some Challenges With Covered Calls:

*	You may have tried this strategy and failed. It is not your fault.  You 
were taught Covered Calls incorrectly.  You do not know the finer points of 
Covered Calls that can mean the difference between a 15% gain and a 12% loss 
per month!
	
*	You may have tried this strategy and lost a lot of money. By learning a 
couple of David's key money management techniques you will trim losses easily 
and naturally.
	
*	You may have been told lies about this strategy. Most of the traders 
that do Covered Calls lose big time, because they don't know what they don't 
know!
	
*	You may have paid big money to a seminar company to teach it to you 
incorrectly. There are seminar guys that are out there teaching you the wrong 
way to do Covered Calls.  If you try to do Covered Calls their way you are 
almost 100% guaranteed to lose!  These guys shouldn't be allowed to teach you 
unless they have made the kind of money David has made with Covered Calls.
	
*	You may have been sucked in by this strategy because it doesn't involve 
any work and it can pay you big. Once you really learn how to do Covered Calls 
David’s way, you can make money and still have a life or job.


Here is what David Is Going To Be Covering:

1.  Stock Picking
2.  Stock Analysis  
3.  Call and Premium Analysis
