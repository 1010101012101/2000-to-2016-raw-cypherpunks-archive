If the information is the history of human civilization, that may very well 
end up being information of great "negative fitness"! (We shall see...)

Actually, from what I understand, there are huge swathes of every creature's 
genetic code made up of "useless" information. Some of these areas are 
apparently extremely old and do not change very often...as I remember Hillis 
(the guy who started "Thinking Machines" and is currently working on the 
Decamillineal clock) identified such an area in the cockroaches DNA and had 
the info inserted there. (Our own DNA has apparently a lot of junk also, as 
well as fragments of various encounters we've had over the aeons...there are 
apparently significant chunks of various viruses' DNA in there and other 
stuff...)

Although some things in a cockroach change pretty often (here in New York we 
are breeding a variety of extremely manueverable cockroaches....), the DNA 
of the cockroach I think is extremely stable overall (aren't they like 100s 
of millions of years old?)
