I just knew somebody was going to bring Wilson's trilogy up. I think
there are actually four books (a conspiracy by the Gnomes of Zurich I
bet), I've seen the first three bound together in pbk.

I found it tedious and much less than funny. To each their own. I did like
the card game that Steve Jackson Games did for it. It's still available
(do we have a new category, crypto/math games?).
