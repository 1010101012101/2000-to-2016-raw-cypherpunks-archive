The bias of the US news media is most clearly demonstrated by the general 
absence of questions or discussion along the lines of "For months the US 
sought a resolution from the UN authorizing an attack to 'disarm Saddam of 
his weapons of mass destruction'. Now where are the weapons of mass 
destruction? Has the US done the equivalent of shooting a man holding his 
ID instead of a gun, but on a scale of tens of thousands? Wasn't WMD simply 
a pretext for starting a war of aggression that had been long planed and 
desired?"
