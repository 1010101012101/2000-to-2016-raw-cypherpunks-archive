Steve:
An interesting project, and I wish you well. You may be in a good position
to respond to nastygrams that lawyers beating up on free software projects
send. But it strikes me that if you want to get involved in even a semi-serious
legal defense, it may be more than you can afford pro bono unless you're
at a large law firm. Even the PETA case (which I wrote about today for 
Wired) involves over $300K in legal fees and misc. expenses, and that was just
over a domain name.
