Veridian green is entryist, not commie.  The watermelons would 
perceive it as right entryist, or libertarian entryist.

The standard green viewpoint is that if socialism retarded the 
advance of technology and lowered everyone's standard of 
living, that is actually a good thing.   The Veridian green 
viewpoint is pro capitalist, and pro progress.

As living standards rise, we are going to spend more on
intangibles and natural beauty, and the interesting question is
how to do this in a capitalist, hi-tech, framework.
