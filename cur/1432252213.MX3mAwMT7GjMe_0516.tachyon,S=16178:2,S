Rush,

You certainly are an earnest fellow, but that doesn't get you very far. It 
seems to me that folks like you, who are college sophomores with the 
unfortunate experience of one or two undergraduate political science 
classes, don't have much to contribute to cypherpunkly discussions. Your 
points, such as they are, might be better made on alt.politics.banal-ideas.

You:
* Don't seem to understand the nature of modern political parties
* Don't seem to understand the nature of checks and balances
* Don't seem to understand how Washington works, and the interplay between 
the legislative branch, executive branch, lobbyists, and advocacy groups
* Have not read the basic literature that would enable us to take you seriously

My participation in this sad discussion is now over, except that I will 
volunteer a reading list for you at some later point.

-Declan
