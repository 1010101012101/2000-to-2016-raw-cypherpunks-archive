In response to a question about whether she would favor a Constitutional
amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, a Fox Fake News
Channel bimbo responded, "I want a Constitutional amendment so Arnold can
be President."

Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center has characterized Arnold
as having "done more to further the cause of Holocaust awareness than
almost any other Hollywood star."  Rabbi Hier also points out that Arnold
makes regular substantial constributions to the Wiesenthal Center, and has
raised millions for the Holocaust Memorial Trust in Los Angeles.

So how exactly, one might ask, does Arnold's view of America's Manifest
Destiny to rule the world and his unconditional love of the Jewish people
and Israel differ from Bush's view of America's Manifest Destiny to rule
the world and his unconditional love of the Jewish people and Israel.

Or the view of any other major Neocon?

Watch for this President Arnold movement to gather steam.  Who knows, once
the naturally born restriction on Presidents is removed, Ariel Sharon
could be the US President after Arnold, bringing the Neoconservative
nonsense full circle.
