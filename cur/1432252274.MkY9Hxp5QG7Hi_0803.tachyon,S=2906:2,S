You rang?

Herr Agent Provocateur Shamrock, here you go:

IMHO, this is the best bomb making recipie in the world.  It's amazing
how destructive it can be.

I think this is a much more better thing for you LEO's to be doing than
sitting around eating donuts all day and looking for porn.  Yes, the world
would be a much better place if you guys made more of these kinds of
bombs.

They work well whether you drop them from airplanes, or send them through
the mail, or hell even better, just deliver them in person.
