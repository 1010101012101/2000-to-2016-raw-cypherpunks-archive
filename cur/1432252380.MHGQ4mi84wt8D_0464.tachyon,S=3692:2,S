Possibly confused with this bunker buster:
Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28) 
BLU-113 Penetrator 

The Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28) is a special weapon developed for penetrating hardened Iraqi command centers located deep underground. The GBU-28 is a 5,000-pound
laser-guided conventional munition that uses a 4,400-pound penetrating warhead. The bombs are modified Army artillery tubes, weigh 4,637 pounds, and contain 630 pounds of
high explosives. They are fitted with GBU-27 LGB kits, 14.5 inches in diameter and almost 19 feet long. The operator illuminates a target with a laser designator and then the
munition guides to a spot of laser energy reflected from the target. 

Much more likely.  Hard to imagine a scenario where tacnukes would be deployed.
