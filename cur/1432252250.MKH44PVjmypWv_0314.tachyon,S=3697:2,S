Hi,
    I came across your addies in a search off ask Jeeves and thought perhaps 
due to the way your interests run you might be up on this topic. I'm a Sr. 
Support Analyst for a large vendor and recently was asked by one of my 
casual internet contacts if there was a way to prevent a "keyboard logging" 
surveillance program from prevailing on their system and reporting the 
goings on from their keyboard. In an effort to be helpful, I set about my 
normal pattern of research and found that there seems to be a ton of info 
promoting various products, yet there is virtually nothing I could find 
which offers any realistic or reliable countermeasures that can be taken to 
prevent someone from logging the output from your keyboard. Even the hackers 
seem to think it isn't a threat to anyone's privacy. Weird...
     So anyway, all I'm asking is that should you know where I can find 
resources that assist me in defeating such software (especially if it's 
undetected), I would gratefully accept any guidance you could offer. That's 
all I need, I won't take anymore of your time.
Peace,
Tom (aka Santa)
