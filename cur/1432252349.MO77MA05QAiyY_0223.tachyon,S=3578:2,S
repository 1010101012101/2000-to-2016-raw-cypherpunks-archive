  Hello,
 
 One of the biggest turnoffs in Internet Marketing is the need to recruit others 
to do the same thing in order to make money and even when people sign up, with 
the best of intentions, a very high proportion drop out soon after.

THERE IS NO NEED TO RECRUIT WITH THIS BUSINESS.

If you decide to recruit there is a referral payment of  (#500) and you could 
recruit without doing anything, as there is an optional, built-in facility on 
your web site. However, you do not need to recruit to make money. There is an 
initial payment of (#50) to cover domain registration but you do not have to 
pay for the site until you are earning (#10,000) per month. They do everything 
to get you started and provide instructions after that. All you need is a computer. 
The business is based in London, England and will pay in any currency.

The downside, if you want to call it that, is that the business involves the 
number-one money maker on the net, though it is strictly legal and discrete. 
Under the circumstances, I will only send you the URL for further information 
if you request it sending an email to 

statiro@yahoo.com 

and putting "PLEASE SEND" in the subject heading. There is a limit to the number 
of sites, so don't delay. You could miss out on a very big opportunity and somebody 
has to do it.

  Kindest regards,

           Christian
