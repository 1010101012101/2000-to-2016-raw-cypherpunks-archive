Hi,

We've talked a bit about sat phone security on this list - I'm glad that
these guys have made their research public:
http://cryptanalysis.eu/blog/2012/02/02/dont-trust-satellite-phones-the-gmr-1-and-gmr-2-ciphers-have-been-broken/

"In a nutshell, they were able to reverse engineer and to break the
secret ciphers used in many satellite phone systems, namely the GMR-1
and the GMR-2 ciphers."

I hope that their research helps to put these questions about sat phone
security to rest. They did an amazing job.

All the best,
Jacob
