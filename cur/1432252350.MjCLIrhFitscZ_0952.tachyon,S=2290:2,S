I once created an explosive in the kitchen:

I didn't tighten the lid securely on a pressure-cooker (I think I was
cooking beans).  The eventual burst and the slam of the lid against the
ceiling was . . . startlingly surprising.  No damage, but certainly loud and
alarming.

Good recipe for a dinner disaster.
