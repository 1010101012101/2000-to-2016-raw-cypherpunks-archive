 Federal program to monitor everyone on the road

Interesting article about the Fed's plans to develop an all-knowing 
intelligent highway system.

    Most people have probably never heard of the agency, called the 
Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office. And they haven't 
heard of its plans to add another dimension to our national road system, 
one that uses tracking and sensor technology to erase the lines between 
cars, the road and the government transportation management centers from 
which every aspect of transportation will be observed and managed.

    For 13 years, a powerful group of car manufacturers, technology 
companies and government interests has fought to bring this system to 
life. They envision a future in which massive databases will track the 
comings and goings of everyone who travels by car or mass transit. The 
only way for people to evade the national transportation tracking system 
they're creating will be to travel on foot. Drive your car, and your every 
movement could be recorded and archived. The federal government will know 
the exact route you drove to work, how many times you braked along the 
way, the precise moment you arrived -- and that every other Tuesday you 
opt to ride the bus.
