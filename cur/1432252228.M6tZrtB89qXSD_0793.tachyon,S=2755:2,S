Well, we have 13 slightly active posters, plus 10 cluesless lurkers, 
and 7 HomeSec and CIA and B'Nai Brith Anti-Hate League spies. So, yeah, 
it adds up to about 30.

Between the incipient statism so many of them express and the laughable 
subscriber base, it just confirms to me that the cause is lost. I hope 
Al Qaida at least manages to destroy Washington and New York and their 
statists and animalistic welfare breeders. Thirty million "people of 
color," as they prefer to be called these days, need to be sent up the 
chimneys. (For their crimes, their collection of welfare and other 
benefits, not for their skin color, per se. That so many of the 
"niggaz" and "Aztlanos" are criminal is not something I concern myself 
about...our only concern should be to exterminate those who have stolen 
from us.
