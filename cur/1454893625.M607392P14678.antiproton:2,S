I had a bit of downtime this afternoon so I read the above Wikipedia 
article that Jim linked to.  I'm mildly disturbed by the fact that I seem 
to have no recollection of this incident...

On the surface: it appears that a disturbed individual, with a known 
history of mental illness and an established interest in weapons and/or 
explosives, had an unspecified familial dispute and crafted a premeditated 
attack that also involved numerous unaffiliated strangers.

I have not read all the linked articles listed in the reference section, 
but it does not appear that they are seeking others who may have been 
involved or carrying out an ongoing investigation.

How are you supposed to have been involved, Ryan?  What reason do they give 
for this supposed connection?  Is it some bogus parallel construction?

Also:

Why did you withdraw your request?

I have no idea of the veracity of the claims made or the soundness of mind 
of the person making said claims, but I also would not put anything past 
some of the corrupt LE in this world.

My curiosity is piqued and I'm a neutral party, so I'm all ears/eyes if 
you'd like to clarify.  Many of us here are skilled at finding things and 
might be of some help.  I assume that's one reason why you've posted?
