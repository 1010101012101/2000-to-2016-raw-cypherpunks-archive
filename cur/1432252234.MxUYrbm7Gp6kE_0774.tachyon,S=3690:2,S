Yep. Most laptops have a video card for attaching an external monitor,
with an unshielded port - they thus spray out monitor-driving RF signals
while they run, regardless of whether there is a monitor out there to
receive them. 

Of course, a *good* laptop design would power off the video card if it's
not in use, to extend battery life if nothing else. I don't know if they do
this.

One of my home systems is a Compaq desktop with an LCD screen. It 
does *not* use a standard video cable: there is a pure digital interface for
the LCD. (I've never investigated as to whether I can seperately remove the
SVGA card or interface).
