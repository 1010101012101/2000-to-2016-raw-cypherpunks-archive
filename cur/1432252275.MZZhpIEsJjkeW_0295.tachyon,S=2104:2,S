The 419ers aren't the starving poor - they know exactly what they 
are doing and have got the resources to do it.   And they have no 
scruples about ripping off fellow Africans either. Getting rid of

Nigeria's a big country. Nearly everyone there is poor. But there 
are still a great many rich. And not many of them got rich honestly.
