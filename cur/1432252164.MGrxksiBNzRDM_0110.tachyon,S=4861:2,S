I'll recount it, but not recant it.

Think of spacetime diagrams, a la the lightcones of Minkowski 
diagrams. Events A and B precede Event C.

The same kind of diagrams obviously apply in ordinary events, without 
regard to the speed of light. A directed acyclig graph (DAG) of 
various events, some in the "causal chain" leading to some Event C, 
some outside the causal chain.

Pearl addresses Bayesian networks in terms of DAGs and provides tools 
for analyzing when events actually "cause" other events. Of great 
interest for deciding when, for example, some drug test produces 
meaningful results, when some legal proof of causality is being 
challenged, etc.

Pearl doesn't produce some magical formula for separating causes from 
non-causes, just a bunch of theorems and corollaries which may be 
useful in policy analysis, experiment design, and just thinking about 
the world. I think of it as a kind of "network analysis," akin to 
tools for circuit analysis (like Kirchoff's Law, for example).

More discussion is of course available at Amazon or in search engines.
