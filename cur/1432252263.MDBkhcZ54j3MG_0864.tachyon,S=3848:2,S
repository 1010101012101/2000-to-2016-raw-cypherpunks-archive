On a similar "pulling out all the stops" note, I'll betcha a nickel that
the early indicators of biological weapons use and the potential for
nuclear and chemical attacks means that the CIA gets first dibs on
prisoner interrogations with no restrictions on methods. Hard to not
approve, actually, when you consider that something like variola can
have ~30% mortality and would have likely nearly 100% infection rate.
Rules? Screw the rules.
