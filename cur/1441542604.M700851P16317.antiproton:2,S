TBF, Servo is kind of a total rewrite of exactly the sort the world needs: memory and type safe from the ground up.

What Servo needs then (besides 'completion') is a type/memory safe JS engine to replace Gecko, and likewise a LibreSSL-like replacement for OpenSSL.

While they've got nothing to lose though, they should go further than a mere reboot. They should resume *leading* FFS, for example by making their JS engine strict by default so they become the go-to development browser again. "If it works on FF it will work anywhere" would be a nice selling point I think.

They should also take privacy seriously and totally rethink their funding model. Patreon? Premium versions? I don't care, almost anything but built-in ads and bloatware will do. 

Baking in P2P in a real way would be nice. WebRTC-based replacement for Bittorrent Sync? Peer to Peer calls using Jitsi instead of (vomit) "Hello"? P2P filesharing and content publication, backed by subscription for "available while I'm offline"?

Loads of scope for Mozilla and not enough vision. I hate Google more than what Mozilla are becoming but that doesn't mean I'm proud to use FF. It kills my battery, WebRTC is still broken, and it keeps getting worse.
