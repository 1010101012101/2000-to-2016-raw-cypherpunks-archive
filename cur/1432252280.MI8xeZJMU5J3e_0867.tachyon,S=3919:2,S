Good point.  Channelling Hettinga, crypto is economics.

Fair 'nuff.  You know that 5 year predictions are too conservative, and
20 year predictions too liberal.  Ask Orwell.

My point is only that they will be killed should they leak their
actual capabilities.

a manic mechanic, okay?

Ergo my dark fiber remark, even if naif.

What I meant was, Ames and that FBI dude Hansen (sp?), at least the KGB
got Ames' wife as part of the package, whereas the FBI CI dude
let his wife off as part of the deal he cut.  Nice xian that he was, he
was
into strippers.

All under $2e6, all capable of reading their own records.  Go figure,
eh?

See you in Athens, or before :-)
