The DoD's Computer Investigations Training Program offered its first class, 
Introduction to Computer Search and Seizure, in September 1998.


The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is awarding a contract worth US$86.9 
million to train cybercrime fighters.


According to news sources, the DoD announced that the contract will go to 
Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), an El Segundo, California-based firm 
with over 68,000 employees and revenue for its last fiscal year of $11.1 
billion.


Computer Sciences will use the money to assist the DoD's Computer 
Investigations Training Program (DCITP), instructing various agencies in 
the best methods for combating computer-based crime and for maintaining the 
security of defense-related computer networks from counterintelligence and 
other incursions.


Agencies whose operatives receive training under DCITP include the Naval 
Criminal Investigative Service, the Army Criminal Investigations Division, 
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Defense Computer 
Forensics Lab, the Defense Criminal Investigative Services and the 902nd 
Military Intelligence Group.
