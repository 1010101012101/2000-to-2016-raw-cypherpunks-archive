Are you equating passive attacks with active attacks? If I understand
how CryptoCat works correctly, it is resistant against passive
interception attacks, whereas Google Chat stores cleartext on Google
servers, which are easily accessible to law enforcement. Active
attacks against SSL can be mitigated by pinning CryptoCat
certificates, so you are left with what, compromise of server
infrastructure? That requires LE jurisdiction where the servers are
located, domain expertise, and dealing with the risk that the
compromise is detected. All that vs. Google servers, which, if I
remember right, provide a friendly interface to user accounts once
served with a simple wiretapping order (and as has been already
mentioned, Google is a multinational corporation, subject to a
multitude of jurisdictions, and is known to bend over for whoever is
in charge).
