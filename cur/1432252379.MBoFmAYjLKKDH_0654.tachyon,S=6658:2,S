I don't get it.  Why would Google ever know anything about your Wifi? If  
you choose to make your ssid publicly broadcast, it's publicly broadcast. 
At least they admit to it unlike the tens of other people who discovered 
it.  Is the complaint that they've just reduced the cost to centralized the 
info and made it searchable?  Likewise, if you don't properly password 
protect that publicly broadcast ssid, you will have people using it.  If 
you care anything about security, not to mention privacy, you shouldn't be 
broadcasting that at all.

I have a better idea, we should have a campaign that everyone change their 
ssid to "wireless," "netgear," "linksys," or "default."
