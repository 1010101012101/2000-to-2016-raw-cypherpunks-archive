I don't know what "NIPC" means, but I thought at first you meant that 
NIPC was in Lithuania. Perhaps not.

But the point is still interesting: recall that Louis Freeh and the 
other spook chiefs were making much about sending teams over to 
Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Lithuania, etc. to teach them the 
essentials of creating a _modern_ police state.

No doubt Carnivore is being deployed outside the U.S., and without a 
_fraction_ of the public discussiong being seen here.

(BTW, there is little discussion of the commercial espionage aspects 
of Carnivore. I know that Intel must be thrilled at the prospect that 
a Carnivore box attached to some node that their traffic flows 
through will suck up all of _Intel's_ traffic. With luck, it will 
convince companies like Intel and Microsoft to much more widely 
deploy crypto for communications which might be intercepted by 
Carnivores.)
