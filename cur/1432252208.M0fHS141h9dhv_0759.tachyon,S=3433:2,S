In this framework where does your right to refuse entry to your 
private residence come from?

In my mind this is all about property rights.  He (the business 
owner) doesn't have a right to make a property, he has the right to 
say what persons can and cannot do on his property.  If they refuse 
to comply he has the right to ask them to leave and possibly resort 
to force to remove them.  If money has been involved in the exchange 
(ie, the lesbians bought a ticket) they have a right to demand 
compensation IF their actions were not explicitly banned.  The owners 
reasons do not have to be moral, reasonable, intelligent, or even 
rationale.  It's his property.
