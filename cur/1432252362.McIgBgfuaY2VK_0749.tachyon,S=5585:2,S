Subject: Re: PDA versions of Speak Freely

 >> Has anyone else been working on a PDA version of SpeakFreely?

To my knowledge, nobody is working on this.  Several people have expressed
interest in such a package, but nobody has yet lifted a coding stick to
create one.

If you have a GCC environment, Speak Freely should port to almost any
platform with little difficulty; the main problem is coming to terms
with audio support.  The iPAQ should have adequate CPU power for any
normal Speak Freely compression and encryption mode.  If there is
handheld-specific code which belongs in the Speak Freely distribution,
I am perfectly willing to integrate it in the next release.

Next week I hope to post a "bleeding edge early-adopter" version of
Speak Freely for Unix 7.5.  This version will (*gasp*) compile without
any -Wall warnings from gcc 2.96, include Ivan Popov's fix for transmission
of face images in encrypted sessions, correct the lingering problems
with LPC-10 compression not working with this or that compiler
and optimisation modes and include, for the first time, support
for FS 1016 4800 baud CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction) encoding.
The latter CODEC will be initially supported only in *nix versions
of Speak Freely, and integrated into the Windows version some time
in the future.  I've always considered Speak Freely to have a secondary
mission of serving as a "reference implementation" of network audio
algorithms, and CELP is the latest addition to this list (even though
GSM is adequate for the vast majority of users).

Bashing the CELP code into something you can just "make" has taken a
lot longer than I anticipated, which is why this release is so late.
I hope to have something for you to try sometime next week, but
I won't announce it until it passes all my tests on Linux,
Solaris, and SGI IRIX here.

The Speak Freely for Unix 7.5 release will be 100% ANSI C; if you
need to build it on legacy compilers, you'll need to run it through
ANSI2KNR or an equivalent translator.

Let's think about what a PDA version should be.  Should it be a scrambler,
a dial-up (or GSM, etc.) VoIP bridge, or application running under a
network-enabled OS?
