Well, what do you *think* I'm saying?  Perhaps I could clarify my post.

I fail to see the relevance.  

Domestic security services haven't spent the last few decades co-opting
the press for nothing.  As far as I'm concerned, it is ludicrous to
suggest that quasi-offical state press organs will produce product that
will in any way be candidate materials for classification as subversive
publications.

This premise, however, depends somewhat on the observation that the
so-called left and right-wing divisions of the political spectrum are
largely illusory.  The most strident critics of diametric political
opposites in the press and elsewhere would disagree, but their very
occupations are rather dependent upon the perception that the evident
differences in ideology are more than superficial.  But as far as I'm
concerned, there is no meaningful difference in most cases.

Uh-huh.

Yes, but in the wrong way.  Which makes you either an idiot or a JBT
troll.  Possibly both.

I agree that cell-phones are scary devices, but only because they are
proprietary, and because the phone companies are just as bad as the press
when it comes to co-operating with the so-called law-enfocement community.
 Anyone recall Operation Sundevil and friends?

Uh-huh.  Y'know the police planted a stupid story in the local media here
(toronto) not too long ago.  They said that some wack-job had been
deterred from going on a psychotic rampage with his evil guns because he
met a friendly dog in a park, and that the dog made him re-assess his
homocidal/suicidal ideation.  I imgaine the people who thought that one up
should cut down on their intake of hallucinogens and laughing gas.

As for propogating the silly idea that bombs can be detonated by
remote-control with a cell-phone trigger... Well, that's really fucking
stupid.  Any half-wit could do just as good a job with a one-way pager, or
a digital watch -- if he were not so inclined as to cobble toghether a 555
timer and some glue in a shielded enclosure.

As I mentioned elsewhere, science, logic, and fact have no major role to
play in the operation of courts or law enforcement today.  That should be
inexcusable to anyone who expects to rely on science, logic, or fact in
any other areas of life; such as medicine or transportation, for instance.

Well ain't that just too fuckin' bad.
