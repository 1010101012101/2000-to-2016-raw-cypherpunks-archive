World-first technology combines payment card and authentication in a single
device



October 24, 2007 A next-generation credit card that incorporates a
12-button keyboard, a microprocessor and an embedded alphanumeric display
promises to provide unprecedented security in phone and online banking
transactions.

Appearing in the standard form of a payment card, the Credit Card Embedded
Authentication Device has a number of authentication 'modes' for use in
online, phone, or ATM transactions. For example, a user can enter his or
her secret PIN into the card's keypad to receive a numeric passcode for
one-time use. To authorize a banking transaction, the passcode is entered
into an interface and instantly validated by an authentication server. This
process removes the need to enter a PIN into an unsecure device such as a
web browser and provides a user-friendly defense against electronic banking
fraud - a problem that costs financial institutions an estimated $4 billion
annually.

Developed jointly by Innovative Card Technologies and eMue Technologies,
the device was recently recognized at InfoSecurity's Tomorrow's Technology
Today Awards and picked up the "Judge's Choice" and "Technical Achievement"
Ilan Awards presented at ICMA's Annual Card Manufacturing and
Personalization Expo in San Diego.

The Ilan awards recognize card design innovation and technical achievement
in the card manufacturing industry, and are judged by an independent panel
of ICMA associate members, industry notables and international journalists.

The Credit Card Embedded Authentication Device will make its consumer debut
at Cartes & IDentification in Paris November 13-15, 2007.
