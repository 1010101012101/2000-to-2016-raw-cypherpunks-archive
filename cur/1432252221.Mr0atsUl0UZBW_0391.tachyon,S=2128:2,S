What I object to are corporations who utilize their power (money) to influence 
governments to make laws that benefit them at the expense of others.

- The DMCA
- Tariffs AND Free Trade Agreements
- H1-B visas

Even Ayn Rand weaves this into "Atlas Shrugged" where the competitors of 
Reardon Steel get the government to try and force him to give them his 
formula for his high-strength steel because it's putting them out business 
and "unfair".

Company's that do this are no better than Tim's "Welfare mutants" and probably 
worse because they have a much larger impact.

But I don't see him calling for their "vaporization". 

It would screw up his stock portfolio.
