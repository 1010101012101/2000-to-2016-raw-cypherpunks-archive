DES/ECB, originally with a 40-bit key, more recently with 56-bit and 3DES.
Keys generated by the manufacturer onto a USB dongle.  No easy way to make
backups of the dongle.  It's a messy tradeoff: If you want something like
laptop/data-theft-protection (which will suit the majority of the market),
then DES-40/ECB is fine, but you want to be able to back up the dongle because
if that goes (and after multiple insertions and removals it will) you've lost
all your data.  OTOH if you want protection from the MIB the fragile nature of
the key storage is probably a benefit, but then you want 3DES/CBC to go with
it.  At the moment you have laptop-theft-protection crypto and MIB-protection
key storage.

You can buy truckloads of these things on ebay for about $20 a pop if you want
to play with one.

Peter.
