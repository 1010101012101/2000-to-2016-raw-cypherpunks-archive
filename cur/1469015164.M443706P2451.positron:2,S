Yes doping is a huge fucking problem in every country that can afford it. However, the US of Ass, as tyrannical a bunch of fucks as they are, have not had a whistle blower like Roschenkov come forward and make broad claims that there is US govmt sponsored doping program, with the CIA acting as facilitators for clean blood / urine / drugs...  as your surely must know, this has happened for Russia.

I would swear it seems like you must be getting paid by the FSB for much of this pro-Russian Rah-rah-Putin-is-our-man shit you spout Zen, if I didn't know better ;) (which I don't) Or maybe it's "ideological"
