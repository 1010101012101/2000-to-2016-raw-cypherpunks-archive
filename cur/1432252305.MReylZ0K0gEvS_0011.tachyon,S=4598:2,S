That's the point :)  As a slice of experience, this business of creating  
new monies demands an integrity to economics that is uncompromising.  
Whatever your views, you will find them challenged.  The more you know,  
the better you'll be.  If you don't have a total commitment to the reality 
of people's financial habits, and a total commitment to being totally wrong 
from time to time, you'll find this business an unhappy one.

You are asking people to choose your form of money over others, and your  
customers will be incisive and brutal with your chosen set of  
presumptions.  Another thing you will need is a thick skin;  the ability  
to debate the real issues while not getting distracted by the sink into  
politics and verbal tit-for-tat.

Back in the good ol' days, Zooko and I used to run something called the  
Weber Economics Club.  Every week we would collect all the local monetary 
engineers and discuss one economics topic of interest.  I remember Coase's 
theorem one week, Schelling points another week.  For an hour ... and then 
the beer would steer us to other topics.  Which is probably good, as our 
group was filled with randians and marxists alike, and we wanted to survive 
the night.

We should have produced a poster, something like

"Beer - helping Randoids and Commies debate economics since 1862!"
