I facepalmed so hard when I read this.  I support and agree with both 
Razer's and Juan's replies to this post; I just didn't want to offend the 
netiquette-sensitive by posting +1 to both replies.

Totally miss the point.  Totally.

You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the 
focal point, the most important factor.  To me, it is the least important 
part of the equation.

Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?  It's a concept I have embraced for all 
of my adult life.  I don't have much money because I don't want it.  I 
don't use many resources because I like to tread lightly upon the earth, 
and I don't think it's fair if I have an abundance of something while 
others have none.  I'm not a capitalist, never have been nor will I ever 
be.  I agree with Razor's view of capitalism.  Juan's, too.

Nor do I have a god delusion that lets me shit all over the earth, be 
horrible to people and do whatever else I want as long as I say the magic 
words in a prayer and put an offering of filthy lucre in a basket for 
absolution.   This is the only shot I get at not being a totally useless 
garbage person.  My conscience won't allow me to mindlessly consume at the 
expense of the planet and other people.  I'm not sorry for that.

One aspect of the human cost of "shiny new crap" has already been pointed 
out by Razer.  I wasn't talking about the monetary cost to you (although 
paying €200/mo for a phone and laptop is incredibly unnecessary, imho.  But 
I like to have control over the operating systems of my devices, and see no 
reason to upgrade hardware to newer models if they're in good working order 
and meeting my needs.)

Do you get no sense of personal satisfaction from repairing something that 
would have gone into a landfill?  Or of building something exactly how you 
want it instead of buying overpriced, pressed particleboard crap that is 
toxic to both humans and the environment?  Where is your hacker ethic, man?

More appropriate is the question, what wouldn't you trade?  Things you no 
longer use or need for something you do.  Skills you have, for some your 
neighbor has (can be as simple as I'll help you repair and paint your 
porch, you help me sow and plant my garden.)  Trading child/ elder/ pet 
care, shared meals, errands... do you really have no friends or neighbors 
with whom you do this?

The list of what one wouldn't buy secondhand is much shorter. Yes, you can 
go into the Gap and buy a pair of pants for €70... but why would you want 
to?  So what if it takes me an hour to look through thrift store racks - 
for that $70, I'd come out with several pairs of perfectly nice pants, 
skirts, shirts... it's madness.

 I have a dresser for which I paid $20 at a thrift store, over 20 years 
ago.  It is made of sturdy, solid wood and in excellent condition, has 
survived cross-country trips and countless local moves.  Good luck with 
your Walmart junk!

That hour I "wasted" saving hundreds of $ or € in a thrift store?  I'll get 
it back by using commute time to read and catch up on things while taking 
the bus or train.  You'd be stuck driving in traffic (if you lived in my 
city; not sure how it is where you live), all stressed out.

What I don't buy used: undergarments, pillows, etc.  But I won't ever buy 
them at Walmart, either.

No. That's why I said *true* fair trade, a living fucking wage.  Not a bag 
of coffee from a corporate behemoth with a fake stamp on it.  Please, tell 
me you knew that and are just being cheeky?

So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor 
conditions & being paid subhuman wages, polluting the atmosphere by 
transporting this stuff for thousands of miles... instead of supporting the 
local businesses in your own community, if the price is right?  I can't 
even answer this.  Not without flaming.  I can't.

I don't intrinsically hate cars.  As was already mentioned, does everyone 
really need one (or more) of them, though?  Your CBA is flawed because, 
again, you're only thinking of yourself.  Your convenience, your money.  
There is an entire world around you.  You could start by cutting back on 
the amount of damage you do to it.

Public transport sucks sometimes, no doubt.  Get involved to make it 
better.  It's not wasted time if you use it to read, learn something new, 
chat with someone, or post random bullshit to public internet lists ;)

On nice days, biking is good exercise for those who are able.  Most of us 
don't get enough exercise as it is.

It is not ANY of these things.  Use that time on the bus to learn how to 
cook basic stuff!  Cook on the weekend while hanging out with 
friends/family or rocking out to music and make your lunches and dinner 
main dishes for the entire next week.  How is that not saving time, money 
and being good for your health?

It is, and much better for your health as well (not to mention, better for 
the animals!)

If the meat industry wasn't subsidized, you'd be paying $20/lb for 
hamburger.  If you're truly interested, read Diet for a New America by John 
Robbins (who was heir to The Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune and walked 
away from it all to lead a vegan, ethical life.)

It has America in the title but is applicable to all (we are just among the 
worst offenders, as with most things.)  There are several documentaries 
that show the horrors of factory farming; I'll list some if you'd like.  
Not only is it barbaric, it is extremely unhealthy for you.

Razer and Juan answered the rest of this with much more grace than I would.
