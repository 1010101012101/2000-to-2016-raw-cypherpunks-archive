You're an insolent twit. I didn't give URLs because the simplest of 
searches in Google turned up hundreds of hits describing overflight 
fees. My point was not to prove that overflight fees exist--directly 
contradicting your denial that they exist--but to show a _lot_ of 
references. I picked two at random.

And now you complain that I randomly picked one mentioning 
Cuba....but didn't give a URL. (Hint: add the word "Cuba" to the 
search if you are actually interested in retrieving the full article. 
But you are not, obviously. You just had to make a twittish quibble.)
