The "FAQ" is a joke, right? You know this is strictly a bush-league effort 
when you read:

"This diversity of libertarian viewpoints can make it quite difficult to 
have a coherent discussion with them, because an argument that is valid for 
or against one type of libertarianism may not apply to other types."


....you mean you actually have to LISTEN to people before you stick them in 
a conceptual box and slap your two-bit pre-made labels on them??? Say it 
ain't so!!!! Moron. 

You can take any philosophical position under the sun and always find 
idiots and straw men who "support" it to knock around, why should 
libertarianism be any different. There's plenty of room for real debate 
here, too bad he's not up for it. Oh well! 

(You got me to take the troll bait though, not bad... ;)
