=A0=A0=A0 One clue would come from my suspicion that agents of the Federal =
government, in March 1995, lured away the former resident of 7302 Corregido=
r (see=A0 http://www.redfin.com/WA/Vancouver/7302-Corregidor-Rd-98664/home/=
14565030=A0 ), the house immediately to the east of mine, and bought that h=
ouse.=A0 (In the picture provided, my house at 7214 Corregidor is just to t=
he left of the house shown.)=A0=A0 The prior resident was a local school (h=
igh school?) science teacher, and he was hired at the Pacific Northwest Nat=
ional Laboratories in Richland Washington, a Federal government laboratory =
akin to Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, etc. =A0http://www.pnl.g=
ov/=A0=A0 =0A=A0=A0=A0 The purpose of this was to be able to acquire that h=
ouse, and use it as a spying location against me. (The names ostensibly buy=
ing the house were Daniel J. and Dori J. Sabin, and they ran a remodeling o=
peration named "Sundown Development Construction Corporation".=A0 http://ww=
w.sundowndevelopmentconstruction.com/ =A0 ) =A0 Note that the date the hous=
e was sold is shown as March 10, 1995.=A0 (This is odd, because school teac=
hers' lives are oriented around the 'school year', which in most locations =
in America go from about September 1 to about June 1.=A0 They sign contract=
s with the school to work for that year, and are bound to do so. =A0 While =
I don't recall when the prior, lured occupant left, based on the sale date =
it appears that he sold that house months before the end of his school year=
.=A0 For a school teacher, this would have been highly unusual.)=A0=A0 =0A=
=A0=A0=A0 The sale price is shown as $180,000, which I think was rather hig=
h for that time. (But not unexpected if the government wanted to lure him a=
way quickly.=A0 Presumably he got a large raise, as well.)=A0 They immediat=
ely began an extensive remodeling and enlargement operation on that house, =
including adding a second floor.=A0 As I recall, this remodel took nearly a=
 year; seemingly the house was unoccupied during that time.=A0 Further, dur=
ing a long period very little work was actually being done, as I recall.=A0=
 (This remodeling would have dramatically increased the value of that house=
; the sale price in 1995 of $180,000 cannot be directly compared with the c=
urrent value of the much-larger and more-up-to-date house as it exists toda=
y.)=0A=A0 =A0 While I don't remember precisely the date I published the fir=
st part of my AP essay, I believe that it was no more than a few weeks prio=
r to March 10, 1995, on the 'Digitaliberty' discussion area.=A0=A0=A0=A0htt=
p://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/cud6105.htm =A0 (Hence my reference to Digi=
taliberty in the essay; it wasn't until many weeks later that I'd heard of =
the 'Cypherpunks' list.)=A0 My recollection that the person who initiated '=
Digitaliberty', Bill Frezza, was interested in the use of technology for th=
e development of 'liberty', although the first part of my AP essay apparent=
ly exceeded his tolerance for radicalism.=A0 At some point somebody transpo=
rted Part 1 of the AP essay to Cypherpunks, and informed me of the existenc=
e of CP; I acquired Internet access and joined the Cypherpunks list.=0A=A0=
=A0=A0 The acquisition and operation of nearby government spy locations was=
/is certainly not new.=A0 Consider the case of Robert Hanssen,=A0=A0 http:/=
/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen =A0=A0 =A0 While this Wikipedia artic=
le does not mention it, I read contemporaneously various news reports (2001=
) that said the government set up a spy location near Hanssen's house.=A0 H=
ow far away that location was, those reports did not say. =A0 Presumably, t=
his was a standard tactic, and non-controversial. (At least in the case of =
actual criminality being suspected and investigated.)=A0 The difference, in=
 my case, was that not only did they not suspect me of any crime, they knew=
 that I was innocent of any crime.=A0 It is obvious, therefore, that they e=
ngaged in this activity not because of any crime (which, had it existed, wo=
uld have made me a 'criminal') but because of my writing and publication of=
 Part 1 of my Assassination Politics essay.=A0 (Which made me 'an enemy', '=
a
 dissident', an opponent of not merely the Federal government, but all gove=
rnments everywhere.)=A0 In other words, the government engaged in activitie=
s more appropriate for the former Soviet Union, and seemingly not for Ameri=
ca.=A0 =0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 One question that should be asked, is:=A0 "What what=
 the government did, acquiring that house at surveilling me from it, legal?=
"=A0=A0 They would presumably say, "yes".=A0 But why wasn't that "stalking"=
, within the meaning of the criminal statute?=A0 After all, in November 21,=
 2000 I was accused of "Interstate Stalking", simply for going around, look=
ing at various locations, not confronting (nor even seeing) anyone.=A0 I wa=
s investigating things, because I knew that something was (and had been) ha=
ppening.=A0 Was I less entitled to do what I did, than what the government =
was to do what it did?=A0 An inmate/informant named Ryan Thomas Lund (his r=
ecent activity:=A0 http://www.localblotter.com/news/oregon/man-detained-on-=
multiple-counts/8340383.html=A0 )=A0 was instructed to attack me, which he =
did on November 25, 1997, because I was beginning to resist the plea agreem=
ent that I had been offered, and initially accepted.=0A=A0=A0=A0 Don't thin=
k that I didn't already suspect the house at 7302 Corregidor during that ti=
me.=A0 In fact, I informed my (corrupt) attorney Peter Avenia=A0 http://www=
.avvo.com/attorneys/98101-wa-peter-avenia-20216.html=A0 of some of my suspi=
cions.=A0 (But, of course, I didn't know at that time Avenia was corrupt.)=
=A0 Sometime about December 1, 1997, Avenia visited me at FDC Seatac jail a=
nd I told him of Lund's attack.=A0 His answer?=A0 "I don't know anything ab=
out.....that")=A0 (Avenia was also Lund's attorney.)=A0=A0 And in about Jul=
y 1998, after I was re-arrested, ostensibly for a 'supervised release viola=
tion', the prosecutor Robb London (who is currently the direction of commun=
ication at Harvard Law School=A0=A0http://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?orig=
=3DSEO_SN&firstName=3DRobb&lastName=3DLondon&trk=3DSEO_SN=A0 ) claimed that=
 I 'said that the government was spying on him' [Jim Bell].=A0=A0 Which, of=
 course, was true:=A0 I DID suspect, and say, that the government was spyin=
g
 on me!=A0=A0 Problem is, London was using this bare assertion to justify m=
e being sent to the Federal Medical Center at Springfield, Missouri, for a =
mental evaluation (!).=A0 Another problem was, London didn't say I was _wro=
ng_ when I said (or suspected) that.=A0 (Without at least an allegation tha=
t I was wrong, what justification is it to claim that I asserted that the g=
overnment was spying on me?!?=A0 Is merely saying that I believed the gover=
nment was spying on me enough to justify sending me to a mental evaluation?=
=A0 Would an American's "suspecting" that all his telephone metadata and em=
ail was being copied by the NSA, prior to Snowden's allegations, constitute=
 a justification to send that 'comrade' for a mental evaluation in Siberia.=
..er...Springfield?)=A0=A0=A0 And worse, I was not allowed to challenge the=
 (implicit) allegation of falsity in my assertion that the government had b=
een spying on me.=A0 However, I used the situation (a hearing) to extract a
 promise (only partly kept) from Avenia that he would investigate my allega=
tions.=A0 Many months later, perhaps in February 1999, Avenia send investig=
ator Sharon Callas to Vancouver.=A0 Mysteriously, Callas was said to have '=
disappeared' (or perhaps 'resigned') later.=A0 I never saw the results of h=
er investigation.=A0 Later, in about April 1999, attorney Avenia resigned, =
but NOT at my request.=A0 I suspected then, and still suspect today, that h=
is resignation was triggered by something that Sharon Callas discovered dur=
ing that investigation:=A0 Perhaps she confirmed enough of my allegations t=
hat Avenia knew that I was correct.=A0 http://www.shmoo.com/mail/cypherpunk=
s/jun00/msg00154.shtml =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 So, what had been goi=
ng on?=A0 Presumably, the interest in me (including local spying) was NOT b=
ased on allegations of crime, or even suspected future crime, in March 1995=
.=A0 In other words, no government law enforcement agency would have been l=
egally entitled to spy on me.=A0 Presumably, the spying that did occur was,=
 itself, illegal:=A0 And, had it become exposed (which it should have been =
if I had not been assaulted by Ryan Thomas Lund on November 25, 1997), the =
Federal government would have suffered an enormous hit of bad publicity.=A0=
 This corruption must have been at an extremely high level:=A0 The forgery =
of fake appeal case 99-30210, initiated secretly and kept from me for 10 mo=
nths, with numerous forged documents filed (at least two ostensibly being f=
rom me, but they were also forged:=A0 You can see them on PACER:=A0=A0 www.=
pacer.gov=A0=A0=A0 9th circuit court.=A0 One was docketed about November 10=
, 1999 and the other was docketed about March 4,
 2000:=A0=A0 Both dates by my recollection). =A0 That would have taken the =
cooperation of some very powerful people in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appe=
als, possibly including a few judges. =A0 Further, every document filed in =
that case, from June 1999 through April 2000, was (illegally) not delivered=
 to me when I was at FDC Seatac (until September 3, 1999) and when I was at=
 FCI Phoenix from September 10, 1999 to my release on April 13, 2000.=A0 In=
deed, there were at least two pieces of certified mail described in the doc=
ket for case 99-30210 that were mailed to my then-correct address at FCI Ph=
oenix, which didn't get to me, presumably they were stolen by BOP staff at =
FCI Phoenix.=A0=A0 (Not to mention my allegation that this entire docket wa=
s RE-forged once they learned that I had requested an appeal that I hadn't =
known was already in progress.)=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 Doesn't this begin to sou=
nd like the classic "government conspiracy" that people who don't like to t=
alk about "government conspiracies" argue don't happen.=A0 (Except rarely, =
say the Watergate incident in 1972).=A0 One of the reasons that I look (way=
) down on a few of the doofuses around here (CP list) who don't seem to 'li=
ke' me is that they apparently take that position without taking the troubl=
e to read my 2003 lawsuit (02-1052; Portland Federal Court) and learning wh=
at I allege the government and its minions did.=A0 It will be interesting t=
o see if any of them step up, apologize, and say, "Sorry, Mr. Bell, we didn=
't know..."=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 Jim Bell=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=

pment Construction Corporation".&nbsp; <a href=3D"http:///"><span>http://ww=

the date the house was sold is shown as March 10, 1995.&nbsp; (This is odd,=
 because school teachers' lives are oriented around the 'school year', whic=
h in most locations in America go from about September 1 to about June 1.&n=
bsp; They sign contracts with the school to work for that year, and are bou=
nd to do so. &nbsp; While I don't recall when the prior, lured occupant lef=
t, based on the sale date it appears that he sold that house months before =
the end of his school year.&nbsp; For a school teacher, this would have
 been highly unusual.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><span class=3D"tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p; </span>The sale price is shown as $180,000, which I think was rather hig=
h for that time. (But not unexpected if the government wanted to lure him a=
way quickly.&nbsp; Presumably he got a large raise, as well.)&nbsp; They im=
mediately began an extensive remodeling and enlargement operation on that h=
ouse, including adding a second floor.&nbsp; As I recall, this remodel took=
 nearly a year; seemingly the house was unoccupied during that time.&nbsp; =
Further, during a long period very little work was actually being done, as =
I recall.&nbsp; (This remodeling would have dramatically increased the valu=
e of that house; the sale price in 1995 of $180,000 cannot be directly comp=
ared with the current value of the much-larger and more-up-to-date house as=
 it exists today.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; While I don't remember precisely the da=
te I published the first part of my AP essay, I believe that it was no
 more than a few weeks prior to March 10, 1995, on the 'Digitaliberty' disc=
ussion area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=3D"http:///"><span> http://www.=
skepticfiles.org/hacker/cud6105.htm</span></a> &nbsp; (Hence my reference t=
o Digitaliberty in the essay; it wasn't until many weeks later that I'd hea=
rd of the 'Cypherpunks' list.)&nbsp; My recollection that the person who in=
itiated 'Digitaliberty', Bill Frezza, was interested in the use of technolo=
gy for the development of 'liberty', although the first part of my AP essay=
 apparently exceeded his tolerance for radicalism.&nbsp; At some point some=
body transported Part 1 of the AP essay to Cypherpunks, and informed me of =
the existence of CP; I acquired Internet access and joined the Cypherpunks =
list.<br><span class=3D"tab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The acquisition and operati=
on of nearby government spy locations was/is certainly not new.&nbsp; Consi=

</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>While this Wikipedia article does not menti=
on it, I read contemporaneously various news reports (2001) that said the g=
overnment set up a spy location near Hanssen's house.&nbsp; How far away th=
at location was, those reports did not say. &nbsp; Presumably, this was a s=
tandard tactic, and non-controversial. (At least in the case of actual crim=
inality being suspected and investigated.)&nbsp; The difference, in my case=
, was that not only did they not suspect me of any crime, they knew that I =
was innocent of any crime.&nbsp; It is obvious, therefore, that they engage=
d in this activity not because of any crime (which, had it existed, would h=
ave made me a 'criminal') but because of my writing and publication of Part=
 1 of my Assassination Politics essay.&nbsp; (Which made me 'an enemy', 'a =
dissident', an opponent of not merely the Federal government, but all
 governments everywhere.)&nbsp; In other words, the government engaged in a=
ctivities more appropriate for the former Soviet Union, and seemingly not f=
or America.&nbsp; <br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question that should be a=
sked, is:&nbsp; "What what the government did, acquiring that house at surv=
eilling me from it, legal?"&nbsp;&nbsp; They would presumably say, "yes".&n=
bsp; But why wasn't that "stalking", within the meaning of the criminal sta=
tute?&nbsp; After all, in November 21, 2000 I was accused of "Interstate St=
alking", simply for going around, looking at various locations, not confron=
ting (nor even seeing) anyone.&nbsp; I was investigating things, because I =
knew that something was (and had been) happening.&nbsp; Was I less entitled=
 to do what I did, than what the government was to do what it did?&nbsp; An=
 inmate/informant named Ryan Thomas Lund (his recent activity:&nbsp; <a

"><span>http://www.avvo.com/attorneys/98101-wa-peter-avenia-20216.html</spa=

 at that time Avenia was corrupt.)&nbsp; Sometime about December 1, 1997, A=
venia visited me at FDC Seatac jail and I told him of Lund's attack.&nbsp; =
His answer?&nbsp; "I don't know anything about.....that")&nbsp; (Avenia was=
 also Lund's attorney.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And in about July 1998, after I was
 re-arrested, ostensibly for a 'supervised release violation', the prosecut=
or Robb London (who is currently the direction of communication at Harvard =
Law School&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=3D"http:///"><span> http://www.linkedin.com/v=
search/p?orig=3DSEO_SN&amp;firstName=3DRobb&amp;lastName=3DLondon&amp;trk=

pying on him' [Jim Bell].&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, of course, was true:&nbsp; I D=
ID suspect, and say, that the government was spying on me!&nbsp;&nbsp; Prob=
lem is, London was using this bare assertion to justify me being sent to th=
e Federal Medical Center at Springfield, Missouri, for a mental evaluation =
(!).&nbsp; Another problem was, London didn't say I was _wrong_ when I said=
 (or suspected) that.&nbsp; (Without at least an allegation that I was wron=
g, what justification is it to claim that I asserted that the government wa=
s spying on me?!?&nbsp; Is merely saying that I believed the government was
 spying on me enough to justify sending me to a mental evaluation?&nbsp; Wo=
uld an American's "suspecting" that all his telephone metadata and email wa=
s being copied by the NSA, prior to Snowden's allegations, constitute a jus=
tification to send that 'comrade' for a mental evaluation in Siberia...er..=
.Springfield?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And worse, I was not allowed to challenge =
the (implicit) allegation of falsity in my assertion that the government ha=
d been spying on me.&nbsp; However, I used the situation (a hearing) to ext=
ract a promise (only partly kept) from Avenia that he would investigate my =
allegations.&nbsp; Many months later, perhaps in February 1999, Avenia send=
 investigator Sharon Callas to Vancouver.&nbsp; Mysteriously, Callas was sa=
id to have 'disappeared' (or perhaps 'resigned') later.&nbsp; I never saw t=
he results of her investigation.&nbsp; Later, in about April 1999, attorney=
 Avenia resigned, but NOT at my request.&nbsp; I suspected then, and
 still suspect today, that his resignation was triggered by something that =
Sharon Callas discovered during that investigation:&nbsp; Perhaps she confi=
rmed enough of my allegations that Avenia knew that I was correct.&nbsp; <a=

&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what had been going on?&nbsp; Presumably, the interest in =
me (including local spying) was NOT based on allegations of crime, or even =
suspected future crime, in March 1995.&nbsp; In other words, no government =
law
 enforcement agency would have been legally entitled to spy on me.&nbsp; Pr=
esumably, the spying that did occur was, itself, illegal:&nbsp; And, had it=
 become exposed (which it should have been if I had not been assaulted by R=
yan Thomas Lund on November 25, 1997), the Federal government would have su=
ffered an enormous hit of bad publicity.&nbsp; This corruption must have be=
en at an extremely high level:&nbsp; The forgery of fake appeal case 99-302=
10, initiated secretly and kept from me for 10 months, with numerous forged=
 documents filed (at least two ostensibly being from me, but they were also=
 forged:&nbsp; You can see them on PACER:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=3D"http:///">=

ne was docketed about November 10, 1999 and the other was docketed about Ma=

have taken the cooperation of some very powerful people in the Ninth
 Circuit Court of Appeals, possibly including a few judges. &nbsp; Further,=
 every document filed in that case, from June 1999 through April 2000, was =
(illegally) not delivered to me when I was at FDC Seatac (until September 3=

ed mail described in the docket for case 99-30210 that were mailed to my th=

were stolen by BOP staff at FCI Phoenix.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Not to mention my all=
