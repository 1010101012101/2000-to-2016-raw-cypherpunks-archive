Freedom will do that as it'll hide your IP address and ISP email
address.

Same.

Potentially freedom can handle this, though it depends on the system.
Freedom works with IRC, but not yet with ICQ.  The issue is that you
need a anonymizing local proxy if the protocol violates layering and
includes IP addresses in it's higher level messages.  Some protocols
require this (eg. ftp due to the announcement of the port and IP to
connect back to in the request), others don't.  As the source code is
out (for linux) people can add handlers for their favourite
applications (Quake, ICQ etc).

Difficult to protect against this one.  One could think about applying
some of Nick Szabo's ideas to this as it's effectively a private
contract issue -- some of things I talked about in my recent post
about "smart privacy policies"

http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.2000.10.30-2000.11.05/msg00189.html

Your best defense is not to give the info.  Or perhaps to give it
pseudonymously if that is possible.

Freedom's approach to profiling is to let the cookies accumulate on a
cookie jar associated with each pseudonym.  You can also edit cookies.
In this way you still get advertisements more targetted than "random"
(which might be thought of as positive if the user is comfortable
being pseudonymously profiled).  Also you can use multiple persona's
to segregate your interests (financial interests, porn, etc.) which
reduces your chances of the profiler getting a unified profile -- he
gets separate profiles for each of your activities.

That's addressed by freedom as packets are all encrypted (modulo the
traffic analysis attacks discussed in the previous post).

Also protected for traffic.  Mail is protected in the new mail system
as the stored mail is encrypted by the sender, and transfers into and
out of the mail system are anonymous by being routed through the
freedom network, which uses forward secret keying.  The 1.x mail
system also protects against it as the mail is encrypted end to end,
and arrives in the ISP box encrypted.

That would be a nice thing to clean up.  The browsers keep a lot of
state, in history, pick-lists, cookies, bookmarks etc.  The whole lot
could do with storing in an encrypted per local user profile, or
having an option to wipe.

Even the machine keeps a lot of stuff -- the windows pick list, stuff
scattered all over the disk in deleted files etc.

I made a suggestion I think on cypherpunks a few months back that
freedom and anonymous systems meeting the type of requirements you
list could be thought of as legal insurance from bullshit legal
attacks.

You could probably collect a list of freedom exit node IP addresses
and look for web hits from them?  The hit rate will depend on the site
topic and the user group, so it'll still be pretty hit and miss.

Freedom's trying to do some pretty ambitious things in interfacing
with the windows stack from within the tcp stack and transparently
re-writing and redirecting packets at that level.  That area of
windows isn't the best documented.  If you were using an early version
things may have improved a lot since then.  Also I think win2000 stuff
is more amenable to the things freedom is trying to do.

Well I would avoid using the web at all if I were doing something
sensitive.  That could be inconvenient.  I guess there are web2mail
gateways one could use with an alpha nymserver, but that's pretty
inconvenient.  So freedom is good for that (now that there's a linux
version).

The managed privacy services are technology related and pushing the
"zero-knowledge" stance.  ZKS technologies include the freedom
network, and the freedom client.

Yes they would.  Sorry to be ambiguous.  You asked the question with
"you" which sounded like ZKS, and ZKS couldn't in general decrypt the
whole reply block (it would depend how many of the hops where ZKS
nodes).  Note there are multiple reply blocks -- default 3 -- to
combat reliability and bit rot, so given the mix of ZKS nodes someone
could end up with an all ZKS reply block.

Yes.  I mentioned this in the previous mail as a highlight of the new
mail system in my view.  That plus recording any traffic coming frmo
the users machine is all protected by forward secret encryption with
freedom 2.x.  No keys protecting the outside layer are kept for more
than 1/2 hour, and then only in RAM.

It wasn't written by legal types -- Adam Shostack & Ian wrote it.  I
take it there are some legal inaccuracies in the description of legal
process?  Perhaps one of the lawyers should review those parts.
