Subject: New protocol for cryptographically strong, "accountable anonymous
messaging"
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.1078)

A student and I here at Yale have recently been developing an experimental
protocol for cryptographically strong anonymous messaging within a small
online group or "virtual organization."  We believe the protocol is (provably)
resistant to both traffic analysis and anonymous denial-of-service or
disruption by malicious or compromised group members, and supports
applications requiring an exact 1-to-1 correspondence of members to messages
in a given round, such as voting or assigning 1-to-1 pseudonyms.  In its
current form the protocol is intended only for small decentralized groups and
is not scalable to large groups or providing "mass anonymity" as in Mixminion
or Tor, and the protocol is suited only for non-interactive messaging or bulk
file transfer due to high startup latencies, although we have some ideas for
addressing these limitations in the future.  We have placed a preliminary
draft of the protocol (with some experimental results from a very preliminary
and incomplete implementation) at the URL below, and would like to solicit
analysis and feedback from interested cryptographers or distributed systems
folks.

Thanks,
Bryan

Accountable Anonymous Group Messaging
http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.3057

Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving
users may abuse this anonymity to spam or disrupt the group. Messaging
protocols such as Mix-nets and DC-nets leave online groups vulnerable to
denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, while accountable voting protocols are
unusable or inefficient for general anonymous messaging.
We present the first general messaging protocol that offers provable anonymity
with accountability for moderate-size groups, and efficiently handles
unbalanced loads where few members have much data to transmit in a given
round. The N group members first cooperatively shuffle an NxN matrix of
pseudorandom seeds, then use these seeds in N "pre-planned" DC-nets protocol
runs. Each DC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one
member's message, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity
under our attack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and
one-to-one correspondence between members and messages, makes
denial-of-service attacks by members traceable to the culprit, and efficiently
handles large and unbalanced message loads. A working prototype demonstrates
the protocol's practicality for anonymous messaging in groups of 40+ member
nodes.
