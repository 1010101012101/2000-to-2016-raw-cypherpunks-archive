This simply does not follow. Juan made a simple logical response that
"no, just because I choose to drive on a public road, does not mean I
actually agree to display a license plate"

As a fact, Juan's logic is true.

This can also be extended:
- driving on a road does not mean driver -wants- to display a license plate
- driving on a road does not mean driver displays a license plate
(this might result in certain consequences that from various view
points might be desirable, and or un-desirable)

Neither of these two positions, nor the one Juan stated above, warrant
being classified as "a true right wing jackass me-first sovereign
citizen".

"I don't have to be doing anything wrong to want my privacy."

This one time, an associate was asked by a Magistrate/Judge, "well Mr
Redacted, how would you feel if a driver had no number plate and did a
hit and run on your child?" to which he responded "pretty bloody bad,
and frankly, just as bad as if someone -with- a number plate had done
a hit and run".

The point here is that the number plate does not stop people doing the
wrong thing.

Although there may be some encouragement towards better behaviour by
mandating number plates, such a correlation is not public knowledge,
and more importantly, the costs are manifold:
- our right to travel anonmyously is sacrificed (yes, anonymous wrt
most individuals, but no, not anonymous from the state, which is
arguably much more important)
- the state intrudes into our private lives
- economic bias - fines charged (eg for parking longer than 'allowed')
unfairly target the poor
- many more reasons

It is the bad action which ought be punished/ sanctioned in some way by society.


>> >> I'll bet you think you're an anarchist too!

Razer, your reaction to suggestion that "there is no agreement to
display a number plate when one drives on a public road" is way out of
proportion to the suggestion.

Some people have such reactions because they had a love one who
suffered from some egregious road crime.

Frankly I don't really know what "right winger" means. I really wish I
did, but it's different for different people, so your definition is
unlikely to be useful in this thread.

What I believe -is- useful is to handle a particular issue at a time -
if an issue gets too big, perhaps additional threads are required.

Here you are conflating capability (training) with tracking and
control (license).

And, we can debate whether control via license is abused by the state,
whether control by court order and/ or punishment by the courts for
violations of the public standards/expectations of "the herd", and
compare any purported benefits put forward, with the many costs
involved, some of which I outlined above.

I wholeheartedly disagree with the incredibly simplified assertion
"car bad, state control good".

No. We can not. The lack of depth/ assumption that we can, might be
worth analysing though.
