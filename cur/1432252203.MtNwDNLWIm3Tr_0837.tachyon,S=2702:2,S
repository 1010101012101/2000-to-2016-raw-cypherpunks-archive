At current rates, that's $3.5M, not bad.

I'd love to see someone much smarter than me analyze the types of transactions that come in/out of accounts like this. Who is likely to own it? What's up with those incoming transactions of 5-10k BTC from dozens of addresses?

The link below states that is the SilkRoad main account. Can anyone confirm?

MagicalTux has suggested before that it belongs to MtGox, as far as I know.
