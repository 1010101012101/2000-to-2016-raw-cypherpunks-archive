Subject: Historical Evidence or Possibility of Steganography in Music

I was wondering if anyone here might guide me to any reference material
regarding the possibility or actual occurrence of information having been
steganographically hidden in musical scores.

If this is the wrong NG to post this to, please correct me.

TIA

Mark

Sorry, I don't have any formal references for you about hiding information
in music. Nevertheless, I know it's happened, because I have done it
myself, in the mid-1980s. Not only that, but it survived a cryptanalytic
attack from somebody who was 99% sure that the music contained a message
but was unable to work out how that message was encoded.

Some time in the 1990s, I read in good old Readers' Digest of a war-time
incident in which musical notation was used for encryption; this nearly got
a man killed when he was asked by the Germans to play the music. He was
able to shrug off the cacophony as "this modern music", and got away with
it. How true this account is, I don't know.

I don't know why they didn't do what I did, which is to insert musical
padding into the score to maintain some semblance of melody.

It's an expensive method of steganography, though, since you really do have
to compose your own tunes. The problem with saving time by using existing
scores is that their composition (if you will forgive the term) is public
knowledge, and so a comparison with the original will reveal the
significant differences. The only way around this is to prevent such a
comparison, and the only certain way to do that is to compose your own
tunes.

You might be able to automate the padding, if your computer is soulful
enough.  :-)
