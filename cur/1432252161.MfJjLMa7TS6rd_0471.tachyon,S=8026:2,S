Sorry, it wasn't a "private solution" but relied on the
existing legal protections under Federal Law.

If I was asking for more laws, I'd ask for the Swedish
credit disclosure law that says that whenever a company
writes a credit report it must provide the individual
with a true and accurate copy (without any action on
the individual's part).

A private solution to the problem that one Carl wanted more laws to solve:

Having recently been on the receiving end of identity theft, I'm a bit more
optimistic than Carl. I solved my problem by reading the back page of the
credit report, where it provided addresses of the federal agencies that
regulate collection bureaus, banks, and similar organizations. Letters to
the agencies resulted in one "opening a case" and, eventually, a letter of
apology from the bank in question (who hadn't answered my previous
requests/complaints).  I used an account record book -- a bound notebook
with numbered pages -- that had dated notes of every interaction I had with
the banks and credit card agencies, interspersed with software notes,
interesting URL's, telemarketing caller numbers, and other scribbles. This
let me document my complaints with the specific dates and times that I
attempted to resolve the problem.
