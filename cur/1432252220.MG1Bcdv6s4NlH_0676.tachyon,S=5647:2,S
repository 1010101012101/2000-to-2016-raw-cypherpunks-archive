I.e. you both evaluate actions as such, I tend to evaluate them based on
their consequences.

I know and I appreciate the viewpoint in question. I raised some mild doubts
about it and apparently have to bear the consequences, now...

I do not see the essential difference. I see that as an axiom which need not
hold. OTOH, no point in debating axioms...

Actually I subscribe to neither view. I see rights as something that do not
naturally exist, but are purely a societal product, subject to change
through redefinition. Whether this happens because the government effects it
or if the people start to view something as an inherent right is, to me, 
immaterial. I also have trouble with argumentation which starts from a clean
slate, since such a thing does not exist in reality.

If everybody around you decides your shop is now a shared resource, it will
be, by your definition. Since I view rights as highly relative, you cannot
even call this thievery.

If you do not define commerce as a shared resource, which in some cases just
might be sensible.

Because I evaluate based on the outcome. In the first case, the sound bugs
you if it bugs you. (And yes, in some cases the damage could be enough to
regulate the speech. This is, thankfully, rare.) In the second case you
die. There is a conflict of interests and I rank. Admittedly you could place
the value of the right to exist below that of not having to listen to
someone and resolve this particular problem. I think it would be problematic
elsewhere.

Yep, this is the difference in viewpoint. I do not view regulation of
inaction as fundamentally different from the regulation of action, relying
instead on the consequences of each to resolve possible conflicts. Perhaps
we will get to burying this thread before I acquire the reputation of being
a troll beyond rescue...

And again. I am, under some circumstances, ready to regulate inaction
whereas you are not.
