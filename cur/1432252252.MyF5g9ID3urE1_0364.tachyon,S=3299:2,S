I believe that Geotrust has come up with an excellent new model to make
money out of the CA business with minimum hassle to the customer while
reducing Geotrust's vetting costs down to next to zero. Their
introduction of this new model was one of the more interesting news at
this year's otherwise rather bland RSA Conference.

The cert shows as being issued by Equifax because Geotrust purchased
Equifax's root embedded in major browsers since MSIE 5 on the secondary
market. (Geotrust purchased more than just the root).
