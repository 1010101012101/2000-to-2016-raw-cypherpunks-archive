Yes, the cites are real. Yes, every(!) one of them requires 'intent' to be
linked to the article in question and the potential of a future legal
action. In every cite that BU provided you'll find additional material if
researched which provides proof of 'intent' with respect to the 'loss of
evidence'. In other words, it wasn't a matter of policy per se, but rather
an intentional use of policy with respect to a SPECIFIC piece of evidence.
BU's argument falls down when the policy applied to ALL 'evidence'. A
MAJOR distinction. No, it isn't routine by any definition. I'd be
surprised if it was in the double digits percentage wise.
