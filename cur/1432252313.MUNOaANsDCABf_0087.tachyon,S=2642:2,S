Actually that won't hold up. There is a distinction that you are missing.

Do you legally purchase service from that cable vendor? If so then even
building your own cable descrambling box may be illegal if the contract
says so (you're depriving the cable company of contractual income,
fraud?). The only(!!!) way that I can see building your own descrambler
and getting away with it is if you have no(!) connection to the vendor,
hence they have no claim to a 'loss' since you're not buying any service
in the first place.
