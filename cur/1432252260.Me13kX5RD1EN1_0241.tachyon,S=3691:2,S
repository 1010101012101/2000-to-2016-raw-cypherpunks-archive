Looks like Microsoft is racing to get copies of XP out where they can't 
be retrieved, where the distribution is a done deal, a fact on the 
ground.

No word yet on whether Black Unicorn's "Mr. Happy Fun Court" is "not 
amused."

Windows XP could see September ship date
By Joe Wilcox

Starting next month, some new PCs could include an unexpected accessory: 
Windows XP.

Microsoft has given PC makers the go-ahead to ship Windows XP as much as 
one full month before the operating system's official Oct. 25 launch 
date, sources close to four major PC makers told CNET News.com.
...
For Microsoft, the early release of Windows XP has an additional 
benefit. The company is advancing its release schedule to try to beat 
any possible injunction that would delay the new operating system's 
debut, analysts said.
.....
"Because a new remedy would be forward-looking, that could include 
(Windows) XP," said Andy Gavil, an antitrust professor with Howard 
University School of Law. "There's no reason to think the government is 
not considering an injunction against XP."
....
Specter of injunction
Getting Windows XP on new systems ahead of the scheduled Oct. 25 launch 
could help Microsoft fend off possible injunctions against Windows XP,...
...
Publicly, Microsoft Group Vice President Jim Allchin said the company 
had no contingency plan should an injunction be issued against Windows 
XP. But sources close to Microsoft said the company is concerned about 
the possibility.
