 Somoza fell largely because of US pressure, so he was not 
"our SOB".  Furthermore however nasty Somoza was, we did not 
see tens of thousands of refugees escaping Nicaragua to 
neighbouring countries during his rule.

The short story of Nicaragua is that there was a US sponsored 
overthrow of an unpleasant dictator, a commie conspiracy 
stole the revolution, and the contras took the revolution 
back, bleeding the Soviet Union significantly in the process. 
The war cost the Soviet Union vastly more than it cost the 
US, and the Soviet Union could afford it less
