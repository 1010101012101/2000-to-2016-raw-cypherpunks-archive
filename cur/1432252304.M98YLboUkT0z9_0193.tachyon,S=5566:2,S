I think many or most on this list, not to mention within the computer 
industry, might disagree with you.

This was discussed at the workshop.  Its the reason I mention the SICs.  My 
hope is that by extending these Standard Industry Codes to somewhat smaller 
gradations, none of which would be allowed to fall below some GNP 
threshold, that MS' classification (almost all of whose business currently 
falls in the Software Publishing category) might be subdivided into, for 
example, OS and Office Software Application Suites.

No.  Though my readings in antitrust have led me to the conclusion that 
there are few industries in which greater than 50% of market share are 
required for sufficient economies of scale.  One that comes to mind is 
commercial aircraft.

It might if I get to have choices which would otherwise be foreclosed once 
one company reaches a "friction free" point in that industry.
