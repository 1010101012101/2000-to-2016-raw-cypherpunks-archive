Being curious, I did some more digging in online etymologies and 
dictionaries and found several transliterated versions of "foundation" 
into Hebrew. (The word "foundation" shows up in dozens, even hundreds, 
of Biblical passages, so we have lots and lots of old Aramaic and Hebrew 
appearances.)

Here's one I found at this site:

http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?search=foundation&version=
kjv&type=eng&submit=Find

Things like "yahcad" and "muwcahd" and "cuwdah"

foundation	hdwoy	y@cuwdah


Sure sounds like "kaida" or "qaida" to me.

And Asimov was Jewish, so this proves that "Hari Seldon," which is 
Arabic for "America will be conquered in the 17th cycle after the Greys 
established their bases in New Mexico," was in league with the Rastafari 
Bilderberger colonizers of the holy lands.
