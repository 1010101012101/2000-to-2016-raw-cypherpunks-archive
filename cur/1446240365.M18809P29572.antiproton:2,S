	Of course. So, why should any sane person support such a

	Abstaining from violence? States are the most violent
	organizations on the planet. As to the complex arrangements
	that can exist in a society, you don't need the state to
	have them. 

	It's also debatable why huge organizations are 'valuable'.

	That's vague. What system are you alluding to, and who is 'we'?

	Statism? That system is designed to benefit special interests.
	Unless you belong to some special faction, it won't do you any
	good.

	What is the 'correct' behaviour?

	Define 'works'.

	Well yes, there are varying levels of propaganda in political
	philosophy. There are some sound principles too. 

	You think people should be free, and things organized according
	to 'market principles' in some areas, but not in others.
	Problem is, being 'free' to follow arbitrary rules isn't
	exactly freedom.

	Literally? A very good criminal monopoly would excel at being
	criminal. I don't think that's what you want?

	Whatever. A world state is a pretty bad idea. 


> I have the right because I can. Powers *are* rights. 

	That's not what 'right(s)' means. Or rather that's the kind of
	'rights' that governments rely upon. Arbitrary dictates backed
	by force.

	You are misunderstanding what natural rights are. Natural
	rights are a more legalistic description of common sense
	morality. 

	You can probably kill a few random people right now if you
	want. Say, use a car to run people over. But the fact that you
	*can* kill people means killing people is morally right?

	Same thing with natural rights. The fact that natural rights
	can be violated doesn't mean they don't exist.

	We are not talking about political philosophy applied

	That's a poetic license.

	Well, at least you are sincere...

	I would point out (again) that  1) your understanding of
	natural rights isn't...right. 2) that even current states
	pretend to get their powers from 'natural rights'. 

	It's called 'representative government' and it's allegedly
	based on 'consent'. Look it up =P

	It's a reductio ad absurdum of the  "power = rights" argument.

	"might makes right" is sarcasm, not a literal statement.
