This is mistifying to me - there are apparently enough in there that it
*should* be possible for someone to purchase one or a few and start
offering an alternate source of certs. Or has Verisign gone and purchased
all of them already?

What would happen if one of those private keys were found and made
public? I suspect there would be a lot of lawyers and suing and claims of
trade secrets made, with significant intimidation of anyone who dared make
a cert for themselves rather than paying for one the way the good lord
intended.

It would, of course, result in no practical loss of security whatsoever,
since man in the middle attacks never happen.

Yes, getting the public key of the domain as part of the DNS lookup is
better engineering all around. It would also be nicer for services like
Akamai which spew out different IPs and for the same domain name, and are
currently forced to use the exact same private key in every one of those
machines.

Revocation just plain doesn't work. The only practical solution is online
verification.
