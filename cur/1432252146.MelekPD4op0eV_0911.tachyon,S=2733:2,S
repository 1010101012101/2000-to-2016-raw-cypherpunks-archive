   from the takes-five-minutes-to-download-patches dept.
   [1]Amadaeus writes "According to the latest study by USA Today and
   [2]Avantgarde, it takes less than [3]4 minutes for an unpatched
   Windows XP SP1 system to become part of a botnet. Avantgarde has the
   statistics in [4]their abstract. Stats of note: Although Macs and PC's
   got hit with equal opportunity, the XP SP1 machine was hit with 5
   LSASS and 4 DCOM exploits while the Mac remained clean. The Linux
   desktop also was impenetrable, but only was only targeted by 0.26% of
   all attacks." See also our story on the [5]survival time for unpatched
   systems.
