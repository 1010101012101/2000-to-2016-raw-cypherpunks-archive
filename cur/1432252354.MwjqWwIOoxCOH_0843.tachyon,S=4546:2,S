Don't tar me with that brush, Declan!

I said absolutely nothing about what fraction of reporters stand their 
ground, what fraction roll over, what fraction end up going to jail on 
contempt charges, and so on.

I've addressed two basic issues:

-- the issue of shield laws, which I think are clearly unconstitutional 
and which raise issues of state sanctioning of some reporters over other 
reporters

-- the claim that assertion of 5A rights lets a witness choose not to 
testify


I made no claims about whether reporters routinely refuse to name their 
sources. (I did hint that Jeff Gordon, the victim/witness/real 
prosecutor probably took into account the "can of worms" he would be 
opening if he sought to compell disclosure of certain things...an 
implicit reference to the fact that many reporters will refuse to name 
sources and to disclose things said to them.)

Hence the comment I made about can of worms.

I think John Young would have had a much harder time claiming reporter's 
privilege. Checking the archives for the period when Bell was trying to 
track down home addresses of agents should clarify this point. John 
might have done better to assert 5A rights and make them force the issue 
by dropping the line of questioning or granting him some form of 
immunity.
