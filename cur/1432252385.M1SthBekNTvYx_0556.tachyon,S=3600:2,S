Get real.  There's no way these are going to be serious problems in five
years.  For one thing, they all depend on an established anonymous cash
infrastructure for payoff off the crooks, buying the intelligence, etc.
There's very little chance that such a system will come into existence
soon (look at all the progress in the last five years), and even if it
did, any problems with criminal use will be blamed on the cash system,
not the email delivery.

Two way anonymous communications have been around for years.  Dead drops
are a commonly used technique, likewise public postings in classified
ads and similar places.  It's nothing new and there have been no laws
to ban this capability.
