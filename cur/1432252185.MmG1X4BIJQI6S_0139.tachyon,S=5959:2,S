Right.  Now the seller has the cash, and the buyer has nothing.  The
seller has lost only the future value of the nym, which was presumably
accounted for in the price.  The seller loses no "real" reputation,
because the nym can't be tied back to the is-a-person seller.  The
buyer, meanwhile, is out the price of the nym, and must either 
destroy the nym in order to ensure that the seller actually loses all
that value, or accept damaged goods.

So, why would a buyer agree to such a transaction, where he will
remain at the mercy of the seller?

Or is this 'one born every minute' economics?
