A bit tax has been proposed in the European Union several times.  The
general idea is to levy a tax on each bit/byte of Internet traffic that
flows through some specified point or set of points.  So far the Internet
service providers have successfully lobbied against the tax.

The US legislators obviously haven't clearly thought through their
proposal yet.  But it would be easy enough to, for example, reason
that it costs N cents to push a megabyte down a telephone wire, and
so it would be 'logical' to impose a tax 0.09 * N cents/megabyte.
The LAN is just a way around the telephone wire, right?
