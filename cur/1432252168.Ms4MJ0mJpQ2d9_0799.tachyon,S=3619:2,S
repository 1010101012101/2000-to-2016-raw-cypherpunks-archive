When the information is obtained from the phone company ( in this case MCI) 
for "untraceable" phone calls, what kind of data will I receive?  Is there 
ever any way to break this down to something usable?  My problem is harrasing 
phone calls that appear to be coming from out of state but I believe are 
actually coming from a cell phone is state.  Any ideas or helpful hints would 
be very very appreciated.
