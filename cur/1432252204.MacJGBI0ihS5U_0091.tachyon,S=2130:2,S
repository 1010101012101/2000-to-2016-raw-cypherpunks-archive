Bottom Line: These so-called Americans have got to go.

CNN is reporting that the Big Debate about the rounded-up Iraqi 
leadership is whether the many Liberated Illegal Regime Members, a la 
Tariq Aziz and the other 54 spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds, are to 
be treated as "prisoners of war," and hence subject to the Geneva 
Conventions ("name, rank, serial number") or are to be treated as 
"illegal combatants" (torture, metal cages, withholding of food and 
water, sodium pentothal, shipment to Guantanamo Bay in metal boxes).

When one is an "illegal combatant" in one's own country, we know the 
U.S. is run by characters out of Alice in Wonderland.

I would say more, and more angrily, as I just did before deleting my 
paragraphs, except I don't desire a fatal visit by our Thought Police, 
aka the SS.

What a fucking fascist country we have become. Fuck it dead. Piss on 
its corpse. Maybe something will then grow out of it.
