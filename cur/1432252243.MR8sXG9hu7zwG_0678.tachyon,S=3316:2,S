You're assuming that resellers add zero value to the content.  They can
make a profit by providing some service over and above the content itself.

Take file sharing networks as an example.  Current networks are flooded
with bogus, incomplete or poor quality files.  A nym could build a
reputation as a validating service - a critic, if you like.  Perhaps
something like this:

Alice the music critic buys copies of new content at relatively high
prices from the creator, or close sources.  When Bob requests a copy of
a particular file, Alice encrypts it to Bob's public key and signs the
encrypted copy, selling him this 'reviewed' copy for reproduction cost +
profit.  Bob can verify he's received a good copy, but he can't
redistribute Alice's reviewed version without revealing his secret key.

(Yeah, Mallory can create a one-shot key pair with the intention of
revealing it and redistributing Alice's reviewed file.  Alice can reduce
her losses by refusing to deal with unknown buyers, or by demanding
pre-payment for 100 copies up front, or something like that.)
