And the "exclusionary rule" is mostly meaningless, anyway.

Though there is much noise about "fruit of the poisoned tree" (or 
"poison tree," not sure which), a black bag job can generate other 
grounds for arrest and prosecution. For example, planned meets, 
planned heists, etc.

One of my favorite movies of all time is "Heat," with Robert De Niro 
and Al Pacino. The cops are trying to prove a gang is pulling off a 
series of violent heists. Surveillance is heavy, and the surveillance 
per se is not intended to be used in a court: the cops are seeking to 
catch the gang in action.

And then there's the old "confidential informant" ploy: "We got a tip 
from our snitch."

Make no mistake about it, the exclusionary rule will do little to 
deter black bag jobs.
