Am I wrong or does this article essentially say that stego is a tool for
terrorists and that no legitimate enterprise has any use for it? The
observation that there is probably nothing that anyone can do about it
notwithstanding, this looks to me like a strong statement that stego is
not a good thing. 

Whether stego has a 'legitimate business' use or not is irrelevant
except as an argument for prohibiting it.

The investment in stego detection is probably substantial and due to
increase.
