The American Assocation of Motor Vehicle Administrators
has prepared a series of studies on security of drivers
license data, and not least sharing it with law enforcement. 

Access to some of the docs are supposed to be limited to
members but R. notes that the security is illusory, so the docs 
can be accessed until the hole is closed (see the last
appendix for LE access to data):

AAMVA determined the need for a comprehensive
framework of minimum requirements with enhanced
recommendations to improve the quality, reliability,
uniformity and security of the driver licensing
process in North America.  As a result, AAMVA compiled
and produced its DL/ID Security Framework: A Package
of Decisions Based on Best Practices, Standards,
Specifications and Recommendations to Enhance Drivers
License Administration and Identification Security.

This document is currently available to the AAMVA
membership only.  Members will be required to present
their AAMVA user ID and password to access the
framework.
