To state the obvious to Major Variola, CDC will have first
indication of a devastating US attack, reported fragmentarily
under its links to hospitals, clinics and physicians, against 
which the might military and law enforcement have no defenses.

By time the attack is understood it will be too late to mount
a national defense. Food and water are the means and methods,
not the hardware and electronic infrastructure, seaports and
airports, so loudly warned about. The last terrorist attack is not
the next one.

Elderly and children first to show the signs. Those not watched
all that carefully by the big warfighters, indeed overlooked by
design, so disdainful are they of caregivers.
