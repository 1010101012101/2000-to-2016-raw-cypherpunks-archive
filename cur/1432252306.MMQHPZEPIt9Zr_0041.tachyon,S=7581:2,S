I had not followed GamerGate until today's New York Times
article about it. Nor followed games, so the controversy is
new to me. But not the issues involved, which are prevalent
online and off. Particularly in testosterone-rich enterprises like
military, spies, armaments, sports, weapons, ideology,
religion, education, society, civilization, humanity, existence
itself. In all of these, the stronger violently dominate the
weaker and do so with the psychotic belief that this is
the way it should be, natural.

In war and peace, in human exploitation of animal and earthly
domains, in climate degradation, in force-feeding "democracy,"
in cruel treatment of women's bodies and neglect of children,
in just about every aspect of torturous "advancements in
civilized peoples" in the course of inventing and applying
ever greater and more vicious ways to kill, maim, starve
and over-populate earthlings by male rape in all guises
of wargames.

Games are a reflection of the this much greater conceit
of male dominance in all institutions, all of them, even those
which spout diversity and affirmative action and grant minimal
access to privileged male sanctuaries -- no matter the skin
color, ethnicity, faith, location on earth.

It is argued that male aggression inherent and can at best
be somewhat controlled by law and social compact. That is
a comfortable apologia by male supremacists in law and
social compacts dominated by them with intellectual and
economic arrogance. All institutions measure accomplishment
by male-derived standards to tip the balance in favor of those
rigged games.

GameGate is too limited in scope, so much that it should
be seen as a male-dominated diversion, a game, to avoid
addressing the origin and sustaining influence of male
way of thinking, doing, making, competing, surviving, by
lying, cheating, killing, ruling in all aspects of existence,
simulated in games, trained for in games, monetized by
games designers and producers, applauded and lauded
in halls of power and control, in prizes and awards, in
cemetaries and statues, in art and science, in accumulation
concentration and monopolization of wealth.

No game this larger world, this wargame of "ballsy"
potentates in military, policy, spying, media, sports,
taxation, playing obsessively the "law of men enforced
by lawmen."
