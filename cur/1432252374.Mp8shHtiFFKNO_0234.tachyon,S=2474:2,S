Sort of.

I still have concerns about whether reading via Gmane is /actually/
anonymous, but said concerns are going to be present in pretty much any
active form of obtaining the list.  To technologically ensure anonymity, it
would either need to be read via TOR (which, looking at TOR's threat model,
is not that close to perfect anonymity, but may be close enough for most
person's needs), or to feed it into something like Freenet.

There's also the concern that not everyone carries the Gmane feed.  It would
probably be more effective -- not to mention simpler, potentially more
anonymous, and more resilient -- to stick the list into a newgroup under the
alt namespace.
