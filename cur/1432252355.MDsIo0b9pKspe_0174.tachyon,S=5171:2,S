[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Declan McCullagh is Wired News's 
Washington, DC Bureau Chief and is in Washington State testifying at 
the Jim Bell trial.  Below is a message Declan sent to me concerning 
an invitation I sent to Freematt's Alerts and to a few other net 
mailing lists about the restart of Seattle cypherpunks meetings.  The 
infiltration of political groups is nothing new going back as far as 
nations have had secret police forces.  In the late 1980s and early 
90s I served as a local Libertarian Party chairman in Ohio 
(Columbus).  Several strange happenings made be suspicious of several 
people that were active in the party.  Suspicious enough that it 
prompted me to file FOIA requests with the FBI.  After the usual 
several year process I was declined info about spying on the 
Libertarian Party-  But the FBI did confirm that by releasing the 
records they did have would have violated the privacy of a third 
party (The informant).  And yes I think I know who it is and no I 
won't say because I can't be 100 percent sure.   I have managed to 
unmask informants and out right agents, once at a machine gun shoot 
in Knob Creek, KY and once at another local civil rights 
organization.  I'll be writing a more lengthy response to this.]
