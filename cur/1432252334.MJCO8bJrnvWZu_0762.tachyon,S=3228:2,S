<DIV>Dear sir . </DIV>I'm doing my Master degree research on parallelizing the LUC algorithm, and the Extended Cubic LUC algorithm. 
<DIV></DIV>I try first to program both of the algorithms sequentialy with the standard C language. And so far with small integers both the algorithms are working perfectlly, But the problem that I have encounter is how to deal with very larg primes such(p,q,N), since they are larger than the largest reserved field at the C language[unsigned long]. 
<DIV></DIV>And how to deal with non integer Plaintext, since the algorithm work with integers only. 
<DIV></DIV>I will be so greatfull if you could feed my knowledge and illustrate those points to me. 
<DIV></DIV>Thanks for your cooperation............. 
<DIV></DIV>yours....
