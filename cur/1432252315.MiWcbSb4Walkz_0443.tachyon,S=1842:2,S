    It would be hard to verify/test that you had in fact cut the correct

    Firmware hacks are of course the free man's last refuge.

Of course disabling your GPS unit will not prevent the fascists from
doing triangulation with signal strength, ie the alternative (and
cheaper
and less precise alternative).  That's merely physics and
geometry.  To counter that,  you need to hack the antennae and and
can only displace yourself a few miles.
