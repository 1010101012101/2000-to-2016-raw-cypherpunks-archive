I'm not sure I believe that, or much of anything else put out regarding
a bioagent. ("We have everything under control. Just continue to pay
your taxes and do what we tell you and everything will be all right.")
Are there any real doctors or vets on the list who can confirm it from
their own knowledge? (Sorry, I don't think I want to trust the word of a
"Dr Evil". <grin>)

I figure the spores have to come from somewhere, and they seem to be
grown in animals and then released to spread. According to the CDC page
on the subject, "Anthrax most commonly occurs in wild and domestic lower
vertebrates..., but it can also occur in humans when they are exposed to
infected animals or tissue from infected animals". Humans are animals,
aren't they? Do the spores reproduce only in herbivores?

Well, maybe I'm just cynical from experience with the government's lying
and concealing for our own good.
