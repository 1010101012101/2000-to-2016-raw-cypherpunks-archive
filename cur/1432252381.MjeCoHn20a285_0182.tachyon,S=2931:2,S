So how do you feel, for instance, about bullying in the form of cooperative
isolation of someone by his/her peers? Certainly everybody has the /right/
not to speak to someone...

Only that sort of thing harms people more than an occasional, physical
punch, something which few liberty-advocating people would say is tolerable.

I think liberty should carry a pricetag of tolerance.
