  Looking at this more, I think it's two separate problems. I don't get the
"recipient list suppressed" or whatever it is from Declan's posts, it just
appears that something is wrong with the header, and it's probably something
minder.net is doing and I haven't done a group reply to anyone else posting thru
minder.net. But with Steve's, I get the same thing Tim got. What list is Steve
posting thru?
