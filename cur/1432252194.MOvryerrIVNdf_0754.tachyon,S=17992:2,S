What plans? If anything I find "their" plans to be highly turbulent and
confused. It's as if speech disintegrates completely into white noise, and
then people become soldiers and start marching in unison. Pretty insane, if
you ask me. It's all build on the conceptions of God, King and Country. Now
with God gone, Kings dead, and Country integrated with all the others, it
becomes exceedingly unclear what people fight for. Economy? Terrorism? You
tell me.

They send a Coast Guard Cutter and a squad of marines to escort you back
home forcefully. Or just leave you, without giving a damn. They couldn't
declare war without first declaring you a nation, which they won't, because
internationallylegally you aren't.

Unfair doesn't factor into it, if you ask me. Being a gentleman... well..
You'll probably be the offender in their eyes.

The thing is, violence is difficult. You're not allowed to harm a foreign
national (I'd be Dutch, you'd be whatever you'd be) for no reason
whatsoever. So maybe the coast guard will trick you into doing something
wrong, like shooting them first. There's no territorial waters when you're
not a nation, so they'll be allowed to ship right in.

But either they don't have a reason to care (and why would you do it?) or
they cannot do something (which is highly circumstantial) or you're just
not their match and lose. You'd say there's a chance you'd win, but there
probably isn't without being huge (Cuba is big enough though).

Somehow many nations still have never admitted to recognize Taiwan as an
independent nation, nor recognized it to be part of China. Taiwan still
claims to be the original and legitimate China, but sits on it's own seat
in the UN. Bottom line? Who know what will happen! Sealand exists because
at some point they were clearing it with a helicopter, but they had AA guns
on the platform (wtf?!), so the helicopter went away again and Britain
really isn't going to risk lives for winning Sealand back.

Well, Hong Kong's future is yet unsettled. It's held up surprisingly well,
if you ask me. It sure is o-so-British to invent some kind of
in-between-ownership-or-independence deal for 100 years. They always have a
ton of fun, those British lads. See also: Kowloon
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City>.

So, those nations are doing well? I'm not sure what this does for you.
Internally, the nations you mentioned give much less security, wealth,
freedom and sometimes privacy to it's people. Internationally these nations
have posed large national security risks time and time again, seemingly to
very little avail other than to remain isolated, poor and sad.

I really (really) think we have huge *huge* first world problems. But, I
don't think the mentioned nations are doing any better.

Will this independence be better? How, why? These aren't trivial questions.
I believe the right conclusion for the wrong reasons is still wrong.
Independence seems like the right conclusion, but you must know why.

Power of law is a security as much as it is a risk. Humans act strangely
around things such as "duty", "honor", "law", "allegiance", "right", etc.
Haven't quite found the pattern, although one's own profit is a pretty
constant factor. Sometimes honor is the act of defying game theory for the
global better, but often it's not. (Also, let's stay away from the DPRK, k?)
