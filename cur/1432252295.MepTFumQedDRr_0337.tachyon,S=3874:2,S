Earlier you mentioned another problem that I left out, which is that even
when two protocols use the same kind of component, they'll use subtly
different versions of it to obtain certain performance or security
properties or just to "fit in" with the rest of the protocol. I think
eventually the problem will turn into how to redesign all of these
protocols to use only components from a standard set.

Rather than wait for that, I think anyone who wants to implement a
protocol should just do it with the currently available tools. My
perspective may be warped, but I think even without higher level building
blocks, the crypto part of such a project is easy compared to other
problems like OS integration, scaling, UI design, business planning,
marketing, etc., etc. The fact that most interesting crypto protocols are
not being used is almost certainly due to a combination of these other
problems rather than the difficulty of implementing the crypto.
