Would a free vacation be enough to convince you to save some money every month?  What if I threw in free airfare too?

All you need to do is go to:
http://cognigen.net/corporate/?owen

Check the Best Rate Calculator, and then choose the  lowest rate 1+ (no lengthy access number, no busy signals) long distance service provider you can get!  They have lots of other great telecom 'stuff' too.

That's it. Now go get your free vacation and free airfare:

http://iwav.trip4free.com/orbit


Still not enough incentive?  Need another reason to lower your phone bill?  How about if I also throw in a free 500-channel satellite dish with free installation?

Isn't this an offer you can't refuse??  (Even if you DON'T want to lower your phone bill, you can still use the free stuff -- there is no obligation.)

P.S. Cognigen is also a great business opportunity -- no cost EVER to be an agent.  Massive passive residual income. You could send this same ad.

Note: I respect your privacy, and this is a one-time mailing from me.  If you would rather be removed from the "travel" list I purchased, just send a blank email with "remove" and your email address in the subject line.  I will forward it to the list source.
