	IIRC it's heavier, not harder (more mass for the size). Lead and 
Gold (as the !Dr mentioned) are both (cm^3 for cm^3) heavier than steel, 
and both are "softer". Both also make (in the material sense) better 
bullets for certain types of targets, with the exception that gold is a 
lot more expensive than lead, and far more useful as bait for the things 
you want to shoot.
