2001 Conferences

8th CACR Information Security Workshop
2nd Annual Privacy and Security Workshop
The Human Face of Privacy Technology
November 1 & 2, 2001

Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research (CACR)
University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada

This is the first announcement. Please pass this announcement to any 
colleagues who might be interested in attending.

Updates, including the abstracts of talks and speaker bios, workshop 
program, and hotel information, will be posted to this web-site as 
the information becomes available. This information will also be 
included in the second announcement to be mailed on July 16, 2001.

INTRODUCTION
The 8th CACR Information Security Workshop: The Human Face of Privacy 
Technology will be held November 1 & 2, 2001, at the University of 
Toronto, Canada (exact location to be announced). This is the second 
annual conference jointly organized by the Information Privacy 
Commission of Ontario and the Center for Applied Cryptographic 
Research, University of Waterloo.

WORKSHOP THEME:
Cell phone users were recently outraged when their private 
conversations were streamed live over the Internet. Digital cell 
phone users became equally stressed when the wireless encryption 
standard - 802.11 they had been using to protect their conversations 
was cracked. Even more disconcerting, places such as Guatemala see 
human rights workers, using privacy technologies to protect other 
civil rights groups' identities and the information they report on 
civil rights abuses, experience daily threats of information theft as 
well as kidnappings.

Within the last year those involved in developing and implementing 
technology have experienced a growing awareness of privacy risks 
within those technologies and a better understanding of privacy 
averse environments. This awareness has brought to the fore the need 
to further develop and implement technologies that are privacy 
protective. Parallel to this, around the globe, economic crime units 
and law enforcement agencies, governments, businesses and lawyers 
wrestle with the tools to combat the international specter of cyber 
crime, while often sidelining key privacy issues. The exploration of 
privacy and security issues is fundamental to understanding how the 
construction and implementation of privacy policies and technologies 
can be improved for the real world.

This year's workshop will explore these and other privacy and 
security issues through a mix of traditional panel discussions and 
presentations as well as a Mock Cyber Crime Trial with audience 
participation and an interactive subject rights counter-surveillance 
event lead by Dr. Steve Mann, U of Toronto.

The workshop builds on the comments and suggestions provided by last 
year's delegates and speakers who suggested a further exploration 
into both leading edge privacy and security technologies and an 
exploration of the context that these technologies work within. As a 
result, the conference has been expanded to cover two days, including 
parallel breakout sessions. Attendee spots have been increased to 210 
to meet demand and more time for discussion and networking has been 
set-aside in the evenings. For early registrants a conference package 
will be sent out before the event that includes additional material 
on the conference objective, speakers/organizers and a detailed 
backgrounder for the scheduled Mock Cyber Crime Trial that will take 
place.

The intended audience includes technology and security experts, 
CIO's, senior technology executives, cryptographers, engineers, law 
enforcement, academics, private sector leaders, privacy experts and 
students.
