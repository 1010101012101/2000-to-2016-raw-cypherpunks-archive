Actually I was kind of joking. I was gently implying that anyone that 
adhered to a religion where God is a human being on the planet Kolab can't 
be super-bright. But then again, the CEO of Corvis is a Mormon and he's not 
an idiot, though he is by every account a megalomaniac and rather 
sociopathic.


"Good luck trying to buy a beer, BTW."

Actually on Thursday night I found a good little brewpub just a few blocks 
from that Temple (and that's their world HQ, BTW). There were a couple of 
others even closer, but they were hidden in a backalley like a 
speakeasy...kind of amusing.

But the Mormons themselves (like SLC) are strangely banal...I was wondering 
where 'Landrew' was. Also, absolutely no caffeine, either. When they told me 
true Mormons would never knock back a  good cappucino I told them that was 
simply too much for any good NYC boy to bare.
