>The Managed Privacy Services Process
>Zero-Knowledge MPS fuses sophisticated infrastructure
>design, advanced cryptographic systems and world-class
>privacy expertise to deliver strong privacy integration to
>a wide variety of business processes and system designs.
>Following a period of assessment and design, MPS culminates
>in the deployment of a tailored privacy layer that
>integrates seamlessly with the client's existing enterprise
>applications.
>
>* ASSESS AND ADVISE -- Managed Privacy Services begins with
>a thorough assessment of each client's data storage and
>usage patterns, as well as their business objectives. From
>this assessment, recommendations are made regarding areas
>where data can be better utilized through the addition of a
>strong privacy layer, and areas of potential privacy risk
>are identified.
>
>* DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT -- The assessment stage provides the
>framework for all aspects of the infrastructure design, and
>determines which Zero-Knowledge privacy technologies are
>best suited to the client's needs. The result is a solution
>that not only secures and protects the client's data, but
>also allows for a wider array of data-driven activities.
>Professional systems integration ensures that all the
>client's business requirements are met, and guarantees the
>final design will result in the most robust and flexible
>system possible.
>
>* VERIFY AND MANAGE -- Zero-Knowledge is able to manage all
>elements of the privacy infrastructure, allowing clients to
>focus on their core competencies, and providing third-party
>credibility to a client's privacy initiatives. Independent
>audits ensure that the system deployed is in compliance
>with stated policies, and that all controls are functioning
>as per the design specifications.
>
>Zero-Knowledge is committed to deploying systems that are
>transparent and accountable. In keeping with this policy,
>MPS will incorporate third party verification and split
>encryption key structures, as well as provide consumers
>with access to white papers, independent auditors' reports
>or other materials that assure a company is doing what it
>claims. With MPS Zero-Knowledge strengthens its commitment
>to building responsible systems that empower consumers to
>control the disclosure and use of their personal
>information, while still enabling businesses to thrive in a
>data and relationship-driven marketplace.
>
