Hi,

I realize now I didn't state the scaling correctly in my example. Let's
try it again...

Let's say I use an algorithm of O(x^2).

My initial problem set size is 10 and I use x resources in y amount of
time.

If I go to a problem set size of 20 then I use (2^2)x and (2^2)y. And not
x^2 and y^2 as I originaly typed.

So, to gauge the resource difference between two problem set sizes of
x and y, with an O(f()) and z being run time for x, and w being the
resource load for x, we get,

y/x = dx

And the new run time for y will be,

f(dx)z

And the new resource load for y will be,

f(dx)w
