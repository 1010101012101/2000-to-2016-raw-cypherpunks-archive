Not so sure we need to be quite so cynical. Obviously this encryption 
is useless against state-level agencies, since data is encrypted 
server-side and Google manages the keys ( although the fact that they 
think they won't be obligated to hand the keys over to the gov't is 
bullshit). However, what I think is important to see in this story, is 
that Google is responding to pressure from the public to take privacy 
and encryption more seriously. This is an opportunity for security and 
privacy activists to push for real security solutions for user data 
storage, that involve strong *client-side encryption* of data.
