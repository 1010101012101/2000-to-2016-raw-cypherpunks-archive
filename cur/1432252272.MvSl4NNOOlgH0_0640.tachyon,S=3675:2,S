Indeed.  

If it's coming from Redmond, and as usual if it smells of evil, there is
an utterly simple solution in dealing with it:  don't buy it.  Don't buy
Microsoft software, don't buy motherboards that include TCPA capabilities.  
When you're up for getting yourself a new PC, get a generic one without
such options, or if you insist, call the vendor and tell them you want a
box without evil-inside and without a Redmond OS pre-installed.

Buy a generic intel/amd machine without the "Secure" processor, or give
Steve Jobs some of your cash for a nice G4/G5 machine, or you can go to a
generic PowerPC motherboard and run Linux, or you can go to McNeally's
shop and buy an UltraSPARC, etc.  There are plenty to choose from.

If you find uses for TCPA, by all means, have fun.  

If you think Microsoft's secured from you OS platforms are the way to go
for you, by all means, Ballmer and Gates surely could make better use of
more of your cash than you can.

Vote with your wallet.  The market will ultimately dictate what M$ will
and will not sell in regards to operating systems, digital rights
management, application suites, and so forth.  

End of story.
