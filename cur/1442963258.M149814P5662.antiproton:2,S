	It isn't bollocks, at all. English signs on cnn that just
	happen to match the pentagon's war propaganda are obviously
	suspect...except for biased people or people in the payroll of
	the pentagon.

	The signs are not proof of american imperialism. The signs are
	proof of the kind of 'conspiracy' that people partial to the
	american government deny. 
	
	American imperialism doesn't need any kind of subtle 'proofs'.
	It's part of all fucking history books since 1776.


	" reptilian overlords." 

	Don't you have anything better than that?
