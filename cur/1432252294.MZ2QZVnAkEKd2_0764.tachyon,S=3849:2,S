But that's no excuse for JB not sucker punching back.  The only reason for
running your own defense is so that you can get nastier in cross-ex than a
lawyer can.  If you can't do it, you're better off having a lawyer do
everything.

I think JB had the worst of both worlds - a lawyer who he alternately
ignored and fought with.  I wasn't there but just an impression.

I think Jeff used up all the low-hanging fruit on the list.  Anyone else
he goes after comes expensive.  Maybe Choate but would he really be worth
it.

Anyone with half a brain could put on a stronger defense than the two
previous victims.  We either have the money or the emotional resources to
corral a defense.  CJ & JB didn't really even try.   For example, neither
got real lawyers.

They need an overt act.  Mere chat won't be enough.
