You're going to learn something else. Once squirrels grow up they don't
look to 'other' squirrels for behaviour. It's already set.

Squirrels can't learn to solve problems by watching other squirrels.
Outside of birds and people, there aren't a lot of animals outside of
primates and cetacians that do learn by observation (and this can be, and
has been, proven by observation).

At most a given squirrel is doing a correlation analysis on whether they
(and I challenge you to demonstrate a squirrel has an 'I', which is
necessary before they can have a 'they') see a problem or not. After
enough false alarms the squirrel HABITUATES and ceases to respond to that
call FOR A SHORT TIME PERIOD. You can also find may studies on this
involving Meerkats and Chimps (there are lots of studies of chimps - three
calls - snake, cheetah, bird).
