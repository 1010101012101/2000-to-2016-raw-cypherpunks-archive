^^^^^^^^^
"Taser" is the stun gun to which I was referrring as unsaleable (is that a
word?) to mere civilians.

Additionally, I was referring to federal law, rather than state law, since
(as we have seen in California's medical marijuana clinics) state laws are
meaningless in the face of federal laws.

I have left a message on an answering machine for regarding Anonymous'
question for a citation, and will forward it when I receive a return call.

The Taser issue is one I very recently (~2 months ago) researched, as I
had planned to acquire and [openly] carry one.  So much for that...

Just imagine the hassle the BATF is in a position to dole out.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
