Declan, I finally realized what you were talking
about when you wrote this: 

DM wrote:
#
#    [Vatis'] reported comments are a little, well, unusual. 

This was apparently what you were referring to: 

Tim May receives NIPC internal notes:
#
#    Michael Vatis, deputy assistant director and chief of the Federal
#    Bureau of Investigation's National Infrastructure Protection Center
#    (NIPC) created February 26, 1998, told the Senate Judiciary
#    Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information June
#    29 that 'crypto anarchists" see Washington's computers as "the final
#    exam, the ultimate challenge, the enemy which must be destroyed."
#    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these persons out of
#    the public debate. 

Notice the closing quotes on Vatis's testimony. 

I immediately read and attributed that last sentence to another voice. 

We are looking at an FBI agent's internal notes, recounting events. 

Who said this: 

#    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these persons out of
#    the public debate. 

General Ashcroft, of course. 

Here, I'll combine it with the smoking gun: 


#    Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing these crypto
#    anarchists out of the public debate. NIPC has been tasked to
#    assist in the take-down of a high-profile hacker terrorist at
#    the DefCon conference next week in Las Vegas. The take-down is
#    being planned for maximal public impact, as per AG Ashcroft's
#    memo of 24JUN01. Full assistance will be provided by NIPC. Plain
#    clothes agents will be at the conference to render assistance. 

Oh my gawd, he's a "terrorist"!!!

All that boring traffic Tim got.net, that
is what most traffic is: boring. 

Don't believe my "traffic analysis"? 

Ask Tim what the SMTP headers say. 

You've got a major story on your hands. 

Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. 

Sat in your lap. 

Why didn't cypherpunks think of this virus?
I guess we're not predatory, like the DOJ.
