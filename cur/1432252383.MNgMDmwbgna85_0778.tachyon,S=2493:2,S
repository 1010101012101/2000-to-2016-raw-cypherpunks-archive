California's law against Driving While Speaking Spanish is only
about 10 years old, and was a Pete Wilson thing.
It happened about when I moved here - did other states start
doing similar things in the mean time?
The Feds started bullying states into collecting SSNs
when issuing drivers' licenses in the mid 80s,
ostensibly as a way of preventing duplicate registrations,
but I hadn't heard they'd been doing this.

"Homeland Security"?  Back when Pete Wilson was State Reptile,
he was at least only claiming it was to make it hard for illegal immigrants
to come here and compete for jobs and get welfare,
but wasn't pretending they were a threat.
