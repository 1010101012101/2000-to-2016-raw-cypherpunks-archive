	"Catastrophic" health insurance--insurance which covers 
things massive trauma (car accidents etc) or Cancer are pretty cheap.

	If one has the resources to pay for "routine" health care up 
to and including extensive surgery (say 20 to 40k), it can be a 
reasonable filler.

	Minor surgery is relatively cheap--IIRC my hernia repair was 
only about 5 to 7k in 1997--this is out of the reach of the lower 
half of the socio-economic scale, and it made me damn glad I had 
health insurance, but it's hardly something that most people 
*couldn't* pay off if they were so inclined.
