You missed the main point. It's not that they can't tell you are there
from the picture, it is that they can't tell that you had any particular
association with the other guy. If you meet out by the 3rd oak from the
top of the wall in a Maine hayfield, it is obvious you met by
arrangement (unless of course you both live i Maine and are in the habit
of talking country walks). But if you are both on camera at the same
football game it shows nothing but that you are both watching football. 
You walk in, buy your ticket, stay for the whole game and walk out and
have done nothing out of the ordinary. Railway station even more so.
Anyone and everyone can have perfectly legitimate reasons to go there.
So you are on the photos? So what?
