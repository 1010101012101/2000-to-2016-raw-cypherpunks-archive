Home (Audio) Recording Act of 1992.

It created the tax and specifically immunized those who make recordings 
for personal use, not for profit or sale.

As I have said here before, a somewhat obsessive friend of mine has a 
library now of at least 4000 CDs recorded onto DAT and CD-R. He goes on 
"library runs" where  he visits 5-6 nearby library branches and checks 
out the maximum number of CDs at each, sometimes as many as 15 per 
branch. He started out by loading them into a CD changer and 
automatically duping them to DAT. Now he just uses a 48x reader and 24x 
writer (I think that's the speed) and copies each in a matter of a 
couple of minutes. The usual online sources give the songs, from a code 
on the CD, and his color printer prints a label which he affixes to the 
CD-R.

I know other people who do the same thing with DVDs, though this is not 
legal under the above Act. And there are issues of quality with DIVX 
(not the Circuit City scheme, but another).
