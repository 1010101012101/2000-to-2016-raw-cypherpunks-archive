Safeweb principally offers web browsing anonymity.
Our source for the RIAA meeting allegations used a
hotmail address which resolved to a Safeweb IP
address. However, I don't see on Safeweb's site
an anonymizing mail service. Is there such a service
by Safeweb or does it sell an anonymizing e-mail
program?

The source last wrote that "multiple" Safeweb protection
was used to cloak the messages. Is there a way to chain
Hotmail to Safeweb, or some other way to "multiple"
Safeway protection as preamble to Hotmail?

It would be intriguing to learn that the source is
connected to Safeweb itself, or Safeweb's backers.
