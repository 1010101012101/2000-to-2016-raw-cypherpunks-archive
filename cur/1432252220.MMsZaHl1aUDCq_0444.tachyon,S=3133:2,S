While by default I hold libertarian positions, doing so sometimes
requires uncomfortable contortions.

Who, for example, should the inhabitants of Tuvalu sue for rising
sea levels? Neighbouring territories for failing to prevent excess
seawater from crossing their mid-ocean border? Arctic nations 
for sloppy handling of the runoff from their melting icecaps? The 
rest of the human race for burning too much stuff? Me for driving a 
Suburban?

Sometimes ownership is so distant and diluted that
individual responsibility is impossible to establish, yet the
problems are real, and significant.

[This is just an example, ok? Lets NOT fork into a debate over
the reality (or lack thereof) of global warming.]
