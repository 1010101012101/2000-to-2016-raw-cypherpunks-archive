No, we know that it's not necessarily in the best interest of stability, 
people outside of the U.S. or the U.S. for that matter. Apart from 
creating a unipolar world. And how the status quo serves the U.S. Which, 
not unlike smoking cigarettes causes cancer but reliefs my anxiety. Not 
saying that the CIA causes cancer. But I'm also not saying that the CIA 
functions in the best interest of the US. But I don't even think we want 
to have this discussion.

Yes. Agreed.

Not much of a government then eh? This is mostly semantics. As a 
non-ISIS-supporter I'd like to see ISIS' governing body overthrown and 
their constituents heading in a different direction. But yea, that might 
mean your principles take a hit.

Simply not true. Transgressions yes. But to put it like that is 
polarizing the issue. How many pin France as the steward of the 
Vietnamese conflict?

How many pin the ECB as the steward of growing inequality in Greece? 
Cases of kids fainting from malnutrition? With all their economists they 
could not reliably tell Greece was never fit to join the Monetary Union?

Europe's unilaterally dropping the ball on Ukraine, and in very recent 
history, Kosovo.

Actually, more specifically it's a concentration of power in the hands 
of a few (1?) individual(s).

European diplomacy works only because of NATO. And NATO  is U.S. 
Firepower to put it bluntly.

The fact that Putin understands that projecting power without 
repercussions is so delicious. You really want to be at the mercy of a 
that person? Talk about concentrated power....

Surely, you understand why they did this? There is a perfectly good 
rationale for running these kind of operations. It's just that you're 
miffed about the fact that you're not able to do anything about it.

So if you're part of some impotent government that does not know how to, 
or wants to project power, instantly you're at the mercy of institutions 
of governments that can. No amount of tree-hugging or moral high ground 
is going to save you from extinction.

And it's not all that bad. It's mostly power-play and politics really.
