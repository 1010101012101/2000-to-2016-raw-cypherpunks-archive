There are however some bad people, who want to conquer and
rule.  Some of them are nastier than others.  Those people need
to be killed.   Killing some of them is regrettably

Your history is back to front. China and Vietnam stagnated,
until they invited capitalists back in, and promised they could
get rich.  Mean while the countries that we were not "kicked
out of" for example Taiwan and South Korea, became rich.
