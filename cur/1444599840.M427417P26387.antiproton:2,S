It's simple.
Someone made a mistake. Best was initially assumed full of shit by JYA, as
he's a neophyte - and is consistently 'off-message' for this list.

Others, wishing to read more into it, other than face value of hubris, see
plans within plans.

At the end of the day, Bests' disclosures amount to nothing of consequence.
At best he overhyped them, being a neophyte. At worst he's JTRIGd the list,
hilariously easily. The technical cognoscenti on the list stay quiet, "code
compiling" as the good doctor says.

In general, this oversight is valuable because it demonstrates one thing:
Even if you try to delete it.
If there's a signal it will leak. Purposefully or not.

When the protocol you use doesn't provide metadata anonymity, don't expect
it because you won't get it. If you don't understand this - keep studying.

Why guess at 'motivation'? Do we need to FUD yet another leaker site? Put
your money where your mouth is - improve it, donate, write your own, fix
the bug & plug the hole.
