That was the nice thing about Ross Perot.
If he'd gotten elected, he'd have caused serious chaos in Washington
(even though he was basically just another Republicrat),
and the worst case is the Second Amendment said we could shoot him
if he got too crazy.

Unfortunately, he wouldn't let go of the Reform Party,
preferring to give the party to the Transcendental Meditation cult
if it wasn't going to be run by the Ross Perot personality cult,
and now Buchanan has a certain risk of coming out behind the
Libertarians :-)   (Probably won't happen, since the LP hasn't done
enough successful publicity to get mentioned in the media's
"oh, yeah, there's also Nader and Buchanan" afterthoughts, but it'd be nice.)
