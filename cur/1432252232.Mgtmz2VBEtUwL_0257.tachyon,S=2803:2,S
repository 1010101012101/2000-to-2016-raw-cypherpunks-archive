Both of these these stories lack plausibility as far as I'm concerned.

1. For Flight 800: Why would a terrorist wait so long, and shoot at
a plane at such an extreme altitude and range? It would have made
a lot more sense to fire just after it got off the ground. Far less chance
of a miss.

2. WTC: If you have the ability to insert tower-busting bombs into
the WTC towers, why the hell would you go to the trouble of doing the
plane thing? It tooks extra months/years, with high training costs, many
extra people, and a substantial chance of failure or detection.
For that matter, why the hell would you wait the better part of 
an hour before blowing the charge?

Sometimes you just have to remember Occam's Razor.

Terrorists may do evil things, but they are not usually that
stupid.
