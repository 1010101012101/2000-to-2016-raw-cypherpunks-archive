In recent years California citizens have decided against new 
electric power generation  projects  within their jurisdiction and to 
enforce strict air pollution standards on any existing facilities.  

This is great as long as the people making this decision pay the 
cost.  Unfortunately the cost of these decisions are not being borne 
only be the citizens of California.  The bad decisions of the citizens 
of California have produced an energy crisis in what is called the 
Northwest for which all citizens in what is called the Northwest must 
pay the price.

Here I sit in Vancouver BC Canada paying outrageous prices for 
natural gas because of the demand in California for natural gas for 
heating and electrical generation purposes.  I feel California should 
pay for their previous decisions themselves, if you don't want power 
plants don't use power or pay the complete premium for your 
decision.

Of course the system can never be made to work in this way so 
here I sit in Canada paying for bad decisions in California.
