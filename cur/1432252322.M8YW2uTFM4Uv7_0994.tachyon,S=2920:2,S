Walter Mossberg, WSJ technology columnist, wrote
yesterday about the need for the Internet coming to be 
treated like other forms of communication, that now
is the time for its special treatment to end. He said
to get rid of pseudonyms and anonymity, that people
need to own up to who they are. Implied that national
security is at stake.

Weird, for Mossberg is usually level-headed, and the
WSJ has recently been fairly critical of the power grab
of the Bush government in the name of national
security.

You might think Mossberg has had a personal problem
with anonymous criticism. Or lost a loved one in the
recent tragedy. Or just wanted to take a swing at
nobodies to strut his courage, bygod, courage to
demand the world be safe and secure like it used
to be before the Internet.

Or maybe he got outed for using WSJ's servers,
or his wife's PC, to eat some lonely guy porn.
