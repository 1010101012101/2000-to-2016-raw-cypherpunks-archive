Event Description: Drafting Effective Federal Legislation and Amendments -- 
A "how to" program for federal agency staff. This one-day conference is 
designed to help you write and revise your agency's bills and amendments 
effectively and concisely. In addition to discussing the role of the OMB 
and examining the different formats and deciding how to choose the best one 
to highlight your agency's issue, we will discuss how to: - Define your 
audience and broaden the appeal of your measure. - Assess existing law and 
policy objectives before putting pen to paper. - Structure bills and 
amendments and streamline the drafting process. - Ensure that your 
legislative draft is interpreted exactly as intended. - Comply with style, 
grammar, punctuation guides and the U.S. Code rules of construction. - Use 
different drafting styles to work in your favor. -- TheCapitol.Net is a 
non-partisan, women-owned firm that is the exclusive provider of
