   Philip Zimmermann, creator of PGP wrote in to tell me about [1]Zfone,
   his new system for encrypting any SIP VoIP voice stream. His first
   release is Mac & Linux only. I tested it with him using Gizmo as our
   client and it was pretty trivial to use. While it should work on most
   any SIP compatible VoIP client, he hopes that clients like OpenWengo
   and Gizmo will incorporate Zfone directly into the UI. Zfone has no
   centralization, and has been submitted to the IETF. He hasn't yet
   determined a license, but he believes strongly in releasing source
   code for all encryption products. A windows client is forthcoming.
