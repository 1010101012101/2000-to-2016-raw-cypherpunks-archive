Never underestimate the power of the combination of the People With 
Agendas with Classified Computerized Profiling Algorithms. :)

Be vigilant.

Define "us"?

Personally, as a relatively frequent flyer, I worry much more about things 
like cutting corners of fuselage and engine maintenance and quality of 
fuel (and, perhaps even more, the quality of onboard coffee) than about 
bombers on board. (On the other hand, local states grew out of their 
imperial-lust phase couple decades/centuries ago, which makes their people 
less disliked. Somehow lesser tendency to trigger-happy gung-ho a-ramboin' 
seems to be helpful too.)

Seeing things in perspective sometimes helps.
