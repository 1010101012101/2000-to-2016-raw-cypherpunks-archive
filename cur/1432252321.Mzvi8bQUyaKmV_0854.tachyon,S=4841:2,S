I am a really big fan of "Buffy".  A cute chick, lots of 
violence and killing, and a bit of sex, what more can one ask 
for in a TV show?   Recently due to family crisis, I missed a 
couple of shows.  So, using usenet, I downloaded the two one 
hour shows that I missed.  I had no problem getting them, the 
download ran in the background.  It did not seem to take an 
unreasonably long time, though I did not bother to time it.  I 
started the download, proceeded to do other things, and when I 
remembered to check, the download was done.   So I then watched 
the shows.  The image and sound quality was excellent, the ads 
had been deleted.  The stories were rattling good.  Loved the 
bit where buffy says "I am the law", and picks up a great big 
naked sword and stalks off to apply the instant death penalty, 
while Xander flutters about ineffectually being deeply caring 
and emotional and having deep moral debates about the use of 
violence.

I have never downloaded a tv show off the internet before. 
Everything just worked, no fuss, unlike some encryption 
programs I could mention.

My experience is that the mass media are doomed.  This stuff 
works just great for me.   I have stopped downloading music 
until I organize the music I already have.   Napster was just 
great, worked with no fuss.  Maybe the Napster clones are not 
as good, but my experience with downloading TV shows suggests 
that piracy is working better than ever.
