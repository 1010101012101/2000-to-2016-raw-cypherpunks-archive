But that's not the whole problem, here.  ICANN may be, arguably, subject to
"those laws," but it isn't clear that those laws (per se) were responsible
for the disconnection.  Is there a law, somewhere, that said "anybody who we
determine appears to be violating the law in America, we 'unaddress' them
before they get a trial."   That certainly isn't normal procedure:  There
are probably over a thousand Internet Casinos who are (the thugs would
argue) in violation of some American law, yet they are still accessible to
us.

(It's very unlikely that "the law" anticipates "the need" (cough, choke,
ptooey!) the government thugs found themselves with.    ICANN might be
considered the publisher of a large "telephone directory" that happens to be
accessed by electronic means, rather than printed on a big lump of dead
tree.  Suddenly, one of the listees angers the govt:  Govt. demands
immediate "delisting."    Notice that this is impossible with "dead-tree"
directories.  Current law doesn't even anticipate the possibility of
de-listing, at least not before the next directory is published.)

No, I presume what's happening in those "votes-for-sale" cases is that ICANN
is responding NOT to any black-letter laws, but in fact to the simple
desires of various authorities explicitly beyond (and prematurely, at that!)
what their legal authority grants them.  An extremely bad precedent.

ICANN needs to be taught a very painful lesson:  "Even if you feel that you
must obey a specific law, you must not do it without initiating a legal
process and continuing it through any valid appeal.  Given that the election
was only a few days away, it is obvious that no such process would be
completed before the point becomes moot.  You screwed up."

Then, <BANG!>
