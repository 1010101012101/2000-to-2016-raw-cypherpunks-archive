"Technological Advances in Assessing Threats to Judicial
Officials"
Sheriff (08/01) Vol. 53, No. 4, P. 34; Calhoun, Frederick S.

The majority of sheriff offices throughout the country
assign personnel to handle threats made to judges according
to which situations pose the greatest risks. Los Angeles
security consulting firm Gavin de Becker has developed an
advanced threat-management system that incorporates
computers. Assessing which threat poses the most risk to
court officials or jurors is difficult. According to the
U.S. Marshals Service's case files, people making threats
rarely carry them through. Gavin de Becker's MOSAIC program
provides a series of questions designed to assess the
potential risk posed by different situations and people. The
Supreme Court Police use the program for ensuring the safety
of the chief justices. (www.sheriffs.org)
