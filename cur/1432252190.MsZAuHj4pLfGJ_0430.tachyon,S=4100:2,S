Yep.  And any parent who relies on v-chips is *abdicating responsibility*
by depending on someone else's ratings.  Similarly with internet
content ratings or MPAA filtering (PG vs R) or FCC filtering (content vs.
broadcast time, or their stupid labels on broadcasts).

To Bear: my reference top "machines under others' control" means
censorware which hides its list of sites from parents.

Certainly relying on other editors (filters) is useful, but parents have to
pick the editors carefully.  This is not a political but a personal
responsability issue; as far as the state goes, no filtering can be
*imposed* by others in a free society.  My point was that a parent
voluntarily chosing 
some black-box default is not doing their job.  

\begin{political} A parent forced to use filtered feeds needs to eliminate 
that force, then that imposed filter.

Anyone can open up a ratings system and filtering tools.
And they are free to have open or secret lists and rules.  You
are free to pick and choose raters you like ---just like you can
chose to eat kosher-rated, or 'organic'-rated, or whatever. 

But the filters can have no support from the State, for that is censorship.
Freedom + filters = lame parenting; 
State + filters = censorship.
\end{political}

Precisely.

Yes.  

Plus the insult of being forced to pay for it.  Along with CALEA,
locatable cell phones, parental advisory labels, etc.
