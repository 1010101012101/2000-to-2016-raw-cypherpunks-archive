You fucking idiots who want "closed" lists have several choices:

1. Those who came before you _already_ created closed lists. 
"Cryptography" and "Coderpunks," for example. Join _those_ lists.

2. Subscribe to one of the filtered lists, e.g., Ray Arachelian's list.

3. Create your own lists.


BTW, if you are posting to the "toad.com" address, as you are, you 
are too ignorant to be giving us advice on how the list ought to be 
structured.
