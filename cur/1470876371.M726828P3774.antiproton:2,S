Just to be clear, I'm not judging anyone's sexuality. I'm pointing out
that the community has a double standard. That people like Jake who act
male (even if they're gay or bisexual) get lynched. But people who are
just as promiscuous, but act female or androgynous, get a pass. They get
to be victims.
