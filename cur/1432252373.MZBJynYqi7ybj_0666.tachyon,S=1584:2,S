James Gleick's NYT article on the OED mentions "cypherpunk"

The page requires registration to access, though there are enough
popular pseudonyms that have done so; I don't know if any of the

I've been using one of the no-response email systems for my login.

I don't have a subscription to the online dictionary to
see what they said about it.
