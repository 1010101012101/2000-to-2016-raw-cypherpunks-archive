"Credit" has many dimensions (or application).  The NYT has more
journalistic "credit" than Drudge.  Don Trump has more
financial "credit" than readers of this list :-)   Various
members of this list have more list "credit" when it comes to e.g., physical

in a multitude virtual corporations, there's a lot of behavior
to keep track of.

Social primates are uniquely equipt to monitor conformance with social
contracts.

The automation of reputation is so natural its not funny.
