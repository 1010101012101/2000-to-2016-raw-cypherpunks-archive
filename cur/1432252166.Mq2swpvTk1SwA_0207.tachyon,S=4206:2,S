If I were a remailer operator, I'm not sure I'd like this. Active
cooperation with another remaler operator means that if
he/she/it does something illegal, you could be dragged in
on 'conspiracy' charges, regardless whether you actually
had any knowledge of the the other operators nefarious
activities.
