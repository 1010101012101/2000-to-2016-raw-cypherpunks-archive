the lie is assuming these requests over plain-text were ever private :P

i find that understanding data requires placing in the utmost context
of additional data, thus leading to a cycle of expanding corpora.

i understand if this discussion is a bit forward to have a public,
like some of your referrers. why did you install that toolbar? for
shame...

i'm not sure who bandmon is, but they're not coderman@gmail.com. i
would however be amenable to uploading a list of sha-256 digests to
verify components of similarity between the torrent and origin.

actually one may cross reference with their own requests and circuits,
for high confidence of legitimacy.

i find it apropos to now quote the original disclaimer in full:
