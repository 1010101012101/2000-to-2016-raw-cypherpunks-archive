	Further note, I figured out the kernel of truth in the above.
There was an *addition* to interstate stalking law 2261A on 10/28/2000
which involved electronic communications (106-386), that seems to
have been the basis of 1 (one) (uno) (00000001) of 3 (three) (tres)
(00000011) later counts of interstate stalking against Jim Bell.

	Grumble, no reputation-capital in countering urban-legend-punkery :-(
