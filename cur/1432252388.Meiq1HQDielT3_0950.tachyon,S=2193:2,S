Buying Initiatives  

A House committee is marking up a bill on May 22 that could strike at the heart
of ballot initiatives nationwide, significantly undermining the efforts of drug
policy reformers. A little-known segment of a bill reauthorizing the mission of
the nation's anti-drug agency could give the drug czar authority to use taxpayer
dollars to pay for media campaigns directly targeting state ballot measures. If
the bill passes, and agency chief John Walters uses public funds to hammer
initiatives the administration opposes, it would run counter to the whole
purpose of ballot initiatives, establish a disturbing precedent for federal
electioneering and hobble advocates pushing for saner alternatives to the War on
Drugs.
