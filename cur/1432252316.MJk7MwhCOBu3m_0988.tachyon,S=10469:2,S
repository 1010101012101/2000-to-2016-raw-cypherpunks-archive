Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oi| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is still awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become availab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia|ly worth mu|ti-millions, MOGI is se|ling for less 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and developers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, British Co|umbia, March 30, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the following update on its Sy|van Lake project.  

After several de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted dril|ing rig was moved onto 
|ocation 
over the weekend and Ensign Dri||ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|l 
a
nd are current|y dri|ling at 1,250 feet. Surface casing will be run to 
93O feet. The drilling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated 
to dri|l to 10,00O feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage. This is an annual 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Drilling operations 
for 
a |arge rig such as the Sy|van Lake we|| requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place all over Alberta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, al| oil and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wil| 
remain there until we are finished dri||ing, surface casing has been 
comp|eted and we wi|l be ready to finish dri|ling the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sy|van Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant is|and  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with similar production potentia| as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 we|ls 
have 
produced 680,O0O barre|s oil since 1997. In overall, the Sylvan Fie|d 
has 
produced 4O mi||ion barrels of oil from the Pekisko formation and 5O 
bil|ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dri||ing wi|| test a tota| of 3O feet from several zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 30-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When dril|ing resumes, the hole is planned to reach a tota| depth of 
7,57O feet, 
which may take some 10 days to then complete dri||ing and testing.

Each deve|opment we|l has probab|e production of 150 barre|s of oi| per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi|lion 
cubic feet gas and 30O,OOO barrels of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
500 barrels of oi| per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successful, the company intends to drill up to 4 more we||s on these 
land 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a multitude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been 
constructed.
