Polish journal "Nie" (means "No") specialising in scandals has revealed
partial contents from 12 hard drives that have leaked from Polish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These drives contain more than 4000
documents from years 1992-2004, some of them labelled "secret".

After the Ministry and ABW (Agencja Bezpieczenstwa Wewnetrznego, our
NSA) have confirmed this leak, minister Cimoszewicz has resigned from
his position. The resignation was however not accepted by the president.

The drives have leaked when the Ministry has upgraded their computers.
Old drives taken by a technical worker of the Ministry and sold to a
retailer for a price of the  drive itself . The retailer, however,
realized economical potential of the data stored on the drives and sold
them to the journalists.

This case should teaches us a lot, indeed...
