Well, there was also some other details left out by that article. A "100kW 
beam" doesn't tell you very much if you don't know the beam diameter. A 
1310nm telecom laser can cause serious eye damage with 10mW, but that's 10mW 
into, say 38 um^2. But it ain't going to do nothing to enemy aircraft 
located at a distance. A 100kW laser might easily have a smaller energy 
density depending on the diameter. In addition, there's the problem of 
focusing that thing through turbulence, but turbulence through certain 
wavelength windows may not be a problem.
