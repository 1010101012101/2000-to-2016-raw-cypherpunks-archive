Well, I've been playing with one of those little Tor USB doohickeys.

But that's a very different thing from allowing anyone, anywhere to pull a 
Tor client down onto a java virtual machine.

Of course I'll grant that such a publically available Tor node offers a kind 
of anonymity that most Cypherpunks would pass on, but I still maintain that 
huge increases in quasi-anonymous traffic* is good for those of us who roll 
our own, more secure communications.

* By Quasi-anonymous I mean potentially breakable, but only through the 
exertion of significant TLA resources. In other words, too expensive to do 
fishing expeditions on big-mouths.
