They can't "prove" it, but AIUI given the current evidence there would have
to be something pretty strange going on for it not to be quantum effects.
But even if they ARE using quantum effects, they still need to prove
they're faster than any classical algorithm for some problem.

Depends on what you mean by "practical". Perhaps fewer applications due to
the fact that you can only approximate the answer (with accuracy increasing
as you increase the number of braids), but potentially more scalable
because the braids are more stable. If IBM's computer can't be scaled up to
the point that it's more than a toy, but TQCs can, then the TQC would be
the practical one.
