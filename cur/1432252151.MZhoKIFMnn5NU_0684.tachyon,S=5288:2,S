Hello-

Here is a brief update on NIST's crypto standards efforts:

1.  On January 5, 2001, we announced a Draft FIPS for HMAC (Keyed-Hash 
Message Authentication Code) that is a generalization of HMAC as specified 
in Internet RFC 2104 and ANSI X9.71.  A 90-day public comment period ends 
April 5, 2001.  Details are available at <http://www.nist.gov/hmac>.

2.  On January 2, 2001, we posted a white paper that discusses our plans 
for developing standards and recommendations for public key-based key 
management.  This will be a two-part process, involving the development of 
1) a scheme definition document, and 2) a key management guideline.  This 
paper is available at <http://www.nist.gov/kms>.

3.  The Draft FIPS for the AES is anticipated for release for public review 
in the very near future.  Final approvals for the release of this document 
are pending.  When an announcement is made, information on the draft and 
for providing public comments will be available at <http://www.nist.gov/aes>.

Best regards and Happy New Year,

Jim

[This note is being sent to those people who have attended any of NIST's 
AES conferences, the Key Management Standard (KMS) workshop in February 
2000, the Modes of Operation workshop in October 2000, or who have 
expressed other interest in our efforts.  If you would not like to receive 
similar notices in the future (which should be infrequent), please let me 
know, and we will remove you from our email distribution list.]
