It's not? Demonstrate where Libertarian or Anarchic ideals take care of
this person even in principle? Explain how they're not turned away and
left to die? 

And don't invoke the old 'somebody will take care of them' bullshit.
Because it is clear today that many people don't get taken care of at all.

Explain why moving to such a system will empower the mild of human
kindness in these sad souls?

They could, but they're not stupid. In a un-regulated market the insurance
companies will focus on profits alone and that unfortuantely (and much to
the chagrin of the libertarian/anarchy crowd) means that there will
actualy be LESS insurance available and it will exist at a higher cost.

This can be done today legaly, the question is whether the newer more
accurate technologies should be used. NOT wether such policies can be
written.

Leving her free to die, that ungrateful irresponsible bitch (for getting
cancer that is).

No, it means savings for the insurance company. It is clear that history
shows that unregulated markets do not in general move to a minimum in
costs and servicability. Hell, look at the aircraft industry for contrary
evidence.

And what you seem to miss is that your 'free market' theory is screwed for
the simple reason that real life doesn't conform to free market theory
without some major modifications (that happen to require at least light
regulation).
