But you can cheat if there is a feedback.

Suppose that an external party (as opposed to multiple personalities housed in
the same wetware) diagnoses you with attribute A (eg. "you write in
disconnected fashion and often mention "state") which you neither understand
nor agree with.

You then, blindly, do the opposite of A (~A) (write closely related sentences
and never mention state).

This is called acting and many can do it on regular basis.
