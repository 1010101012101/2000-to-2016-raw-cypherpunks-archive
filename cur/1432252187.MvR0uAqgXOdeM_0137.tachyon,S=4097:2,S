(sent to AAAS members)

Dear AAAS Member:

As the anniversary of September 11th approaches, AAAS continues to
be engaged in issues that relate to national security and the role of
science and technology.  One such issue is the safe and responsible
conduct of research involving biological agents and toxins.

AAAS was recently asked by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to
assist in alerting our members to the federal mandate (Public Law
107-188)
requiring all facilities and persons that possess, use, or transfer
agents
or toxins considered a threat to animals, plants, animal and plant
products
and/or public health (called "select agents") to notify the CDC and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Approximately 200,000 facilities were
sent a copy of the notification form by the CDC.

The deadline for submitting a completed form to the CDC is September 10,

2002.  All entities that receive a copy of the form must comply, even if

they do not possess a select agent or toxin.  If you are in possession
of
a select agent or toxin and did not receive a form, you should call
CDC's
toll-free number: 1-866-567-4232.

Further information on the select agent list, procedures for
notification,
and exemptions can be found at the following websites:

CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/lrsat.htm
USDA: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ncie

AAAS is initiating an effort to monitor the effects of new national
security initiatives on the research community.  In that regard, we'd be

pleased to hear about your experience, whether positive or negative,
in complying with this new federal mandate.  You can forward such
information to Dr. Mark Frankel, director of the AAAS Program on
Scientific Freedom, Responsibility and Law at mfrankel@aaas.org

Sincerely,

Alan I. Leshner
Chief Executive Officer
