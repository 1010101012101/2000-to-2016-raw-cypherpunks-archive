And I'd agree with you.

Putin sure wanted and tried hard over many years to create an alliance
with the west, and genuine state-level economically mutually beneficial
"partnership", with perks of "fighting the same 'bad' guys together".

Over and over he kept/ keeps getting snubbed - so yes, the lack of any
rapproachment between Russia and USA is certainly not for want of Russia
trying...

Perhaps this failure of USA to get in bed with Russia is a better long
term outcome; I suspect so.
