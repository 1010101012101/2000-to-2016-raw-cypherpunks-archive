I think it does a little more than that.  "Deny the luser owner
root access" is sufficient to explain how the luser is prevented
from copying or modifying the trusted content, but it doesn't
explain how "trusted" apps can access the data.  
In essence, deny the luser root access + all programs signed
by microsoft automatically run as root. Neither piece alone
would be innovative enough to be patentable, but maybe the combo 
is.
