Do you have plans to try and hang the Supreme Court Justices who upheld
Sodomy laws in Bowers v Hardwick?  What about the significant minority
of Americans who'd completely agree with Santorum's remarks?  The
Justices involved with the majority opinion in Bowers, most notably
ex-Justice Lewis Powell, need some S&M experience with Satan far more
desperately than does Santorum.  Santorum's just a patsy.
