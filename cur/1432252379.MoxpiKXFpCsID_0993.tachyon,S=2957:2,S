http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/23552.html  Life imitates art...we 
hope.

In Buffalo, New York, eighty-two inches of snow fell during a three-day 
period last week. The townspeople began to dig out almost at once. They 
leave their shovels by the doors in Buffalo, and a recent Washington Post 
article made note of why. It's so they can shove the front door open just 
an inch or two against the tonnage of snow, and pull the shovel inside, 
from whence they begin to dig outward and uncover the world once again.
In a New Year, having experienced a blizzard of destruction and death ...

On blacknet they are screaming for intell on leveraging this dump to create 
havoc...ideas?
