That isn't the reason why a click-through agreement isn't 
enforceable---the agreement could, were it enforceable, validlly
forbid reverse engineering for any reason and that clause would
in most cases be upheld.  But, unless you buy your software from
the copyright owner, you own your copy of the software and
clicking on a so called agreement with the copyright owner
that you won't do certain things with your software is---or,
at least should be---as unenforceable as promise to your doctor
that you won't smoke another cigarette.  The important point
is not, however, that click-through agreements are probably
unenforceable; the important point is that people---at least
those people who think that they own their own computers and
the software copies that they have purchased---generally
believe that they should be unenforceable.  (And in the
actual case involving Linux and DVD players there was no
agreement not to circumvent the technological control measures
in DVD's; the case was based on the theory that the circumvention
violated the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.)

I don't think that one should confuse contract limitations, or 
limitations on enforceable contract limitations, with technological
limitations.  There is nothing, for example, in any legal system that
forbids one from violating the law of gravity.

One of the many problems with the use of the Digital Millenium 
Copyright Act to enforce the technological control measures
in DVD's was that it was based on the rather weird theory
that it should be illegal to do something that someone
else tried, but failed, to make technologically impossible
to do.

(Thus I am rather doubtful that Lessig's idea the everything is
code is useful for analytical, rather than rhetorical, purposes.)

: I think lawyers will hate this.

I don't see why we should.  We don't hate the law of gravity
or the law of large numbers.
