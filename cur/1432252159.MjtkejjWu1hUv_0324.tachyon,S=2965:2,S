   WASHINGTON -- Music and record industry lobbyists are quietly readying
   an all-out assault on Congress this fall in hopes of dramatically
   rewriting copyright laws.


   With the help of Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of the
   Senate Commerce committee, they hope to embed copy-protection controls
   in nearly all consumer electronic devices and PCs. All types of
   digital content, including music, video and e-books, are covered.


I think any Senator who signs on for this has earned killing.
