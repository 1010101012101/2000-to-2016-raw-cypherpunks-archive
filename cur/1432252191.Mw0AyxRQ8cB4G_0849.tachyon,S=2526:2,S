I like the idea, however it could be a management nightmare.

How would you meter the http vs https traffic? How would you
meter the pgp email vs the non pgp email? Many pgp emails
(including mine) have some non encrypted stuff in it (such
as the sentance 'PGP message follows' or whatever.

Good Luck!
