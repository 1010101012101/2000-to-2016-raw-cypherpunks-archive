The first thing cops do is make backups of the harddrives.
So you can't destroy the "real data".

You would need a tamper-"proof" card (ie trusted security region)
to implement this.  None of the commercial memory gizmos,
from USB dongles to stamp-sized memory cards, do this.
None of the smart cards are user programmable and none
include secure wipe, AFAIK.  Do PDA apps?  How do they
store data between battery changes?

Is it enough to hold a tiny memory card for a minute over a lighter?
Merely snapping the card into pieces?   Does one need to
make a scene with fireworks?   (I'm remembering that spammer
who tried to eat a small memory card.)
