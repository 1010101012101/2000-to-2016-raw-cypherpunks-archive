That's true. However, that's still better than Google or Bing, which do=
n't=20
even go that far.

Also, I kind of like the fact that the results are not "bubbled" into w=

"insights" are gathered from my search history. Now, that is not to say=
 that=20
such "insights" are *not* gathered -- they very well might be! -- and I=

Pics or it didn't happen.

...first to a big white building in Washington D.C., but that had to be=

fluke -- as mere minutes later it was a compound in Beghazi; there it s=

for a couple of months, afterwards moving to the Red Square in Moscow, =

and then to Langley, Virginia, before finally arriving at the location=20=

currently visible in WHOIS.

Don't ask me how I know, though.


What I'm trying to say, I guess, is: it would be nice if we had somethi=

to work with than just "some guys on the Internets said that for realz =
