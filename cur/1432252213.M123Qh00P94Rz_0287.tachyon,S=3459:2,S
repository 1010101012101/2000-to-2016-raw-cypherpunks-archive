Dave,

I've been getting lots of continuing interest and queries in the
wake of my blog item from late last year:
"How To Tell If Your Cell Phone Is Bugged"
( http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000202.html )

In an effort to explain this issue in a more demonstrative
and somewhat less technical manner, I'm pleased to announce a
short free video (under six minutes): "Is Your Cell Phone Bugged?"

While I'll admit that the production values are much closer to
those of Ed Wood than of Cecil B. DeMille, I hope you'll still
find this video to be interesting, or at least amusing.
