Doesn't make sense.  If the government imposed rationing, that would have
kept a few people from buying up everything, or if they required the
price to be very high, it would do that, but I assume you're saying they
artificially kept the price low - in that case, it's *easier* for somebody
to buy up everything and hoard it.

Duh - basic supply and demand.  Major disasters imply that obtaining more
stuff in the near future will be difficult or impossible, so buyers
have an incentive to pay more money to get anything they can right now,
and sellers have an incentive to ask for more money for the stuff they've got.
If the sellers gouge too hard, they risk alienating customers and losing
future business to their competitors, but the goods they have are worth
more now.
