  This last Memorial Day weekend, I was heading off to work at my fun historical
reinactor job at a state historic site (I get to run a 150 year old sawmill) and
dressed appropriately. My wife's car was parked behind mine in the driveway, so
I pulled hers out and into the neigbor's, pulled mine out onto the street, where
there is no parking -- but hey, FedEx and UPS stop there all the time, so do
contractors who are working on homes in the area and can't get their vehicles in
the driveways, this is a historic district afterall and driveways are pretty
damn small -- so just as I was about to get into my pickup and drive away, an
Oshkosh pig pulls up behind me, lights on. He says, "Is that your truck?" and I
say yes, I was just switching cars in the driveway. He says, as he gets out of
his car, "Step over here, please." Asks for my license, "You can't park
there." And I answer, "I'm not, I'm just switching cars." 
   Then things get more serious -- "I smell marijuana, do you know marijuana is
illegal?", which is total BS since it's been far too long. Then he says, "Do
you mind if I search you?", to which of course, I replied, "Yes I do, you have
no right to search me." I started to say, "Yeah, and I smell pigshit." but then
realized that if I did, I wouldn't probably wouldn't make it to my job. Normally
I would have escalated the scene as much as possible by bad mouthing him and his
mother as much as possible, but I really do enjoy playing at the historic site
and getting hauled to the jail for a few hours, even as much fun as that would
have been being as obnoxious as possible and giving them continual lectures
about how evil they are, how evil dubbya and asskruft are, how much I think that
people like them need to be rounded up and put into re-education centers and
given lobotomys so they can never bother decent people again -- still, I really
wanted to make it to the job. 
    So we were standing there at a bit of an impass, me saying "no, you cannot
search me." Then he says, "Well, for my own safety, I have a right to search you
for a weapon." I really, really, wish it had been some other time, so I could
have forced the issue and made him call for reinforcements, because it would
have been obvious to all and sundry that what this was really all about was the
big 3 foot tall lighted 24/7 peace sign on the roof of my house and the bumper
stickers on my truck and perhaps my hair, but -- ah well, maybe I'm getting old
-- so I let him do it. And, of course, instead of just patting me down, he went
thru all my pockets. Then he went over to the truck with my keys, and I thought
he was going to search that too, but then he must have realized he was stepping
into some real shit, with and stopped, put my keys on top of the truck, and got
back into his car and told me I could go. 
   So what am I ranting about? I'm not sure -- mostly, I guess, about how far
things have gone. That some young skinhead pig thinks he can do something like
this and get away with it. And it pisses me off more that it was such an
in-opportune time, because I really do love so much going off on them and
watching their stupid little faces get so flustered, watch their hands twitch
nervously toward their guns. I really envy all those Iragis with their easy
access to RPGs -- that's probably the only real answer.
    You know, there really are a lot of useless eaters, far too many oxygen
thieves, in this country. But it's not the welfare mothers and poor that Tim
always ranted about -- it's the pigs and those morons with the flags on their
cars and imprinted on their brains. 
    On the good side, I went to the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair this weekend,
and sat just a few feet away from the stage where John Stauber and then Amy
Goodman spoke, primarily about the media sellout in this country.
