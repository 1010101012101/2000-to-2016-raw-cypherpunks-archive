Hello buddie

You know what, I am in a very good mood so may I tell you a thing? I am a customer rep. leader target in your region.<br> 
As a rep, I'm given permission to send out 2 giifts phone every month as "returns" to frequent clients.<br> 
We just received the brand-new Apple iPad! <br>
Actually, nobody has claimed theirs yet for the period (I don't feel they seriously believe we do this :p)<br>
so if you claim one before midnight, I'll be happy to ship it to you .
