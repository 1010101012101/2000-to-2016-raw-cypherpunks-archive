looks like it will be Q1 2007 with 16 qubits:

regarding the deafening silence (where outright dismissal is not used)
in crypto circles about AQC: at what point does skepticism turn into
denial?  *grin*

a nice overview: http://qist.lanl.gov/pdfs/theory.pdf
"""
Aharonov, et al. [3] showed that a slightly more general formulation
of adiabatic algorithms, when used for quantum-state generation, is in
fact universal for QC. Designing quantum algorithms via quantum-state
generation is a novel and potentially important direction, because it
ties into classical algorithm design techniques using Markov chains
and techniques such as bounds on conductance and spectral gaps. As a
first step, it would be interesting to even give such an algorithm for
solved problems such as quadratic residuosity or discrete logarithms.
