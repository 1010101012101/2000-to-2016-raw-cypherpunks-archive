"...the body of Muzafar Avazov, a 35-year old father of four, showed signs 
of burns on the legs, buttocks, lower back and arms. Sixty to seventy 
percent of the body was burnt, according to official sources. Doctors who 
saw the body reported that such burns could only have been caused by 
immersing Avazov in boiling water. Those who saw the body also reported 
that there was a large, bloody wound on the back of the head, heavy 
bruising on the forehead and side of the neck, and that his hands had no 
fingernails."
There was a CHEKA torturer once who collected 'gloves' from boiling his 
victims hands."The United States has allied itself closely with Uzbekistan 
in the war against terrorism."
