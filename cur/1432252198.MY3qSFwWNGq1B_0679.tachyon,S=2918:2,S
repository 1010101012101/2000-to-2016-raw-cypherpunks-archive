Man Kills Eight Students in Japan

  OSAKA, Japan (AP) - A man brandishing a knife burst into an
  elementary school on Friday and slashed nearly two dozen people,
  killing at least eight children, in Japan's worst mass-killing since a
deadly
  nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways six years ago.

Police said the attacker, identified as Mamoru Takuma, carried a 6-inch
  kitchen knife.

....

Well we certainly hope Sec'ty Annan starts proposing internation bans on

the manufacture of kitchen knives and their precursor materials.
