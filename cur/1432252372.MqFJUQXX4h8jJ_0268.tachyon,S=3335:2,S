Bruce is indeed commendable for his crypto advocacy,
though he's backed off from that in recent years now
claiming  dependable security is possible only by the 
service he sells.

In his latest Crypto-Gram he applauds Bush, says
the US has got to learn to live with terrorism, that
there is no way to prevent it, just learn to be cautious
and careful of ever changing threats, and follow the
leadership of those who know what's what, again the 
way he talks about wise and realistic computer security.

Unfortunately for Bruce's once sterling reputation he
sounds more and more like a scare mongerer strictly
pumping up the protection racket.

Indeed, his promo for his firm now clouds his opinions,
although he may be suffering coercion of his investors,
call that economic terrorism, though Bruce cautions
the word is terribly overused for trivial annoyances
like those of investors hounding you to meet expectations.

What can you do with a mature professional no longer
free to do what he likes, pressured to beat the upstarts
and gray hairs, why make him a prestigous spokesperson 
for an industy, recycle his outpouring of advice. 

Don't get me wrong, this is not about Whit Diffie.
