Insurers are bettors. They weigh all available information and then 
set a premium based on their expectations. Even those with "bad 
genes" can get insurance...they just have to pay more. Sounds fair to 
me.

More to the point, "opt out" means that a person, call her Alice, can 
arrange for her own tests, done privately. For diseases to which she 
is not susceptable, she can "opt out." If she has vanishingly small 
expectation of contracting AIDS, for example, she can opt out. In an 
uncoerced society, yow else could it be.

Stop your lying. I was responding to the point made earlier that DNA 
is being collected by the police and is shared with insurers.

Those who won't piss in a jar don't have to work for Megatronic Corporation.

Employment is not a "right."

And none of _my_ employees are drug tested.
