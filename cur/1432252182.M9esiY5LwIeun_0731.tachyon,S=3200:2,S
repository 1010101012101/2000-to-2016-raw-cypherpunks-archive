The telcos are often legally required to NOT do this well. We should keep
in mind that the Adversary keeps the infrastructure compromised.

Ideally, it would be a plug-and-play thingy, a box with just a connector
and the antenna.

In "auto" mode, the box should ask the other side if it is a compatible
box, and if yes, do a key handshake.

There is no reason why it couldn't. :)

The Adversary won't like this. This is another reason why the design has
to be completely open and widely published. I can imagine a government
shutting down a corporation or an individual enterpreneur. I can't imagine
a government successfully shutting down eg. Linux movement, DeCSS, pr PGP.
Asymmetrical warfare in its best :)
