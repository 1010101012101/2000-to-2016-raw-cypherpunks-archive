	The Cypherpunks list is a mailing list. There is a very small 
variation in the ways one gets on and off mailing lists.

	If he doesn't realize he's on a mailing list, that is cluelessness.

	If he *does* realize this, he should be able to figure out 
relatively quickly how to get off the mailing list. That he can't is 
cluelessness.

	He is calling it spam. It is not spam. That is cluelessness.

	He is threatening people. People he doesn't know. That is 
clueless in a dangerous way.

	You are defending an ignoramus. That is also clueless.

Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government
