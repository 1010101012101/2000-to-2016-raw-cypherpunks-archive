            Man Who Scored Too High on Police
            Test Loses Federal Appeal 
            The Associated Press

            NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - A man whose bid to become a
            police officer was rejected after he scored too high on an
            intelligence test has lost an appeal in his federal lawsuit
            against the city. 

            The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a
            lower courts decision that the city did not discriminate
            against Robert Jordan because the same standards were
            applied to everyone who took the test. 

            "This kind of puts an official face on discrimination in America
            against people of a certain class," Jordan said from his
            Waterford home Friday. "I maintain you have no more control
            over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your
            gender or anything else." 

            He said he does not plan to take any further legal action. 

            Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate, took the exam in
            1996 and scored 33 points, the equivalent of an IQ of 125.
            But New London police interviewed only candidates who
            scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those who scored too
            high could get bored with police work and leave soon after
            undergoing costly training. 

            The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22,
            the equivalent of an IQ of 104, or just a little above average. 

            Jordan alleged his rejection from the police force was
            discrimination. He sued the city, saying his civil rights were
            violated because he was denied equal protection under the
            law. 

            But the U.S. District Court found that New London had
            "shown a rational basis for the policy." In a ruling dated Aug.
            23, the 2nd Circuit agreed. The court said the policy might
            be unwise but was a rational way to reduce job turnover. 

            Jordan has worked as a prison guard since he took the test.
