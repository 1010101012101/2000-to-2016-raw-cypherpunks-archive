Worldwide Caution - Public Announcement
January 5, 2001

The Department of State remains concerned about the possibility for
terrorist actions against United States citizens and interests throughout
the world.  American citizens are reminded of the need to remain vigilant
with regard to their personal security.  This Public Announcement is not in
response to any one particular threat or event but to emphasize the U.S.
Government's ongoing concern for the security of Americans overseas.

The Department of State continues to receive reports that prompt concern
about the safety and security of both official U.S. Government personnel and
private American citizens worldwide.  As always, we take this information
seriously.  As a result, U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a
heightened state of alert.  In addition, U.S. Government facilities have and
will continue to temporarily close or suspend public services as necessary
to review their security posture and ensure its adequacy.

In light of the above, U.S. citizens are urged to maintain a high level of
vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness
to reduce their vulnerability.  Americans should maintain a low profile,
vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. In addition, American citizens are
also urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objects, and to
report their presence to local authorities.  Vehicles should not be left
unattended, if at all possible, and should be kept locked at all times.
U.S. Government personnel overseas have been advised to take the same
precautions.

U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the Department of
State's Public Announcements, Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets,
and regional travel brochures, all of which are available at the Consular
Affairs Internet web site at http://travel.state.gov.  We will continue to
provide updated information should it become available.  American citizens
overseas may contact the American Citizens Services unit of the nearest U.S.
Embassy or Consulate by telephone or fax for up-to-date information on
security conditions.  In addition, American citizens in need of emergency
assistance should telephone the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate before
visiting the Embassy or Consulate.

This Public Announcement replaces the Public Announcement - Worldwide
Caution of October 12, 2000, and it expires on June 7, 2001.
