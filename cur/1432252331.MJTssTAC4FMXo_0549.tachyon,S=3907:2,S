Yes. But packet counting can also play a role. Cf, 
"Passive Attack Analysis for Connection-Based Anonymity Systems"
at http://freehaven.net/anonbib/index.html#SS03

It's not. Cf. my "Locating Hidden Servers"
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/index.html#hs-attack06
wherein we had zero false positives on any timing attacks conducted
in finding hidden services, which generally was very quick.
(That such attacks existed were known for years. That they were not
just possible but so fast and effective using merely a single
node in the network was the reason that guard nodes were introduced
into the Tor network.)

And building on that see, "Low-Resource Routing Attacks Against Tor"
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/index.html#bauer:wpes2007
where timing attacks with epsilon false positives
were based simply on circuit setup and were shown on general
Tor circuits, not just for hidden services.

There's been a lot of research on this. I think Nick pointed at
some. Cf. the anonbib.
Research against timing attacks continues. (I'm doing some myself.)
But so far, any "chaff" strategy in the literature is both too
expensive and not at all effective against active attacks on
general low-latency systems for wide use, such as Tor.

HTH,
