Subject: RIAA Cracks Down After Taliban Ousted

http://bbspot.com/News/2001/11/riaa.html


Kabul, Afghanistan - The Recording Industry Association of 
Afghanistan (RIAA) has begun a major crackdown on pirated 
music since the Taliban fell from power 2 days ago, and
launched their own bid for control in the war torn city. 
Many cheered the fall of the Taliban, but the RIAA feels 
that if music can be listened to that copyrights will be 
violated. 

Soon after the Taliban fled Kabul, black market Qamar Gul 
and Ahmad Zahir CDs were being openly peddled on street 
corners. Rumors of Abdullah Muqri MP3s circulating on the 
Kabul computer were widespread.

"It was much easier to control music piracy when the Taliban 
was in control. Now we fear that with their new found freedom 
the people of Kabul and in the rest of Afghanistan will turn 
to copyright violation to satisfy their musical needs," said 
RIAA President Ghulam Hotak. "An RIAA lead country will be 
able to enjoy the joys of music, but only if artist are 
properly compensated."

Opposition groups denounce the RIAA power grab. "We will fight 
to the last man to keep the RIAA from power in Afghanistan," 
said General Mahommed Dawood of the Northern Alliance. "We did 
not unseat the Taliban only to have them replaced by a more 
oppressive regime."

The Recording Industry Association of America has pledged 
support to the RIAA by offering troops from its elite piracy 
fighting Freedom Squad. "We can not sit idly by and watch the 
people of Afghanistan violate copyrights. Our brothers in the 
RIAA need our support," said Hilary Rosen.
