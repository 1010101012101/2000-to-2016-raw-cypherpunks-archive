CD burners place a unique BurnerIDCode onto each CD-R that they
write. Thus, a CD-R can be associated with the machine that made
it, much as color copiers place their serial numbers on copies they
make. 

Of course, this serves no useful purpose for the average user, but 
narcs out software pirates or samizdat publishers.

"You may not speak anonymously on CD-R".

I don't know what level of work would be required to modify it.
