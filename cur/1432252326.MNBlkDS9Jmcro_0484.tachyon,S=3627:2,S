Since I haven't noticed anyone else point this out (apologies for
my redundancy if I just somehow missed it),  it's worth mentioning 
that the original result was more of a "gee whiz,  it's interesting we 
can do this in principle" type of thing than an actual threat of
something anybody would ever actually do. Yes, you can trick a 
remote host into performing calculations for you with a specially 
prepared message, but it requires a hell of a lot more effort to 
prepare the message than it would to perform the calculation 
yourself.
