That varies from corp to corp - pure ISPs (as opposed to companies which =
are also involved in other areas of the media business), for example, =
are generally quite strongly opposed to filtering, wiretap and data =
retention laws, because they are a significant cost to them which makes =
their core product no better for their customers (and will often make =
things worse), without any useful benefit to them. Sure, they are only =
really interested in their own advantage, but their advantage coincides =
with the desires of privacy advocates, so an alliance of convenience is =
suitable.

OTOH, in the US many ISPs are also either content producers, TV =
companies, or POTS companies, and so have a strong interest in =
preventing their internet activities from harming those (often more =
profitable) areas of their business. Because they are themselves often =
beneficiaries of attempts to preserve traditional distribution channels =
and business methods, they are strong advocates for anti-privacy =
measures which they believe (rightly or wrongly) will help them while =
shifting any opposition onto the politicians.

Also, some companies have the sense to realise that even if handing over =
customer data is no great burden now, the demands from governments only =
tend to grow, and so opposing a small amount of snooping can protect =
themselves against a larger imposition later. (For example, the =
telephone companies at first only had to turn over data they were =
keeping anyway, then they were ordered to keep it at their own expense =
for government use.)
