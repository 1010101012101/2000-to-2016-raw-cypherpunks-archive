I'm not so worried.

=46rom the Criminal Complaint PDF I get the feeling that the charges are
on the narcotics, and the running of the shop where others can sell
those narcotics. ie. the normal witch hunt on drugs.

I get the impression that the use of bitcoin to hide identities is the
problem. Not the bitcoin itself. There are references at paragraph 12b:
use of a  Bitcoin "tumbler" to hide origins of individual transactions.

In paragraph 15: "Ulbricht has required ... Bitcoins, an electronic
currency designed to be as anonymous as cash".


The good news:

The FBI-author even states that "Bitcoins are not illegal in and of
themselves and have known legitimate uses. (Para 21.v)

In fact, they have been declared legal in Germany. You need to pay tax
on them, over there....

So, the biggest challenge is to make sure the general public gets to
know this fact.

Regards, Guido.
