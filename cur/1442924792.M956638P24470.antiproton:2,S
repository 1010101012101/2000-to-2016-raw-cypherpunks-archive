Very much so. Here's a helpful infographic version:
http://rys.io/static/amusing-ourselves-to-death-huxley-orwell.png
/not mine, unfortunately/

One thing to note is that one important way we are being intellectually=
=20
castrated is by being led to radicalizing our positions -- by the filte=
r=20
bubble, by keeping more and more to like-minded people on social media,=
 by=20
assuming "the other side" (whichever that might be in any given circums=
tances)=20
is "inherently evil", and by assuming off the bat what the "other side"=
 in a=20
given discussion has to say. Without listening, without thinking.

This, in turn, makes it impossible to find middle ground and to *actual=
ly*=20
understand the world, and to *actually* work to improve it.

Look at the US vs. Russia debate. Why the fuck does it have to be "vs."=
? Why=20
the fuck almost every single "lefty" person that I talk to and pass on =
my=20
concerns about what Putin (yes, personally that guy; I have no beef wit=
h=20
Russians as a people) assumes that at the same time I'm saying I'm okay=
 with=20
US internal or international policies? Why if I criticize actions of th=
e=20
Russian government I am immediately assumed to be defending actions of =
the US?

And, on the other hand, why do people that have (rightful) grievances w=
ith US=20
policies fail to even *consider* that maybe, just maybe, things in Russ=
ia=20
aren't all that great and that Putin is not entirely the victim here?

They are both fucked up, in many *different* (systemic racism in the US=
;=20
systemic homophobia in Russia), and several *similar* ways (oligarchy r=
unning=20
things). And yet they are able to play us, because predominantly we sim=
ply=20
cannot see the bigger picture and cannot seem to understand *anything* =
more=20
complicated than the simplified beyond belief "USA BAD RUSSIA GOOD" (or=
 the=20
other way around) worldview.

It sickens me.
