Hey, lots of people say their local cops are bums.
These cops are just admitting it.  What's the problem?

OK, so it may be insulting to the homeless.  But it's also appropriately
critical of the people who don't see the homeless when they walk by them,
so it's got as much claim to political correctness as incorrectness.

The state assemblycritter was so negligent that his daughter
hadn't learned to wear seat belts (regardless of who was driving)
and the voters elected him?  Sigh.  It's too bad that Darwin
didn't take out him instead of his kid.
