Afghans have been living, fighting, conducting their daily affairs, 
playing, or alternatively, starving and dying, amidst bombs and shells 
landing amongst them for quite some time now. Some of the footage PBS 
has been airing is pretty dramatic about this. Don't see most of them 
fleeing for the mountains unless maybe forced at gunpoint, which I doubt 
would work.

A few days and any bombed out roads or runways will be repaired enough 
to get the aid trucks rolling again. If you want to argue that the U.S. 
should not have got itself in the position of having to send its 
military over there (and all which *that* entails), I'd concur, but 
that's another matter, and irrelevant at this point, as far as the war 
itself is concerned.
