If you focus on user-experience, simplicity, and minimal dependencies you
might end up writing an exchange in python and running it on this:
http://micropython.org/ , and then getting an insurance company to underwrite
customers for any loss, including hacks.

Next step is make it run on a cpu you can audit the VHDL for...
http://yasep.org/
