Ryan,

3) DeCSS: probably good, although it seems to not provoke a terribly big
response from "The Enemy".  I'd be up for hosting an active server which
returned keys per DVD, so it's a bit more threatening than just static
decss code.

Didn't we have an offer from someone who wanted to put DeCSS up and actually
pay for it? What happened to those guys? I certainly still think that DeCSS
is the best way to go with this.
