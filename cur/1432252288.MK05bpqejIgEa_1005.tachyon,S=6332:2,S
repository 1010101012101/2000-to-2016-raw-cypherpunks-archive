All 100% true and anyone who disagrees is full of shit but you seem to
have missed subparagraph a) where people in their wonderful and
surprising variety have filled the void by assigning their own personal
values to their lives and the world around them. Values which they hold
dearly and do not have to justify to anyone unless they choose to.

Again, an accurate but useless observation. At least the accomodations
are good and we don't usually have to work on weekends and can get out
to the occasional ballgame or fishing trip while we wait for the
confirmation of our ultimate meaninglessness.

Here we go again. 100% true and 100% useless. People have those rights
which they choose and are able to guarantee themselves either
individually or as a tribal group.

Aha! Now we see the arbitrary values inherent in the system. Fleeing
from nihilism you have arrived at your current Pain Avoidance Value Set.
It is one of many possible sets. You would impose impose these values on
others as far as possible ( power thing ). Standard human behavior.
Nothing new or profound.

Arbitrary value set #1 vs. Arbitrary value set #2. Actually more of a
continuum where self-interest, and community interest ( and sometimes
looniness ) defines the camps and the players are free to choose.

Steal from them if you can but keep in mind that they will try to
protect themselves from your attempts to impose your arbitrary values on
them.

yawn. Since when has Agreement of any sort been a desired outcome?
