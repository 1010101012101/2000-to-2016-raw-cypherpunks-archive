   No, Tim is right. The Mormons might consider themselves to be "christian",
but are not recognized as such by any other denomination. In fact, they are
billed as a "dangerous cult" just like the Moonies, etc. by most christians. 
   If you really take a close look at Mormon, you'll also note that Lucifer is
considered the brother of Jesus and of equal, or even more important standing.
   And even more interesting are their rites for initiation into the Temple
(most Mormons never go thru this, only the elect) where the member, both male
and female, is completely disrobed, their body washed (every square inch) by
other people, then anointed, again, every inch, and painted with occultic
symbols, and they are then dressed in a sacred undergarment which they must wear
the rest of their lives. Even when bathing, at least one arm or leg has to stay
in the sacred underwear. They swear alligence to Lucifer during the ceremony,
among other things. 
   Tim is also right about the similarities to Islam. Joseph Smith was a con
artist who went to prison for scamming people with his "peep stone" which he put
in his hat, stuck his face into the hat, and was then able to read instructions
from the stone. Originally he was using it to "find" buried treasure, and this
scam got him busted, later he used the same "peep stone" trick to "find" the
"sacred writings", etc. Like Muhammed, he soon realized the necessity to have
mulitiple wives. He also, and some of the leaders after him, got the holy word
from god that told them that all the worldy goods of their non-mormon neighbors
belonged to them, and they went out raiding farms and towns, which got them run
out of New England, then run out of IL. which is how they ended up in Utah. 
   Bizarre group. Read their history -- fascinating stuff. So is the history of
Islam. A poor man, Muhammed married a rich widow old enough to be his mother,
got visited by angels, started Islam, decided men needed multiple wives, etc.
