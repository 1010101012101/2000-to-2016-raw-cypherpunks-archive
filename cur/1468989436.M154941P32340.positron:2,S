I can dig it.  But how to implement this?  My strategy is to let
Nature take its course; after the State collapses, surviving resources
no longer under State control will be up for grabs.

BTW, money as we know it is a fiction created and maintained by the
State for the purpose of enriching the powerful at everyone else's
expense.  See how easy it is to fall into the trap of compliance with
State sponsored assumpitons?  :)

Note that this would only affect the State itself, and those who have
made a positive commitment to submit to State dominion.

This ain't a call for regulation; it's just a call for public
reporting by a State agency.  ;)

Only if I expect this to produce real world results.  Prescribing
abstinence as a cure for alcoholism, or getting well as a cancer cure,
would be similar in effect.

For a start, if my (impossible) suggestions were implemented,
Microsoft would lose its most important State protections, all its
government contracts, and a large part of its market share in the
business and consumer markets.  Those product lines would be largely
replaced by UNIX model operating systems, Free software applications,
etc.

My first draft was an explicit Microsoft death sentence, I worked
backward from there to create generic, vendor agnostic conditions that
would assure the same result.

No anarchists were harmed in the production of this policy brief.  I
wrote it because it amuses me to keep a hand in - I used to do quality
assurance programs and the like, and sometimes I miss the games.  Also
to troll the Commission.

Thank you for your feedback, and may I add, OINK OINK.

:o)
