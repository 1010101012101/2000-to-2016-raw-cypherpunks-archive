No, you're missing the real issue. Having a tape of what was said is 
meaningless for two main reasons:

1. Selective quoting. Out of a typical interview, the reporter can 
extract the juiciest quotes, even if misleading and out of context.

2. Enforcement. Having a tape is not very useful. (Declan says some 
court rulings say that verbal agreements are binding, but this presumes 
that one would bother to sue, hire the lawyers, and see it through. I 
know I wouldn't. I'd rather pay $5000 to have a lying journalist whacked 
than spend a hundred thousand bucks fighting AOL Time Warner or General 
Electric and, probably, losing.)
