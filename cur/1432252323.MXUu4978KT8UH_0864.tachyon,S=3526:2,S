You're assuming he'll "shut up." I'm not so sure of that. I think that the
results, regardless of what they are, will generate plenty of conversation
by themselves. Worse, the results will multiply conversations, and not in
a good way; some argument will come up, and then the results will come up
as a point of credibility. Then it will be back to the same old back and
forth about the results and what they "mean." We might as well activate
some infinite automata and leave the room for drinks.

What's slightly pathetic about all of this is that it says that if only I,
too, could gain the disrespect of my peers, maybe I, too, could have
someone else pay for me to take the LSAT. Hey, at least that might make
my parents happy. They sometimes tell me that maybe I should look into
being an IP lawyer. Now there's a way to gain the disrespect of your
peers.
