Aloha, dear

Love is when one soul lives in two hearts… I am looking for another
half of my tender and passionate soul. I want to be a mother and 
a wife, I want to be a lover and a friend, I want to be your queen
and I want to be your slave! I want to be everything for you and 
I want your love to be my universe! 
I want each day for us to be a miracle… I want each kiss to be 
the first one… I want us to be the happiest… I want to create the
biggest love in the world… 
Do you want to dive into the ocean of passion with me? 
I am here http://hotnetlove.com/kidding

Looking forward to get a note from you

Stazy
