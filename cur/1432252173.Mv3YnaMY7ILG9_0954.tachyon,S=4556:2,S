Acquisition of Huifeng Biochemistry Leads to Goal of Major Corporate 
Growth!

Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20OO with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supplier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and 
Neutraceutical products worldwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of 
Huifeng for Secured Data Inc. is the ownership of proprietary and 
patented techno|ogy re|ating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a |arge grOup of phenolic secondary 
metabolites of plants that include more than 2,O00 different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the walls of the blood vesse|s including capi||aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 20O4-2OO5 are more then  $10O mi|li0n USD

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
