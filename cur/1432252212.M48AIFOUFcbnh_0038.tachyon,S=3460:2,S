When the market is "what a bunch of guys in suits decide is what I should
be able to buy" -- YES!

The reason unauthorized copying takes place to the extent it does is the
absolute disreguard for "the market" that those making the decisions on
what is available and/or what is promoted have for those "market forces".

When was the last time that actual supply and demand actually made a
difference in how much you had to pay for a movie or DVD?  Who else are
you going to get it from?

The bootleg market is the only real competition these conglomerates have.
