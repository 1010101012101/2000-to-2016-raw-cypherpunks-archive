DEFCON On The Mat
(A submittal in response to the DEFCON 22 Call for Papers)

• Presenter Information:  I am an entity, floating about.
• Presentation Information:  This is a challenge, mostly directed to the
DEFCON 22 organizers, to engage in sparring matches, one on one, with each
other, and with me, should I decide to attend.  Each match will be
refereed by someone (whoever is willing and able to call a beginning and
end to the matches and who will spend time on the mat along with two
opponents).  Each participant must begin and end each match with a bow to
their opponent.  Respect is the keyword.
• Scheduling Information:  Whenever you are up for it.
• Equipment requirements:  Your fists, feet, and sparring gear (don't
forget a protective crotch cup).  Also, bring protective headgear and a
mouthpiece.  Forearm guards, leg guards, and chest gear highly advisable. 
Booties and soft gloves are ok, but frowned upon.  Make up your own mind,
but protect your head and your middle bits.  If you have interlocking foam
squares (portable mat components), such as a bunch of SoftTiles, bring
them and help make a mat.  Don't wait for someone else to do it, just do
it.
• Speaker Bio(s):  Who said I would be speaking?  You want to speak to me,
meet me on the mat.
• Abstract:  Matches begin when random referee (whoever wants to stand in
the mat area) says "Start!" or "Begin!" or "Shi-jak!" 시작
• Outline:  Try not to bleed too much.  See detailed outline in lower
portion of this submittal.
• Supporting Files: Look around. See papers scattered on floor.
• Submission Agreements:  You agree that if you are put in a submission
hold that you will agree to never ask for submission agreements again.

Presenter Information
Primary Speaker Name:  Odinn
Primary Speaker Email Address:  odinn.cyberguerrilla@riseup.net
Primary Speaker Phone Number:  Sure, funny.
Primary Speaker postal address:  No address provided. No honorarium

Presentation Information
Presentation Title:  DEFCON On The Mat
Is there a demonstration? Yes.
Are you releasing a new tool? Please.
Are you releasing a new exploit? That depends on what happens to you
during the match.
Is there audience participation? Audience not participating in matches or
persons who come without required gear must remain outside of match area.
Length of presentation? Could be an hour. Could be longer.  Up to you.
Are you currently submitting this topic to any other conferences held
prior to DEF CON 22?  No.
Are you submitting to Black Hat USA? No.
Has this presentation been given or accepted to any other venue or
conference? No.

Is your ability or willingness to speak predicated on your talk being
accepted at Black Hat USA? No.

Scheduling
Is there a specific day or time by which you must present?  No.

Equipment needs & special requests:
-All the wireless internet I need and desire
-Some kind of technically competent helper human to help me connect my
Palm-powered Tungsten T to the Internet.  It has Palm OS 5, a TI OMAP 144
MHz processor, and bluetooth, so maybe you can make it work.
-Drinks, such as vodka and also water, if you have it.  It must be clean
water, though.
-Some kind of good food that is not rotten.  Pears and bananas are nice. 
Hamburgers are good.
-Please do not claim that someone stole your forearm guards or demand to
use someone else's chest piece.  You are responsible for your own gear. No
whining.
-Take your hits without crying out in pain, it doesn't look well to be
moaning and groaning when you have previously agreed to a match and have
entered upon the mat willingly.
-Thoughtful conversation
-Respect
-If I decide to come, you will pay for all my goodies and not attempt to
charge me anything for attending.  Failure to comply with this special
request will result in chaos

Will you require more than 1 LCD projector feed? No.

Will you require a white board? No
Are there any other special equipment needs that you will require?
If you have SoftTiles that are interlocking please bring them, they make
nice mat material.
I would like you to bring some concrete blocks.  If you have them lying
around or can get them easily, maybe 8 or 10 of them.  However, they need
to be the kind without rebar in them as they will probably all get broken
in a demonstration.  Also bring pencils or chopsticks so we can put those
between the blocks while the blocks are waiting to be broken.  Best blocks
are 4" standard concrete blocks or 8" standard concrete blocks.  Thank you
Also, I like hamburgers.

Speaker Bio(s):
I am a fellow human.  As an entity, floating about, I am happy to be here
with you and share your experiences, fantasies, delusions, etc.  Thank
you.  Blessings.

Abstract:
Meh.  Get to the mat.

Detailed Outline:
1) Get your gear on
2) Line up in orderly way and proceed to mat
3) When it is your turn to go, step onto the mat, bow to your opponent,
and wait for the referee to say "Start!" or "Begin!" or "Shi-ha" or
something that indicates the match has begun.
4) Fight.
5) The referee (random participant who decides to ref) will time the
match, at most two rounds of a minute each.  At end of first round you get
a break of about 30 seconds.  Referee decides when break begins and ends.
6) Referee notes second round is over.  It is not necessary for referee to
say whether or not someone has "won."  It is about respect.
7) Both match participants bow to each other, shake hands, and leave the mat.
