For this to make sense, we have to interpret Soldier to mean not
just agents of the armed forces (military), it has to mean 
law-enforcement as well.  I can accept the idea of abstracting the 
Third beyond humans to software/hardware agents, etc... but I'm
not so sure about the military vs. law enforcement distinction.  
Can anyone point me to some founder's writings that may help 
support the interpretation of Soldier to mean any agent of the 
government?

Even if we did extend the Third to mean law-enforcement... since
Congress has repeatedly ceded their authority to determine when
the country was "in a time of war" to the Executive, and as such 
we are now in a perpetual time of war, any quartering has to be
prescribed by law, rather than prohibited outright.  For these
reasons, I have to agree with Tim's earlier referenced post, to
the effect of "the only solutions now available are Technology 
and Terrorism."

I think someone in this case would have a much better argument for
a Fourth amendment violation (unreasonable seizure of their home, 
albeit temporarily), though probably, today, still unsuccessful in
a court.
