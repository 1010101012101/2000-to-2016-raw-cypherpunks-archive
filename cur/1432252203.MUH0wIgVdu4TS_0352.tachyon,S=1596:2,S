What exactly do you mean by a "simple LINUX OS"?

Do you mean a port of all or part of GNU to Java? Part of the Linux
kernel? Both?

The answers to the rest of the questions vary quite a bit depending on
what exactly you meant. This is part of the reason *why* referring to
both the kernel and OS as just "Linux" is bad.
