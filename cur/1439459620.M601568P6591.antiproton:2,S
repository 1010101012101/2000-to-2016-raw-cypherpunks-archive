define racism then cause i dont think we have the same definition really
also maybe we dont have the same definition of trolling

just saying someone is a race and is fucked up with power based on their
racial privilege is not racism

its like saying someones race and then being called a racist because you
categorized someone within their race

have we been socially engineered as racist and genderist and specieist and
ageist and mentally or physically challengedists - oh yes and we need to
build new frames out of it but you saying i am white and racist against my
"own" people because i hate the culture doesnt do that - if you really want
to do something about it have a really long think about designing new
frames... raise consciousness - make new words develop your own mind

are you being racist by deciding my identity for me ?... i dont identify as
white ... i dont act white ... its like i am a tansgender person that
identifies as a woman and you are telling me i am just a man and i have to
just face that ... you dont get to decide for me what i identify with

its really white of you to think you get to decide for me btw

I agree, massive ongoing public investment in water infrastructure sure is
a nice thing!  But most people on the planet do have potable water to
drink, tho perhaps not as plentifully as in America.  Not that many people
worldwide are literally dying of thirst.

umn talking people that dont have a tap to have fucking water in so... but
here i cannot drink the tap water maybe more common than you know
