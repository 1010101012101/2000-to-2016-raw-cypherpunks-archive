Your secret's safe
The ephemeral signals that flood the airwaves are the key to creating an 
uncrackable code, says Michael Brooks
5-jan-02 New Scientist.Looks like this...
http://humboldt.sunyit.edu/553/The%20Key%20Vanishes-Scientist%20Outlines%20Unbreakable%20Code.htm
or same difference

With the addition,"send money."in the NS,story.Ill write more on it in a
