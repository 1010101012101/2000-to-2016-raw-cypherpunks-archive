That thing is kind of complex.

AFAIK, inside pirate parties, there are always people that shout "we
should do more issues, most people don't care just about the internet"
and people that shout "we should do less issues, we know nothing about
tax reform and medicine, and we will not agree on anything meaningful
either".

And, as somebody said before, because it's a political party, you have
to do compromises, so they usually try to go somewhere in the middle.
