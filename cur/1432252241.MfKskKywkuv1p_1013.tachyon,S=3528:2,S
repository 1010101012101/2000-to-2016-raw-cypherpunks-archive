It's very simple.

Go to a military surplus store or your local Wall-Mart and buy a machete.  If
you buy a surplus one, you may want to sharpen it and polish the rusty blade,
although this step is not essential because one may hack quite noisily and
dramatically with a rusty dull machete.

Go out in your back yard and find some brush or small trees.  (Bamboo works
well but may not be available in your area.)

Hack away -- it's that simple!

Disclaimer:  In many states, if you hack at decorative trees or shrubs that do
not belong to you, you may be liable for a sum in damages equal to thrice the
actual value of the vegetation destroyed.
