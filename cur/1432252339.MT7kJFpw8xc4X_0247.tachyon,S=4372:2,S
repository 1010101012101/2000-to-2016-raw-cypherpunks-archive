This is the achilles heel of the Snowden drop. PowerPoint,
Photoshop and redactions coutured in editorial elaboration of
documents not revealed is exactly what officials do to
spin material and manipulate the public.

The Snowden material needs an untethered, unchoked,
and unmarionetted leaker not more commercial journalism
dribbling what, unforntunately has become common in the
"era of WikiLeaks journalism," is disinfo. And implies the
prospect of complicity with authorities under rigging of
privileged journalism and coddled D-Noticers.

The Guardian has belatedly confessed to that. And WaPo
and the NYT have they have and will vet Snowden material
with the USG before release. Which suggests cotinuation
of a lot more editorial elaboration, TV garavitasing, bowdlerized
reports and articles, Dough-Boy books, Op X films, primly
steriolized documentaries. In effect, a propaganda push
right out of the 1950s through the 2010s configured for
cyberwar coldwar. Manchurian Assange, Manning, Snowden
featured a la Zizek in the Guardian yesterday.

Little crypto will be revealed, except misleading urge
to use it as Snowden has done, instead much fancified
metadata -- not to overlook the metaphysics of hyping
entertaining leakage, now a booming culture of deceit
continuing the cult of spy fiction began in days of
Art of War.
