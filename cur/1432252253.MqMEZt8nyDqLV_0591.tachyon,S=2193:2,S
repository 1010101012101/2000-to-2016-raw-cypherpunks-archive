I kind of agree, to a point, but then you (and others) do the same
with imposing your own ideals to others, don't you ? As long as people
interact, they'll have to impose stuff to others. I'm imposing my
ideals (in this case, forbidding to smoke to people who want to) ?
You do yours (annoying people who don't like smoke, because you want
to smoke). I don't usually annoy smokers when they do. If I'm annoyed
by it, I just move. Unless I can't, that is. But you just act as if
*your* ideals were *obviously* the right ones. I reject that idea.
They might, and they sure are popular here. But you do impose them
all the same.
