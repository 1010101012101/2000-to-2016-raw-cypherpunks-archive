its real simple I dont like fakes 


hmm


lets see  you committed an act of battery against a german police officer while claiming to be be a cherokee american indian/aboriginal, to wit you admitted in a  public
forum that you committed the act of assault(fighting with a police officer)
violating section 113.1 of the German criminal code.

"Whosoever, by force or threat of force, offers resistance to or attacks a public official or soldier of the Armed Forces charged with the enforcement of laws, ordinances, judgments, judicial decisions or orders acting in the execution of such official duty shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding two years or a fine."

as the punishment is up to 2 years by american legal standars you have committed a
felony and blamed my racial group in doing so..

This in a legal jurisdiction notorius  for historically pursuing racial profiling/purity etc and track same in their national police intelligence systems.



You are no better that any other white racist in blackface/redface makeup.. except in
this case you chose to lie about your descent.

Membership in ANY of the indian tribes and familial band that are a registered tribe
with the USG is easily checked..

This was all setout by treaty after the american holocaust known as the trail of tears
when the nascent USG did their level best to exterminate my family and all of my
relations and by lineal descent moi.

I will point you to http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/final-rolls.htm

where the familial name machet appears on NONE of the tribes recognized by treaty(
which includes 4 seperate lists for the cherokee nation.)

SO if you are NOT a obsessive liar Cari machet either supply a familial name and
relationship to the tribal rolls or publically apologize to the Cherokee Nation
for having defamed same.. or suffer the consequences.. negative exposure in all tha
 media that a clever cypherpunk can reach in essence
