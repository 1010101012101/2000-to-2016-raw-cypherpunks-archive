You'd probably want to hack up Mixminion's socket.connect stuff to use
a SOCKS-compatible version instead.  The functions to hack on the
client side would be in lib/mixminion/MMTPClient.py ; that's the part
that does the client-side network connections.

Unfortunately, Mixminion isn't maintained these days; if anybody is
interested in new versions coming out, they should subscribe to the
mixminion-dev list and coordinate with others.
