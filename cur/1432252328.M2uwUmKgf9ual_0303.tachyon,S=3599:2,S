Hello.

Why not try to offer some of your products at http://bacalao.net before you leave the office today? There might be someone out there looking for what you have!

Another good idea can be to offer items that you normally do not work with, but for some reason have available...

Or if you are looking for something http://bacalao.net is a perfect place to post your inquiry - you never know - again,  there might be some of the few 100 visitors per day that can help you.

If you don't try - you will never know.

The place is http://bacalao.net

Good weekend!

Best regards,
BACALAO.NET

Office
