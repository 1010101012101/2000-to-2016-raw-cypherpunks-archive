Oh some distinction.... and what if they do not lay down in the dust and 
relinquish their "way of life" as you demand, then you will have no choice 
but to make them perish?  The James A. Donald definition of 
"freedom":  relinquish your way of life, or else....?

If it was up to me, we wouldn't be in this war, we'd have spent it on 
alternative energy instead.  I think with $150+ Billion we'd have made 
progress on that front, thereby negating any "need" we have for Mideast oil.

The mentality of people like you endangers us ALL, both here in "the 
homeland" as well as innocents abroad.  That is the real message here which 
you have refused to hear, instead advocating continuation of the policies 
which have led us here.  Policies based on well established and documented 
history of which you are both ignorant and in denial of.

I hope you feel safer this Christmas, with your Code Orange.  Oh yeah, but 
how can that be, I mean, aren't we safer now that that evil dictator Saddam 
has been captured?!  hah hah hah sure we are.  And all along we should have 
been focusing on Bin Laden and Al Qaeda who are the real threats.  Oh well, 
what's $150B worth of military and intelligence resources...

A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should 
have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence 
from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own 
government.
