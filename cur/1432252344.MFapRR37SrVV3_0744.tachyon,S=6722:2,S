Sorry...I don't understand...why would psuedonymity services be provided 
within Tor?

An external reputation/psuedonymity server would of course "reduce" a Tor 
users' anonymity to mere psuedonymity, but I don't see how it would do 
anything more, and who cares? If Wikipedia (or anyone) doesn't want to 
interact with the truly anonymous (as opposed to psuedonymous), then ah 
well.

Solution: Wait and do nothing until someone (commericially) provides such 
services.

Am I punchdrunk or stating the obvious?
