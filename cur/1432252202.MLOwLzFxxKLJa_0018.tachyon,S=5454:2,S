Merely a denial, not a rebuttal:

This essay does not actually claim that the people cited by Chomsky said 
the things that Chomsky attributes to them.  In particular it presents no 
actual examples of massacre reports that were discovered to be false.

It answers none of the criticisms that I or other people have made of 
Chomsky.  Instead it takes fragments of those criticisms out of context, 
without the specifics of that criticism, and simply denies the charges, 
without acknowledging or rebutting any of the evidence that Chomsky's 
accusers present.  It does not rebut a single charge, or address a single 
piece of evidence.

It does not rebut, or even address, the charges I made, or indeed any of 
the charges that any critic made.

Most flagrantly, it ignores the fact that Chomsky's position, and the 
radical left position, on Cambodia changed abruptly and radically when 
Soviet foriegn policy changed in January 1979, quoting statements that 
Chomsky made after 1979 as evidence that he did not mean the things he said 
before 1979.
