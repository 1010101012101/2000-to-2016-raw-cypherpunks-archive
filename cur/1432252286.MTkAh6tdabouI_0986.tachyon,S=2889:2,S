Remember too that terrorism is really a form of PR, rather than (in most 
cases) an actual destruction of infrastructure or whatnot. Smart terrorists 
will obviously leverage any channel available to cause a population to view 
their world as unstable.

Also remember too that plans such as this may be "fishing"...in other words, 
communications in the hope that somebody out there (not directly known to 
the issuer of the communique) will take the info and work out his own plans 
for attacking the target.

I'm sure our boys at the School of the Americas (or whatever it's called 
now) use these mthods all the time. In fact, they're probably the ones who 
taught the Mujahadin (and bin Laden) a lot of these techniques.
