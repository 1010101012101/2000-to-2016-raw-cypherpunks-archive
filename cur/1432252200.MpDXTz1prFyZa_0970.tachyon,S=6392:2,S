              S.U.V.'s, Golf, Even Peas Join
              Eco-Vandals' Hit List

              By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

                 EATTLE, June 30 — The
                 fire at Joe Romania
              Chevrolet in Eugene, Ore.,
              started just before 2:45 one
              morning in the spring. Nearly 30
              Chevrolet Suburbans and Tahoes
              were destroyed in the blaze, the
              second time in nine months that
              vehicles in the dealership's
              sport-utility lot had been set
              afire.

              The fire at Ray A. Schoppert
              Logging Inc., in Eagle Creek,
              Ore., also occurred between 2
              and 3 a.m. This one, on June 1,
              near the site of a disputed timber
              sale in a federal forest, burned
              three logging trucks.

              Sometime in the night of June
              10, someone broke into a
              research farm owned by Seminis Inc., near Twin Falls,
Idaho,
              and ripped out hundreds of genetically altered pea plants.

              These incidents share more than the fact that none has
              resulted in an arrest. All three appear to be part of what

              federal authorities describe as a growing pattern of
              eco-sabotage, or vandalism, that its anonymous
perpetrators
              claim to have carried out in defense of the environment.

              Many of these attacks, which the authorities say are
              especially prevalent here in the Pacific Northwest, are
              relatively small-scale and fail to attract much attention.
Many
              go unreported, for the companies involved are often
              reluctant to generate publicity that might make them a
target
              all over again.

              But even if less noticed than major acts of eco-sabotage
like
              the recent fire at a University of Washington genetics
              research laboratory, the vandalism has quietly reshaped
life
              for many small businesses, forcing a need for safety
              measures that would have once been unthinkable.

              "We've had to beef up security so it looks like a prison
              around our greenhouses," said Crystal Fricker, president
of
              Pure-Seed Testing Company in Canby, Ore., which grows all
              kinds of grass seed. The company installed a chain-link
fence
              with razor wire, motion sensors and an alarm system after
              vandals broke into greenhouses on its 110-acre property
last
              June.

              The intruders destroyed several research projects, stomped

              on the grass, spray-painted slogans like "Nature bites
back"
              and left behind golf balls marked with the letter A, the
              international anarchists' symbol. Pure-Seed was apparently

              singled out because of its experiments with a genetically
              modified form of grass that could be used for putting
greens
              on golf courses.

              A few days after the incident, an e- mail message from a
              sender identifying itself as the Anarchist Golfing
Association
              claimed responsibility for the vandalism, which caused
              roughly $500,000 in damage.

              "Grass, like industrial culture, is invasive and permeates

              every aspect of our lives," the message said. "While the
golf
              trade journals claim that `golf courses provide suitable
              habitat for wildlife,' we see them as a destroyer of all
things
              wild."
