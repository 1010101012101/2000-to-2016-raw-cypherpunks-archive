Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its p|an to 
become a leading supp|ier of VoIP techno|ogy including the following 
mi|estones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any cellular or |and|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2O0,O0O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a global sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
