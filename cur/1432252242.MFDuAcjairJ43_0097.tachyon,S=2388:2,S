Tempest works not on just the keyboard but the entire machine. Monitor,
system unit, cables, and keyboard all give off tempest emissions. The
usual way this is handled is to have the room the system(s) are in 
shielded, and or completely underground, or both. 

The Zenith "tempest" 286 PC had 72 screws and a very solid steel CPU
casing, and it's cables were completely unshielded. Your tax dollars
at work. D'oh! :)
