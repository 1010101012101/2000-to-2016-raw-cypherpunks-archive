I saw your ad in the business classifieds and i had to tell you that you could be getting 
paid for 
doing just that--placing ads!!
Read on to find out how to get paid for something you are doing allready.

THE AD PLACEMENT PROGRAM

Work at Home Simply Placing our Classified Advertisements! No Catches! 
That's right! Simply place our Advertising & get Paid! Did you know that classified 
advertising is 
part of a:

Six Billion Dollar Market

We are sure that you will agree this is a big enough market to get YOUR piece out of 
it! Read on 
to tap into the Easiest & Most Profitable Business on the 'Net!

You are about to discover how to acquire the most simple, easy and powerful money-
making 
opportunity. It is called The Ad Placement Program and it's a dynamic income 
generating system 
that allows you to make profits providing a valuable service on or off of the Internet.

Who are we? 

We are CJ Holdings, a direct response Marketing Company. We are hired by various 
companies 
both on and off of the Internet to design & implement Ad Campaigns for them. A very 
large part of 
any Ad Campaign is Classified Advertising. Open ANY Newspaper, Magazine, or 
Internet classified 
site and you will see the multitude of Ads placed.

What if we could show YOU how to earn a good income from home by simply placing 
Ads for our 
clients? One week you may place Ads for FREE Software, Widgets or a Work-at-
home 
opportunity, the next week it could be long distance services, satellite dishes or even 
a 
discounted vacation offer! You choose the Ads that you want to place and get paid 
PER REPLY 
to these ads! No one even has to buy ANYTHING from the Ad - just respond!

Ad Placement provides a great service to our clients. By them not having to place 
Ads 
themselves, this allows them to concentrate on the sales end of their business. ALL 
responses to 
any advertising go directly to CJ Holdings. You NEVER have to handle ANY 
mail,correspondence, 
or otherwise. CJ Holdings maintains the "contracts" with these firms and then forwards 
the Ads to 
place for that given week. You simply place them. That's It! 

 THIS IS NOT ENVELOPE STUFFING!
You may have seen ads or websites offering to pay you for envelope stuffing. The 
ads generally 
are worded something like this:

Work At Home paid $5 Per Envelope Stuffed! Homeworkers needed NOW due to 
expansion 
Supplies provided, envelopes are prestamped, etc. etc.

- A typical 'Envelope Stuffing' advertisement

What their Ad does not tell you is that you will be required to run the identical ad, 
request that they 
mail YOU $5 for information and the YOU have to mail them the sales letter recruiting 
them to do 
the same thing. There! You have just stuffed an envelope!

This is NOT what Ad Placement is. Once signed up as an Ad Placer with us you 
simply place the 
classified advertisements on or off of the Internet! Your Choice! We provide you with 
the wording 
for the Ads that you conveniently 'copy' and 'paste' to the more than 100 FREE Ad 
Sites that we 
provide to you for NO CHARGE over the Internet.

REMEMBER: 

You do NO SELLING OF THESE COMPANIES PRODUCTS. You never have to 
contact a 
customer, you receive NO Email from these companies or the leads that we provide 
them. In 
return, they receive, from us, qualified leads for their sales department.

For this service that you and the many other professional Ad Placers provide, placing 
Ads, you are 
paid $1.00 US from EACH response to your Ads. Doesn't sound too exciting, does it? 
Some Ad 
Placers recieve an average of 150 replies to their Ads a week just on FREE sites 
alone! Some 
more and some less. In addition to this let's say that you also ran a print Ad campaign 
that same 
week and this averages you an additional 450 responses, that would yield you an 
income of 
$600.00 US a week! But wait, it does get better!

If you can spend 2-4 hours a day running Ads you will see that this is the easiest 
money that you 
have ever made! You are provided with COMPLETE Training & Support! Why are we 
sharing this 
with you?

Due to the growth and of Internet businesses alone always looking for new ways to 
generate 
leads, CJ Holdings is forced to expand.

This, my fellow entrepreneur, is where YOU come in!

As we do need more Professional Ad Placers as our business grows, we will also 
pay YOU an 
additional .50 cents for any replies from your group's Ads as well! This means that you 
are paid $1 
per response from your own Ads PLUS .50 cents for any replies to Ads placed from 
those that you 
recruit to work from home for us!

With the example of 150 replies from FREE Ads in a week & 450 replies from print Ads 
you have 
already earned $600.00, what if you also had 10 Ad Placers working under you doing 
the same? 
That will skyrocket your income to $3,600.00! That is in only 1 week! 

Let's say that you only have 5 Ad Placers that you have recruited. You still have a 
weekly income 
of: $1,200.00! That is $4,800.00 a month! Do not be fooled, this is NOT a get-rich-quick 
scheme. 
You will have to work, you will have to place Ads for our clients and if you choose to 
have your 
own Ad Placement Group then you will have to manage and support your group as 
well. Is it worth 
it?
I think you will agree that it IS worth it!
If you would like more info on this great money making opportunity,

Simply reply to this message with "Ad placing" in the subject

Thank you 
Tony Kloschinsky
