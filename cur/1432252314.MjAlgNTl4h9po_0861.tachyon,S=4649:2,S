  And when there are only a couple of regular posters using similar
connections to adsl-64-164-25-91.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net

  I'd guess that there is a moderate probability of you being "Jonathan
Wienke" <mis@itiaccess.com> - JonathanW
(adsl-64-164-156-82.dsl.snfc21.pacbell.net [64.164.156.82]) from a couple of
recent postings.

  Of course this is all rampant speculation on my part.
