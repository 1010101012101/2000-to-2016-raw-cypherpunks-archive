I believe this statement was quite ambiguous, and should have been
written by my ever so humble self as follows:

   -  so entangled photon pairs can be created, and we can know at one
      end, if the photon at the other end has been "read"

note the "has been" replacing "is"!  With, of course, "has been" meaning
"happened at a time up to and including --now--".

Cute concept :)

Possibly a good analogy, but I ain't Schroedinghy, so dunno how
analogous it is :)

Absolutely, in this example case, but I have no idea if your idea is
suitably analogous or not sorry.

If it is actually instantaneous, then the rate is infinite, in the
dimensions in which we make our observations.

If a second primitive is ever theorized and later experimentally shown
to exist, then I am confident we shall see a flurry of mathematical
modelling and comparison and elimination, and something "conclusive" and
"well duh" paraded around.

Your experiment shows possibly that we simply do not understand either
the entangled experiment, or why it cannot be used to transmit
information "simultaneously", since synchronization can indeed happen in
wall clock time, as long as the two ends are far enough apart - e.g. 1
light year, or 1 light minute apart.

No, the statement is: either the remote side can determine that I have
made an observation or not - this is a basic premise, which is either
true or not.

If it's not true, we do not understand this new toy called quantum
entanglement, and therefore cannot reason about the problems nor
theorize as to why it cannot be used for information transmission.

Not in your hypothetical.

It certainly would be - although you cannot verify nor decrypt the
transmission for 1 year, you can prove the transmission actually
happened 1 year ago.


We seem to be missing some vital part of the problem, I guess...
