On the contrary, TCPA/Palladium can solve exactly this problem.  It allows
the marketers to *prove* that they are running a software package that
will randomize the data before storing it.  And because Palladium works
in opposition to their (narrowly defined) interests, they can't defraud
the user by claiming to randomize the data while actually storing it
for marketing purposes.

Ironically, those who like to say that Palladium "gives away root on your
computer" would have to say in this example that the marketers are giving
away root to private individuals.  In answering their survey questions,
you in effect have root privileges on the surveyor's computers, by this
simplistic analysis.  This further illustrates how misleading is this
characterization of Palladium technology in terms of root privileges.
