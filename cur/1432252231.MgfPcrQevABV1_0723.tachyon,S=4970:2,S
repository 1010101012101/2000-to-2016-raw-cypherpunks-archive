Two Things:

1. It sounds like to me that there is no room for human compassion in
crypto-anarchy.
    (Seems like we will all end up sitting in our "compounds" armed to the
teeth and if anybody comes along we either blow'em to bits or pay them
anonymous digital cash
to go away).

2. I think that it's funny that ultra-conservatives who are for letting
"competition" improve health care are setting themselves up for more
abortions.

How does crypto-anarchy/libertarian/anarchy propose to deal with the
"tragedy of the commons" where by doing what is best for each persons own
interests they end up screwing it up for everyone (Overgrazing land with to
many cattle is the example I've been given).  The "prisoner's dilemma" is
another example.
