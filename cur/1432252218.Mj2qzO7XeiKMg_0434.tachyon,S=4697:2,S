Note that there are a relatively small number of Googles on the Net.

This is a point that was brought forth pointedly at John Wharton's ee380
seminar at Stanford last spring, during Rhonda Hauben's seminar "Usenet
and the Usenet Archives The Challenges of Building a Collaborative
Technical Community"

    http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/010523.html

Specifically, the Usenet community became used to the Deja News
archives, to the extent that many independent archives of specific
newsgroups or collections of groups were deactivated, relying instead on
Deja.

While comprehensive archives are useful, *single* comprehensive archives
present a point of failure and control.  The Net would be advised to
develop multiple Google alternatives.  And I say this as quite the fan
of Google....

Peace.
