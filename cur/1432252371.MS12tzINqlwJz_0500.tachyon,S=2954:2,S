GSM/Europe
1) Buy a cell phone and pay cash
2) Buy a GSM cash-card and pay cash
3) Don´t send in the registration form to get that extra half hour!  :-)

To stall traffic analysis - buy many GSM cash-cards and change
frequently - they are only around USD 10 (not counting the prepaid
calling time). I don't believe the cell phone is sending it's serial
number (but who - except for deep insiders and possibly Lucky Green -
knows for sure?).
