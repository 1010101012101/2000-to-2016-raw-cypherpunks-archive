Your initial claim was that CNN wasn't covering it, ergo, they did not
consider it to be newsworthy, and that independent media outlets (Declan
did not list primarily, independent news sources), were missing an irony
that MayOrMayNot exist outside of Choatian Space.

Take your damned meds.

Ask yourself this,

Why does CNN have nothing on the 9th Circuit ruling related to 'free speech'
expression of 'violent acts'? Is 'civil liberties' not a news worthy point?
Is the abortion issue not important?

http://www.cnn.com/

And finally, why will 'independent media' outlets not point this irony out?
