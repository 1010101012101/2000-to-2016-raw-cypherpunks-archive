I am not authoritative here but I can say how I consume this list.
It's different from any other list I know. Consumption is more similar
to IRC. There is no real structure and many write under pseudonyms. I
don't think you can have a serious discussion of topics that hover
around anonymity without accepting the cruft that comes with anonymous
contributions. Some people use these "qualities" in this environment
and simply masturbate intellectually with. On IRC one develops a way
to find interesting comments in-between this noise. And over time one
develops interesting mental reflexes and intuitions from these space.
This might seem like a description for "how to survive the cypherpunk
mailinglist" but these reflexes, once developed, then apply in very
interesting ways in other areas of society. One example is the
application of anonymous behavior and hierarchies to political
science. That is, the role of non-branded ideology and action in politics.

or to put simply
in some ways the cypherpunks mailing list is 4chan via smtp.

thus far I dont think you would find yourself getting banned. though
some may just add a mute filter for you if you spam.
