Not this cypherpunk -- the evils of asbestos are ninety percent
hot air.

The superstitious and ignorant tend to believe in black magic
killers, invisible imperceptible causes of great harm, and
award colossal damages on that basis.  Supposedly biotechnology
will make the cows milk dry up.   In reality, if someone is
exposed to enough asbestos to be a problem, he is painfully
aware of it.  Only a minuscule minority among those now
receiving stupendous awards were exposed to that level of
asbestos.
