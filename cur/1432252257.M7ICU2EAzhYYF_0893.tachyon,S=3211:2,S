That is what King George and his redcoats said about the 
ragtag colonials, American as well as those who suffered the 
king's abuse into the 20th Centruty.

That is what King George also said about the colonials, who then
quite rationally arranged help from King George's enemies.

More King George-type remarks, as with arrogant tyrants 
everywhere and their authority suck-ups. 

To be sure, the children in their realms suffer as if colonials, or 
slaves, or wives, or sex toys, or faux-sacrosant idolized figurines, 
or nascent rebels who must be whipped regularly for moral 
instruction in subservience.

If not Iran, then Ireland, if not Ireland, then a new Iraq, or NK,
or PK. What the US-UK hegemon cannot face is that the
bloody challenges to their moral supremacism is just getting 
under way inside and outside their borders.

PJ O'Rouke's fighter planes of winners won't mean shit in this 
murderous crusade where the enemy wears no easy to spot
uniform. 

The Chechens are the bellweather warriors. Kids and women 
among them indifferent to the old guys self-serving rules of war. 

Kill the heads of state, defense ministers and generals first, then 
down the line in reverse order. That'll likely bring over the lower 
downs who've eaten their shit, fought their battles, hated their 
guts. Women and kids among them.
