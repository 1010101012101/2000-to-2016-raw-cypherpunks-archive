True. As a journalist, I do my best to avoid those conditions. I think
of them (probably not an original thought) as entangling alliances.

I could easily cobble together a book proposal that would include
chapters by cypherpunk types; I'd edit. I've been thinking of writing
a book for a while -- even had meetings with publishers in '96 -- but
it would take too much time. Editing would be far easier.
