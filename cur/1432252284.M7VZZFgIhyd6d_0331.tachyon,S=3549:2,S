As if email doesn't share that property?   You really think I work for

What a fucking concept...

How about teenagers planning terrorist attacks?  Or terrorists' senior
proms?

Use textual stego, mofo.

A pretty good argument for broadcast stego.

I bet.

They already 0wn the fucking IX points, and can grab the DHCP records;
don't you think the spooks already do this, and more?

Look at Orion Sci, which graphs gangs.  Extrapolate to IP.

If these bozos were better they wouldn't be in Troy.
