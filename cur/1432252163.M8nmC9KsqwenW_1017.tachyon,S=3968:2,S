Actually, I'm still smarting over the twin facts that the Oklahoma highway 
department, for the greater good, leveled two gas stations, one I 
considered a landmark, to widen a highway turn.  That Altus, the county 
seat here, "annexed" the surrounding area, and declared that only so many 
houses could be built per acre to appease the airbase, and regulate 
businesses outside thier borders by requiring a certain amount of the front 
of the buildings being bricked, without extending fire and police services 
to those controlled in either case.

I think the labor of a person is his own to use or sell as he sees fit.  If 
I agree to turn out wooden pencils for 6 dollars an hour, I have no 
arguement for demanding more if those pencils later sell for 10 bucks apiece.

Besides, my comments in that still quoted post, were based on how socialism 
was at least, if not more, abusable than what we have now.

I think you mis-read me.

That second quote about sacrificing for the herd was closer to the 
mark.  Substitute "could" for "should", "stupid" for "moral", and "popular" 
for "right".

And you have to admit, if tomorrow I gave all my worldly goods to the 
community at large, they would hail me a "good man" for at least the 
evening...while they snickered behind my back.

Good luck,

Sean
