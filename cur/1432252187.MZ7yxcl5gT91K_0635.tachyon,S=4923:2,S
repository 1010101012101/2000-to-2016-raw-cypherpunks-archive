PRIVACY LECTURE SERIES
<http://privacy.openflows.org>


"European cybercrime law and its implications for privacy"
Wednesday, February 28
7:00 to 8:30 p.m.

Ian (Gus) Hosein
Privacy Technology Officer
Zero-Knowlege Systems, Inc.

140 St. George, Room 728
Faculty of Information Studies (building adjacent to Robarts Library)
University of Toronto
Toronto, Ontario
Canada


This lecture will focus on the new European/international cybercrime
law, which was drafted specifically to deal with the cross-border
nature of much computer-related crime. As the name indicates this law
stems from the European Union, but it has been endorsed by the United
States and Canada. When finished the law will be opened for signature
worldwide. This lecture will not only explain the particularities of
the law but also how it affects privacy worldwide.


Ian (Gus) Hosein is a Tutorial Fellow and doctoral student at the
London School of Economics. For three years Gus has lectured to
undergraduate and postgraduate students on privacy, philosophy and
politics of technology, regulation, cryptography policy, networks,
and the concept of the Information Society. In his spare time he
works with Privacy International, is a Policy Counsel for
ZeroKnowledge Systems, and is an Advisory Council member of the
Foundation for Information Policy Research. A Toronto native, he is a
survivor of the University of Waterloo; but now lives in England
partly because of the prevalence of pubs.


The lectures are free of charge, and there is NO need for
registration.
