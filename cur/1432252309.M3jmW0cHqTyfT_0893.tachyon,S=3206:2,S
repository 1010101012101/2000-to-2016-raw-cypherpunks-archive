Hi everyone

I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is out.  
Tor-ramdisk is an i686, x86_64 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux  
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment 
that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced by hardening the 
kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be off 
at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal 
information. Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no 
information survives a reboot, except for the Tor configuration file and 
the private RSA key, which may be exported/imported by FTP or SCP.

Changelog:

Tor was updated to 0.2.2.37, BusyBox to 1.20.1 and the kernel to 3.4.2  
plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-3.4.2-2.extras. The MIPS port also  
incorporated these changes, but for this architecture the kernel was kept 
at vanilla 3.2.5.
