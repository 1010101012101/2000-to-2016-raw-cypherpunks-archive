Phill gets it halfway right, or put another way is halfway wrong.

The question is not whether network effects exist or not; clearly they
do in some form. Better questions include whether they have produced
inferior results than "someone" desires, how strong they are, and whether
state intervention is a good idea because of their alleged ill effects.

Phill also is not aware that VHS has some advantages over betamax,
and also persists in crankishly calling libertarian groups "right
wing." He is clearly an example of a person who needs killing. (*)
