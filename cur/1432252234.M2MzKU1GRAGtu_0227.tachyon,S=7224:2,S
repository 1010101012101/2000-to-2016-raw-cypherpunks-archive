Terrorists have to live somewhere. They store their equipment and
materials somewhere. They need vehicles. They have people who help
them - and these people might come and go at strange times of the
day and night. They may make unusual financial transactions or use
false documents to hide their real identities. They may be behaving
differently to how you've known them to behave in the past.

If you suspect it, report it. You can also give non-urgent
information that may assist police investigations online through
www.online.police.uk.

Van – Terrorists need transport. If you work in commercial vehicle
hire or sales, has a sale or rental made you suspicious?

Passport – Terrorists use multiple identities. Do you know someone
with documents in different names for no obvious reason?

Mobile phone – Terrorists need communication. Anonymous, pay-as-you-go
and stolen mobiles are typical. Have you seen someone with large
quantities of mobile phones? Has it made you suspicious?

Camera – Terrorists need information. Observation and surveillance
help terrorists plan attacks. Have you seen anyone taking pictures of
security arrangements?

Chemicals – Do you know someone buying large or unusual quantities of
chemicals for no obvious reason?

Mask and goggles – Terrorists use protective equipment. Handling
chemicals is dangerous. Maybe you’ve seen goggles or masks dumped
somewhere.

Credit card – Terrorists need funding. Cheque and credit card fraud
are ways terrorists generate cash. Have you seen any suspicious
transactions?

Computer – Terrorists use computers. Do you know someone who visits
terrorist-related websites?

Suitcase – Terrorists need to travel. Meetings training and planning
can take place anywhere. Do you know someone who travels but is vague
about where they are going?

Padlock – Terrorists need storage. Lock-ups, garages and sheds can all
be used by terrorists to store equipment. Are you suspicious of anyone
renting a commercial property?
