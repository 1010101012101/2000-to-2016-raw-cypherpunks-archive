Afraid the Texas authorities have already linked you to bomb 
information? Afraid that those who planned the Waco raid out of Texas 
offices are worried about being truck-bombed themselves?

In any case, the soliciting of bomb-making instructions has been 
happening on this list since shortly after the Swinestein bitch started 
planning to outlaw bomb-making instructions sent over the Internet. A 
lot of us think the very similar wordings are the result of a concerted 
effort to solicit such instructions.

Giving them the real details on mix ratios for Astrolite and detonation 
timing patterns may get Fineswine's panties in a bunch. Sounds good to 
me.
