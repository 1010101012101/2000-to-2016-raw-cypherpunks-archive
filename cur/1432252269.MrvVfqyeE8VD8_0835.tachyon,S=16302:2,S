MAKE MONEY FAST, EASY, AND LEGALLY


--------------------------------------------------------------------
: Posted by $$$strick:nine$$$ on oct, 2000 at 22:08:47:
: 
: April, 1997
: Fellow Debtor:
: This is going to sound like a con, but in fact IT WORKS! The person who
: is now #8 on the list was #9 when I got it, which was only a few days ago.
: Five dollars is a small investment in your future. Forget the lottery
: for a week, and give this a try. It can work for ALL of us.
: You can edit this list with a word processor or text editor and then
: convert it to a text file.
: Good Luck!!
: Dear Friend:
: My name is Johnny Ponce. In September 1998 my car was repossessed and the
: bill collectors were hounding me like you wouldn't believe. I was laid
: off and my unemployment checks had run out. The only escape I had from
: the pressures of failure was my computer and my modem. I longed to turn
: my advocation into my vocation.
: In January 1999 my family and I went on a ten day cruise to the tropics.
: I bought a brand new Lincoln Town Car with CASH in February 1989. I am
: currently building a new home on the west coast of Florida, with a private
: pool, boat slip, an a beautiful view of the bay from my breakfast room
: table and patio. I will never have to work again. Today I am RICH! I have
: earned over $400,000.00 (Four Hundred Thousand Dollars) to date and will
: become a millionaire within 4 or 5 months. Anyone can do the same. This
: money making program works perfectly every time, 100% of the time. I have
: NEVER failed to earn $50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted. Best of all,
: you never have to leave home except to go to your mailbox or post office.
: In October 1998, I received a letter in the mail telling me how I could
: earn $50,000.00 or more whenever I wanted. I was naturally very skeptical
: and threw the letter on the desk next to my computer. It's funny though,
: when you are desparate, backed into a corner, your mind does crazy things.
: I spent a frustrating day looking through the want ads for a job with a
: future. The pickings were sparse at best. That night I tried to unwind
: by booting up my computer and calling several bulletin boards. I read
: several of the messages posted and then glanced at the letter laying next
: to the computer. All at once it became clear to me. I now had the key to
: my dreams.
: I realized that with the power of the computer I could expand and enhance
: this money making formula into the most unbelievable cash flow generator
: that has ever been created. I substituted the computer bulletin boards in
: place of the post office and electronically did by computer what others
: were doing by mail. Now only a few letters are mailed manually. Most of
: the hard work is speedily downloaded to other bulletin boards throughout
: the world. If you believe that someday you deserve that lucky break that
: you have waited for all of your life, simply follow the easy instructions
: below. Your dreams WILL come true.
: 
: Sincerely yours,
: Johnny Ponce
: 
: ***************************************************************
: -----========INSTRUCTIONS===============-----
: ***************************************************************
: Follow these instructions EXACTLY, and in 20 to 60 days you will have
: received well over $50,000.00 cash, all yours. This program has remained 
successful
: because of the HONESTY and integrety of the participants. Please continue
: its success by CAREFULLY ADHERING to the instructions.
: Welcome to the world of Mail Order! This little business is somewhat
: different than most mail order houses. Your product is not solid and 
tangible, but
: rather a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many
: large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
: (The money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is
: made from people like yourself requesting that they be included in that
: list.)
: 
: [1] Immediately mail $1.00 to the first 5 names listed below, starting at
: number 1 through number 5. SEND CASH ONLY. (Total investment: $5.00)
: Enclose a note with each letter stating:
: "Please add my name to your mailing list".
: Include; Your name, Mailing address, and E-mail address.
: (note) This is a legitimate service that you are requesting and you are
: paying $1.00 for this service.
: [2] Remove the name that appears as number 1 on the list. Move the other
: 9 names up one position (Number 2 becomes number 1, number 3 becomes
: number 2, and so on). Place your name, address, and zip code in the
: number 10 position.
: (note) You do not need to add your e-mail address to the list. Only add
: your e-mail address to the 5 letters you send to the first 5 names
: listed.
: (extra note) When you change the names and put your name in the 10
: position, you have to Save As when you are done....
: then to send this to yourself so your name is in the 10
: position, hit compose mail...then attach this file and
: send this file to yourself.......then it will work to send
: to other people.
: [3] With your name in the number 10 position, upload this ENTIRE file to
: 10 (ten) different bulletin boards. You may post it to the BBS's
: message base or to the file section. Name it FASTCASH.TXT, and use the
: file description comments to draw attention to this file and its great
: potential for all of us. In addition, send this out by E-Mail to as many
: people as possible.
: (note) Essentially what this does is circulate this file around, which is 
what you
: want to do. So sending this out to as many people as you can is to your 
benefit.
: [4] Within 60 days you will receive over $50,000.00 in CASH.
: 
: Keep a copy of this file for yourself so that you can use it again and again
: whenever you need money. As soon as you mail out these letters you are
: automatically in the mail order business. People will be sending YOU $1.00
: to be placed on your mailing list.
: This mailing list can then be rented to a broker that can be found in your
: local yellow pages listings for additional income on a regular basis. The
: list will become more valuable as it grows in size.
: This is a service. ** IT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL **
: If you have any doubts as to the legality of this service, please refer to
: Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 of the Postal Lottery Laws.
: NOTE: Make sure that you retain EVERY name and address sent to you, either
: on computer or hard copy, but do not discard the names and notes that
: people send to you. This is PROOF that you are truly providing a
: service, and should the I.R.S. or some other government agency question
: you, you can provide them with this proof!
: Remember, as each post is downloaded and the instructions carefully 
followed,
: five memebers will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer
: with $1.00 each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when
: your name reaches the number 5 position you will be receiving thousands of
: dollars in cash.
: REMEMBER - THIS PROGRAM FAILS ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT HONEST - PLEASE!!
: PLEASE BE HONORABLE...IT DOES WORK! THANK YOU

******************************************************************************

***********
: The following letters were written by a participating members in this 
program:
: ***************************************************************************
**************
: To those with the COMMON sense to participate in this easy money 
opportunity:
: About six months ago I received the enclosed post in letter form. I
: ignored it. I received about five more of the same letter within the next
: two week.I ignored them also. Of course, I was tempted to follow through
: and dreamed of making thousands, but I was convinced it was just another 
gimmick
: and could not possibly work.
: I was wrong! About three weeks later I saw this same letter posted on a
: local bulletin board in Montreal. I liked the idea of giving it a try with 
my
: computer. I didn't expect much because I figured, if other people were as
: skeptical as I, they would not be too quick to part with $5.00. But, I BUY
: LOTTERY TICKETS WEEKLY IN MY PROVINCE AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT
: TICKET STUBS! This week I decided to look at this as my weekly lottery
: purchase. I addressed the envelopes and mailed out $1.00 in each as 
directed.
: Two weeks went by and I didn't receive anything in the mail. The fourth week
: rolled around and I couldn't believe what happened! I can not say that I
: received $50,000.00, but it was definitely well over $35,000.00! For the
: first time in 10 years I got out of debt. It was great. Of course, it did 
not
: take me long to go through my earnings, so I am using this excellent money
: opportunity once again. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GET READY TO ENJOY!
: Please send a copy of this letter along with the enclosed letter so together
: we can convince people who are skeptical that this really does work!
: 
: Good Luck,
: Charles Kust
: St Agathe Que.
: 
: ANOTHER ADDITION BY A PARTICIPATING MEMBER
: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE, A MAXIMUM OF 5$ !JUST TRY IT!
: SPREAD IT EVERYWHERE, THE MORE YOU SPREAD THE MORE YOU MAKE!
: 
: (((((Roger Lew)))))
: Hello, my name is Roger Lew . As you may have
: noticed I'm the seventh name on this list, so I do not have
: a rags-to-riches story to tell here. However, I did make
: a phone call to the 2nd name on this list, Jane Beckon.
: Did she have a rags to riches story to tell? Not exactly,
: but then I found out that she did not follow the
: instructions precisely. You see, Jane lost faith in
: the program before she had finished following instructions.
: She only uploaded this file on one BBS, which happens to be
: operated by Brian Sassounian, the 3rd name on this list.
: Jane told me that she has received $600.00 to date
: (1/6/95). I realize this is far from the $50,000.00
: promised at the first of this file, yet one must keep
: two things in mind:
: 1. $600.00 is more than 100 times her initial investment, and it only took 
about
: an hour of her time (there's nothing to lose).
: 2. This program works mathematically on an exponential scale. In other
: words, for every one BBS that this file is uploaded onto, it should
: spread to at least ten other BBSs and possibly a whole lot more. So, if
: Jane had uploaded his file on all ten BBSs, she should have at least
: gotten a hundred-fold of what she has, which would be $600.00. Not bad
: for a few hours work and a $6.25 investment (including postage).
: Finally, I would like to exhort those who become involved
: in this program to maintain its integrity by being honest.
: It is the only way that it can possibly pay off. In other
: words, be sure to enter your name at the bottom of the
: list and not in one of the top five positions (actually
: this would be robbing yourself since it is while your name
: is in the lower positions that it gets multiplied
: exponentially over hundreds of BBSs). And, of course,
: send your $1.00 off to the first five names. As I write
: this I have not made a penny (that's because I have not
: uploaded this yet), but I thought you might like to hear
: from someone at the bottom of the list, instead of someone
: claiming rags-to-riches. I hope such is true, and I'm
: sure it will be if we all stick with it. The potential is
: definitely here!
: 
: ===============================================================
: OK HERE'S THE DEAL. AT PRESENT I AM A BUSINESS MAJOR AT VANDERBILT
: AND THIS PROGRAM MAKES A WORLD OF SENSE TO ME. I RECENTLY READ ABOUT
: A GUY THAT TOOK A PENNY FROM EVERY PERSON'S BANK ACCOUNT AT THE NEW YORK
: CITY BANK. AFTER 2 YEARS OF DOING THIS ILLEGALY HE BECAME A MILLIONAIRE.
: BUT GOT GREEDY AND GOT CAUGHT. SAME PRINCIPLE HERE. TAKE A DOLLAR
: FROM EVERYONE WHO GETS THIS AND ALTHOUGH THEIR GIVING PRACTICALLY
: NOTHING, THE RECEIVER IS GETTING LOTS. SORTA THE HUMANE THING TO DO.
: IF YOU COULD GIVE A GUY A BUCK AND HELP HIM HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY OFF A
: DEBT OR SAVE MONEY FOR RETIREMENT WHY NOT? THEN AFTER YOU SEND A
: DOLLAR JUST MANIPULATE THIS FILE LIKE IT STATES ABOVE AND PEOPLE WILL BE
: HELPING YOU OUT TOO. MY DAD TAUGHT ME TO BE CAREFUL OF THINGS THAT
: SOUND TO GOOD TO BE TRUE CAUSE THEY USUALLY ARE BUT WHAT CAN YOU
: LOSE BY GIVING $5!!! YOU HAVE ALL TO WIN AND NOTHING TO LOSE. L8R
