Not a straw man.  Those who think poor little Saddam was a 
victim, for the most part also think that the US 'created" the 
afghan resistance, and, particularly if they were European, 
think the that Americans had 9/11 coming to them.

Saddam was not behind the 9/11 attack, but he was and is allied 
with those that were, and, the point of my argument, western 
socialists allied with him and them.  Bin Laden, in obviously 
violation of the Koran which mandates capitalism, has taken 
socialism on board, Saddam, originally a secularist, has taken 
Sunni Islamicism on board, bridging what small ideological gap 
there was between him and Bin Laden, and western socialists are 
alarmingly willing to overlook the arabism and islamicism of 
the few remaining socialists in power.

During the invasion of Iraq, most of the arab news feeds, or at 
least their corresponding english language websites, were 
reasonably fair and balanced, while the BBC went over the top 
with Saddamite propaganda.  When I read the Al Jazeera web 
site, most of the entirely over the top propaganda came from 
western correspondents.  Al Jazeera's own correspondants were 
for the most part OK.

The western intellectuals are not reacting to this as a war of 
caucasians vs semites, but a war of ideologies -- German 
originated ideology vs English originated ideologies, with 
Saddam and Bin Laden incarnating Heidegger and Bush incarnating 
Locke.   Very likely Saddam had nothing to do with causing 
9/11, but Chomsky and the BBC did have something to do with 
causing 9/11.

When one sees someone arguing that Americans had 9/11 coming,
he frequently starts quoting improbable "facts" that originate 
from Chomsky, and backs them up with one of the nuttier BBC 
correspondents.
