Just wondering (because maybe you don't live in the US). But why are you
all gonna protest because some Russian got arrested for breaking the law??

Don't you have anything better to do with you're time???

(this isn't a flame but if that's how you want to take it be my guest,
just wondering why we are soo concerned about some russian.. the
principle?? If you want to protest something why not put you're effort
into blowing open the Gary Condit fuck up... )

I mean this ass hole fucked some Intern and then killed her... maybe I'm a
little crazy here (which I have been told oftern that I am) but that seems
a hell of a lot more important then some fucking Commie.

Just my 2 cents (after about 12 beers...)
