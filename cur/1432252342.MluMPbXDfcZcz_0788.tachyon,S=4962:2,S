Call for a dual mobilization for total liberation. Or rather- a Fall uprising.

In Fall- the streets of DC, and Denver, CO will erupt. 2 forces made up of 
many movements with much historical/herstorical precedent will converge. 
The anti-capitalist, the anti-imperialist, the anti- colonialist, the 
anti-authoritarian, the anti-patriarchy, the anti- white supremacy will all 
take to the streets in these 2 cities.

Current Threats to America
Current Threats to America Include "a Loose Alliance of Left-Wing Groups"

A recent "threat assesment" issued by the FBI's National Infrastructure 
Protection Center has identified global justice activists as a potential 
terrorist threat.

The memo, entitled "First Anniversary of the September 11th Attacks And 
Other Dates of Interest," notes that "there are several notable events 
scheduled in the near future which warrant heightened awareness." It lists 
the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; upcoming United 
Nations meetings in New York City; and the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, DC, during the period September 25-29th.


The bulletin, which has attracted mainstream media attention, goes on to 
contend that "prior protests against the IMF and WB in Washington, D.C. 
were disruptive and resulted in limited clashes with police...historically, 
tiny contingents of individuals associated with the protests belonged to 
violent groups."


While this is not the first time that elements of the Global Justice 
Movement have been the targets of FBI scrutiny, the inclusion of WB / IMF 
protests in a memo dealing with largely foreign terrorism may represent an 
escalation of US Government harassment. Read and discuss the full memo.
