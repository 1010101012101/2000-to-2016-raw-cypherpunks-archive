They've developed language skills? Man, I should have gone into food
research. I don't think I could handle the bread products
communicating with me, though.

I don't know how special they are, but you can find some at
http://www.ritzbits.com.

Actually, Nabisco doesn't crack websites. They just make crackers and
other food products. You might be more interested in some Ginko
Biloba...or a lobotomy; those might help you. If not, ask your doctor
about Ativan.

I'm not planning to go to Tehran, Iran any time soon. However, any
hardware store would be glad to sell you a sledge hammer which you may
use to crack it once you get there. For the transportation, you might
want to try http://www.priceline.com. I hear that you can name your
own price for airline tickets, gasoline, hotel rooms, and groceries
there now.

That looks more like an email address to me, but I confess that I
don't quite know what those two trailing periods are for.

> make a splash !

You too can make a splash. Just send $29.95 to Cypherpunks, Inc. for
your very own, easy to use cement. Just eat, drink a few glasses of
water, and you too will be able to make your own splash the very next
time you go to the bathroom. (Most common side effects included
intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, rectal hemorrage,
vomiting, and dehydration. Talk to your doctor before beginning to use
Cypherpunks, Inc. Cement Shitbrick Mix.)
