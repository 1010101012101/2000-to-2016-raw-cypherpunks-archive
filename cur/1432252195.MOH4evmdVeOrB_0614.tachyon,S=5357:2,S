Company Profile:
BIOGENERICS LTD is a domestic oi| and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy |eader 
in today’s Energy market. The company’s shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oi| and Gas is Bush’s #1 priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principal business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, he|d significant positions in biotechnology, fiber optics 
and other techno|ogy ventures that management believed cou|d prope| shareho|der va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation – an oi| and gas techno|ogy leader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas play was natural.
The Company’s other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to fi|e a Form 10 in the immediate future.
