As the D.C. types would say, "that has no traction."

Interesting that the cyberliberties crowd was so eager to launch a 
"Boycott Adobe" campaign because of their sin that they attempted to 
defend their property rights, but no one is launching a "Boycott Oracle" 
campaign over Larry Ellison's fascist support for mandatory 
citiizen-unit ID cards.

As an Oracle investor for many years, I am ashamed that the President 
and CEO of a company I have long-owned is adopting the fascist and 
statist policies reminiscent of Nazi Germany.

Ellison wishes Oracle to play the role of Krupp. "Ve vill volunteer our 
software, ja, in ze struggle."

I would say he needs <censored>, and soon, but that might get me in 
trouble with the Securitat.

So I'll leave it this way:

FUCK ORACLE.

FUCK LARRY ELLISON.

Someday I will piss on his shallow grave.
