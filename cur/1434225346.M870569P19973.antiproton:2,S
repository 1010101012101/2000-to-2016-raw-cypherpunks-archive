That's kind of spooky, in that I re-read Vernor Vinge's True Names
just yesterday.

But I think it's more likely that some public servant or private
contractor unleashed the Balrog on those folks without a work
order, and made it painfully obvious to them on purpose, to settle
some personal grudge.  If so, well played:  The full public
disclosure that this act set in motion will be of considerable
benefit to the 'victims' in the long run.

As P.T. Barnum famously said, "There's no such thing as bad
publicity."
