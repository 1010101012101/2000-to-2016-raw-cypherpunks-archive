** New Online Payment Services Debut

This week brings the debut of two online payment systems that make the =
same point: Credit cards are an imperfect solution for E-commerce.


ECharge Corp. USA is testing eCharge Net Account, which is expected to =
launch later this year. It'll offer consumers a revolving line of credit =
for online shopping and deduct full or partial payment from their bank =
or checking accounts. Signed up already is MP3.com, whose customer base =
of music downloaders is arguably less ingrained in the use of credit =
cards and more open to options.

"Everybody keeps talking about solutions to handling micropayments =
online and alternatives to credit cards," MP3.com marketing executive VP =
Steve Sheiner says, "but this seems like the first business model that =
handles small transactions." Besides its infamous stock of 600,000 free =
music files, MP3.com also sells CDs and other products -- and the number =
of purchases made on the site is growing.


ECharge chairman Ron Erickson says that by moving customer data offline, =
to its own servers, and cutting out the credit-card settlement system, =
eCharge can offer merchants rates between 0.5% and 1% lower than credit =
cards and full data on what customers buy.

The last paragraph is the significant one.
