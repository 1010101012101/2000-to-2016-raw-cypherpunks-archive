Free Lakota Bank b Preliminary Assessment

Posted by GaryL on Wed, 11/26/2008 - 01:43 in

With the launch of the Free Lakota Bank, The Free & Independent Nation of
Lakota has launched a frontal assault on Wall Street, The Fed, and
International Bankers.

Native Americans are historically known for their strong spirit, patience,
and stealth, not to mention their very advanced war making strategies. The
launch of this banking concept seems to display all of these characteristics
in spades.

While The Free & Independent Nation of Lakotabs formal secession from the
United States passed last year with little comment or reaction, this latest
development will likely raise many eyebrows around the world. Ultimately,
official reactions will be based on how individuals and markets respond to
the offerings of their bank.

The Free Lakota Bank has well-baited its hook by the sheer elegance of their
banking model, some features being

1. Only Gold or Silver Holdings, but with a preliminary period where they
will accept Federal Reserve Notes and convert them to metal.

2. Completely Anonymous b No names or Social Security Numbers attached to
accounts.

3. Two-Tiered Security b SSL Online username, using a strong keystroke
encryption program; followed by an automatic phone call for the user to enter
a PIN number.

4. An incredibly inexpensive monthly fee for account maintenance (0.00005
service fee or 5 cents per thousand when calculated at present silver spot).

5. A bGeneral Investment Fund;b which allows a waiver of investorsb
maintenance fees and earns a current annual rate of return for the Fund of
7.24%.

6. A lending philosophy that is a blend of classic Muslim banking and the
largely unexploited market of bMicro-loans.b

Their model presents on our continent a system not unlike a numbered Swiss
account, and with features and benefits that are appealing to both individual
and larger, institutional investment vehicles. They offer this investment
alternative precisely at the time when investors are under great pressure by
economic conditions.

After some due-diligence, it would not be surprising to see large accounts
divesting and shifting to The Free Lakota Bankbs bGeneral Investment Fund.b
While there may be something of a bwho blinks firstb dynamic involved, it is
likely that once one large fund would make such a move, it would be followed
rapidly by many others possibly precipitating a significant Wall Street
bevent.b

Therein lays the elegance of what this writer perceives to be a carefully set
out plan b a well calculated and executed frontal assault, exploiting
critical infrastructure vulnerability.

It would be wise to watch developments closely as there is potential of a
very strong response from the U.S. Government at the prompting of the Fed and
its underlying banking interests. The type and nature of such response could
draw some significant lines of demarcation, and prompt decision making modes
likely uncomfortable for some.
