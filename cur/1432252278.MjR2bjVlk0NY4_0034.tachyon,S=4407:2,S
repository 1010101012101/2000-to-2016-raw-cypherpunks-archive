Having worked for comScore, I can tell you that having a fixed address
in the lower 64 bits would make their jobs oh so much easier. Cookies
and javascript are of very limited utility.

On the other hand, I could swear I've seen a draft where the PC picks
up random unused addresses in the lower 64 for each new outbound
connection for anonymity purposes. Even if there is no such draft, it
wouldn't exactly be hard to implement. It won't take NAT to anonymize
the PCs on a LAN with IPv6.

That's your failure, not Roger's. As delivered, IPv6 is capable of
dynamically assigning addresses from multiple subnets to a PC, but
that's where the support for multiple-PA multihoming stops. PCs don't
do so well at using more than one of those addresses at a time for
outbound connections. As a number of vendors have done with IPv4, an
IPv6 NAT box at the network border can spread outbound connections
between multiply addressed upstream links.

A friend of mine drives a 1976 Cadillac El Dorado. I asked him why
once. He explained that even at 8 miles to the gallon and even after
having to find 1970's parts for it, he can't get anything close to as
luxurious a car from the more modern offerings at anything close to
the comparatively small amount of money he spends.

The thing has plush leather seats that feel like sinking in to a comfy
couch and an engine with more horsepower than my mustang gt. It isn't
hard to see his point.
