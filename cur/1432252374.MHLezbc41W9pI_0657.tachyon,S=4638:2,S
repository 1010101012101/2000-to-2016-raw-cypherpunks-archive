By "developed" I mean when orchards became housing.

That, Tim, is my point.   Think about it.

If you look at the statistics for any one area, it becomes
harder and harder to afford.

However, if you look at the statistics for America as a whole,
it becomes easier and easier to afford, as manifested by the
ever increasing proportion of people that own their own houses.

This is a consequence of the fact that in any one area, you run
out of legally available land for houses, but for America as a
whole, we are very far from running out of land for houses.
