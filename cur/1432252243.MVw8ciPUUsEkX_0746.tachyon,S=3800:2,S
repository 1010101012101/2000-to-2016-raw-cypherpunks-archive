no, lilo is. if you you can mount a pgpdisk (say) without software, then you
are obviously much more talented than I am :)

for virtual drives, the real question is at what point in the boot process
you can mount a drive - if it is not until the os is fully functional, then
you are unable to protect the os itself. if the bootstrap process can mount
the drive before the os is functional, then you *can* protect the os. Win9x
uses dos as its bootstrap (and drivespace gives a good example of a virtual
drive system that can hand over to a 32bit driver as the os starts). lilo
*could* kick a virtual drive into existence during the kernel boot, given
such a driver and some patches to both kernel and lilo itself.  that it
would need a password from somewhere during this process is both obvious and
not a major issue.
