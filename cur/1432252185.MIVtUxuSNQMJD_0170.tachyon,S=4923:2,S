  This is not the time to "investigate" and "blame" --it's
  time to turn Iraq into a glass parking lot and Afghanistan
  into a cinder.

  It takes less than 30 minutes to re-target and deliver the
  ordnance...

  I'll settle for the Casablanca Inspector: "round up
  the usual suspects". Anything less than a dramatic
  response of 'shoot first and ask questions when there is
  silence' is insufficient.

  Bin Laden may have been capable of placing the hijacking
  teams, but Iraq is the clear beneficiary.  Bin Laden may
  get revenge, but Saddam gets an opening. A ground war
  against Iraq's legions would be foolish --the Gulf war was
  won against his hordes by pulverizing them with carpet
  bombing and demoralizing them --by the time our troops
  moved, there was virtually no resistance.

  I'm automatically ruling out North Korea (not capable);
  Iran (enough problems of their own and not capable of
  sustained action); Russia (not in their best interests);
  and China (could not afford the economics of war). Bin
  Laden is bent on revenge, and Saddam is a megalomaniac who
  does not care if his people are targeted.

  If Bush fails to take a dramatic step, eg: incinerate
  Baghdad, then the talking heads will be playing Neville
  Chamberlain; the UN will "condemn" the action while
  accusing the US of creating the conditions which brought
  on the attack; and, Iraq and the rest of the Arabs,
  etc. have the opportunity to play counter-threats....

  If the US waits to retaliate, the Arabs will show a united
  front --if Iraq is gone before they can even start to
  argue among themselves, there will be muted satisfaction
  in their governments that Saddam's head was finally
  delivered on a platter.

  If the retaliation is fait accompli, nobody has
  time to comment --and no-one, other than perhaps the
  Syrians will mourn the loss of Baghdad.

  If Iraq is not permanently neutralized, they will power
  strike across Jordan and Syria into Israel --at that
  point, the Israelis will preemptively nuke Baghdad. From a
  strategic standpoint, it would be far preferable for the
  US to do its own dirty work than accept world opinion that
  the US was either a) too impotent to clean its own mess;
  or, b) that Israel was the pawn, thereby uniting the
  Arabs.

  We probably have upwards of 20,000 dead in NYC alone; now
  is not the time to be squeamish about collateral damage in
  foreign targets.

  Lastly, what the US does in the first hours will determine
  the US' ability to prosecute the action in its entirety.

  Today we determine whether or not America has the will to
  survive. If we falter, the whole world will kick us when
  we are down --eg: the third vision begins.

  Make us proud to be Americans, George...
