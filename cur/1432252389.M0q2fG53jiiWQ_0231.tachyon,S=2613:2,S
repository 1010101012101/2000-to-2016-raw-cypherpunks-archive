Cable cutting, if that's what it is, impairs two domains: data harvesting (as
there is less to harvest) and cost/quality of the affected communications.
These two domains cannot possibly belong to the same side of the Conflict. I
find affecting data harvesting to be improbable, so it's either:

- done by the affected principalities themselves as a neat way to limit
undesired communications for their own subjects;

- or a spook agency doing a live "what if comms go away" testing in irrelevant
parts of the world;

- or a previously undiscovered natural phenomenon (mutant laser-head sharks.)
