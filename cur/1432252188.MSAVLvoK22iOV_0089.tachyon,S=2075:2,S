Point of order here: are you referring to a full operating system when
you say "Linux" or just the kernel. If the former, it's GNU/Linux. If
the latter, you should specifically say "the Linux kernel".

Though, arguably, the proper substitution here could be:
s/Linux/any operating system besides Windows Vista or later/

We need a public education campaign here. Microsoft seems to embrace
security, as long as it's in their best (monopolistic) interests to do
so. That's a huge problem, unless and until ReactOS can come close
enough to Windows to fool treacherous computing.
