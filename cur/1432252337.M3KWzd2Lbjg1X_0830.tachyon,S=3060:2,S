Subject: Toolkit for detecting ISP modifications to web pages

Hi Dave--
 There has recently been some discussion on both this list and the  
Net Neutrality Squad mailing list about ISPs modifying web traffic  
(e.g., the recent messages about Rogers modifying Google's home  
page).  Related to this, I wanted to point you to a toolkit that a  
server could use to detect whether its pages are being modified in  
flight.  The toolkit is available at the URL below:

http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/security/web-tripwire.html

 The toolkit allows publishers to deploy "web tripwires" on their own  
web pages.  Web tripwires are JavaScript code that can detect when a  
web page is modified in flight, so that the publisher is aware of the  
event and can notify the end user if appropriate.

 The URL above also has a brief summary of a measurement study that  
used a web tripwire to detect changes to a web page 
(http://vancouver.cs.washington.edu ).  A message on your IP mailing list 
back in July helped draw users  for the study.

 We'd be happy to get feedback on either the toolkit or the study  
results.

Thanks!
Charlie Reis
