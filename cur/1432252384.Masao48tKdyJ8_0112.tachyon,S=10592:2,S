The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to

milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Personal Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
al| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physica|ly connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any ce|lu|ar or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partially or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a global sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
