Well, this may actually be less hard than we thought. Indeed, it's the one 
vaguely silver lining in this toxic cloud. Outsourcing to India will 
actually add a lot to world stability. Of course, we'll loose a lot of jobs 
in the process, but in the long run we'll eventually have another strong 
trading partner like Japan or France or the Dutch. Bush will sell us out to 
big business and all of the less-well-off will suffer like crazy in the 
process, but it will actually make things better in the long run. The only 
thing we need to worry about is not melting the ice caps in the process.
