Damn! From Russia and China yeah? Wow. What a mindset.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions

"The United States has been involved in and assisted in the overthrow
of foreign governments (more recently termed "regime change") without
the overt use of U.S. military force. Often, such operations are
tasked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)."

I grant they seem to be doing ... something. Here's the table of
contents from that wiki page:

Perhaps those are the countries that were going to overrun "us" (never
mind the fact I live in Australia anyway, but damn, what a way of
thinking).

SDW, thank you for being so frank - honest about how you think. It is
educational to me in a good way. Part of the difference is perhaps
that I am not living in the USA, so I look inwards to your government
and agencies, not outwards.

Interesting way of "understanding" the world - 'regime change' is
about as polite a way the current empire can couch its predominant
activity since WWII.

Sounds like you're focusing on the small stuff, the little "local"
political show. And a show it is, and apparently quite effective...

Time to wake up. You evidently need to do more research. The balance
of good vs. evil, of the once mighty USA, is well and truly tipped in
favour of despotism and cronyism at this point in history. Very
unfortunately. And notwithstanding the good remnant who do remain
actually within the system (as insignificant and ineffective as they
are to effecting good into the world).

Greece. Rome. Persia. British Empire. USA.

Every empire falls. USA has fallen, it just can't quite see the
reality of this yet.

"No better than all the rest". Fixed that for you.

The record is abysmal. USA is "morally" (on an international political
and death-toll level) and financially bankrupt.

I just pray that the end of USA's grab for global hegemony means a
long lasting multi-polar world, and not a new imperialist Chinese
"empire regime".

You're missing the point. "Regime change" means if you're in their
way, your life ends. Time for you to do some history lessons. Because
you feel safe (you're one of the "good guys" right?), you don't see
the problem, and you therefore have difficulty hearing the message.

Sadly, individual liberty was not respected enough to capture the
sanction of foreign thinkers. I'm being extraordinarily conservative
in my words here...
