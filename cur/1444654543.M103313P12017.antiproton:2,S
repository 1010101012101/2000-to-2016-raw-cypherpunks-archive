So assuming Snowden "borrowed" the slide from the NSA and he didn't get
owned, the slide is _REAL_.

Having in mind Snowden likely have large pile of slides, if he got
owned, likely all/the majority of them would likely be fake.

Is this plausible?

And did you missed the us-natsec trolling about the eu appearing to
trust Snowden's slides (though sometimes they can't prove it)?
