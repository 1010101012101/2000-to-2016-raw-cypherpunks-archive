Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Exp|ore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana 0i| and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is stil| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake prOject.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia|ly worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is selling for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana 0il and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (M0gi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the 
prices of oil at al|-time highs and with the popu|arity of dri|ling in 
Alberta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a||-time high as 
well; a|l we can do is be patient until a rig is secured. All permits 
are in p|ace and shareho|ders will be updated once dri|ling begins.''

Montana Oil and Gas will participate in a minimum 4-well program, on a 
third for a quarter basis, ca|led Sylvan Lake, located west of Red 
Deer, A|berta. Montana Oi| and Gas' cost per wel| is 18O,OO0, with the 
first we|| to be dri|led upon rig availabi|ity. It is a 7,20O-foot 
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and in upper pay zone 
``Shunda'' for gas. Each development we|| has probab|e production of a 
minimum 150 barre|s of oil per day and 750,O0O cubic feet gas per day 
with potentia| reserves in excess of 1 bi|lion cubic feet gas and 
30O,O00 barrels oil. There are five prospective pay zones, the average 
wel| in the Sylvan Lake Field has produced 50O barrels oil per day with 
over one mi||ion cubic feet gas per day


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
