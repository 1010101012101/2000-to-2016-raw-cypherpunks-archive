Perhaps this is worth discussion.

Are AirBnB, Uber and Homejoy examples of political anarchism
(degenerate or otherwise)?

Are we seeing the ultimate in self responsibility (I would say self
responsibility is a good thing)?

How might we embrace such self responsibility, whilst also manifesting
collective empathy/ shared 'responsibility' (perhaps there's a better
term here)?

Is Lauren Weinstein with his indenting style actually Juan in
disguise? Or is it in actual fact the other way around?

The "Sharing Economy" Is the Problem

http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/33720-the-sharing-economy-is-the-problem

  	It's unfortunate then that these companies and the
	misnamed "sharing economy" are really just fronts for
	millionaires and billionaires to opportunistically ride off the
	backs of everyday people, while also exacerbating many economic
	inequalities. Avi Asher-Schapiro explains the truth in Jacobin:
	The premise is seductive in its simplicity: people have skills,
	and customers want services. Silicon Valley plays matchmaker,
	churning out apps that pair workers with work. Now, anyone can
	rent out an apartment with AirBnB, become a cabbie through Uber,
	or clean houses using Homejoy.  But under the guise of
	innovation and progress, companies are stripping away worker
	protections, pushing down wages, and flouting government
	regulations. At its core, the sharing economy is a scheme to
	shift risk from companies to workers, discourage labor
	organizing, and ensure that capitalists can reap huge profits
	with low fixed costs.
