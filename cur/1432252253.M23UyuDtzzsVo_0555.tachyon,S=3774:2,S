Here's a free VM generator. I have no idea if it can be configured to 
support Mixmaster:

As for the tone, it doesn't hurt to have a fire lit under one's butt 
sometimes. Although I agree with the 'Cypherpunks Write Code' paradigm, the 
other half of the coin is that if only Cypherpunks write (and use!) code 
then we might as well walk around with targets painted on our jackets.

It wouldn't hurt to have a Win32 Mixmaster client, so long as no one doing 
anything important believes that it'd be all that secure. (On the other 
hand, f*ck 'em if they do...)
