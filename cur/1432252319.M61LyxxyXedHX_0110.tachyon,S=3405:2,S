This will be a simple threat to mitigate. 

The government simply needs to require that every male carry a Foreskin
Certificate of Authenticity.  Obviously for women, a similar certificate will
be necessary to authenticate breasts and pregnancies.  Particularly paranoid
regimes might also view moles and bunyans with suspicion and mandate further
security measures.  For the public safety, of course.
