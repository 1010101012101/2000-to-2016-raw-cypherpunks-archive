Even the owner of my ISP is narcing me out.

Read what he wrote recently to a Net.Nazi who wanted my speech limited:


"I'm sorry that Tim is being a bother again. He has a long history of
being obnoxious and threatening. So far, he has not broken any laws. We 
have talked to the authorities about him on numerous occasions. They 
have chosen to watch but not act.  Please feel free to notify me if he 
does anything that is beyond rude and actually violates any laws and I 
will immediately inform the authorities."

Thank You
