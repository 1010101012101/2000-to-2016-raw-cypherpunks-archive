Eric:

I don't recall hearing about this remark on the news at 
the time, and I suspect I would have. A Google search 
turns up a number of cites, but they are all on white 
supremacist or anti-Isreal sites. The original source is
the Islamic Association for Palestine site:
http://www.iap.org. The message is archived at:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/iapinfo/message/2132

Are there any major media citations in any country? 
If not, I suspect that this is a manufactured quote, 
like the ones we saw a few years ago where Janet 
Reno was alleged to indicate that Christians weren't 
good citizens.

Regardless of what Sharon may or may not believe, I
don't think he could have said this without the major 
media jumping all over it, in the way that Bush 
recently got pinged for referring to the people
of Pakistan as 'Pakis' (a racial slur in Britain).

Of course, one could take the self-fullfiling viewpoint 
that the fact that this quote only appears in extreme 
fringe publications is simply proof of total Jewish control 
of the major media. I prefer to apply Occam's Razor.
