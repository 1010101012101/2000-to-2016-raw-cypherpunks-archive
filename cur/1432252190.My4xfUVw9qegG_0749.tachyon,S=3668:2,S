Well, FWIW, I interviewed him by calling an Australian telephone
number when the Ohio cops were on his trail; an Australian journalist
confirms mattd/proffr lives there (http://www.politechbot.com/p-02099.html);
the Australian press had some coverage (though no photos) of his
problems with the local constabulary.

A Secret Service agent reportedly showed up at one of mattd/proffr's
hearings.
