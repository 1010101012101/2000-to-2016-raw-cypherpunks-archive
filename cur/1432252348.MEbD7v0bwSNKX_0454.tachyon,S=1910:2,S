Court says prisoners cant be ordered to give blood samples

A THREE-JUDGE PANEL of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the first
federal appeals court to address the federal DNA Analysis Backlog
Elimination Act, said requiring convicts to give blood for a criminal
database was a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights against
illegal searches.
       Ruling 2-to-1, the San Francisco-based court said it was an
unlawful invasion of privacy because the samples were taken without
legal suspicion that the convicts were involved in other crimes.
