A mountain of records is a pain, and makes stuff harder to find. 
Therefore automatic log rotation, where records that are unlikely to be 
of use are automatically deleted within a reasonable time, is optimal.

How many times have you gone looking for something, and there is a pile 
of crap?

OK, you could keep the pile of crap properly organized, but it is lot 
easier to just delete it than to properly organize it.
