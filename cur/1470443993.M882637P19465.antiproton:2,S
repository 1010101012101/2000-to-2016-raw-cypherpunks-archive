there are numerous types of anarchy

one has direct democracy > horizontality as a formulation like in
switzerland

its a process (like life is a build so is the anarchic form) and the
hierarchical forms of government are eroded by its functionality

we made formulations for assemblies and developed new methods within
different geographies for structure > new structure for decision making >
participatory

there are many actions within the erosion process one is participatory
budgeting >>>> most sectors can have actions in this way
