Speaking of red herring (will you go <Plonk!> now Robert? I didn't think
so):

No, until the SC found the personal income tax legal less than 100 years
ago this was not a valid statement. And it isn't valid today. It is an
expression of the typical anarchist/libertarian bullshit whereby they want
to reap the benefits of a large and dyamic society and its economic market
without having to actualy participate in it.

It is EXACTLY the sort of viewpoints that Hayek warns against with respect
to losses of individual freedom.
