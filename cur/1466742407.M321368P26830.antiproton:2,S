Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility.

Control had a portable version of the cone of silence - basically two
plexiglass fish bowls connected by a tube - but of course it got stuck
on the Chief's head then ended up shattered the first time it was deployed.

I have come to realize the Agent 86 may have been the greatest
intelligence officer of his generation:  That is if, as I now suspect,
he was working for Kaos all along.  Smart wasted vast amounts of
Control's money, misdirected 100% of its manpower and resources toward a
crew of small time losers who were probably a KGB front set up for the
purpose, and completely demoralized Control's Chief and (all but one of)
his fellow Agents.  And they fell for it.  To such an extent that
Control went out of business for good just five years after Smart showed
up on the record as its "top Agent."
