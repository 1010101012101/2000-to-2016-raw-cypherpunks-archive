I must have been mistaken, according to the material at 
http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/asat/miracl.htm no CO2 is employed, 
rather "a fuel (ethylene, C2H4) is burned with an oxidizer (nitrogen 
trifluoride, NF3). Free, excited fluorine atoms are one of the combustion 
products. Just downstream from the combustor, deuterium and helium are 
injected into the exhaust. Deuterium combines with the excited fluorine to 
give excited deuterium fluoride (DF) molecules, while the helium stabilizes 
the reaction and controls the temperature. The laser's resonator mirrors 
are wrapped around the excited exhaust gas and optical energy is extracted. 
The cavity is actively cooled and can be run until the fuel supply is 
exhausted. The laser's output power can be varied over a wide range by 
altering the fuel flow rates and mixture/"
