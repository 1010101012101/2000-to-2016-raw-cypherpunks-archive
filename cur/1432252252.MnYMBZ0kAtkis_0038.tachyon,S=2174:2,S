Washington -- Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy said Thursday that he was stopped 
and questioned at airports on the East Coast five times in March because 
his name appeared on the government's secret "no-fly" list.

"That a clerical error could lend one of the most powerful people in 
Washington to the list -- it makes one wonder just how many others who are 
not terrorists are on the list," said Reggie Shuford, a senior ACLU 
counsel. "Someone of Sen. Kennedy's stature can simply call a friend to 
have his name removed, but a regular American citizen does not have that 
ability. He had to call three times himself."
