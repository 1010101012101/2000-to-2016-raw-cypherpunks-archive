Hello

your email address was found at http://cypherpunks.venona.com/ this was during a search for readers that might be interested in a different kind of news, much in the way the Art Bell radio show has discussed in the past.

I am the editor of The London Morning Paper and invite you to a free subscription. It is email based and is sent daily. It includes news from a different slant and that of contemporary press for comparison.

May I send you a sample?
