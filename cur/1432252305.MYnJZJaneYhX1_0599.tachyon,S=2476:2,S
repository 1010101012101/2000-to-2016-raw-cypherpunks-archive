Look, if running a Tor node anonymously was difficult, this conversation 
would be interesting.

But unning a Tor node anonymously is trivial, so the cost/benefit analysis 
is pretty parabolic.  No cost, all benefit.

Unless you're actually part of the project, or a public supporter, etc., 
there is no reason to have your identity attached to Tor in any way.
