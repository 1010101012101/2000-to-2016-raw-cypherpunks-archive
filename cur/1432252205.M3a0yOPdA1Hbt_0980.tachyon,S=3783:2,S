You appear to be intentionally misrepresenting the motion we filed
last week as a way to make a personal attack. I understand your
motive, but I don't care for it much.

You have me at a disadvantage. My attorney advises me not to make
public statements about what we're doing at this time, so I can only
say that the motion speaks for itself:

Also, it is not a surprise that the interests of a defendant and
journalist may diverge.
