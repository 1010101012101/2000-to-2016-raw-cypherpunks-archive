If what you are looking for is an estimate of fractal dimensions in the
Internet, look at the following paper, which was published in the 1999
ACM/SIGCOMM conference:

On Power-Law Relationships of the Internet Topology, Michalis Faloutsos,
University of California at Riverside; Petros Faloutsos, University of
Toronto; and Christos Faloutsos, Carnegie Mellon University.

Power laws are measurable, and somewhat related to the "fractal" nature.
According to the measurement described in the paper, the Internet topology
is, in fact, fractal.
