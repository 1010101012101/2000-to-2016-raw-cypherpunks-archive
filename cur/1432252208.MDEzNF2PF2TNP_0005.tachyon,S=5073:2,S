As always, standards are driven by the mass-market and the mass market
is already speaking on this one. In 18 months time there will be no
difference between mobile phones & cheap digital cameras - all but the
cheapest phones will come with built-in cameras.

Its almost certain that these devices will have GPS location, and
probable that they will have Bluetooth as well. 802.11 less likely
because of power consumption - possible that there will be little "base
stations"  to go Blt <-> WiFi  so the Bluetooth becomes a wireless drop
cable. 

Realtime video isn't on the horizon unless someone pulls a lot of
bandwidth out of the bag, as ever network speeds grow more slowly than
processing power.

So effectively everybody will be walking around with the ability to take
timestamped photos and transmit them. BrinWorld arrives, at least in
public places.  No policeman gets to bludgeon a demonstrator unrecorded
ever again - expect them to wear visors and helmets increasingly often,
and to remove the identifying marks from uniforms (as, or course, riot
cops and vigilantes have been doing for decades)

The authorities will be able to take down the cell networks - though
they won't be able to do that without causing some publicity.  They
won't be able to confiscate all phones from everyone who is walking the
street. Presumably in high-security situation (like interviews with
presidents or rides on torture planes) phones can be removed from
visitors but they will be rare.  Mobile phones are now so ubiquitous
that taking them away has come to seem as odd as asking visitors to
remove their shoes or to wear face masks.
