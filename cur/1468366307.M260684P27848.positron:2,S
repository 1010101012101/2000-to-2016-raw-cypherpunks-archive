The laws of secure information systems design:

Law 0: It's all about who is in control
Law 1: Someone else is after your data
Law 2: If it isn't there it can't be stolen
Law 3: Only those you trust can betray you

Law 4: Attack methods are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal
Law 5: The entire system is subject to attack
Law 6: A more complex system has more places to attack
Law 7: Openings for good guys are openings for bad guys too

Law 8: Kerckhoffs's Principle rules
Law 9: A system which is hard to use will be abused or unused
law 10: Design for future threats
Law 11: Security is a Boolean

Law 12: People offering the impossible are lying
Law 13: Nothing ever really goes away
Law 15: "Schneier's law c" holds illimitable dominion over all... 
including these laws

Yes, I especially recognise 1,2, 7-11.

If you don't mind, I might include something with 8 and 9: as-is the 
"Laws" are a bit too theoretical, and too skewed towards security over 
availability.

I have always regarded the "Principles", soon to be "Laws", as mostly 
widespread and preexisting, and more of a communal than an individual 
effort - (revised) two come from Schneier, one from Satoshi, two from 
Jerry Leichter, several others are just well-known homilies recast - 
with myself more as an editor and arranger than anything else.

In fact I would like to see them written so as to be applicable to all 
systems, not just especially secure systems, or systems which have to be 
secure.

But that is even harder...
