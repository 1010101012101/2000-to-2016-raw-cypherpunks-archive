 I found this on the internet and I thought you would be interested in making some easy extra money.  All you need to do is sign-up and you can 
make extra money by opening some e-mail.

 It is safe and I have made about $250.00 a month extra just by signing up and referring some people.  Check out my business page above and 
get started.

Your friend,

Rich
