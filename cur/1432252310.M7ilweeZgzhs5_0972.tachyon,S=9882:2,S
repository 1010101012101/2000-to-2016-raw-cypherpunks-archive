 Intelligence chairman Roberts of Kansas says program 'consistent with U.S.
law'
 Bush gets key backing on spy policy

 By MATT STEARNS
 The Star's Washington Correspondent

 WASHINGTON - The Bush administration found a key ally on Capitol Hill
 Monday as it broadened its aggressive defense of a recently revealed
 domestic spying program that used warrantless surveillance.

 Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence
 Committee, "believes the program is consistent with U.S. law and the
 Constitution," Sarah Little, Roberts' spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
 statement.

 Roberts, in his first public remarks on the electronic surveillance
 program, indicated he has known about the program since he took over the
 committee in 2003. He said he believes the administration has taken proper
 safeguards to preserve Americans' civil liberties and is in talks with
 Senate leaders on what additional oversight steps Congress should take,
 Little said.

 "Senator Roberts believes that in a time of war, the president should have
 every lawful authority to protect the American people," Little said.

 The Kansas Republican's defense of the administration came just hours after
 President Bush lambasted critics of his domestic anti-terror policies at a
 White House news conference.

 Facing harsh bipartisan criticism in Congress over the surveillance
 program, and with renewal of his signature anti-terrorism law, the Patriot
 Act, stalled in the Senate, Bush said both are key tools in the war on
 terror.

 "We're doing the right thing," Bush asserted.

 Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, countered by calling the
 surveillance program "an outrageous power grab
against the laws of the
 United States of America."

 Bush called public disclosure of the National Security Agency program
 "shameful 
 the fact that we're discussing this program is helping the
 enemy."

 The program bypasses a secret court system that requires warrants for
 eavesdropping.

 "I just want to assure the American people that, one, I've got the
 authority to do this; two, it is a necessary part of my job to protect you;
 and, three, we're guarding your civil liberties," Bush said.

 The program began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Bush said
 Congress had been briefed "more than a dozen times on this program."

 Such briefings are classified, which means that even if a member of
 Congress disagrees with a policy, they can't disclose it. The briefings
 were limited to top congressional leadership and the chairmen and ranking
 members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.

 Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican who has been on the Senate
 Intelligence Committee since 2003, said he was not aware of the program.
 Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat on the committee, said he did not know
 about it, either.

 On Capitol Hill, Bush's defense did little to quell criticism, amid
 bipartisan calls for hearings to investigate the program. Democrats said
 they would not seek to halt the program until they gathered more
 information about it. Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is
 chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has criticized the program and vowed
 to hold hearings on it.

 Bush said public hearings would help terrorists by revealing U.S. strategy
 and tactics. Senate GOP leaders appear to agree with Bush; Majority Leader
 Bill Frist is said to prefer that any hearings be held by Roberts and the
 Intelligence Committee, and be closed.

 "Because of the nature of this subject, it needs to be kept close-held,"
 Bond said in explaining why Roberts' committee would be a better venue than
 Specter's.

 Meanwhile, top administration officials sharpened their aggressive defense
 of the program.

 Lt. Gen. Michael Hayden, the deputy national intelligence director and
 former NSA chief, credited the program with "detecting and preventing
 attacks inside the United States."

 "I can say, unequivocally 
 that we have got information through this
 program that would not otherwise have been available," Hayden said at a
 White House briefing.

 Attorney General Alberto Gonzales sought to dampen congressional concerns
 that the program may be illegal.

 He said the program could only be used if one party on the call or e-mail
 was outside the United States, and if authorities had "a reasonable basis
 to conclude" that one of the parties was in some way affiliated with
 al-Qaida.

 In a 1972 case involving domestic security surveillance, the Supreme Court
 found such spying, without a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment.

 Congress in 1978 established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court,
 known as FISA, a secret court through which covert spying warrants must be
 obtained.

 Gonzales conceded that the law requires warrants for the type of
 surveillance being done by the NSA. But he claimed Congress trumped that
 requirement by authorizing the use of force in the war on terror after the
 Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

 Although nowhere in that authorization is domestic surveillance
 contemplated, Gonzales said the administration interpreted it to include
 communication interception.

 "We believe signals intelligence is 
 a fundamental incident of war, and we
 believe has been authorized by the Congress," Gonzales said. "And even
 though signals intelligence is not mentioned in the authorization to use
 force, we believe that the court would 
 recognize the authorization by
 Congress to engage in this kind of electronic surveillance."

 Feingold, appearing on NBC's "Today Show," disputed that assertion.

 "Nobody, nobody, thought, when we passed the resolution to invade
 Afghanistan and to fight the war on terror, including myself, who voted for
 it, thought that this was an authorization to allow a wiretapping against
 the law of the United States," Feingold said.

 Gonzales also said the surveillance court would not work well in combating
 terrorism.

 "(FISA) doesn't provide the speed and the agility that we need in all
 circumstances to deal with this new kind of threat," Gonzales said.

 But Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, pointed out that FISA
 procedures seem designed to assist quick action by authorities.

 "These procedures are secret and they're retroactive," Reed said.

 Some pointed to last week's disclosure of the surveillance program as the
 reason opponents of the Patriot Act were able to block its renewal in the
 Senate. A group of senators has bottled up the bill because of civil
 liberties concerns. Aspects of the bill will expire in 12 days unless
 Congress acts.

 At his Monday news conference, Bush took aim at those opponents, implying
 they were jeopardizing the security of American citizens.

 "It is inexcusable for the United States Senate to let this Patriot Act
 expire
 I want senators from New York or Los Angeles or Las Vegas to go
 home and explain why these cities are safer," without the Patriot Act, Bush
 said.

 "In the war on terror, we cannot afford to be without this law for a single
 moment," Bush said.

 But opponents indicated no willingness to cave either on Patriot Act
 renewal or on demands to investigate the surveillance program, as they
 pushed back against the broad executive powers claimed by the
 administration.

 "He is the president, not a king," Feingold said. "If the president is
 asserting a doctrine that he can do anything to protect the American people
 without the basis of law, we need to know what those things are, and we
 need to talk about it."
