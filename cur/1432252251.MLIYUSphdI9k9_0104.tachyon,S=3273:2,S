What exactly was on these posters? Self-defense information, or weapon 
how-does-it-work type stuff?

HOW COOL IS *THAT*!  Weapon education chamers? Shit!  I grew up in NYC, 
where there are *zero* legal guns, unless you're LEA or one of the under 
100 people who could afford the weekly $500.00 bribe!  Not that handguns 
weren't all over the schools - almost everyone in my class carried at IS44 
(IS == "Intermediate School". Kinda of like junior high school and high 
school all in one: grades 6-12), since the likelyhood of needing to defend 
yourself was very close to 100%  NYC schools in the 60's were horror 
shows, even in the better neighborhoods (which I certainly didn't live!).

Our "weapons education" was going out at night and shooting out street 
lamps (at $1.00 per shot to the betting pool - first to take the light 
gets the pool. Not so easy with a <3 inch barrel on a saturday night 
special!).  I am in envy of you and your schools :-)
