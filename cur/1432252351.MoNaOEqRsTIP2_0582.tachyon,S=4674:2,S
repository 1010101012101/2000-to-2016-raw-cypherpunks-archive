You're missing a more important point: there is no correlation 
between who is using the service or product and who is paying the tax.

Taxing a computer used for video game playing, for example, when 
absolutely no "piracy" is happening from that computer. An overly 
wide net.

Governments like this sort of thing, however. Tax everyone, then 
spend the revenues as they wish.

Might as well tax paper products, pens, pencils, and 
typewriters...because sometimes these are used to copy the works of 
others.

But, as I said, the deeper issue is the "disconnect" between the tax 
and the allegedly "improper use" of some service.

The U.S. have done this many times, of course. In particular, the 
Home Recording Act of 1991, or thereabouts, which slapped a tax on 
blank tapes and let home recording folks copy as much as they wanted 
(so long as they don't sell the tapes). (A friend of mine has over 
4500 CDs copied digitally onto DAT and CD-R. I'm just a piker, having 
only about 500 CDs copied onto DAT and CD-R. Why _buy_ a CD when our 
libraries have tens of thousands of CDs available for borrowing and 
copying?)

And from a practical standpoint, this bad tax (bad in the 
decorrelation, nonmarket sense) also leads us in the wrong direction. 
Instead of the recording companies figuring out technological and 
market solutions, they are relying on "men with guns" to collect 
taxes and, hopefully, with enough lobbyists in Bonn and Berne and 
D.C., to dribble some of these taxes back to the recording companies.

Feh.
