I believe it's called Bagle.J.

Lots of people allow .zip files through their virus scanners if
they're encrypted, since until now it was thought that no virus would
encrypt the .zip file.  In fact, one popular way of sending
viruses/trojan horses/other malware to forensic mailing lists for
analysis and discussion is by putting it inside an encrypted .zip
file, preventing it from opening automatically or being identified by
virus scanners and bounced.

Clever clever.
