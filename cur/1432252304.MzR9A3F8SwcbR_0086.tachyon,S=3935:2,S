Start with,

Mathenauts: Tales of Mathematical Wonder
ed. Rudy Rucker
ISBN 0-87795-891-2
     0-87795-890-4 (pbk.)

Stories by,

Rucker, Asimov, Kagan, Bear, Berman, Dnieprov, Gardner, Watson, Cramer,
Zebrowski, Hofstadter, Sakers, Orr, Laidlaw, Sheckley, Gross, Pohl, &
Benford.

There was supposed to be a second volume, don't know if it ever saw the
light of day...

Most of Ruckers fiction is related to math/physics,

Spacetime Donuts
White Light (What is Cantor's Continuum Problem?)
The Fifty-sixth Franz Kafka
The Sex Sphere
Master of Space and Time
