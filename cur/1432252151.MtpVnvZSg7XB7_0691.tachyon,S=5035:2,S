Yes, you are right, she was searching for attention but she received 
more than she bargined for.  The point is how did the front line grunt 
know who to abuse?  Obviously there was a bit of a conspiracy 
here, don't you think?

Now this bitch may have deserved it but who is making the decision 
and what is the basis for that decision?  It may appear deserved 
until you are the target, then your thoughts change a bit.  Obviously 
you have never been a target before and been put thought the usual 
grinding.  I don't like liberal tree hugger types and rarely feel for 
them but if they restrict her travel privilages what is to stop them 
from picking on you?

You may think you are bullet proof but until you actually experience 
being a target it is difficult to understand the sense of violation one 
experiences when one is done over by a system.

I kinda like a place where there is a rule of law and everything is 
totally predictable, something America appears to be moving away 
from at this moment.
