I didn't say you did. I DID say your statement was misleading because it
only mentions privacy. That isn't the only issue with your example. As a
result, it's a weak argument.

As usual, you pick an example, it has a couple of nit picks you skipped
or thought unimportant, and you get all defensive when they're pointed
out. Almost like you're still searching for Mr. Goodbar still...

Pick your examples more carefully and explain them a bit more carefully
and you won't have this problem.
