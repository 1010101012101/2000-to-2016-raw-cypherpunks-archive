[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  US Attorney General John Ashcroft said 
"to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost 
liberty; my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists - for 
they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve. They give 
ammunition to America's enemies, and pause to America's friends. They 
encourage people of good will to remain silent in the face of evil.". 
Lost liberty is exactly the term a rational patriotic American would 
use to describe the intrusive power grab that is occurring in 
America.  National Review Online Editor Jonah Goldberg asks liberals 
to stop comparing Ashcroft to McCarthy.  A better exercise would be 
to start comparing police state apologist Jonah Goldberg and John 
Ashcroft to totalitarians 
<http://www.libertyartworx.com/heimatsicherung.html>.  For the full 
text of Ashcroft's statement go to

committee.htm>.]

Liberals: Stop comparing Ashcroft to McCarthy

Like everyone else, I'd moved on from the public debates over 
military tribunals, racial profiling, detentions, etc. But, 
unfortunately, like crabgrass that feeds on inattention, a liberal 
canard has been growing wildly in the absence of public debate.

That's the trouble with liberal canards. You have to pull them out by 
the roots when they're young, otherwise they spread all over, 
crowding out everything else until they become accepted as actual 
facts.

The canard I'm talking about is this idea that Attorney General John 
Ashcroft is some sort of McCarthyite. Recall, if you will, a few 
weeks ago the Senate Judiciary Committee invited the attorney general 
to explain himself.
