I've done a little work with Blackberries (aka RIM pagers).

I can't answer for ARDIS (which is the network), but on top of that,
the pagers run their own protocol. This is encrypted with 3DES, 
using shared secret keys agreed between the device and the 
server while the device is being sync'd in it's cradle.

I don't know how the keys are derived, or how often they are 
changed.

The system seemed reasonably non-snakeoily to me, at least
against aerial intercepts.
