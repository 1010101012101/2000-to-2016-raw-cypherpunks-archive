I just received my watch yesterday. It looks exactly like the picture on your website, no difference at all. This was actually 
my first time ordering from the internet, and I've heard so many bad things about online companies, but ordering from you 
and receiving my watch was a great first time experience. I really wish all internet companies were like yours.
