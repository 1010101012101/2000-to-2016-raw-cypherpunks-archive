Strangely enough, I agree.  I thought he went to far.

"Show of Force" is what one nation does for benefit of others.  Perhaps
you might recognize the phrase "sabre rattling".  "Great White Fleet"???
A religious wacko who might be taking liberties does not need a show of
force, he needs an expenses paid escort to a padded room.

Your "show of force" point is not reasonable, and you are a fool to stand
by it.

Your loss.  You should settle down and get a cat.
