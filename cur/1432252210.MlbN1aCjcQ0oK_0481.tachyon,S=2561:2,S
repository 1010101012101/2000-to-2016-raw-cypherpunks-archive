We would like to invite you to participate in the Amateur Science
Information Survey (AMSIS). The AMSIS is being conducted by
information professionals at the University of Tennessee. This
anonymous survey is an attempt to determine where and how amateur
scientists find information related to their scientific interests.
The online survey takes approximately 10 minutes to fill out. The
results of this survey will help libraries provide services and
materials to better meet the diverse needs of amateur scientists. To
take the survey please go to

Sincerely,

Travis Dolence
