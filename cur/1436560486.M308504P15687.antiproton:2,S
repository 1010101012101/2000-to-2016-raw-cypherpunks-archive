If you are interested in improving Bitcoin, and making about a Euro
(4.2 mBTC) in return, read on...

We are researchers conducting a Bitcoin user study and are seeking
participants. Bitcoin users are kindly invited to participate. Our
survey is anonymous and takes under 10 minutes to complete. As a
reward you receive BTC.

The goal of this survey is to learn about user perceptions regarding
Bitcoin and will cover aspects such as key management, wallet usage
and risk perception. As we believe that these results will be
valuable to the entire community, we will publish our results and
make them available to everyone. This is the link to the survey:
