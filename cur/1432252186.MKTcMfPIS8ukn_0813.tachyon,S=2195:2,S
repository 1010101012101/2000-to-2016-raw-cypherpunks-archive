Bingo.

You can't make a hierarchical network out of a geodesic one again.

To mangle Gilmore's words a bit, a geodesic network sees centralization as damage and routes around it.

One node cannot switch all traffic, and, at it's heart, that's what they're trying to do with this stuff.

They may not care, but I doubt, even these days when unpriced "common" resources are being wasted to such a degree by viruses and spam, that the market's going to let them kill off the internet just so they can watch everybody.

Cheers,
RAH
