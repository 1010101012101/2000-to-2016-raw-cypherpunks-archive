I do, too. But, clearly, I'm not an agent.

A field agent would look away from the moving bright spot, take in the whole
room, and see the wolf with the flashlight sitting in the corner.

(That's a ancient Texas proverb, BTW, "House cats do not eat wolves. Wolves
eat house cats." Never made sense to me, aside from the obvious. If anybody
here knows the true meaning/origin of that, I would be interested to hear
it.)
