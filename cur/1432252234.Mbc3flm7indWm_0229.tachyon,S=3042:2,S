Unfortunately, the "newsmakers" have minimal effect in
the near term; the beauraucracies involved have
inertia to beat the the band. (two examples: 1) Reagan
killes the B1, so USAF created the Strategic Program
Office, same people, same building, same contracts -
when it was revived, renamed again to B1, same people,
same building, same contracts.  2) Congress said no
mor U2s, so USAF built TR-1s and didn't rename them to
the U2 designation until the contract was complete. 
Same plane.)
