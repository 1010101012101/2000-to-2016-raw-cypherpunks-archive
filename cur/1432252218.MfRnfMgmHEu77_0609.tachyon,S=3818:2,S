hi,

After looking at RFC1323 below
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc1323.html#sec-4


the only reasonable option is to use the time old
pseudorandom numbers for TCP sequence numbers in the
TCP IP stack.

Another option would be to synchronize the client with
NTP but that wouldn't work either.Say that the client
clock can be updated ever one millisecond. However the
minimum network delay between the time server and the
client is usually 300ms to 800 ms.During this period a
large number of outboud packets are send from the
client depending on the speed at which the client is
blasting away. There are plenty of packets to analyze
for the attacker to determine the skew.

Sarad.
