The Snowden revelations describe several methods by which NSA committed kle=
ptography, caused compliance by hardware makers and influenced standards.=
=20

Why has AES escaped general suspicion? Are we to believe that NIST tested, =
selected, endorsed and promulgated an algorithm that was immune to NSA's to=
olset, without NSA participation and approval? NSA involvement in DES is kn=
own, but we await cryptanalysis or Snowdenesque revelations before having s=
kepticism about AES?

"On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register. =
Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshop=
s were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from=
 various parties, including from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin He=
llman and Whitfield Diffie,[2] citing a shortened key length and the myster=
ious "S-boxes" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspi=
cion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence =
agency so that they =E2=80=94 but no-one else =E2=80=94 could easily read e=
ncrypted messages.[3] Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented,=
 "We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all differ=
ent."[4] The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed=
 the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involve=
ment. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the=
 Committee wrote:

In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was su=
fficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; a=
nd certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowled=
ge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.[5]
However, it also found that

NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invente=
d and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, an=
d concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all co=
mmercial applications for which the DES was intended.[6]"

"On September 10 2013, The New York Times wrote that "internal memos leaked=
 by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the N.S.A. gen=
erated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 N.I.S.T. standard=
 =E2=80=94 called the Dual EC DRBG standard =E2=80=94 which contains a back=
door for the NSA." On September 10 2013, The NIST director released a state=
ment, saying that "NIST would not deliberately weaken a cryptographic stand=
ard.""

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG

"A major American computer security company has told thousands of customers=
 to stop using an encryption system that relies on a mathematical formula d=
eveloped by the National Security Agency (NSA).

RSA, the security arm of the storage company EMC, sent an email to customer=
s telling them that the default random number generator in a toolkit for de=
velopers used a weak formula, and they should switch to one of the other fo=
rmulas in the product.

The abrupt warning is the latest fallout from the huge intelligence disclos=
ures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of surveillance a=
nd the debasement of encryption by the NSA.

Last week, the New York Times reported that Snowden's cache of documents fr=
om his time working for an NSA contractor showed that the agency used its p=
ublic participation in the process for setting voluntary cryptography stand=
ards, run by the government's National Institute of Standards (NIST) and Te=
chnology, to push for a formula it knew it could break. Soon after that rev=
elation, the NIST began advising against the use of one of its cryptographi=
c standards and, having accepted the NSA proposal in 2006 as one of four sy=
stems acceptable for government use, said it would reconsider that inclusio=
n in the wake of questions about its security."
