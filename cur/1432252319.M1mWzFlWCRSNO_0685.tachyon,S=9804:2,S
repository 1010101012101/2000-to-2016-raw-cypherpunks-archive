OK... How about a dying gutshot US Marine in Afghanistan photographed by
an AP reporter?

http://razedbywolves.blogspot.com/2010/05/crosspost-sanitizing-war-what-w=
ould.html#Ricks

AP made the right call, and it took a FEMALE PHOTOJOURNALIST to push
them despite fanaticism on the part of people who don't want us to know
soldiers die in GRUESOME WAYS EVEN IN WORTHLESS WARS, threats, and yes
claims of unethical behavior...

But it's all good to show pictures of 'brown bodies'
