Actually, non-standard CDs sold with the CD logo are fraudulent, since
they violate
a published standard which the logo implies.  I'm surprised this avenue
hasn't been
taken legally.

The non-CD publishers are of course free to sell what they wish, but
they can't claim
standards-compliance, which they do.
