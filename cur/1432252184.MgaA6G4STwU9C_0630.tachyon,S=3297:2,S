Absolutely.  There should be nothing stopping, nor encouraging, private
assemblies.  To give them --or anyone-- special privledges enforced
by the state is wrong.  But the state is composed of politicians who
care not for principle but for votes.

....

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
