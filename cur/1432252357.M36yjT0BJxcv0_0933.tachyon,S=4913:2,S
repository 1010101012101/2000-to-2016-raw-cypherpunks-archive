Motorcycle gangs as international crime threat

Excerpted from:

"International Crime Threat Assessment," December 15, 2000

   <http://cryptome.org/piccs.rep.htm>http://cryptome.org/piccs.rep.htm (410K)

Mexican traffickers have also come to dominate methamphetamine 
production and distribution in the United States, which had 
been controlled by outlaw elements in US motorcycle gangs.

US Crime Groups Abroad 

Some US crime groups have established cells and networks in 
foreign countries, and are engaged in a wide range of criminal 
activities. In many cases, the US crime groups use their 
overseas networks to acquire drugs and other illicit contraband 
or to prey upon US businesses, as they do in the United States.
Law enforcement authorities in other countries also report that 
US crime groups are involved in money laundering, extortion, 
prostitution, drug trafficking, firearms smuggling, car theft, 
street crimes, and contract murders.

The most notorious US crime groups operating overseas are 
outlaw elements of motorcycle gangs, according to US law 
enforcement agencies. Some of the approximately 900 motorcycle 
gangs that have been identified as having outlaw elements by 
US law enforcement have worldwide chapters and are expanding
into other countries at a significant rate. The increasing 
overseas presence of US motorcycle gangs, together with their 
criminal members' tendency to associate with other crime 
groups to further their criminal ends, are causing increasing 
concern among law enforcement authorities around the world. 
Law enforcement authorities in countries where motorcycle 
gangs have established themselves indicate that the 
motorcycle gangs are extensively involved in organized crime 
and have particularly bad reputations for violence, property
crimes, prostitution and extortion rackets, and trafficking 
in drugs and firearms.

[The other US crime group abroad is La Cosa Nostra, second 
to motorcycle gangs.]

"The assessment prepared by a US Government interagency working 
group in support of and pursuant to the President's International 
Crime Control Strategy. Representatives from the Central
Intelligence Agency; Federal Bureau of Investigation; Drug 
Enforcement Administration; US Customs Service; US Secret Service; 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; National Drug Intelligence 
Center; the Departments of State, the Treasury, Justice, and 
Transportation; the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and 
the National Security Council participated in the drafting the
assessment."
