Please put a contact key on your darknet announce.

OpenPGP at its best.

Please no clearnet website/dumps for files. You're not teaching anyone
how to use crypto tools by giving them the easy way out. Make them
download and use Tor, I2P, Freenet, gnupg, sha256, whatever. You can
put those instructions on clearnet if you want.

As for torrent... Tor doesn't have much of a darknet torrent community.
I'd suggest seeding it on I2P, whereby others might pick it up there and
seed on clearnet.

The original files can be rsync'ed as well.

You may want to do 500MiB split(1)'s if resumes of large
files become a problem (2GiB limit bugs, etc).
