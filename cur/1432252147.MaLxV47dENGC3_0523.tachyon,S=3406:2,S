Worried that it's getting too late to send that seasonal deaththreat? Your 
Noel gift of loosely-packed icing sugar lost in the post? Armchair hoodlums 
the world over, twiddle your moustachios with relief: EVIL ANGELICA and her 
"Xmas Giveaway" hacking offer have returned. As involuntarily advertised by 
www.meet-victoria.com (and later by pittsburghrock.com , www.eunhyang.net , 
www.gibnews.com, and www.eprofessionalsinc.com ) web-defacing haxx0r 
Angelica will gladly replace the perfectly innocent front page of a 
semi-obscure domain with festive gr33tz of your own devising. Deadline is 
2001-12-23, so send your requests to webhack_competition@cow-tipper.com 
where Angelica - as well as, we're sure, the National Crime Squad - will 
select the most creative and/or incriminating for further examination. Have 
fun, but do remember: that 4am knock on the door is not *always* Santa 
Claus. http://defaced.alldas.de/?attacker=EVIL+ANGELICA - you're already 
taking that mailbox down, aren't you another.com?
