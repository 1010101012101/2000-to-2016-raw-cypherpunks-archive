Fox & Rabbits implies an arms race.  Fox & Hounds implies dead Fox.

Here's a way to tickle the Fox.  With a taser^H^H^H^HLinux.  Copied from
another list.

trivial to accomplish, too.

attached to this mail is an empty mpeg file (zipped). you can inflate it to 
any size you desire by doing (on Linux):

unzip empty.zip
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=xxx >>empty.mpg

where xxx is the number of KB you want to add. use 681574400 for 650 MB
which is the size of a CD and would look very promising for a pirated
movie.
