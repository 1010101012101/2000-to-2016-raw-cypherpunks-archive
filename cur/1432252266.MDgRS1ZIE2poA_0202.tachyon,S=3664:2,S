	Gee, imagine that, the Attorney General wanting to enforce crimes. 

	What *is* this world coming to? 

	We still live in a country that has laws, and we *should* expect the LEAs to enforce all laws that are on the books. 

	If you have a problem with the laws, it's not the LEAs fault, it's the legislature and the Executive branch.
