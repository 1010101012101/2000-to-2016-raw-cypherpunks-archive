Perhaps the c'punks should put some effort into installing facial
recognition systems in places where they will point out TO THE PUBLIC
undercover cops, FBI agitators posing as demonstrators, or other
undesirable citizens.  How about at the next WTO meeting (not that
I sympathize with the anti-globalists, but when both sides are thugs,
as in Genoa, then they both deserve to be exposed).

Hmm, if DARPA or the Army is going to digitize its soldiers' faces for
an IFF system, maybe we can FOIA that database.

Maybe we can stir up some doubts in even the cops' minds about
whether this technology is evil or beneficial.  Or at least hoist 
them on their own petard.

Brewster -- can we run this software over the set of pictures
of people on the Internet that your Web spider pulls down?

Luckily, picturephones never caught on -- or Ma Bell would be working
hand in hand with the government to monitor every citizen's every
phone call, and compare who's on it with the FBI and NSA watch list.
Oops, I forgot the voice recognition software and the permanent
international call wiretaps; I guess they already are.
