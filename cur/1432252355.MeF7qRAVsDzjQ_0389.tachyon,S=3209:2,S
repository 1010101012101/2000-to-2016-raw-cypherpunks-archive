Hey folks,

We just launched a new facet of our campaign to find out how local US
police agencies are using drones. We are partnering with MuckRock to
file public records requests with every police agency already on the
drone authorization list we got from the FAA via our Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit.

MuckRock also has an easy-to-use system where users can also file their
own requests with their local agencies that aren't on the list, but
which may be in the process of acquiring drones.

Our post announcing the project is here:

And MuckRock's announcement is here:

Hope you enjoy.

Best,
Trevor
