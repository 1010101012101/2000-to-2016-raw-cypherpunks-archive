IRS now sells poppers, Vaseline
Knowing this day would come, but surprised it hasn't, Movementarian.com 
exposes the new business the IRS is involved with, no stone left standing 
in the process. Current IRS commissioner Charles Rossotti stated in a news 
conference held today that "[W]e are trying to make the victims feel less 
victimized. The medical community asked us to do something after April 15th 
when the largest such ass raping occurred. The urologists specifically 
requested that we stop penetrating beyond the anus into the rectum. As a 
traditional policy, we are unable to comply with that request, however we 
will begin offering scented and colored lubes along with a vast array of 
non-Aspirin based painkillers. We hope this will cut down on the hospital 
visits and thank the community for their valuable input."
David Coy Johnston of the New York Times, pointed out in his op-ed "This 
issue has been completely misconstrued by tax-protesters and really is a 
moot point. These radicals need to deal with the issue like the rest of us 
and pay their fair share. Sure there might be a little bleeding and 
discomfort, but that is the price you pay for living in such a great 
country. Also, in the past, we in the media tended to provide various lube 
products, we are committed to doing so in the future as well and appreciate 
your past compliance; please keep up the great work." Hilary swears by them...

The greatest thing about anal sex is you never have kids you have to worry 
about so much that you get them chipped...
"Following the recent abduction of ten year olds Holly Wells and Jessica 
Chapman, the Mirror reports that Wendy and Paul Duval have decided to 
implant their daughter, Danielle, with "a microchip to track her every 
move. "If she was kidnapped her exact location would be discovered via a 
computer."
