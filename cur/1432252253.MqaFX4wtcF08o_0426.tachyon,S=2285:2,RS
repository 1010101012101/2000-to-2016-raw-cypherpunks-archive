This is a fair objection, and you've suggested one good remedy. Seems
John was happy to oblige.

As I said in my first email, I've been running a cpunks node from this
address for quite some time. According to my notes, the last time any
other node in the CDR showed any life was 5/11/2005, but I've run
cypherpunks@al-qaeda.net and before that cypherpunks@jfet.org since
circa 2000. You should be able to verify all this with a couple Google
searches.

Fundamentally, though, you're right: I'm not the same rash college kid
who thought it would be hilarious to have an al-qaeda.net CDR node, and
if that's a sticking point for people, probably this little joke's best
days are seven or eight years gone already anyhow.

To that end, I just grabbed "cpunks.org"; as soon as it comes alive,
I'll change everything over to the new address.
