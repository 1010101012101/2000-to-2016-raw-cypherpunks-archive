I didn't mean to give any impression that it was done by the HC 
attendees, just that it was a big hit. And since there were 30-50 Macs 
and PCs in the audience, with many on the ad hoc WiFi/AirPort network, 
and many links to the outside, there were a _lot_ of JPEGs whizzing by. 
Sometimes a blizzard of dozens per second, sometimes just a few per 
second.

The dynamics were interesting, too. The JPEGs started out being from 
porn sites, then became related to whatever the speaker was talking 
about. For example, if someone mentioned the evening's keynote speaker, 
Don Norman, a bunch of sites and photos related to him would appear 
(about 10 seconds later). If someone mentioned snow on the roads (near 
Yosemite), weather maps would appear.
