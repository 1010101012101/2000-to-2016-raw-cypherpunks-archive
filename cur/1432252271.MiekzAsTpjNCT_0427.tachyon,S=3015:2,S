A word to the wise: Perhaps this is an earnest effort, but it's
impossible to tell.  From appearances it is indistinguishable from a
scam which will accrue a large amount of third party owned bitcoin and
either vanish or get "hacked".

Promotion on the Forbes.com site shouldn't be taken to signify any
evidence of reputability. I've seen first hand that they do not do
much research for this sort of thing, and articles there have
previously plugged services operated by people known to have stolen
from others.

Anonymity can an important tool for social good, but it can also be
misused people should take great caution in handing over control of
valuable information to parties that operate under the veil of
anonymity. Many people have been robbed under similar circumstances.

The open source Bitcoin client software runs excellently over Tor. If
you want to use Bitcoin anonymously its a good combination and you
don't need services like this website.  The next major release of the
Bitcoin software will feature much better support for inbound
connections in hidden services and automatic hidden service peer
discovery, making it work even better.
