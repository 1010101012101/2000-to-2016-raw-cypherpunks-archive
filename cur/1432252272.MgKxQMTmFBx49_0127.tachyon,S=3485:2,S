Bin Laden was originally sponsored by Pakistan (Hence the
argument that Bin Laden was sponsored by the CIA, because the
CIA was sponsoring Pakistan's effort back in the days when
the target was the Soviet Union.).

The Taliban was a creation of Pakistan, created well after
the Soviet Union fell, and sponsored by them until a few days
ago, even though the Taliban was sponsoring terror against
the US.

 I much doubt they spent thirty billion developing them.

So it looks like supporting terrorism is a hugely profitable
activity.

Hey guys, terrorize the US.  We will then pay you stop.

And if Bush should have his doubts about this program, Pervez
Musharraf will point to all the taliban like extremists
within Pakistan and say "Well I am a moderate man, but gee,
if you do not give me what I want I might fall, and then
Pakistan's nukes get into the hands of the like of Bin Laden.

I suggest that Bush might make an alternative offer -- if
Musharraf cooperates sufficiently, the US government will
refrain from destroying his nuclear capability.
