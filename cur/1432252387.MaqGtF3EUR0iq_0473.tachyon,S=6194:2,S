"Because the school accepts no government aid and prohibits its students from doing the same, it
has the right to discriminate on the basis of religion."

from a story http://www.newsday.com/ap/text/national/ap170.htm
about a college for home-schoolers.

Re: why govt subsidized arenas
have to be neutral wrt who you kiss, a
recent thread here.

Along those lines, two more recent refs: one where
a govt school cuts off the Scouts,
another where a county doesnt and
gets sued.

 District Ends Boy Scout Affiliation 

                       NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan school board has banned its
                       42 schools from sponsoring Boy Scout troops because the
                       90-year-old national organization excludes gays.

                       The board of Community School District Two passed the
                       resolution at a meeting Tuesday night, becoming the first district
                       in the city to enact such a ban.

Scouts Lease on Base Extended 
                                                     ACLU, gays claim rent-free access to Newport Beach site is a government
                                                   subsidy for a discriminatory group. 

                                                   By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer


                                                        Over objections from the gay and lesbian community and the threat of an
                                                   ACLU lawsuit, Orange County supervisors Tuesday unanimously approved a
                                                   30-year extension of the Boy Scouts lease on a Newport Beach sea base under
                                                   county authority. 
                                                        "This is good news for everybody in Orange County," said David Janes, a sea
                                                   base volunteer and retired Navy rear admiral, after the boards vote. 
                                                        About 35 Scouts, their parents and Scout leaders attended the meeting in a
                                                   show of support for the rent-free extension of the base lease, beginning in 2006.
                                                   The Scouts have operated the base for 63 years and recently raised $4.5 million to
                                                   renovate the popular facility. 
                                                        Opponents of the lease renewal argued that the county should not "subsidize" a
                                                   group that discriminates against people because of sexual orientation. 
                                                        "It is clear that the Boy Scouts do not have the right to receive any
                                                   government subsidies, sponsorship or special privileges, such as sweetheart deals
                                                   on rent of government lands and buildings," said Martha Matthews, an attorney
                                                   for the American Civil Liberties Union. 
                                                        The ACLU recently sued San Diego in federal court over a lease of public
                                                   parkland to the Scouts for $1 a year. 
                                                        In response to a question Tuesday by Supervisor Todd Spitzer about whether
                                                   the ACLU intends to sue Orange County, Matthews said, "Its likely that we
                                                   would." 
Another great quote: 

The only thing different is you dont have to dumb down the vocabulary when youre teaching
home-schooled kids, said Farris, a Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in 1993 and
founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
