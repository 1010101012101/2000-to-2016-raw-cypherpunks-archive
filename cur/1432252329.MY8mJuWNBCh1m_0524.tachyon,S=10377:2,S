I have a Keybase profile at
	https://keybase.io/jcrawfordor
I have several invites available as well if anyone else is interested.

I think of Keybase very positively, it is perhaps not perfect but it's
a big improvement in usability for typical people than the
web-of-trust system. Attaching cryptographic keys to social network
identities matches how most people really use the internet very well.

Perhaps this has already been mentioned, but it's worth pointing out
that the Keybase service (keybase.io) is NOT trusted to verify the
proofs. The keybase command-line tool verifies the proofs
independently itself, preventing the keybase service lying.

That said, I would not advocate uploading your private key to keybase.
There is a huge usability tradeoff surrounding this, and while Keybase
is trying to maintain as much security as possible, I'm not yet
convinced that it is safe to provide the private key to a third party
even if they have zero knowledge (primarily because of problems with
web browser cryptographic implementation).
