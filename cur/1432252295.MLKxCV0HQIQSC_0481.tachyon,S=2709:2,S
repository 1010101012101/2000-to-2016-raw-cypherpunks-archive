Do you have an opinion on the last 2 posts by Peter Trei? IE When did you 
stop beating your wife? (or meat,dog,etc)

Four hundred billionaires now possess wealth equal to that of the 3 billion 
poorest people on the planet. This capitalist system is inherently violent, 
oppressive and exploitative. Capitalism cannot be reformed, and that's why 
we need to abolish it. "Liberty without socialism is 
privilege,injustice;socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality." 
Bakunin.
