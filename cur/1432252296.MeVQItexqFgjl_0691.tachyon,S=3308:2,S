Yes, the head of ElcomSoft and another senior officer
were in the US when Dmitry was busted, Alexander
Katalov and his brother Vladimir. I spoke to and e-mailed
Vladimir a couple of days after the arrest and he was 
dismayed at being unable to speak to Dmitry and getting 
the runaround from the Las Vegas authorities. He was 
apprehensive that the whole ElcomSoft crew in the US 
would be busted, and didn't know who to turn to for
advice.

Vladimir was in Portland so I gave him Robb London's 
lovenest address and phone number.
