Do I interpret this statement correctly as the endorsement of 
ethnicity-based travel restrictions?

Didn't domething like this been here already, in the form of Jim Crow 
laws, and later found unconstitutional?

I am afraid either I don't understand you correctly, or you are 
contradicting yourself. The "...or use public transport" from your earlier 
statement seems to mean that you said something along the lines "if they 
can't fly, they should use public transportation, which includes 
airplanes".

Being told I can't use some quite common resource, in this case an 
important means of transportation, because of so irrelevant factor as 
ethnicity, isn't exactly delicate. What would you do if you'd be in the 
receiving end of such policy? Add more such restrictions and some 
percolating time - would you just bow and obey? How long it would take to 
get you pissed and eventually revolting?

Vast majority of them yes. But you don't perceive them because they don't 
offend you and don't make the news.

Not yet. But maybe I just didn't look deep enough through the mass-medial 
fog of the terrorism "war".

With the proper leadership, everything is possible. Don't forget the 
WW2 kamikaze pilots, who weren't quite Arabs.
