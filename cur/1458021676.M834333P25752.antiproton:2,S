Even if said crypto citizens don't argue... the one group that is for
citizen guns, the NRA [1], is also rather against surveillance / spying
and databases and for privacy [2][3], so were you to reach out to
them you might find a powerful symbiotic ally in the crypto fight.

[1] And other similar RKBA groups.
[2] See their national rally videos on youtube.
[3] Though they may not know how to reach out to crypto
to consult and integrate the philosophy into their position
for their benefit.
