You're losing it Declan: when you have to start putting words into my
mouth, you at the point where you need to step back, take a deep breath,
and realize you have crossed over...  *NOWHERE* in the below complaint
will you see *ANY* proof of your assertion that I "asked them to take
action against *me* [McCullagh]".  You have  been reduced to whimperings
that even your supporters can see are utter fabrications.

Cypherpunks are well-known providers of Bulk-email HTML spam campaigns.
As a "marketing analyst," you've clearly come to the right place.

Here we go again: "three people".  Poor little Declan isn't responible for
*ANY* of his little betwetting mess, now *is he*???  

> in the

Again with making up what you would LIKE to hear.  Please quote where I
said *anything even remotely LIKE* "I overreacted".  I do not think I
overreacted at all.  I send a complaint about some idjit who was too
stupid to even obtain a spam host without putting his foot in his
mouth.  I don't consider this overreacting.  In fact, given the
unbelievable pathetic attempt he made, I think it was rather appropriate.

>  uunet 
> (intentionally),

I wouldn't know, as UU.net has not yet sent me anything on this
"issue" other than the standard "thanks for making a complaint, now get
lost" missive.

> and my provider (intentionally, probably).

Hrmmm..  So is broadwing your provider as well?  Since broadwing and UU
were the only ones I complained to, your statements here imply that.

More smoke and mirrors Declan: this isn't about "the spamincident" and you
know it.  It's a bout a spoiled little brat who got his panties all
knotted up because he thought someone had tried to complain about
him, and then abused his reputation for accuracy and fairness as a
journalist to try and "get even".

Really?  Don't you mean something more along the lines of "Beter ways of
dealing with others can avoid this in the future."???

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
