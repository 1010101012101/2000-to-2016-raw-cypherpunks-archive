The documentation is perhaps a little outdated. All problems mentioned by
Gutmann have been adressed in a new protocol that has been included in tinc
1.1pre3 and later.

If people are interested in using tinc to connect freedomboxes together, I
would be happy to help fix any problems that might come up. Even if tinc (as it
is) is not suitable for the Freedombox, I am very interested in discussing what
the requirements are for the Freedombox regarding VPN functionality.
