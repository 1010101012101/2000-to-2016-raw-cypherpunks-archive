I don't see how the profit works especially when they have been working on it for 14 years. Don't they have to sustain their employees? Its easier to see how they make money if the launch fails(assuming the launch vehicle is cheaper than the money collected for sending the payload). But its just $8000 and maybe worth taking the chance and maybe that's what they want!
