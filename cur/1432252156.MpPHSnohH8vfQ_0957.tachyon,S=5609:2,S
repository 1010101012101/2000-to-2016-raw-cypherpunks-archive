Al Qaida biological warfare factories attacked

By Ze'ev Schiff, Ha'aretz Defense Commentator

Among the bases attacked in the U.S.-led strikes in Afghanistan was an
Osama bin Laden camp which served as a production facility for
poisonous chemicals, including biological warfare agents.

The present strategic situation is one of the reasons that Washington
is being extremely careful in disclosing the targets that American and
British planes hit in Afghanistan over the past three days.
Information on the targets has not been readily supplied, not even to
fellow members of the international anti-terror coalition.

According to information provided by Western sources, it seems that
U.S. intelligence holds "detailed information on the location of bin
Laden's Al Qaida organization camps." The U.S. and British air strike
targeted instructional and training bases near the cities of Jalalabad
and Khut, located close to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Apparently, one of the bin Laden bases attacked, which was both small
and secret, manufactured various poisons, including biological warfare
agents. Professional bases as well as Al Qaida manufacturing centers,
including intelligence instructional bases near Kandahar and Kabul
have also been hit. According to Western claims, Al Qaida members were
trained to carry out attacks and hijackings at these bases.

Another base attacked in the region was a chief manufacturer of
explosive materials.

According to this information it seems that the American and other
intelligence services knew about Al Qaida's involvement in the
chemical and biological warfare realm prior to the strikes.
