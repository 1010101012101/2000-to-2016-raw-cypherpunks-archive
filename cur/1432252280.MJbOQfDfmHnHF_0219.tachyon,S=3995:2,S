Greedy might be an understatement :-)  Really amazingly stupid is more
like it.  The entertainment industry should be bought out by the Bell's,
and then the telco's can resume control of *all* com-links.  They won't
need DRM since they'll own all the data and the pipes it goes thru.

If the entertainment industry wants safe platforms, they can sell them.
If you buy one, you should expect it's going to have some specific limited
uses.  I don't think there's any problem with that.  I've got a problem
with it being mandated, and I've told my congress critters so.  With luck,
they'll listen.

All those guys can be as greedy as they want.  If they don't deliver a
product, they got no sales to begin with.  For lots of "content creators",
the net bypasses the greedy guys.  I don't see that going away too soon.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
