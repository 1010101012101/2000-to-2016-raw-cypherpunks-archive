Fred Cypherpunk,

As part of our ongoing commitment to provide our customers useful real
trading services, we are pleased to introduce our latest new release: 
"Historical Futures Charts"

http://www.ccstrade.com/ccs/research/tools/history/listing/

Have you ever wondered what July Soybeans did in 1988, the year of the
drought?   

http://www.ccstrade.com/ccs/research/tools/history/listing/s/

Or how about December Silver in 1979, the year the Hunt brothers
attempted to corner the market?  

http://www.ccstrade.com/ccs/research/tools/history/listing/si/

Or the Crude Oil market during the Persian Gulf war?

http://www.ccstrade.com/ccs/research/tools/history/listing/cl/

Now you can plot and study actual contract histories.  Not just a
continuous weekly or monthly chart that goes back 20 to 40 years.  Zero
in on what you need to know by looking at a specific contract and the
psychology behind how they traded it.

We have complete history available on just about every major contract, 
with some as far back as 1959!

This is just the beginning developments of this service.  We have
programmers teamed up with the research department to provide you tools
for custom historical data analysis.

Look for additional new releases and upgrades over the next several
weeks.

As always, we appreciate your business and continued support.

Thank You,

Lannie Cohen, President
