   Greetings Dave,

   ABC News 7 in Denver has series of stories & interviews that are also
   online at

   http://www.thedenverchannel.com/7newsinvestigates/index.html

   The series investigates several aspects of apparent Air Marshals
   management-employee disputes, but most disturbing is the disclosure of
   an alleged "quota" requirement within the service for filing
   "Surveillance Detection Reports" identifying suspicious passengers.
   The "quota" system was apparently disclosed by disgruntled former
   Marshals, who point to directives requiring "Each federal air marshal
   is now expected to generate at least one SDR per month" and that
   citizens identified in these reports are placed on various watch
   lists.   Apparently filing a certain minimum number of reports was
   necessary for performance review and compensation purposes.  The
   managers contacted did not deny the memos but did say that no quota
   existed.  The investigations have apparently gotten some Congressional
   attention.
