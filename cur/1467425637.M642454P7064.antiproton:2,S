Well, Juan basically tells them to use nothing. Or at least, I haven't
managed to elicit any substantive recommendations. So what the fuck?

Yes, the Tor Project is bullshitting people, and that's evil.

I'm not about positive thinking, but rather about working with what's
available. And that includes Tor, even if it's primarily a tool of
