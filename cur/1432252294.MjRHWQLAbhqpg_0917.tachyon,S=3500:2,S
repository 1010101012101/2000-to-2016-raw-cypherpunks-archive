reminder from this month's enhyper newsletter, 2004 payment system and
security conference
http//www.enhyper.com/paysec/

also mention financial cryptography blog ... by some of the same people
http//www.financialcryptography.com/
they also have short blurb on:
http://www.bitpass.com/

enhyper also discovered norm hardy and some of his papers: ... the digital
silk road
http//www.cap-lore.com/Economics/DSR/
http//www.agorics.com/Library/dsr.html

norm's past include LLNL, 360s, vm/370, secure operating systems and secure
transactions:
http://cap-lore.com/

and secure operating systems at tymshare with gnosis and keykos:
http//www.agorics.com/Library/keykosindex.html
http//www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/
.... and there is EROS -- extremely reliable operation system (outgrowth of
keykos)
http//www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/
... note above mentions looking at getting an EAL7+ evaluation for eros.

when MD bought tymshare they were looking at spinning off a number of
things. i was brought in to do a technical audit of gnosis as part of its
spin-off as keykos. they were also spinning off Doug Engelbart who was
working at Tymshare at the time ... tymshare was running doug's "augment"
system on pdp10 ...

http//www.sciencedaily.com/encyclopedia/nls

and total topic drift, i've got lots of references to vm/370:
