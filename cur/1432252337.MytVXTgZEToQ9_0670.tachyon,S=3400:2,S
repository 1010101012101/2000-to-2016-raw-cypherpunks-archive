How secure is Bitcoin's ECDSA?

My thought is using doing a *new* encrypted transport (or re-purposing SSL)
and using the exact same ECDSA keys that are already being used as Bitcoin
addresses would make it more likely that an attacker would just go after
the money rather than wast time on MITM, and it's a lot more likely that
average users would care to upgrade.

This, I conjecture, would result in a generally much stronger deployment of
crypto to end-users.
