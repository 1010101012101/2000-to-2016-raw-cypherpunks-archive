[Various discussion about spammers using crypto to use remailers.
There's not much, but it's there.  Encrypted-Outgoing-Only
reduces the problem a lot, since there aren't many people who'll
positively respond to encrypted spam :-) ]

Obviously there are some destinations that need to be exceptions.
Usenet's easy - keep track of known mail2news gateways,
and any time you send mail to Usenet, you need to put lots of disclaimers
about it's remailed, it's probably forged, there's no way to reply, etc.

Mailing lists are tougher, because you obviously can't keep a list of them.

Another way to deal with unencrypted outgoing message is to send mail
saying "we've received an anonymous message for you.  You can pick it up
at https://myremailer.com/tempoutgoing/msg124354.txt within 7 days."
or some such.
