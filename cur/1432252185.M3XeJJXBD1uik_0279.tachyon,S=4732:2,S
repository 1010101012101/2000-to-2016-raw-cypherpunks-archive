I expect this will have consequences when they eventually resume college recruiting. Adobe will likely face sneers and derisive laughter when it shows up on college campuses next spring to recruit.

	One would hope, but I suspect that between now and next spring three
or four things will come up that will distract the students attention from
Adobe--it helps them that the got things sorted out rather quickly, before 
it got really big--so there wasn't a *lot* of mainstream coverage over 
many days to burn it into the publics mind. 

>Adobe will be suffering for a long time to come.

	As much as I agree with the sentiment, I doubt it.
