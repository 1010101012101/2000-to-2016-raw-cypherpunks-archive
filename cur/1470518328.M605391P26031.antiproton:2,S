The fucking paper that I've cited. And more generally, all experiments
that reject the null hypothesis that the outcome of the CHSH game is 75%
or less.

Quantum mechanics is math. It makes predictions about reality that can
be tested. By experiments where stuff gets measured.

The problem is that some predictions of quantum mechanics, such as this
stuff about entanglement, 1) have been verified experimentally, but 2)
don't make obvious sense. That is, a wave function comprising two
entangled electrons can apparently collapse instantaneously, even though
the electrons are arbitrarily far apart. You could try to give up light
as a universal speed limit. But that creates other paradoxes.
