Out of a population of 900 million (or so) that's definitly the wings of
the bell curve.  The "poverty line" in the US is twice the middle class
income of India.  That's pretty stunning.

In the US, anyone below $20,000/yr income is "poor".  According
to that, 90% of India is "dirt poor"!!

Is this kind of a bribe?  Keep the majority happy on rations
and steal the rest for a few?

Ouch.  But at least it's an attempt.

the bribery is similar in the US, but there's definitly
a lack of respect between classes.

Part of it is because they don't have the resources, and part of it is
because they don't need to control _people_ when they can just gain wealth
instead.  that may have something to do with mutual respect.  I suspect
there's a few 1000's of years of history that helps make things the way
they are.

Thank you for the description.  I knew India had some problems, but now
I've got an idea of the scope and scale.

Patience, persistence, truth,
