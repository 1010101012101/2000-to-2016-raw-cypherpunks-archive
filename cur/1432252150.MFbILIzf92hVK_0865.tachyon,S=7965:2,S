INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!

New articles from Insight on the News are now online

http://www.insightmag.com

...............................................

Folks, last week we put out our Spring Double Issue, so you won’t find a new 
issue today. But you will find some outstanding stories you may have missed. . . 
. Ralph de Toledano’s blistering expose of the ACLU, 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/255123.html Jamie Dettmer’s remarkable story on 
damage control inside the FBI and CIA post Sept. 11, 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/255121.html and Doug Burton’s Symposium on 
whether the NEA discriminates against its religious members 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/255099.html—to name just a few. Until next time, 
I’m still your Newsman in Washington.

...............................................

CIA AND FBI PLAY THE BLAME GAME

Jamie Dettmer reveals that the fabled Clinton "war room," with its alert media 
reflexes and craftiness in unleashing quick ripostes to potentially damaging 
stories, had nothing on these spooks and G-men!

DOLLARS AND SENSE

Sean Paige writes that having blundered once already with a Susan B. Anthony 
dollar coin that confused people by looking and feeling too much like a quarter, 
the folks in Washington seem to have produced yet another dollar coin that 
hasn't caught on with anyone other than coin collectors.

TAXPAYERS GETTING DRILLED ON FLORIDA LEASE DEAL

Sean Paige has discovered that environmental groups are purring like kittens 
(kittens that ate the canary) after the Bush administration agreed to a $235 
million taxpayer buyback of gas and mineral leases on public lands in Florida, 
where the president's brother, Jeb Bush, just happens to be governor.

     Liberals & Homosexuals Conspire to Subvert Seminaries

Liberals who blame celibacy for the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandals are 
missing the real cause: seminaries that actively encourage homosexuality, moral 
laxity, and theological dissent all in the name of post-Vatican II "renewal."  
In Goodbye, Good Men, Michael S. Rose demonstrates that such seminaries are by 
no means rare.  Help defend Christianity from assault by those who would subvert 
its message from within. Save over 30%!  Order now.

WHAT’S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT A TREATY THAT WILL ‘END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN?’

Janice Crouse and Wendy Wright tell us that on the surface, CEDAW looks 
advantageous to all women. What's not to like about a treaty that would 
supposedly "end discrimination against women"? If this was what CEDAW really was 
about, we all would applaud it. But it's not.

PRO&CON:

IS THE NEA FAIR TO ITS RELIGIOUS MEMBERS?

http://www.insightmag.com/news/255099.html

          BOB CHASE SAYS YES: The record shows that NEA treats all teachers – 
both union and nonunion – with respect.

Persecution? The form used by the Ohio Education Association to determine 
whether a religious objector has a legitimate case under the law is less 
probing, less intrusive and far shorter than the information the National Right 
to Work Legal Defense Foundation advises individuals to provide.

http://www.insightmag.com/news/255100.html

          STEFAN GLEASON SAYS NO: The NEA's primary goal is to impose its 
radical social agenda on public education.

In May, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that the National 
Education Association systematically discriminates against teachers who have a 
religious objection to joining or supporting that teachers union. This confirmed 
once again that the nation's largest teachers union has a bias against people of 
faith who do not support its radical social agenda.

CONNERLY LEADS THE FIGHT FOR A COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY

Deroy Murdoch asks what color are you? Black? White? Brown? Yellow? None of my 
concern, you say? If so, why is your ethnicity the government's business?

http://www.insightmag.com/news/255107.html

ROTHMAN WARY OF SHIFT IN CULTURE

In an exclusive interview by Stephen goode, scholar Stanley Rothman says there 
has been a change in society and a breakdown in the social order that one day 
will turn around, but he does not know when.
