Somehow, for you, there is no contradiction between "none of these laws
call for 'restricting' the use of information" and "must comply with the
restriction".  Must be some other language you speak.

Health care is clearly an exception since the subject matter of the
field is the person himself.  For most purposes, finance does not (read:
would not in an ideal world) require any personal information.

(Sic 'em, Hettinga! He doesn't understand the concept of a bearer bond.)

Well, Adam, after years of experimenting with, analyzing, implementing,
writing about, and discussing crypto and privacy, isn't it great
to have some bozo show up on the list and start lecturing to you about
what "most people working in the privacy field" think?

Ahh, the classic "Euro" privacy kleptocrat: got to "control" what those
evil corporations can do.  But pay no attention to that man from the
government: he is your Friend (or Do You Have Something To Hide?).

I'm not sure why you think you have any right to tell me (or my company)
what I can do with information that resides on my private hard disk or
a piece of paper in my desk drawer.

It already has happened to some extent: see anonymizer.com (or the new
safeweb.com).  Digital cash will happen eventually; it's just too useful.
Other stuff will follow.

I don't know what planet you live on.  I visit a retail store nearly
every day, walk up to the counter, plop down my bills and walk out
with merchandise.  Nobody asks me my name or my social security number
or where I live.

"This is _very_very_ complicated, son. Just leave it to us professionals."

Kinda hard to believe the CTO of a place called privacyright.com hasn't
thought a bit more deeply about this stuff.
