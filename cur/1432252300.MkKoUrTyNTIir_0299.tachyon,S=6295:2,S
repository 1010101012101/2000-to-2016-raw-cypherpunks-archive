Not directly I can't, at least not without betraying someone.
In retrospect, I should've used a nym to make the statement 
to keep him out of trouble.

Okay, let's forget what I know from people I don't want to drag 
into the fire and go through it from the "circumstantial" angle.

What does it mean when Lotus Notes has to put a work reduction field 
in their product in order to get export approval status, and then 
doesn't talk about it?  But lots of other companies who also don't 
talk about it, with stronger-seeming crypto get export approval 
status? 
       <you brought it up, you document it...>

What does it mean when banks refuse to work with earlier versions 
of Netscape claiming it's because the security certs are expired -- 
but when new security certs are downloaded and installed, they 
still refuse to work with earlier versions of netscape and refuse 
to tell you why? (This, btw, was what made me suspicious in the 
first place and why I started digging...)

What does it mean when Lew Giles, even after the rules change to the 
BXA-controlled system, made a living going around convincing 
engineers working for american companies to compromise their products'  
security? With or without knowledge of the companies' execs?
        <http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-9902.html#backdoors>

What does it mean when PGP has a "flaw" introduced into its 
Additional Decryption Keys at the same time NAI is seeking 
export approval for it?  And NAI gets export approval, and 
then nobody notices the flaw for several years after, and 
then they go oops, it was just a mistake?
	<in light of recent news, I don't figure I have

What does it mean when a CEO who actually can and does review 
code, so subverted engineers can't seem to get one past him, in 
a meeting with NSA officials refuses to compromise -- and one of 
the spooks loses his cool and offers to run the guy over in the 
parking lot?  I'll explain this one to you...  it means that spook 
_HAD_NEVER_SEEN_ anyone refuse to compromise, and had no fucking 
clue what to do.  That's if you buy the "he just lost his cool" 
story.  On the other hand, death threats may be policy and this 
was just the first time they were needed.  And on the gripping 
hand, maybe it's just the first time it was *reported*.  Not very 
many execs would talk about something like that, and I figure most 
who've experienced it probably just shut up and gave the spooks 
whatever they wanted.

<Considering your address, I figure you know about this one, 
 so I'm not going to bother documenting it. >

Lew Giles and its ilk had to have some kind of bargaining position, 
and if export approval was forthcoming without subverting security 
in some way, would have had none.  The only way a spook could lose 
his cool and offer Bidzos a death threat would be if that spook were 
totally unfamiliar with people not compromising.  

You may consider me paranoid, but I'm telling you that the case of 
Lotus Notes was just the one that people found out about.  If Lotus 
had to do that to get export approval from the BXA, then so did 
everybody else. I do not buy the story that what happened to PGP 
was an accident; on the contrary, it was just NAI doing what they 
had to do to get approval to put it up for international downloads, 
the same as Lotus just did what it had to do.  And, I'm telling 
you now, the same as AOL and Microsoft did what they had to do with 
the browsers.
