Even more significant is that a dead man cannot take the oath of office.

If he can't take the oath of office he can't occupy the office.  The
governor only has the power to replace a senatoratorial position if 
the current office holder dies.

Since Carnahan died before he took office, the office remains unfilled.  The 
governor does not have power to appoint senators willy-nilly. The office must 
be held before it can be filled.  The correct solution would be to hold a 
special election so that the public has a chance to know who they are voting
into office.  What the democrats are afraid of is that his wife might be
less fit to hold that office than her husband in some democrat's minds
(after debates etc).

Here is a question?  Would it be vote fraud to run one person's name on the
ballot and replace him with someone else when he won?
