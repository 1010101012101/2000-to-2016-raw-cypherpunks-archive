Subject: [freenet-devl] freegle.com: major overhaul

I was busy over the Easter weekend.

That's new on www.freegle.com:

-anonymous search page! (inserted with htl 60, should hopefully be visible everywhere)
-anonymous key submission (just a description on how to add to the 'freegle' in-freenet key index)
-list of recently added keys
-better navigation
-nicer layout in a shade of orange

And here's the what's-to-come list:

-automated retrieval of the in-freenet key index (should put that in place soon...)
-downloadable version of the search classes, preferably as an fproxy plugin
-source code of all the server-side stuff
-actual crawling (I'm evaluating the WebSphinx crawler toolkit, should be adaptable to Freenet with few modifications)

Enjoy! Laud! Criticize!

-Stefan
