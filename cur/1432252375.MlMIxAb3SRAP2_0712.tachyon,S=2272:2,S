Hooray.

Not sure it'll matter, though.

But having the Feds beg Wikileaks not to release the diplomatic cables was a
nice touch.

John Young mourned the death of crypto and cypherpunks, but here we are
precisely in a situation in which a government couldn't bomb or assassinate or
otherwise throw some jackbooted tantrum or threat in order to get its' way.

It's cute too that, just like "rendition", Assange and Wikileaks operate in a
nebulous amalgam of jurisdictions. Is it illegal for them to do what they did?
In which country? OK, what about another country and its' mirror sites? And
could they shut down the TOR networks and other means by which the info-dumps
are received and transmitted? No, this cat is out of the bag. Hopefully
Assange is smart enough to have established dead-man protocols, also.

What's good for the goose, etc...

I'm lovin' it. Tickled pink.

Glad to see, however, even the US-ians were smart enough not to get pulled
into a Sunni-Shia thing. Iraq was problem enough, but the Iranians wouldn't
eaten their lunch.
