Just try setting up a well-equipped personal chem. lab w/o inviting a visit 
from the BATF or FBI.  Its next to impossible for minors to purchase 
chemical reagents, I had no trouble in the 60s.

Try building and finding a place to launch an amateur rocket (it can be 
done, but now only with the greatest of regulatory red tape).  I did.  Some 
of my group's rockets achieved heights over 100,000 ft (confirmed by 
Edward's AFB radar.)

Try doing independent research in bacterial or viral genetics and see who 
shows up on your doorstep.

Notice that none of the science avenues presented are the one's I've discussed.
