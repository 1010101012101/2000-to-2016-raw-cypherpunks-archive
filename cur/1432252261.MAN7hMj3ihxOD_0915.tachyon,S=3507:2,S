The test apparatus had one central button and a bunch of other lightable
buttons around it. The subject pressed the central button and waited for
one of the others to light, then pressed that one as quickly as he
could. The test measured the time between the lighting and the subject's
release of the central button as well as the time between the lighting
and the subject's pressing the lit button. The first number was pretty
much just reflex time, and was not particularly correlated with g,
general intelligence. The second number involved selection from amongst
alternatives, was positively correlated with g.

And you're right, the test was denounced, though I can't figure out how
the detractors found a cultural bias in it. Maybe they just attacked the
notion of g.
