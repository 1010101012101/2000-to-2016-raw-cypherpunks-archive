The sky is falling, the sky is falling, ....

So much for belief in free markets. You realise that there is nothing that
requires servers to install this, or cease using the old network?

It seems to me the 'cypherpunkish', 'libertarian', 'anarchic' thing to do
is to promote the growth of individualy operated servers other than those
on ISP's (who will have a motive to drop the old system and use the new
system - just another example of why libertarian/economism is not
sufficient in and of itself for a basis for society - they have no motive
to protect the individual, only the 'market').
