Dearest A,

How are you this morning, my dear?  With great interest I read your  
question to dear John Young of Cryptome dated 8 October 2012, published  
here, http://cryptome.org/2012/10/tor-bradley-mannings.htm. John Young may 
wish to note that Tor boldly states it is from the US Navy on their  
Overview page, see https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en. They 
also boldly state past funding from the US Navy on their sponsors page, see 
https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors.html.en. Take a bespectacled 
gander at "Past Sponsors". And I quote for your reference, "DARPA and ONR 
via Naval Research Laboratory (2001-2006)". What a curious way to hide an 
affiliation. Perhaps A should call up "tor management" and ask direct 
questions. Contact info can be found at  
https://www.torproject.org/about/contact.html.en. They even list an  
old-fashioned telephone for direct voice to voice communications.

My genitals would quiver with glee if you published this information  
months before Tor published the information on their website. Andrew  
Lewman published the financial statements and Dept of Commerce Data  
Collection Form on Friday, October 5, 2012, see  
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2012-October/047018.html.

Having recovered from a powerful conspriacy-gasm, you clicked links for  
half of an hour reframing these documents to sound like a fantastic  
conspiracy of control and puppeteering. You will also note all of these  
data is easily found, gathered, and published in the name of US Government 
transparency. The Dept of Commerce Data Collection Form gives you all the 
source programs one needs to learn to find this information online. You 
will note very few of such DCF forms are published ever. Why would Tor 
publish this if for not to create such an easy-to-follow trail?

Rather, I think the real conspiracy is that Tor published the documents at 
all. Plausibly, they did so in the name of transparency and to the horror 
of their funding organizations. I do so applaud the Tor Project's  
transparency and commitment to such an ideal. They far outweigh and garner 
more trust than Wikileaks could ever hope to do. Now if Jacob would with 
Julian into the Ecuadorian embassy with Julian, the two could bro-code and 
have endless recursion of bro-love for life. Sadly, my genitals are left 
wanting for your publishing of such documents means you did not do the 
faintest bit of work, rather Tor did it all for you. Investigation, my 
dear, takes time, effort, and disclosure of something the world doesn't 
already know.

Further, your own bro-love slave in Alan Taylor of PGPBOARD (CAPS WERE FUN 
IN THE 1970s SIR), selectively used copy and paste to reframe your own 
reframing of said financials and funding for maximal paranoia. You two are 
aware that Al Gore, nay, DARPA invented the Internet, correct? Your entire 
means of propagation is due to DARPA research and funding. Imagine the 
backdoors in TCP, IP, Manchester encoding, and such other protocols on 
which we rely every day.

If you want to recover some higher probability of quivering genitals,  
publish Tor's 2011 990 before they do.

As a former American taxpayer, I do so wish I could direct my taxes  
towards more projects like Tor. I much rather more Tor and Tor-like  
projects exist than in lieu of the United States Government spending more 
money on $22 billion dollar F-22 fighters that cannot fly and are easily 
copied by the Chinese in 50% of the time for 25% of the cost. If the US 
Navy and other military branches do wish to spend more money on Tor, I say 
godspeed sirs. All governments should spend money on Tor. Tor works, unlike 
smart ships, fancy jets, and other DHS/TSA boondoggles bankrupting what was 
once a fine society.

Freedom sir, is a dish best served to all equally. Thankfully, elements  
within governments are funding such projects rather than simply funding  
more fantasies they copied from Metropolis, 1984, Brave New World,  
Farenheit 451, and Kallocain.

I cross posted this letter to tor-talk because I know the Tor Project will 
publish it unredacted. Unlike sirs John and Alan who selectively edit for 
maximal conspiracy value.

Cheers bretheren, the fight for freedom continues aghast at your apathy  
and ignorance.

Frihet Null
