Adam really should stick to crypto, his understanding of psychology is
rather whimsical at best.

If people can act through governments to probe the depths of human
deprevity there is no reason to believe that adding profit to the equation
will alter those depths to the less extreme at all.

His faith in the power of the all mighty buck to make people act ethically
or in a civil fashio is seriously misplaced.
