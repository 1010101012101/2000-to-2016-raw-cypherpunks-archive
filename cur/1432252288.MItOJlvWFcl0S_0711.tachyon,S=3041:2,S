I would like to defend libertarianism, I don't believe I can
defend anarchy.  I don't believe a system that lacks a government
operating military and judicial services would be efficient.

I would respond to your claim that libertarianism is 'fascism at
best and socialism at worst', but I can't even come close to
guessing what you might be basing that upon.
