New NRO Mandate Raises Secrecy Flag

http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20001128S0003

A commission created to examine the future of the National
Reconnaissance Office (NRO) wants that agency to set up a highly
classified office to spearhead advanced research.

The commission also concluded that the NRO -- arguably the largest
intelligence agency in the United States in budget terms -- should
outsource more of its satellite intelligence from commercial
companies.

The National Commission for the Review of the NRO recommended that an
Office of Space Reconnaissance be established that would be granted
top-secret procurement status, with oversight by only the highest
levels of government.

The plan is drawing criticism from some groups, who warn that
increasing the secretive nature, scope, and budget of the NRO without
instituting new accountability measures is risky.
