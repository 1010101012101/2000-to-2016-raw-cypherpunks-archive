Most of the security features of a dollar bill are not directed
toward the serial number; they are designed to prevent changing the
denomination, or to increase the cost of creating a real-looking bill
from scratch.  Changing the serial number is likely to be fairly
straightforward.

For this to be secure, you would have to keep the serial number a
secret; and in that case, the paper could be any piece of paper with
a secret written on it.
