Intel confirms future PC products to use Wave TCPA

The bouncer at the Trusted Computing ball turns up again

By Mike Magee: Monday 07 April 2003, 14:44

THE COMPANY that showed off its Trust Suite products at the Intel Developer 
Forum in February now indeed has the backing of the chip giant.

Wave said it will demo its Embassy Trust Suite apps across different 
"trusted" computer types at the RSA Security 2003 trade show, which starts 
mid April.

Intel is giving the imprimature to Wave using its Trusted Platform Module 
(TPM), which we've dealt with at some length in another article today.

TPM  claims Intel  is a "root of trust" semiconductor device, otherwise 
known as Fritz. Wave and Intel will show the Document Manager app on three 
systems, with a digitally signed document "signed" and then archived by 
each of the "trusted" platforms.

An Intel representative said that it was important "that OEMs and the 
industry in general... deliver these TPM services.. that will be deployed 
over the next few years". Nancy Sumrall, who is the "safer computing 
initiative manager" of the desktop division at Intel "bring a whole new 
level of value to the PC platform".

Meanwhile, Wave claimed it will be the first company to deliver 
interoperable and secure PC services on the industry's "leading trusted 
platforms".

The TCPA compliant solution and the suite will also be shown at the RSA 
conference, Wave said. 5
