  >>>>Second, I'm thinking that there's a problem here regarding
consistency.  If I have a material expenditure or liability (or, I suppose,
revenue or income or investment) that may appropriately be kept secret
under Section 78m(b)(3), then doesn't it follow logically that I will also
exclude it from the financials I file with my 10Ks and 8Ks, etc.?
Otherwise there will be a material mismatch between two publicly filed
financial statements by the same company for the same period.<<<<

  >>-The exemption covers those documents too.  Section 78m(b)(3) excuses
non-compliance only with Section 78m(b)(2) - BUT that is itself the
statutory authority for MOST of the SEC-required filings - including 10-Ks,
10-Qs, annual reports, Sarbanes-Oxley certification requirements, etc.  --
I should have made that more clear.  Most all of the '34 Act (which covers
publicly traded companies) rules are from 17 CFR Part 240 - and 78m(b)2 is
the authority for most of those rules.<<

  So: Bottom line: If AT&T (or Verizon) got paid $1 billion from the spooks
to do something, but got the right directive, they could simply not
disclose that revenue on any SEC filing.  Or, if they did something that
exposed them to liability -- like violating relevant customer privacy
requirements, and their normal obligation would be to disclose the
liability and make a reserve for it, they just don't have to.

  If that's right, at the moment it seems to me that the shareholders of
those companies are awfully exposed, aren't they....?
