Wait. You are using vague popular press FUD about RSA to promote a
website hosted JS encryption tool? Really?

Your code generates random values like this:

	sjcl.random.addEntropy([a.x || a.clientX || a.offsetX || 0, a.y ||
a.clientY || a.offsetY || 0], 2, "mouse")
	sjcl.random.addEntropy((new Date).valueOf(), 2, "loadtime")
try {
    var s = new Uint32Array(32);
    crypto.getRandomValues(s);
    sjcl.random.addEntropy(s, 1024, "crypto['getRandomValues']")
} catch (t) {}

Meaning that if it's used someplace where crypto.getRandomValues()
doesn't exist, it has only pure snake-oil-extract randomness.

Really????

If the randomness is poor, the nonce used in ECDSA will be predictable
and the private key will be recoverable.

This isn't to say I've audited any of it, I just grepped for a couple
likely mistakes. Part of the JS code has been whitespace compressed, I
consider it unauditable.

So, not implemented in slow-as-dirt JS 200,000 iterations should take
a random desktop cpu about 100ms or so. This is hardly wopping. It's
not far from the minimum I'd start with, for all keys not just weak
ones.  Generally user provided keys are a security disaster and should
be avoided wherever it's possible, strengthening or no. Humans are
horrific entropy sources and really can't self assess how bad they
are.
