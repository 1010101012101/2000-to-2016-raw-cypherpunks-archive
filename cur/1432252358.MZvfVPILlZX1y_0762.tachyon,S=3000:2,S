I enjoy a scene from a recent Bond film - where James is called on the 
telephone whilst he is in a compromising position with an academic at 
Cambridge University. He suavely navigates the telephone call, and when 
finished, his female companion remarks "James, you were always a such 
cunning linguist". My memory of the scene may differ slightly, but hopefully 
you pick up the play on words. The academic was a languages specialist, and 
if course, she was gorgeous.
