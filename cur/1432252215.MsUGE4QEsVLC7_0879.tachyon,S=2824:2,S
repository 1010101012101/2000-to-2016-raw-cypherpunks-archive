So when the physicists were discussing fission in the 40's,
and some didn't want it to be used for bombs, did it matter? 

Nope.  They were finding out something about reality, and others
would find out too; and once physics is known the possible applications
follow.

Your "morals" don't affect reality any more than they persuade 
others.  If you're the first to discover something, you can sit
on it, this is your only power.  But guess what: others will come.  If
Einstein had stayed a patent clerk we'd still have fission by now.

Anonymity and anonymous cash are fundamentals.  AP is an application.
Bell, Chaum, etc. can be silenced.  Reality can't.
