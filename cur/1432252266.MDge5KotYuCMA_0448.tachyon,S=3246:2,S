Because that system gott r00ted long ago.

We live in a country that is governed by how prosecutors feel about the

The game is rigged by the people running it.

We don't have a fair legal system any more.  It is more like a carny game
and the common folk are the rubes who get taken.

Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
