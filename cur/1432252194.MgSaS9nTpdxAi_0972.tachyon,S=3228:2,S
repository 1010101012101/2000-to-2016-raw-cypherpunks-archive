Anonymity without Cryptography (2001)

Abstract: This paper presents an encryption-free anonymizing network that 
is efficient to use, and does not require the use of conventional 
cryptography by the users of the network. The method, Anonymous Multi Party 
Computation (AMPC), uses a variation of Chaum's mixnets that utilizes value-
splitting to hide inputs, and hence requires no "conditionally-secure" 
operations of its users. This is achieved under the assumption that there 
are secure channels between good participants, and under a suitable 
resilience threshold assumption that, in our worst adversarial scenario, is 
a square-root of the system. Our new paradigm provides users electronic 
privacy without trusting any computer to perform heavy cryptographic 
operations on their behalf in various applications, e.g., electronic voting.
