It's so difficult for the layperson to find affordable replacements for
those older machines, unfortunately.

I was running X11 on a 386DX40 with 5MB of RAM for quite a while.  It
was slower than a dog with no legs.  Eventually I had some SIMMs go bad,
and they were too expensive to replace, so I ended up investing in a
newer computer instead.
