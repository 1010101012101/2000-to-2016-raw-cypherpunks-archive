	That is possible, but is there evidence of that actually happening, in the 
case of freedom hosting?

	Hadn't fh been running for a couple of years, like silk road? (or more?) - 
If fh's security was so lousy the so called authorities should have got him 
(way) sooner?

	Yes, I realize that pwning the server through a PHP exploit or the like is 
far easier - The main reason I see that explanation as not fully 
satisfactory is that the attack (if it was possible) was not tried sooner.
