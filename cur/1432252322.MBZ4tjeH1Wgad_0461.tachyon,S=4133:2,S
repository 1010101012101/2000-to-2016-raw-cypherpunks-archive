But beware:  In the US we no longer have the rule of law.  It is now the
norm for prosecutors to charge politically incorrect defendants under novel
interpretations of old crimes.  Thus, for example, if someone on Cypherpunks
were to respond to one of these requests with detailed step-by-step
instructions for constructing a simple pipe bomb, that person should not be
surprised to be facing conspiracy or accessory charges in the event the
instructions were followed and the bomb constructed.  Despite lacking the
criminal intent or criminal "meeting of minds" required to support such
charges, a guilty verdict would be unsurprising.  No it's not fair, no it's
not justice, but there it is.
