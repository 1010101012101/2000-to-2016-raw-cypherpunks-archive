It's fun to imagine this in the context of a normal crime....

Prosecutor: "We will show that the defendant was seen in the company of 
some people who were believed to have been planning to consider going over 
to South Central, where they might have joined up with the Crips and 
eventually tried to shoot at some police officers.  As it turned out, they 
didn't make it to South Central (they got lost), and if they had, the Crips 
would probably have robbed them and sent them scurrying home, but it's 
clear that these people would have been up to no good, if only they'd been 
competent enough to manage it.  As evidence, we submit this copy of the 
Autobiography of Malcolm X, and these five rap CDs, found in a midnight 
raid on his house.  We're requesting the death penalty."
