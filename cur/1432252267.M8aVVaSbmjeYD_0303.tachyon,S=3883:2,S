The Germans report that Ata and others planned the
attacks while at an electrical engineering school in
Germany and so far no connection to bin Laden has
been found.

That a small, smart, talented group could conceive and
carry out the attacks may be inconceivable to those who
believe in massive, overwhelming power, is apt indication
of the long-livenedness of those who just don't buy
the effectiveness of guerillas working in tiny cells and
executing non-heirachical operations.

The oft-cited Clauzewitz and Lao Tsu have misled planners 
now for a generation, a generation hoping to erase Viet Nam,
Cuba, Ceylon, and a plethora of asymmetrical victories.

"Lessons learned," is a favorite phrase now used by
giant organizations to figure out why best laid plans
failed. Still, the giant organizations continue to perpetuate
themselves by arguing the virtues of massive retaliation
and minimizing their ineffectivenss at prevention of what
they rush to avenge, wildly attacking targets but never
reaching disappearing attackers hiding in the underbrush 
near homebases.

Whether the lessons learned in this case will prevent
massive overwhelming attacks on foreign and domestic
innocents is a lesson yet to be learned, and learned, and 
learned. But no matter what, the display of force will give 
comfort to scared shitless believers in idiotic concepts 
of good and evil hiding venal intentions.

Would Clinton have APed bin Laden if the disappearing
devil was found hiding in NY's Metropolitan Detention Center
or elsewhere in the USA or Germany under a false dentity?

Who's allegedly under house arrest in Afghanistan? Not 
Osama, who is nowhere near where the oil pipelines are to 
be built. See the UK Ministry of Defense's analysis of why
an Afghan coup is needed to update the overthrow of
Iran by MI6 and CIA in 1953:
