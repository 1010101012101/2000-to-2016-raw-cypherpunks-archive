About National Healthcare Logistics Inc.:
National Healthcare Logistics, Inc. was launched in 1997 as a company 
promoting a new design 
for the healthcare supply chain. NHLG is a service provider to 
multi-hospital systems commonly 
referred to as Integrated Healthcare Delivery Networks or "IDN". The 
first "logistics model" 
for IDN concentrated on reengineering the flow of all routinely 
purchased supplies by setting 
up a dedicated distribution facility that became the sole source of such 
supplies for the IDN 
healthcare facilities. By so doing, NHLG provided a vehicle that made 
supply replenishment 
vastly more efficient and provided cost cutting opportunities that were 
thought unattainable. 
LeeSar was the very first project for NHLG, beginning back in 1998, and 
continuing its mission 
to the current day to serve its prestigious hospital systems or IDN that 
created LeeSar in 1998. 
LeeSar is a cooperative owned by Lee Memorial in Fort Myers and Sarasota 
Memorial in Sarasota.
