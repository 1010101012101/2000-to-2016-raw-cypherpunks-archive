I'm certainly not naive enough to think that any human behavior can be
stamped out with laws or what have you. I'm just saying that online
communication is easier to control by far than e.g. drug trade. It may be
that anonymous markets develop. But I think governments have the necessary
motivation and resources to keep them extremely marginalized.  Enough so
that most people will never notice.

It's not about who can be controlled, but what.
