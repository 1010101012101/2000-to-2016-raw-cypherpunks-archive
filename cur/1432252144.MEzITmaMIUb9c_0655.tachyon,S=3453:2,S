	No, I don't. I've looked at it a couple times, and even set on up once, but never announced it or did anything with it. 

	You imply that the bandwidth requirements are "not" trivial? What's "not" trivial? 128k? That's my home.  512k A phone call to Sprint away (which admittedly would take longer than the helo-refueling).

	Would a cable modem do it? 

	How's about on an account in an employee rack at a major co-location facility with dual gig pipes? 

	I have ready access to 2 of those, and the other 2 are only a matter of breaking loose with a little more cash (although I would hate to get cable). 

	So why don't I run one now? Hassle. Time. I'd rather go riding or shooting than deal with it.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such 
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
