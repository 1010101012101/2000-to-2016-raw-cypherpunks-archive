All the laptops I've used in the last 6 years (IBM, Compaq, Dell) have
had built-in hotkeys to switch from LCD, LCD+CRT, CRT. Monitors attached
to the VGA port while the laptops were in LCD-only mode consistently
blinked their messages for "No video source".

APM (which virtually all current PCs support) allows for monitor blanking,
suspend, and powerdown. XFree86 and Windows support these functions.
