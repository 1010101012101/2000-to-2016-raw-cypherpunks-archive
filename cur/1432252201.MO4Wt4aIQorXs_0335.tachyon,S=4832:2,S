Israel Kills Palestinian Boys, 
Steals Organs For Transplants
Teheran Times.com
1-9-2

AL-KHALIL (IRNA) - The Zionist state has tacitly admitted that doctors at the 
Israeli forensic institute at Abu Kabir had extracted the vital organs of 
three Palestinian teenage children killed by the Israeli Army nearly ten days 
ago.   

Zionist Minister of Health Nessim Dahhan said in response to a question by 
Arab member of the Zionist Parliament 'Knesset', Ahmed Teibi, on Tuesday that 
he couldn't deny that organs of Palestinian youths and children killed by the 
Israeli forces were taken out for transplants or scientific research.   

"I couldn't say for sure that something like that (taking out the organs) 
didn't happen."   
Teibi said he had received credible evidence proving that Israeli doctors at 
the forensic institute extracted such vital organs as the heart, kidneys, and 
liver from the bodies of Palestinian youths and children killed by the 
Israeli Army in Gaza and the West Bank.   
The Israeli authorities normally detain the bodies of martyred Palestinians 
for a few days without any explanation.   

The Israeli Army on December 30 killed three Palestinian boys, aged 14-15 
near Khan Younis in unclear circumstances.   

The army issued conflicting reports on the killing, while Palestinian sources 
charged that Israeli troops murdered the three unarmed boys in cold blood.   

The bodies of the three boys were handed over to the Palestinians for burial 
on 6 January.   

However, shortly before burial, Palestinian medical authorities examined the 
bodies and found out that the main vital organs were missing from the bodies. 
  

The Israeli media have nearly completely ignored the affair.   (IRNA)
