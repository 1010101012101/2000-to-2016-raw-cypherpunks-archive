 through a variety of processes in dealing with bombs, but it also serves=
 as a tribute to the career experiences of author Thomas Brodie, a retire=
d captain of the Metro Dade (Florida) Police Department who has disposed =
of thousands of bombs and investigated hundreds of explosions. Filled wit=

 would equally serve the experienced security practitioner and the novice=
=2E<P>Topics covered include bomb disposal, training, equipment, bomb typ=
es and characteristics, search operations, investigations, and bomb prote=
ction. The several checklists included, such as one on bomb disposal proc=
edures, are a valuable resource for security planners.<P>Brodie's work de=
lves into the characteristics of explosives, containers, and devices. It =
also explores how bombs are delivered and how they explode. Though a some=
what dry and technical how-to manual, the book is punctuated with enough =
lists, charts, and photographs to make it an easy read. Every aspect of b=
ombs and bombings is covered and, where more material may be needed on sp=
ecific topics, resources are listed.<P>It is critical for all security pr=
ofessionals charged with emergency response to be constantly prepared, an=
d Brodie stresses training and other precautionary measures throughout th=
is work. He takes the reader through a history of training development an=
d provides resources related to the current standard.<P>To effectively de=
al with bombs and bombings, it is important to take the mystery out of th=
em. Brodie accomplishes that task through plain language. This book is th=
e first step in ensuring preparedness for bombings and bomb threats. It w=

M><P>For security professionals and electronic hobbyists interested in bu=
ilding electronic surveillance and countermeasure equipment, this book pr=
ovides detailed schematic diagrams and construction information. The auth=
or effectively compiles technical information that would allow a reader w=
ith moderate knowledge to assemble rudimentary devices. While countermeas=
ures are covered, however, the author focuses on the "offensive" uses of =
surveillance. What is more, although the book is informative and <BR>the =
author clearly knows his stuff, much of the information is available else=
where and cannot truly be considered state of the art.<P>The book covers =
traditional surveillance devices at the expense of current technological =
issues such as cellular telephone interception or fax transmission interc=
eption. While the author discusses some CCTV issues, he never addresses i=
ssues relevant to new or emerging security technologies, such as the incr=
easingly popular CCTV systems that allow installation of a camera anywher=
e there is access to a telephone line or a cellular phone.<P>While the bo=
ok's information will help build a solid foundation for those interested =
in traditional technologies, a forward-looking approach would have improv=
ed it vastly.<P><EM>Reviewer: David W. McCoy, CPP, is a security professi=

pub/ncsc.html</a>; 147 pages; $20.</EM><P>Concise, well-written, and easy=
 to understand, this latest revision of <EM>Guidelines for Cargo Security=
 and Loss Control</EM> is a fine reference book for cargo security profes=
sionals and terminal management. It will also help shipper and consignee =
judge a transportation company's efforts to secure goods in transit.<P>Ea=
ch of the eight chapters and four appendices is organized so that all lev=
els of readers can get what they need from it. The outline approach offer=
s a roadmap to subject matter of interest. For example, the book makes it=
 easy to learn quickly about such topics as the vulnerability of cargo, t=
he dynamics of the shipping industry, and the various ways freight in tra=
nsit can be attacked. Readers unfamiliar with rail, air freight, or conta=
iner operations will receive a primer on those topics.<P>Although it omit=
s some detail at times, the guide provides a good basis for establishing =
or modifying a cargo security program, exploring issues such as barrier s=
eal selection, sentry dog use, and cargo loss reporting. The book is prob=
ably best used by cargo security professionals as a checklist to ensure t=
hat facilities in their charge are complying with industry standards. An =
excerpt is available <a href=3D"000302.html">online</a> in the Reading Ro=
om.<P><EM>Reviewer: Michael E. Kozak is manager, corporate security servi=

tion Source, 800/971-2447 (phone), 800/866-4875 (fax); 23-minute videotap=
e, 30-minute audiotape, and 94-page guide; $195. (Editor's note: The audi=
otape and book became available after the release of the videotape and we=
re not considered in this review.)</EM><P>How much more can be said about=
 workplace violence with the glut of material on the market? Enough, actu=
ally, to produce this entertaining and informative video: a docudrama-sty=
le primer suitable for creating security awareness among corporate person=
nel and for helping management banish threats, violence, and harassment.<=
P>Citing the National Safe Workplace Institute and the FBI recognition an=
d risk criteria, the video enables the security novice to identify proble=
m employees and put a systematic solution in place. The video updates the=
 traditional advisory triumvirate of doctor, lawyer, and clergyman by rep=
lacing the pastor with a policeman and adding a workplace violence consul=
tant to the mix. The experts pool their wisdom to help the viewer develop=
 measures to identify, prevent, and contain violence, liability, and cost=
s.<P>For example, attorney Sandra Fanning explains in concise layman's la=
nguage how companies can limit liability for negligent hiring and neglige=
nt retention. Besides well-known measures such as antiviolence programs, =
she advocates preemptive techniques such as securing temporary restrainin=
g orders from local courts. This measure provides the prospective perpetr=
ator with a forum to vent his or her concerns. It also drives home the gr=
avity of the situation to the employee and staff.<P>The video focuses on =
larger corporations. For example, the producers suggest that businesses e=
stablish an antiviolence committee containing eight members--including a =
public relations specialist, a clinical psychologist, and a safety and he=
alth specialist--several of which smaller businesses couldn't afford to r=
etain. But smaller companies may be able to adopt some of these ideas in =
a modified format--consolidating some positions and buying high-priced ex=
pertise on a per diem basis through contract services.<P>Corporate execut=
ives and security neophytes alike should view this video for an overview =
of workplace violence. The video also serves as an excellent refresher fo=
r security professionals and as a top-notch training tool.<P><EM>Reviewer=

Information: A Manager's Guide. </STRONG><EM>By James A. Schweitzer; publ=
ished by Butterworth-Heinemann; available from ASIS, 703/522-5800 (phone)=
, 703/525-2694 (fax); 199 pages; $35 (ASIS members), $38 (nonmembers).</E=
M><P>In an era of fierce corporate competition, diminishing employee loya=
lty, and widespread computer use, information protection is more critical=
 than ever. Using case examples, this book convincingly makes that argume=
nt and sets out methods and management techniques to help an organization=
 establish and maintain an effective information security program.<P>Be i=
t through an imprudent utterance, an unprotected network, or a sloppy fil=
ing system, valuable information can leak out in an infinite variety of w=
ays, as author James Schweitzer makes clear. In one case, for example, an=
 engineer drew ideas for a critical machinery component on a tablecloth i=
n a restaurant. Another customer, seeking that information, bought the ta=
blecloth from the restaurant owner.<P>Schweitzer analyzes the types of th=
reats and the levels of vulnerabilities, from the high-tech (hacker attac=
ks) to the no-tech (employee chitchat). Another helpful chapter discusses=
 establishing proprietary rights to information through trade secrets, co=
pyrights, and patents. The reader also learns how to classify levels of i=
nformation.<P>Additional chapters deal with the threat posed by copiers, =
fax machines, and other office equipment and the vulnerability of communi=
cation applications such as electronic data interchanges. With the prolif=
eration of pagers and cellular phones, however, the author might have add=
ressed information exposures created by these devices.<P>In less than 200=
 pages, the author succeeds in defining the problem of information insecu=
rity and arming the reader with the tools to get an information protectio=
n program going. The book serves not only security managers seeking to es=
tablish such a program but also those who want to put their own to the te=
st.<P><EM>Reviewer: Daniel L. Hoppe, Jr., is corporate loss prevention ma=
nager for Dominick's Finer Foods, Inc., Northlake, Illinois. He has many =
