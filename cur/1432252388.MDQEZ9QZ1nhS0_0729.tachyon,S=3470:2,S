>>Date: Fri, 21 Dec 2001 18:10:20 -0800
>>MIME-Version: 1.0
>>
>>Famed hacker Kevin Mitnick is also General Class radio amateur N6NHG. In 
>>December 1999 he applied to renew his ham license, but today the FCC 
>>designated the application for hearing, to determine whether he has the 
>>requisite character to remain a licensee. Mitnick or his attorney will 
>>have to appear before an administrative law judge (ALJ) if he wants to 
>>save the license.
>>
>>ALJ hearings in the amateur service are rare. They normally are reserved 
>>for flagrant cases. The FCC does not allege that Mitnick misused his ham 
>>license; it was enough that he was convicted of felonies.
>>
>>The hearing designation order (FCC 01-359, Docket WT 01-344) cites a 
>>couple of other high-profile ham license revocation cases, including Herb 
>>Schoenbohm, an FCC critic from the US Virgin Islands who reputedly 
>>misused telephone calling cards; and L.D. Brewer, a radio pirate and 
>>mail-order transmitter dealer (http://www.ldbrewer.com).
>>
>>The FCC is extremely tenacious in these cases and I think there is little 
>>chance that Kevin will retain his license.
