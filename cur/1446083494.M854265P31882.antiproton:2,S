You're absolutely right.  We USians (or Americunts, as Juan says, which 
always makes me laugh in agreement), only have propaganda "textbooks" in 
school.  It's not unless/until we are fortunate enough to stumble upon 
Howard Zinn's books or develop critical thinking skills, despite their best 
efforts at indoctrination, that we truly see.

I'm not sure how seriously to take Russia-insider as I haven't looked into 
it enough, but this would hardly be surprising.  They were still on a roll 
from taking out the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mossadeq, in 
1953.  How many years was it before this was common knowledge?

It's despicable.  Now, as then.

(I don't often comment on politics.  Feeling sassy tonight, I guess.  Heh.)
