First, "safety glass" is said to be "safety" because it tends to hold 
together instead of shattering into shards. It's not Lexan.

Second, anyone who has spent time in a wrecking yard knows things go 
through safety glass all the time.

Third, those of us who are old enough remember that Jayne Mansfield's 
head went right through the safety glass.

Fourth, disputing Choate about the physics of safety glass is as 
pointless as arguing with him over Gauss's Theorem, prime numbers, 
the First Amendment, the history of Europe, law, or anything else he 
has his peculiarly indisyncratic views about.

Fifth, if someone is trying to throw a fire extinguisher through 
either my front window or my side windows, I'm going to defend 
myself. I expect no less from the carabinieri.
