If you've never read them or even heard of them, I highly recommend them.
Whether you dismiss him or think there's something worth listening, the
Nosenko / Golitsyn permanently affair changed U.S. intelligence (not to
mention the JFK and Watergate connections).

New Lies For Old: http://www.spiritoftruth.org/newlies4old.pdf
The Perestroika Deception:
http://www.spiritoftruth.org/The_Perestroika_Deception.pdf

In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994),
Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139
had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were
'not soon falsifiable'.

Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western
intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett, and
the former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified
Golitsyn as "the most valuable defector ever to reach the West". However,
the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an
"unreliable conspiracy theorist". Andrew believes that although
intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global
political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable.
New Lies for Old

In 1984, Golitsyn published the book *New Lies For Old*, wherein he warned
about a long-term deception <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception> strategy
of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into
a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and
diplomatically isolate the United States
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States>. Among other things, Golitsyn
stated:
"The "liberalization" would be spectacular and impressive. Formal
pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's
role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation
of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might
be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power,
and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party
might well be separated. The KGB would be "reformed." Dissidents at home
would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and
some would take up positions of leadership in government.Sakharov might be
included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The
creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the
writers' unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more
independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to
nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or
more alternative political parties.There would be greater freedom for
Soviet citizens to travel. Western and Unitized Nations observers would be
invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action."

Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F.
Buckley, Jr. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.> (who
once worked for the CIA) in writing *New Lies for Old*. Buckley refused but
later went on to write a novel about Angleton, *Spytime: The Undoing of
James Jesus Angleton*.
The Perestroika Deception

In 1995 he published a book containing purported memoranda attributed to
Golitsyn entitled *The Perestroika
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika> Deception* which claimed:

   - "The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that
   exists and will continue between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of
   [the] 'independent' republics."
   - "The power of the KGB remains as great as ever... Talk of cosmetic
   changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to
   support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."
   - "Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and
   'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be
   found secret Party members or KGB agents."
