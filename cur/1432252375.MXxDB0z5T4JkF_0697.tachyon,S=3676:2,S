You are absolutely correct.  From a human-rights point of view, 
that is exactly the problem.  There are now thought-crimes.  

However, just because the law happens to be wrong, does not mean 
that specious crap can prevent a conviction on it in court.  It says 
that "circumvention devices" are illegal, and the opinion of the 
court is that code -- source *or* executable -- is a "device".  
At the same time, it says that other information, which promotes 
*understanding*, but which is not a "device", is legal. At least 
for now.

You can argue about gray areas and fine points all you want in 
this forum, but if your butt lands in court it will be dismissed 
as specious crap.
