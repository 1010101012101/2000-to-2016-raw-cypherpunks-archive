Every SCIF has a unique identification (UID) based on its full
spectrum of construction materials, dimensions and MEP
characteristics. Each compromises itself by inadvertent
signals, or rather signals not usually or easily intercepted.
Same for each building and building site above and below
the surface.

Conventional SCIF design characteristics which are in the
public domain do not cover the full spectrum, typically
only the EM. Like CryptoAG and other ruses, SCIFs are
quite collectible behind the EM mask.

Similarly, TEMPEST characteristics which are in the public
domain do not cover the full spectrum of collectible
signals and metrics of compromising emanations.

Some similarity to lie detection ruses.

There are likely other ruses, as customary comsec
disinformation hardly restricted to crypto.

Now could that be what BadBIOS is up to? A leak of
disinfo for those which have limited interception and
analysis equipment? Still, it is a fine story about the many
levels of comsec onion ot be peeled.
