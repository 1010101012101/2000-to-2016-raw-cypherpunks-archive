so would this not break the physics model already, of faster than light info,
such that the cosmos may operate on principles beyond those employed.

the comments on the article seemingly indicative of this same scenario,
as if a realm of political science, gerrymandering of physics seemingly.

if a spin could be remotely connected to another, as mentioned in the
article comments, and activated at a distance, could this not function
as a basic switch, perhaps making a relay or gate or some kind or the
ability to send/receive coded messages via morse code (as mentioned).

say, a sequence of spins encoding the alphabet or whatever, perhaps
controlled by a normal computer process yet transmitted/received via
this quantum connectivity (seemingly out of this world then back into it
via vibration, rather than a line of sight acoustic signal, if understanding)

i thought that was the idea underneath the potential for other, hidden
technology embedded in existing systems, that remote relationship
via quantum properties that operate in other dimensionality/structures,
if not beyond lightspeed properties or conceptions, and that it may not
be recognizable in the existing approach or computational paradigm.
such that fiber may not be necessary, the approach to key exchange
or processing may occur in other parameters or functional structures.
