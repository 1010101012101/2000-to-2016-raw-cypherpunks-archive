	This may have been a state law in Missouri, but I swear I 
heard reference to a similar law in Illinois. I would be surprised 
that it was not the case in the peoples republic of California.

	*ALL* hospitals are required to provide at least 
stabilization and transport to an appropriate facility to critically 
wounded or ill patients.

	The are not required to admit them for inpatient treatment, 
but they are not allowed to let them die in the street either.

	These kinds of laws are good in at least one respect--they 
make sure that if you forget your insurance credentials, or are 
otherwise unable to present them, you get treated anyway.
