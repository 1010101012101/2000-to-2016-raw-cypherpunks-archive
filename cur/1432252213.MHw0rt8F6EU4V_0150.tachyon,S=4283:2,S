No expectation of privacy is too high. Just as the police are
"artificially" allowed to spy on people by being funded through public
monies that allow them manpower and equipment, they can be
"artificially" commanded to piss off. One artifice deserves another.

Allowing selective use of technology does seem to be a bad idea - it's
usually the authorities who are selected as allowed and anyone else
incarcerated after being economically destroyed. If we allow IR imaging
without restriction there will be legal precendents required and even
some economic benefits.

The fact of a higher than average electric bill or a heat source unlike
heat sources in similar buildings must be found to be evidence of
nothing beyond the use of electricity and subsequent generation of heat.
Zero justification for a search warrant.

The benny will be a whole new industry to make clothing with a high
metallic content. This would also work as a counter to the mm wave
imaging that has been around since the 80's and seems to be going
mainstream.
