JUINA MINING CORPORATION

Ticker Symbol: GEMM


JMC OWNS A 49% INTEREST IN THE DIAMOND MINING PROJECT "PROPERTY 
1000" LOCATED IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF JUINA IN 
THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL. JMC RECENTLY COMPLETED A 
FINANCING PACKAGE FOR $750,000 WITH THEIR NEW 
JOINT VENTURE PARTNER.
THE MINERAL RIGHTS CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 1000 HECTARES (2471 
ACRES), ORIGINALLY ONE OF THREE KEY 
PROPERTIES CONTROLLED BY DE BEERS IN THE MID 1970'S TO THE MID 1990'S.  
THE JUINA REGION IS KNOWN AS THE LARGEST DIAMOND PRODUCING AREA IN 
BRAZIL.
JMC AND THEIR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER (EAG) HAVE A PILOT TREATMENT 
PLANT ON SITE.
JMC HAS DELINEATED A RESOURCE OF ABOUT 1,000,000 CUBIC METERS OF 
SLOPE AND TERRACE GRAVELS WHILE 
CONDUCTING AN AUGERING AND PITTING PROGRAM IN 1998 AND 1999.  THIS 
WORK WAS CONDUCTED ON APPROXIMATELY 
20% OF THE PROPERTY. JMC CARRIED OUT A MAGNETIC GROUND SURVEY, 
WHICH REVEALED 4 DISTINCT ANOMALIES THAT 
HAVE A KIMBERLITE SIGNATURE.
ANOMALY K3 WAS PITTED AND A "MASSA" WAS DISCOVERED WHICH APPEARS 
TO BE A WEATHERED KIMBERLITIC MATERIAL.  
THE PIT YIELDED 1005 CARATS OF DIAMONDS.
THE PROPERTY 1000 IS KNOWN TO CONTAIN MANY HIGH VALUE PINK 
DIAMONDS. RECENT SITE VISIT IN DECEMBER 2000 BY 
THE SENIOR GEOLOGIST FOR EAG WITH 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING 
CHIEF OF NUMEROUS EXPLORATION 
PROJECTS FOR DE BEERS STATED THAT, "WHEREEVER HE WENT ON THE 
PROPERTY, IT WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR ALL THE 
DIAMONDIFEROUS GRAVELS, AS EVIDENCED FROM GARIMPERO AREAS (LOCAL 
ARTISAN MINERS), ACTIVITIES, AND WASHING 
SITES ARE LACED WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF KIMBERLITIC HEAVY SATELITE 
OR ACCOMPANYING MINERALS". 
THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED WERE THAT THE PROSPECTS REGARDING A 
COMMERCIAL ALLUVIAL, ELUVIAL, AND COLLUVIAL 
VENTURE ON THE CLAIM 1000 ARE EXTREMELY POSITIVE AND PERHAPS BETTER 
THEN PROBABLE.  "THE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS 
ARE TIED CLOSELY TO KIMBERLITIC SOURCES AS EVIDENCED BY LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF KIMBERLITIC ILMENITE PRESENT IN THE 
CONCENTRATES.  THE AMOUNTS SEEN GO WELL BEYOND ALL MY EARLIER 
EXPERIENCES ON THE SUBJECT".   A PAYABLE 
PRODUCTION FROM KIMBERLITE APPEARS TO BE BETTER IN THE JUINA AREA IN 
GENERAL, AND ON THE PROPERTY 1000 IN 
PARTICULAR THEN THEY ARE FOR THE OTHER DIAMONDIFEROUS AREAS OF 
BRAZIL. A TEAM OF GEOLOGIST AND 
TECHNICIANS WILL ARRIVE IN JUINA THE WEEK OF JANUARY 21ST TO 
COMMENCE WORK.
