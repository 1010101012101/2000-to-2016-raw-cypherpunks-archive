Actually, despite some of the fairly dubious "what about this!" points, 
there are some things that are a little unsettling. No way that's a Boeing 
757, and it's not like they can just lose one (ie, there should have been 
one unaccounted for). And I was unaware of the possibility that the FBI had 
quickly confiscated tapes that would show the 'plane' more clearly.

So for what it's worth...
