This is a really good article which has a bunch of interesting things to
say on it's way to saying that Hayek didn't go far enough, but it wasn't
his fault. :-).

For instance, how we ended up with nation-states (taxation is their only
reason for existence) and legislation (the use of taxation for
redistribution of assets by force in order to maintain social control), and
why political solutions to political power end up squaring the circle, as
it were.

Of course, he talks about "law as the force which allocates property
rights", and most cypherpunks would dispute that, knowing of better,
cryptographic ways of allocating control of property.

Cheers,
RAH
