Internet Security and Privacy Special Events
 
Software Development Forum Special Events

July 31st Event

A decade ago, Philip R. Zimmermann released an encryption program, 
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  For that, the Federal government charged 
him with violations of the Arms Export Control Act for munitions 
trafficking.  The government held that U.S. national security was 
jeopardized when PGP was spread around the world as free encryption 
software.  The case against Phil Zimmermann continued for three 
years. Without a paid staff, without a company to stand behind it, 
without sufficient funding, and despite government persecution, PGP 
became the most widely used email encryption software in the world. 
The feds eventually dropped their case against Phil Zimmermann.

Phil Zimmermann will make a rare appearance on Tuesday, July 31st in 
San Francisco to talk about encryption and the federal government's 
attempts to control the free speech of programmers through the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Mr. Zimmermann will also 
discuss the OpenPGP email encryption standard alliance, the future of 
public key encryption, and answer questions from the audience.

Purpose

We are bringing in leading experts in many aspects of Internet 
Security and Privacy to discuss how to protect yourself and your 
customers against attacks over the Internet.  They will explain which 
threats you should pay attention to first, and how to reduce your 
risk.  

Organized by Montebello Partners and PaperlessInvoice, our three 
special events will focus on the technologies for public key 
infrastructure, securing credit card information and transactions, 
and securing your network against intrusion with firewalls and 
virtual private networks.  Our speakers will provide a top-level view 
of best security practices, as well as practical technical advice on 
designing, implementing, and managing secure systems.

In addition, these events are a great opportunity to meet your 
colleagues who are also building and administering the latest 
Internet systems.  Find out what malicious activity others have 
encountered, and what they're doing about it.

Please join us, and bring your questions and experiences to share.  

For further information, visit our web page, or email our organizers 
Ames Cornish (ames@montebellopartners.com) or Ira Victor 
(irav@degrees.com) with questions, comments, or suggestions.
