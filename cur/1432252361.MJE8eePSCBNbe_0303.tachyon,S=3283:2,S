Yes, that would work nicely as the outside sheet.

I would bet that there is SOMETHING that is dissolved by liquid freon.
Just mark your letters with the stuff and look for the integrity of the
mark at the other end.

The USPS won't be checking mail this way anytime soon. If they were they
would use some sort of freon recovery system to contain costs.

Oh, well, it will soon be time to go buy $2.95 stamps to pay for UV,
E-beam, freon and zoot suits.
