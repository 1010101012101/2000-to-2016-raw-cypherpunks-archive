With all the hoopla over the release of the final version of the Linux
2.4.0 kernel last week, Microsoft Corp.'s delivery of an interim beta
version of its Windows 2000 successor, code-named Whistler, got lost in
the shuffle.

 But according to Whistler testers, Microsoft issued build 2410 of its
next version of Windows on Thursday. New in this build are many
user-interface tweaks, as well as the incorporation of new anti-piracy
code.

...
No more casual copying?
The most potentially controversial addition to Whistler 2410, however,
is anti-piracy code that Microsoft is calling "Microsoft Product
Activation for Windows," (WPA) according to testers. The technology is
similar to the Office Activation Wizard that's part of Office 2000.

WPA will tie a Windows product key to one specific PC in order to reduce
casual copying. In order to "activate" it, a customer will send data
about the installation, such as product ID number and hardware
identifier, to a Microsoft-run license clearinghouse. The clearinghouse
won't allow the use of the customer's product key on a PC different from
the one originally activated.

 Microsoft plans to deliver WPA in all 32-bit versions of Whistler
except those sold to volume-licensing customers and the so-called
"Royalty OEM initial install images" provided to PC makers, said sources
close to the company. Microsoft is expected to add similar anti-piracy
technology to Office 10 and Visual Studio .Net, sources said.
