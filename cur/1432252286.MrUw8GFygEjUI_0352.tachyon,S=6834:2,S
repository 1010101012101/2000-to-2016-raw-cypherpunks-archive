Years ago, some people were warning that the NSA and other agencies were
monitoring *every* electronic communication, were running half of the TOR
nodes, had bribed crypto companies to insert weaknesses, and I don't know
what else. Real tin foil hat conspiracy nonsense.

Except it wasn't. Revelations from Snowden and others shows that not only
were the "nonsense" claims correct, they didn't go far enough.

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm going to be very cautious before
calling anything nonsense.
