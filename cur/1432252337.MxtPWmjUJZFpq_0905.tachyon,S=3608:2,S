I had _my_ supplies in place, not surprisingly.

A few words on possible threats.

Anthrax is a minor issue, except in big cities or other soft targets. 
(It could kill tens of thousands, but probably only in the aerosol wake.)

My real fear, so far unrealized, is a smallpox or influenza attack. 
Smallpox killed 300 million in the 1900s (hard to believe, but this is 
what experts are saying) and the flu in 1918 killed many millions just 
in the U.S. (including some of my relatives).

(The 1917-18 worldwide outbreak was believed to have been spread 
worldwide by returning troops from WW I. Note that the disease vectors 
of today are far more efficient.)

If I hear the slightest hint of an outbreak of any virulent disease, 
anywhere, I'll head out to the nearest supermarket, buy $300 worth of 
groceries, and then hunker down to ride it out.

As always, this is not a _prediction_, this is a statement about my 
personal approach to insurance and preparedness.
