Silliness. The name "cypherpunks" was a pun on "cyberpunks," a pun 
suggested by Jude Milhon, a woman writer for "Mondo 2000" at the time.

Being that there is no body which "decides" what our group is called, 
or even that it _is_ a group, saying that someone's pun on top of 
someone else's pun means some political ideology attached to 
degenerates like Sid Vicious, the Dead Kennedy's, etc., is pure 
silliness.

Whether even "cyberpunks" had anything substantive to do with the 
so-called punk music scene is debatable, but cypherpunks certainly did 
not. The political ideology of all musical "punks" I have met is 
decidedly leftist, and not in the way libertarians often like. Rather, 
the leftists of British socialism, of American Democrat statists, and 
of Trotskyites in general.

It was a pun on a pun, so to speak. Had someone come up with a funnier 
pun, something better than officious names like "Crypto Rights," that's 
probably what the loose association of folks would have been called. 
But no one did, so Jude's name stuck.

That Jim Choate is carrying the banner for leftie punkism is not at all 
surprising.
