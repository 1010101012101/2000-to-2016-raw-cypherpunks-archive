This is why people who don't know statistics should not be allowed to 
think... By no means is that number, by itself, of any significance 
whatsoever.  How many got canceled last election- one number I heard 
said 14,000.  If so then 19,000 is about what one would expect 
considering increased voter turnout and normal statistical 
fluctuations.  More importantly, the ballot was approved by both 
parties before the election took place.  If they didn't bitch then 
they don't have the right to bitch now.
