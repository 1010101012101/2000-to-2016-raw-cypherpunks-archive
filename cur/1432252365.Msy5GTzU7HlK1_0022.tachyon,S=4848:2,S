Oh, nobody's forcing you at gunpoint to follow any rules; thus,
there's no coercion involved, just social norms. Contrary to what you
say, shunning can take place for simply refusing to go along: If
someone repeatedly violates norms, it's a perfectly reasonable
response.

As for whether OK to be shunned, if folks want to shun me, I support
their right to do so. But, not being all that Choatian, I doubt they
will.
