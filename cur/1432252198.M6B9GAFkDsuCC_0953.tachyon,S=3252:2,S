Cypherpunks IQ Test #0:

Someone, purporting to be a woman, posts a series of questions
and rejoinders to cypherpunks. Do you:

a) beat your alpha-male chest for the attention of this beautiful
   young woman;
b) woo her/impress your friends with witty responses;
c) say "oh no, not again!";
d) Assume it is John Young turned Detweiler;
e) Try to work out who's behind it;
f) sotto voce "cypherpunks who answer silly tests need shooting"
or
g) all of the above, at various times.
