Consider these two reports: Bozo Ridge downplaying the weaponization
of the spores, contradicted by another source; and the Feebs
questioning NJ-mailbox-locals about knowing "chemists".

Makes one think the Quality is Very High and Ridge is lying.

We have always been at war with Oceania bin Laden.


In Washington, Ridge told reporters the anthrax analyzed in the United
States had not been ``weaponized,'' meaning it had not been manipulated
to
facilitate inhalation by potential victims.

Even so, one participant in a conference call for lawmakers said Robert
Gibbs, a Defense Department official, reported the anthrax was of
``relative
high quality'' and that ``there is an effort to downplay and not promote
the
abilities of the people doing this.'' The participant spoke on condition
of
anonymity.



Samantha Pae, 34, said she, her fiance, and her fiance's
mother were interviewed by FBI officers, who asked
them how long they had lived in the area and whether
they had noticed any suspicious activity or observed
vehicles with out-of-state plates. The agents also asked
them to provide their Social Security numbers, she said.

"They hit every house in the development area today,"
she said, adding that she had not seen any strange people
or unusual behavior. Charlotte Kaplan Piepszak, who has
lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, said FBI agents
asked similar questions of her.

"And then they asked if I knew any chemists," she said.
