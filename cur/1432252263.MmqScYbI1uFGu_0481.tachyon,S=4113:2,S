   Governor Calls for 'Cyber Court'

   WASHINGTON -- Malicious hackers, look out.
   
   A government anti-terrorism commission will recommend that Congress
   create a shadowy court to oversee investigations of suspected computer
   intruders.
   
   Gov. James Gilmore (R-Virginia), the commission's chairman, said
   Wednesday that federal judges have been far too sluggish in approving
   search warrants and eavesdropping of online miscreants.
   
   Instead, Gilmore told the House Science committee, the commission will
   recommend that a "cyber court" be created with extraordinary powers to
   authorize electronic surveillance and secret searches of suspected
   hackers' homes and offices.
   
   Police investigations are currently hamstrung by a lack of "effective
   procedures and understanding by many in the judiciary concerning the
   nature and urgency of cyber security," Gilmore said.

   [...]
   
   Gilmore offered few details on the proposal to create a hacker-court.
   A House press release says only that the commission will recommend the
   "establishment of a special 'Cyber Court' patterned after the court
   established in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act."
