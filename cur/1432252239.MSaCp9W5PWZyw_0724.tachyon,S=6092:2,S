coinspot.io and indacoin.com was blocked too, so it's 5 websites.

Quote from the judgment posted by RKN:

"As article 27 of Federal law "On Central bank of Russian Federation"
says, official monetary unit (currency) of Russian Federation is ruble.
Introduction others monetary units and issuing money surrogates on the
territory of Russia is prohibited.

Under such conditions, cryptocurrencies, including "Bitcoin", are money
surrogates, they contribute to the rise of underground economy, and
can't be used by citizens and entitles on the territory of Russian
Federation"
