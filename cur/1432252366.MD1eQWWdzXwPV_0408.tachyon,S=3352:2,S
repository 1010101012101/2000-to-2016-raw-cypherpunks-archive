Constitutionally, I don't think congress can do anything about it- 
they MAY pick the day he takes office (I don't recall if that date is 
in the constitution or is statutory).  If they get to pick the day, 
they might be able to get away with pushing it back for awhile, but 
even then the constition say, president shall serve 4 year term so it 
can be argued that 1 day longer than that and he's not president.
