If it turns out that some of the terrorists were people who were 
beaten up a few times too many by Israeli soldiers, then the US 
government's only effectual remedy is to stop its alliance with 
Israel.

If, however, it turns out that all the terrorists were from some 
countries that are unfree, poor and miserable, and are outraged
by the fact that we are free, rich and happy, and blame us,
rather than themselves, for their poverty and misery, then the
only way to appease them would be to become unfree and poor.  I
would rather toast the entire third world, than make such a
concession.
