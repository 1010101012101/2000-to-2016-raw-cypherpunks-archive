Gladly.  One need only look at a recent cause celebre in the cypherpunk
community to see what the Hollings bill intends to mandate.  We were
assured by the professional paranoids among the cypherpunks that there
was a serious measure being promoted by the content companies, a new
restriction which we were all going to have to deal with.

Remember?  They were going to limit all A/D converters.

That's right, thanks to the Hollings bill your rectal thermometer will
be upgraded so that you can't watch Snow White on it (not that it's
likely to be anything like snow white after you're finished with it).
Yes, Hollings is determined to plug your analog hole.

You heard it here first, folks.  And how can you doubt, when it comes
from a group with such a balanced and accurate view of the world, and
such a marvelous record for accurate predictions?  Every cypherpunk
knows that paranoid conspiracy theories are by far the most reliable
way to interpret events.
