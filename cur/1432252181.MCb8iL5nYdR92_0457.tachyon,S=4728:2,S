Mass-sending of SMS messages in China is a popular channel of spreading 
"alternative", government-unsanctioned news. Used eg. by the Falun Gong 
group, to spread the news about SARS, and probably in numerous other 
cases. Some phones are even directly equipped with the functions to 
automatically send SMS messages to a list of numbers. The government 
already keeps statistics on number of messages sent at time period from a 
single number, and alerts the officials when it's above the limit and then 
the content is checked manually. Mentioned Falun Gong news campaigns 
suffer from this.

The new system, delayed by technological problems probably caused by the 
sheer volume of data, will scan the messages for keywords, keep logs of 
suspect ones, and automatically alert police.


According to me, a partial solution of the problem could be deployment of 
encrypted messaging. The SMS standard, 160-character messages, doesn't 
offer enough space to fully use PKI (though we could sacrifice some 
message space - then we could afford 128 bits of key and 128 bits of HMAC, 
which is total of 32 characters, or maybe even use reduced HMAC of only 
half size as in this threat model we don't need the message integrity as 
much as denying the adversary access to the content, 64 bit hash could be 
enough). We can sacrifice also signing the message, or give the choice of 
signature vs additional content length (the signature is the message hash 
encrypted with the sender's private key, which is about another 128 bits; 
we could perhaps use only 64-bit of signature in this threat model). We 
can sacrifice the identification of sender/receiver keys (or more 
accurately, we can't even afford it in so short message space), but the 
GSM SMS standard has the sender phone number as part of the message, which 
can serve as identificator of the sender's key for eventual message 
signature check.

Contemporary cellphones tend to have Java in them, and should have enough 
horsepower for 1024-bit RSA and 128-bit AES. 

However, according to my consultant, there is a problem with most of the 
cellphones; Java on them runs in sandbox, so they can only send the 
messages (and even that only when they have access to messaging API), and 
there is no access to message inbox. So you can merrily encrypt, but the 
receiver then won't decrypt it. There is a solution, though - use a phone 
with OpenAPI, eg. running Symbian, Linux, or (*shudder*) WinCE as its OS, 
but these are so far in the higher end of price spectrum. I hoped it will 
be possible to implement with already widely deployed cheap technology. :(

Another hope lies in the advent of MMS, expensive now but bound to become 
a standard bulk commodity service tomorrow, which offer much bigger space 
(up to 64 or even 100 kbyte per message). Same problem as above applies.

Then all the adversary can get is the pattern of traffic of the messages 
instead of their content. (And the message content too, but only when 
seizing the recipient's private key - I am not sure if we can avoid this 
in this scenario, without resorting to using one-time pads and using them 
correctly, or without using a direct handset-to-handeset connection, 
perhaps through a proxy, with a DH key exchange. The proxy could be very 
beneficial here, even for the traffic analysis purposes, if combined with 
onion routing.)
