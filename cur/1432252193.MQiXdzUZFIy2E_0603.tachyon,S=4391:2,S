No, not generally, not in the U.S. The lawyerpunks and lawyer larvae can 
explain in more detail, but a tort (civil action, not a criminal action) 
must have some element of either rights violation or breaking of a 
contract. A wall that falls over onto someone's property generates a 
possible tort, the failure to deliver a product according to a contract 
also does.

But the fact that I claim I am "harmed" by Mormons in my midst does not.

(Nor does an actual case of economic harm: if a bookstore is driven out 
of business by the arrival of a supergiant chain store, it will not win 
a tort case, generally speaking. This is because there is no "right to 
face no competition" and there was no non-compete contract. The little 
bookstore may try to argue that the large chain is in violation of some 
anti-bigness law, and many have, but this is somewhat different. And the 
small stores have not yet been successful in blocking the larger stores.)

In English, "coercion" means by use of force. If your friends think you 
should do something, and you comply, this is not coercion in the sense 
implied here. (This may be "social coercion," but we mean something more 
specific.)

Coercion means men with guns threatening people with imprisonment for 
displaying certain images, for example. Coercion is when Congress passes 
the Protection of the Children Act of 2002 and requires all ISPs to 
provide content-filtering labels and tools.

This is the direction "content labelling" is going, not the voluntary 
system ALREADY IN PLACE.
