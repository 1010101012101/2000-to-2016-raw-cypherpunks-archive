Thank you for posting the "Compromised Remailers" article:


http://cryptome.org/remailers-tla.htm

Over the past year, many remailer users have noticed that the reliability of 
the Mixmaster type II network has steadily degraded. Although it may well be 
the result of TLA interference, the remailer community's statistical methods 
of selecting a "reliable" remailer chain contribute significantly to the 
network's degradation.

As a former employee of the United States Army Communications Command [USACC] 
Headquarters, I was amazed to stumble upon the existence of a publicly 
available communications medium permitting truly anonymous communication by 
hampering the government's ability at "traffic analysis," or tracking an 
email message from its source to its destination. One would have to be 
foolish to believe that TLAs are not hard at work trying to pierce the veil 
of anonymity afforded by the Mixmaster type II, and, the yet to be released, 
type III remailers.

I ran tests in September, October & November, and provided the Mixmaster 
developers & remail operators with the same results I've included below. My 
testing was extremely simple: send a bunch of messages, and note which 

messages arrived. [The same procedure an accountant would use in tracking a 
financial transaction from its origin to its destination.]

What I found was that a handful of remailers accounted for virtually all of 
the un-delivered email messages. Yet, these same remailers, that never 
delivered my email messages to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news group, where 
also listed as among the most reliable remailers in mixmaster stats used to 
select remailer chains.

I've included my recommendations to improve the network's reliability in the 
test results below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mixmaster II Reliability Issues & Test Results
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The major issue currently plaguing the Mixmaster remailer network is the true 
reliability of the LAST remailer in a chain. A considerable number of these 
remailers habitually act like "Black Holes" for email messages destined for 
"alt.anonymous.messages" and other news groups. 

Unfortunately, most of these "Black Hole" remailers also happen to be listed 
as among the most reliable remailers in mixmaster stats, with ratings ranging 
from the upper 90's to 100; consequently, it's highly probable that messages 
sent to newsgroups will frequently hit one of these demon remailers, never to 
reach their intended recipient.

Over the past 2 months, I've sent & tracked over 5,124 email messages 
consisting of either 4 or 6 copies of 1,220 unique messages, each routed 
through 11 Mixmaster type II remailers, to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news 
group.

Surprisingly - at first - I found that sending messages through chains of 
remailers rated, in mixmaster stats, at 98% or greater was FAR LESS reliable 
than sending messages through remailers rated at 50% or greater. This is 
because the "Black Hole" remailers were almost always rated, in mixmaster 
stats, at 98% or greater reliability, while the remailers that were the most 
successful at delivering my messages were usually rated, in mixmaster stats, 
at reliability ratings of 90% or lower.

For those of you yelling, "it's the broken chains, dumbass!" I strongly 
disagree. Messages sent through broken chains were more than twice as likely 
to successfully reach the intended news group than were messages that failed.

Broken chains were somewhat reliable predictors only after all the "Black 
Hole" remailers were removed from the remailer chains selected to send 
messages. Even then, the broken chain stats were marginally reliable only on 
the infrequent occasion that broken chains changed little from day to day.

The difference I found in the actual ability of a remailer to successfully 
deliver email was completely at odds with the mixmaster remailer stats and 
broken chain data, rendering them of little value in selecting a remailer 
chain that insures a successful delivery.

The remailer network screams for a testing methodology that stresses the 
success of actual messages delivered to their destination, as I've done in 
this test. Basically, the network needs to be auditable, and the current 
method of evaluating remailer reliability needs a complete re-think because 
it's not working well, at all. 

Additionally, Quality of Service standards need to be established and 
maintained. Remailers that consistently fail to deliver messages need to be 
removed from the network. I consistently achieved a 95% success ratio by 
removing the remailers, listed above, that failed to deliver email messages 
less than 94% of the time. 

It would also be helpful for there to be better communication between 
remailer operators.
Example: "Italy" abruptly stopped accepting mixmaster messages on the morning 

of Monday, October 20, but did send an email, that morning, to the remops 
mailing list announcing its action to permanently leave the mixmaster 
network. At least two days later, italy was still listed as a working 
mixmaster remailer, and not even listed as a broken chain for most remailers.


* When the "Black Hole" remailers were in the chain, but not the final 
remailers, they were as reliable as the rest of the remailers. I found this 
extremely puzzling. Thankfully, I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist...

* Fortunately, in 5 of the tests when "bogg" was randomly selected as one of 
the last remailers, it posted all copies of each message to the 
"alt.anonymous.messages" news group instead of only sending one copy. Thank 
God for small favors. ;)

>From the first line: for 5 separate messages, all 4 copies of the messages 
sent through "bogg" were posted to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news group.

As you can see from the bogg data, usually more than a single copy made it 
through to the last remailer for the test cycles I noted.

Using bogg as an example, I feel comfortable "jumping to the conclusion" that 
most of the "Black Hole" remailers, that failed to deliver messages to the 
alt.anonymous.messages" news group, usually received more than one copy of 
each message.

I hope this helps improve the reliability of a network I've come to rely upon 
over the years...

Keep up the good work!

Mixmaster II Reliability Issues & Test Results [Final Test]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

183 messages [4 copies] were sent through chains of 20 remailers with an
overall & final remailer reliability of 30% or greater. This was truly a
torture test that guaranteed every message an equal probability of crossing
a broken chain.

The results of this final test were in line with my earlier testing
conducted in September & October. In a nutshell: choosing a low reliability
for the remailers resulted in a greater number of messages reaching their
intended recipient, which, in both tests, was the "alt.anonymous.messages"
news group. This is because the "Black Hole" remailers were almost always
rated, in mixmaster stats, at greater reliability than remailers that were
the most successful at delivering my messages.

The Mixmaster network had an overall improvement of 4% over my earlier 
testing, in which some batches of messages were sent through remailer chains
with reliabilities of 98%, while other batches were sent through remailer
chains with reliabilities of 50%. This time around, I used a reliability of
+30%.

I didn't bother tracking bad chain data this time around because I found
the data inconsequential in my earlier testing. In both earlier & present
testing, all messages had an equal probability of encountering a bad chain,
and a chain of 20 remailers, in this test, virtually guaranteed it.

Let me clarify the statement: "I found the bad chain data inconsequential
in my earlier testing." It's not that the data aren't necessary in choosing
a good chain. In fact, you can bet that the new Mixmaster client's ability
to avoid bad chains was primarily responsible for all the 100% ratings
in this testing cycle. [The developers really deserve a strong round of
applause for their improvements to the Mix client & bad chain data.]

The reason the bad chain data are inconsequential to the testing is that all
messages have an equal probability of encountering a bad chain that may
develop over the many hours, or days, it takes for the messages to navigate
20 remailers.

My recommendations are the same as I previously outlined in my earlier 
test results, which I've included below...

Thanks again to all the developers & remops!
