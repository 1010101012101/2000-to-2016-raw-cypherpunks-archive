I think you can forward the PassCode to AOL once the victim has
entered it on a phishing site.  Tokens ` la SecurID can only help if
the phishing schemes *require* delayed exploitation of obtained
credentials, and I don't think we should make this assumption.  Online
MITM attacks are not prevented.

(Traditional IPsec XAUTHis problematic for the very same reason, even
with a SecurID token lookalike.)
