9th Circuit decides - Susan Coffey won a new trial when the 9th Circuit
Court of
                      Appeals overturned Judge Jack Tanner's decision
tossing out a unanimous jury
                      decision of excessive use of force against Coffey
at the secret warehouse in Pierce
                      County during the 1996 General Election. The
second trial occurred on Sept. 18,
                      2000 and lasted 2 days. The jury took 90 minutes
to return a damage award of $1
                      compensatory $1 punitive to Coffey.
