pgp and gnupg are 'pretty good'. Bitcoin is a disaster because the vested interests
appear to have achived complete regulatory capture through FINCEN and the 
Banking Secrecy Act

The cost of privacy is the threat. There's a lot we can do with things that are
Free, as in Freedom (software). I think there's also a great advance waiting when
a viral-freedom copyright license (GPL/AGPL) cryptocoin can figure out how to 
clearly express the cost tradeoff of doing verifiably secure anonymous transactions
vs what it costs to just tell the world you are sending $20 to your grandma and
making sure it gets there.

The problem with bitcoin is all the developers who know what they are doing are now
part of the 1% that benefits from exploiting privacy asymmetry.

I can't trust someone talking with forked tongue about how cryptocoins are BOTH a
serious business currency, AND protect your privacy.
