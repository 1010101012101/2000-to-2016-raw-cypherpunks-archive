=99s a
                      crucial question, because while U.S. companies are
                      allowed to sell Internet service to Iran, they may
                      not do so if they have =E2=80=9Cknowledge or reason=

                      Government of Iran,=E2=80=9D according to Treasury

                      covered by that prohibition, two lawyers who are
                      expert in the sanctions rules told The Daily

    <p>Despite the nuclear deal, Iran is providing the bulk of ground
      forces to crush Syrian rebels opposed to Bashar al-Assad, and is
      part of an emerging power axis with Russia, which has <a
href=3D"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/29/u-s-to-putin-wel=
come-to-the-isis-quagmire.html">launched</a>
      airstrikes to keep the Syrian dictator in power and to keep
      Moscow=E2=80=99s foothold in the Middle East.</p>
    <p>But Iran is expanding economically=E2=80=94and digitally=E2=80=94a=
s well. And
      that presents an opportunity for American technology companies.</p>=

    <p>Since August 2014, when the Iran=E2=80=99s national telecom regula=
tor
      began awarding licenses for 3G and 4G mobile phone service,
      subscriptions have surged, to about 20.5 million people last
      month, Amy Cameron, a senior analyst with BMI Research, told The
      Daily Beast. That=E2=80=99s about 27 percent of the country=E2=80=99=
s population,
      the majority of which is under 30 and, presumably, eager to
      embrace new technologies and the access to information that comes
      with them.</p>
    <p>The surge in mobile phone service is a big business, and Iran
      needs more Internet addresses and access for all those new
      devices, Cameron said. In addition to acquiring new service
      routes=E2=80=94like the ones GTT provides=E2=80=94the government ha=
s also been
      buying up Internet addresses that use the so-called <a
        href=3D"http://research.dyn.com/2015/04/ipv4-address-market-takes=
-off"
        target=3D"_blank">=E2=80=9Cversion 4=E2=80=9D</a> protocol, a vit=
al, and
      increasingly scarce, component of the world=E2=80=99s Internet
      infrastructure. And Iran plans to auction more wireless broadband
      spectrum, which should in turn attract more investment in mobile
      networks.</p>
    <p>=E2=80=9CAll of these developments point towards Iran making conce=
rted
      efforts to open its Internet market,=E2=80=9D Cameron said. Of cour=
se,
      there are limits to that openness: Iran=E2=80=99s primary telecom c=
ompany
      is owned by the military, and the Tehran government monitors
      communications for prohibited content.</p>
    All of which makes its affiliation with a telecom company in
    suburban Washington even more unusual.<br>
