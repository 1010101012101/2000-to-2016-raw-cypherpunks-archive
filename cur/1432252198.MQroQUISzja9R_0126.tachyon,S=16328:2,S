mirimir i would have to dig up the quote where the fuck says that basically
it is good us is invading to get back at the iraqi's for 9-11

umn the iraqi's had nothing to do with 9-11 and he swallowed that tripe...
i am sorry but that is just stupid x 5 million

i dont care about his excuses my pet spider even knew it was crap

if you can give him a pass for being 'apathetic' which i wouldnt frame it
like that then that says a lot about you - its not apathy to support a
fucking invasion of a people - people that are apathetic are like i dont
know not oh yay lets do it it is a totally different mindset

and that he is here in daily kos framing out this lie says more to me about
his lack of character than anything and you of course didnt address that
part - if the fuck was an actual person he could be like yay i sucked but
now i know better i changed its so great we get to change our minds in our
lifetimes and fucking grow but does gleenny do that no he cant face himself
its pathetic he lives in his ego

ego doesnt want people saying they are wrong ever and its a death echo
chamber
