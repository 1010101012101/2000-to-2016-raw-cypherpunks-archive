What Bush and cronies want to do in ANWR is entirely unrelated to
strategy - they want the right to go make money by drilling on public
lands. If it goes through in the near future watch how much the
government spends on roads and other support to get the drillers in
there and how much is payed in return by the oil companies.

Long-term energy strategy is more important than corporate greed. The
most strategic thing to do with Alaskan oil would be to leave it right
where it is. Dipping in to the reserves unnecessarily is moronic.

NB : I'm not opposed to drilling Alaskan oil - after Kuwait runs dry...
