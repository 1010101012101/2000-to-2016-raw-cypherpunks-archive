YouTube (Dec 20) - "Israel: Unlawful Attacks on Palestinian Media" by  
Human Rights Watch:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz4gcp78Ix4

Documents HRW's on-the-ground research into Israeli targeting of  
journalists during the November 2012 war.  The 3.5 minute video excerpts  
an Al Jazeera interview in which Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev  
advocates interpreting the broadcast of "command and control" information 
as criteria for distinguishing "legitimate" journalists protected by 
international law from non-legitimate journalists who can be regarded as 
combatants and targeted as such.
