<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.thestockadvisor.com/images//Unico_Logo.gif" width="267" height="91"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><font size="4" color="#800000">Market Perception of New Site</font></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unico Inc. (OTCBB:UICO) reported on June 14 the launch of the new web site
for its wholly owned subsidiary Independent News (www.indynews.com), The
updated
and revised sited is also being used as a model for Unico's recently
launched
Internet division, TheLocalTimes (<a href="http://www.thelocaltimes.com">www.thelocaltimes.com</a>).
TheLocalTimes is a complete, integrated web solution for the nation's
estimated
15,000 newspapers, all potential customers of TheLocalTimes.</p>
<p>Joseph Nicastro, President of Unico, and Publisher of Independent News
says <i>&quot;Several
potential customer I have been speaking with in the past have now
contacted me
and congratulated us on providing an excellent solution that they will use
for
their papers. As a publisher myself for more than 14 years, I know what
works
and what doesn't. We publishers have a tendency to dislike changes.
However,
this is a solution that will enhance the value for both the newspapers
themselves, their advertisers and the local communities.&quot;</i></p>
<p><b><i>Benefits provided by TheLocalTimes:</i></b></p>
<p>1) <i>For the local newspaper.</i> A) It is a guaranteed moneymaker for the
newspaper itself as their revenues grow. B) Provides the newspaper with a
turn-key solution, including technical support without any money upfront.</p>
<p>2) <i>For the advertisers.</i> The advertisers are getting increased exposure
directly in their local market which is a clear and solid advantage
compared
with their competitor at a very low, almost negligible, increased cost.</p>
<p>3) <i>For the local community.</i> As the Internet develops, the local
community on the Internet is getting stronger and stronger. The Local
Times is,
providing local quality content to each and every local newspaper region
for
free.</p>
<p>4) <i>For Unico.</i> As The Local Times is a fully owned subsidiary of Unico,
Unico's shareholder will reap the fruit as the increased revenue and
profit will
be shown on Unico's financial statements.</p>
<p>Unico's goal is to make TheLocalTimes the ultimate web solution for the
nation's small and medium-sized newspapers, as many of those have neither
the
technical resources to maintain a world class web site nor the financial
incentive to do so.</p>
<p>All a newspaper has to do is to sign up for TheLocalTimes service and the
Company provides each and every newspaper with a turn-key solution,
including an
interactive web site specifically designed to their needs; a complete set
of
technical tools designed by our highly qualified in-house technical staff
and
outsourced technical specialists to serve as the ultimate technical
solutions on
the web for the nations newspapers.</p>
<p>By going from an Internet incubator to a quality news and media company
with
one wholly owned and growing newspaper and a fully functioning revenue
generating Internet division, Unico is positioning itself for explosive
growth
over the next few years.</p>
