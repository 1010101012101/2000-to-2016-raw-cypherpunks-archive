Some misc first: Drudge says he's not waiting for
the polls to close, he's posting exit-poll results
as soon as they come in.

I once worked for NES [News Election Service] the
combined effort of CBS/NBC/ABC etc to receive
exit-poll info from around the nation. Job title
was "Error Editor". Anyone have any current info
on them?

The Texas license uses your SS#.

CHANGED DRIVER'S LICENSE AT ISSUE

Sources told MSNBC.com's Jeannette Walls that Bush associates had been 
worried for several years about his arrest record and had hoped that 
because it was in Maine, and not Texas, it wouldn't surface.

The sources said Bush took one step to keep it under wraps in March 
1995, when his driver's license number was changed. Walls first reported 
this in August 1999 in The Scoop, an MSNBC.com column. At the time, 
the sources told Walls that Bush got his license number changed because 
he was worried about an arrest record surfacing.

"He has an arrest record that has to do with drinking," a source said 
then. "He's worried it will come out, but his handlers keep assuring 
him it won't."

The allegation was not disclosed by MSNBC.com at the time because the 
arrest could not be confirmed.

Also in August 1999, the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles told 
MSNBC.com that changing one's driver's license number was "highly 
unusual" and that it is done only when the holder of the license can 
prove that someone is using the license number for illegal activities.

Repeated calls to Bush's camp back at the time were unanswered, until 
a spokeswoman for Bush said the motor vehicle agency would have an 
additional comment. An agency spokesman then called MSNBC and said 
Bush's license number was changed for "security measures." He declined 
to comment further.

A spokesman for Bush left a phone message Friday saying license numbers 
are changed "as a matter of course and courtesy for statewide elected 
officials. It's offered to all statewide elected officials in Texas."

A spokesman for the governor's office in Texas reiterated this and 
said other governors were also given the option of changing their 
license numbers.
