<HTML><FONT PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" LANG="0">Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. &nbsp;The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. &nbsp;The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.<BR>
<BR>
In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. &nbsp;I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. &nbsp;To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;Dear God it was me!!! 
&nbsp;My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">! &nbsp;I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, &nbsp;but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.<BR>
<BR>
Well, this situation was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> acceptable. &nbsp;But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
&nbsp;My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. &nbsp;Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. &nbsp;My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.<BR>

FACE="Arial" LANG="0">. &nbsp;It seemed to contain everything I needed. &nbsp;
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, &nbsp;</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000"

I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. &nbsp;It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.<BR>
<BR>
It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. &nbsp;My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. &nbsp;</FONT><FONT
