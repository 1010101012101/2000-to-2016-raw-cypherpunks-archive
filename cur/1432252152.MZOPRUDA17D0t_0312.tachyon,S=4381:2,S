Oh yeah, another thing I wanted to ask about, before I forget.

It's somewhat well-known that throughout the South pacific, there are "radio 
stations" that do nothing but broadcast the real-time reading of number 
sequences, but no one seems to know just why. And these number sequences do 
not seem to be recordings...every station has a different voice, and the 
number sequences never repeat. So it would seem that they are being read in 
real time by natives employed at various islands.

Anyone know what the heck those things are? There's actually a 3-CD 
collection available of the number broadcasts.
