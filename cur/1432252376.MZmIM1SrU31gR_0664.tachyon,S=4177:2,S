You've identified one of several attacks on a distributed reputation system.
The next step is to identify solutions to these problems.  
Then iterate, until you're proposing really hard attacks on the part of
your adversary.  At which point you've learned something.

Remembering that disinfo, psyops, nym-unmasking, and other forms of social
engineering
are available options.  If you can tie the meat to the T-shaped crucifix and 
inject what you want, you win.

That's the game.  But you knew that.

If you wish to claim that enforcable contracts require meatspace identity,
claim that, and listen to the discussion.
