Network World Layer 8 (Oct 17) - "NASA exploring $1.5 million unmanned  
aircraft competition":
http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/nasa-exploring-15-million-unmanned-aircraft-competition

A little surprising to see NASA pulled into this by the FAA and Air Force 
Research Lab.  Looks like they're trying to get competitors to figure out 
how to integrate drones in the NAS.  Doesn't really give me warm fuzzies, 
crowdsourcing the Next Generation Air Transportation System...

Also, the competition is not a done deal, this RFI is just a trial  
balloon...
