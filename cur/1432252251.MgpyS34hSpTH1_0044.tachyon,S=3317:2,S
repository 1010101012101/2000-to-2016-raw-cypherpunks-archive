Jailbirds remember porridge online
By Tim Richardson
Posted: 14/01/2002 at 11:53 GMT
The craze for reunion Web sites has taken a new twist following the 
creation of a site dedicated to re-uniting old jailbirds.
Convicts Reunited was set up as a spoof site last month but since then has 
attracted 3,000 subscribers.
A statement on the site reads: "This website is for Convicts and 
Ex-convicts who have either lost contact with old prison inmates or maybe 
looking for fellow conns for their next bank job.
It ends: "Please note, this site is run by ex-convict personnel only, no 
part of this site was created by non-convicts so we understand your needs 
better."
However, when pressed Mike Breach admitted that neither he nor co-founder, 
Chris Harvey, had spent any time behind bars. "It started off as a joke but 
people have been registering with us," he said. .
