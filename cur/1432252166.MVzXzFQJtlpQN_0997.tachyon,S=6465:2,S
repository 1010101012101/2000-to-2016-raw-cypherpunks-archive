Problem was there was no OR time at the hospital we were at, BUT the doc had privileges at several hospitals in town and wanted to know if we minded transferring hospitals...uhhh heck no!... He got us in and transferred us, I saw him about 10pm Monday night. Tuesday morning were in OR prep waiting to go under the knife. Now if you have never been into an operating room while still conscious it is a scary thing. They wheeled me into the OR, I saw all these shiny and sharp instruments and was ready to go home. Thank goodness they knocked me out.6</SPAN></font></p>

I got bored SO went out and mowed the lawn. We ate dinner got the kids in bed and crashed ourselves. So much for a Wild weekend.3 Do you read food labels? I do. And I'm not sure it's for the right reasons. I think I may be deluding myself when I dawdle in the dairy isle looking for the healthiest cheese. The more I contemplate the subject, the more I doubt that I'll be able to stave off a heart attack or diabetes with the exact right balance of preservative-ridden packaged chemicals masquerading as food. Yet, in the hopes that I have a chance of resembling a healthy person, I take a multi vitamin, exercise as often as possible and try to restrain myself from flinging the contents of my desk on the floor and running down to the bistro BBQ that wafts up from the street with the sax music.3</SPAN><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enjoy a better love life for both you and your partner. <br>

The cat B got from her mom has latched on to me, and it is driving me crazy. Prissy will not leave our room for anything, yes she has only been there a week and it will take some time I know. BUT it is driving me a little nuts. If I go the the bathroom she goes to the bathroom, heck if I enter the room she is following me around when I get in bed she has to get in beside me and bugs me till I love on her. Now we have another cat Tuff, he is my cat and has been since he was born in our house, this has really upset him, they sat on the bed last night staring each other down and growling. Heck I hid under the covers afraid the claws might come out and I would be the scratching ground. Now Prissy has decided the only way to get from my dresser where she stay to the food which just happens to be on the other side of the bed is to come across the pillows, it doesn't matter if you are sleeping or not, I nearly killed her this morning when she jumped on my pillow and I was in a fight in my dream lets just say I need to vacuum the cat hair.4</SPAN></td>
