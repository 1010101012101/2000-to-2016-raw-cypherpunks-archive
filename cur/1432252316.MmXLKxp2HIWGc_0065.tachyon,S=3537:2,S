You're right AP might not be protected.  But suppose the activity is different. 
 Suppose its publically stated purpose is some uncontroversial legit activity,
 such as psychic prediction contests.  Shouldn't the same sorts of protections 
should apply as in the ruling? The fact that terrorists unknown to the psychics 
might use the contests for illegal purpose (maybe specifically prohibited 
by the contest organizers) should cover the majority participants.
