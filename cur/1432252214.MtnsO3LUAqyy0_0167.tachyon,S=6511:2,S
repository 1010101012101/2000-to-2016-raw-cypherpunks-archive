Power density in the proposed systems has been at least nominally low 
enough you could safely graze cattle in the beam. This ain't a Star Wars 
death-ray. Not even close.

Believe it or not, I'm actively considering an ethanol project.
Wasn't suggesting such things were not worthwhile. Not by a long shot. 
How far along do you think the emerging fuel-cell technologies would be 
without the space program, though?

Jeez, maybe we can eliminate crime, win the War on Drugs, and wipe out

We had the Buck Rogers stuff 30 years ago, dropped the ball, and have 
been resting on our laurels and for the most part have been wasting a 
singular historic opportunity ever since. Wait any longer, and it could 
be too late. Might already be. They want to whittle down the already 
whittled down ISS, more unmanned planetary scientific missions canceled. 
the Superconducting Collider canceled, fusion research whittled down and 
stretched out past mid-century, hardly any new reactor designs 
production tested in decades, etc. etc. etc. Whatever happened to 
gaseous fission rocket motors, for instance?

By that time it will be way too late. Plenty enough crisis right now to 
spur constructive developments. In case you haven't noticed, there are a 
few new players in the game, too.

I started a comment on this, but then I scrolled down and saw you admit
