Nuclear waste is actually a _poor_ example of this.

Nuclear waste is easy to track, easy to store, hard to hide.

Most problems with storing nuclear waste come from irrational fears 
people have of anything having to do with "atoms."

I could go on to educate you and others about the advantages of 
nuclear power over alternatives, and the ease of storing nuclear 
waste, but I expect this list is the wrong place for such education.
