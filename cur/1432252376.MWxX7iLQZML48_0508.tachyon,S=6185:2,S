Obvious solutions:

* declare BTC to be presumptively evidence of drug dealing or trading CP =
- possession of weakly-related artefacts being declared as sufficient =
evidence has, IIRC, been ruled legal in NY in the case of a law which =
made possession by a woman of multiple condoms evidence of prostitution.
* require BTC holdings to be declared to the tax authorities, and make =
explicit that whatever the local tax on investment holdings applies to =
BTC (I think the current question is not whether growth in value of BTC =
is taxable but what kind of investment it should be taxed as).
* snarl up BTC exchanges with the same reporting requirements as normal =
banks and trading houses, even though the much smaller scale will make =
that extremely difficult to comply with.
* rule that BTC miners are engaging in banking by building up the record =
in the block chain, and make them all responsible for reporting the =
transactions they process

Apart from the first, none of those would be very controversial, or even =
entirely without merit if you accept the validity of the anti-fraud, =
anti-money-laundering, and anti-tax-evasion laws which require reporting =
by financial services companies. The trouble is, what is a tolerable =
imposition on a company handling millions of dollars is a huge and =
crippling burden on some guy with a couple of hundred dollars worth of =
BTC. (This is where a =93by way of trade=94 qualifier[0] would come in =
useful, but it would also be horribly exploitable when it comes to =
financial trading.)

[0] Typically meaning, taking up a significant portion of one=92s time =
or providing a significant portion of one=92s income - the sort of =
clause which means that someone driving cross-country with some friends =
and accepting petrol money from them isn=92t required to comply with the =
regulations regarding taxis or minicabs.
