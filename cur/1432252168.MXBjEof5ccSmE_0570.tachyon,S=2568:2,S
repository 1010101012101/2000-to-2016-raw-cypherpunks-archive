  It's beginning to look more and more like Tim is absolutely right.
There are just one fuck of a lot of people in this country that really,
seriously, need killing. It is utterly amazing how quickly, because
of one incident, all these "leaders" are jumping thru the "trash
the Constitution" hoop. 
  And, of course, anyone who attempts to actively oppose their fascist
schemes, is "aiding and abetting terrorists". Is there no way out
of this?
