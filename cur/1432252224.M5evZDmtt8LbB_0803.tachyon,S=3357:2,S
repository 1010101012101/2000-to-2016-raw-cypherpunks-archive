The quote it attributed to Clive Ponting's book on Churchill. So all
anyone has to do is check that. 
Ponting is a reasonably well-known author it should be possible to find
the book and check page 132. Whether Ponting was telling the truth is
another matter - but he isn't Chomsky.  

Nor is he a socialist of course. Chomsky is a left socialist anarchist
so JAD assumes that anything he says has to be a lie, with or without
evidence.
