Yes, but this is one of those manufactured, utterly implausible 
situations. I cannot think of a single instance where a suspect had this 
kind of knowledge, with this kind of stakes, and with this kind of "next 
three hours" timetable. Even relaxing each item by a factor of 10...I 
can't think of any such examples.

However, I _can_ think of cases where cops believed a suspect knew the 
location of a kidnapped child, even someone buried alive a la some of 
the famous kidnaps of the past. Should torture be used in cases like 
this? The Israelis routinely torture suspects, as news articles over the 
past dozen years have reported (confirmed by Israeli intelligence on "60 
Minutes"). Of course, this might have something to do with their 
upcoming problems.

Given that the scenario Declan describes is unlikely, how might torture 
or drugs be used? To go after organized crime, obviously. And drug 
dealers. And money launderers. And pedophiles.

"But if it helps to catch just one terrorist!"

If the U.S. abandons the standard that no person shall be compelled to 
be a witness against himself--something the "truth serum" drugging 
option would of course imply just as surely as torture would--the end 
times will be upon us.
