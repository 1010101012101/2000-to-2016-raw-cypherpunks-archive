Unmanned at Any Speed: Bringing Drones into Our National Airspace

By: Wells C. Bennett <http://www.brookings.edu/experts/bennettw>

In February of this year, President Obama signed the Federal Aviation
Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (bFMRAb). The new lawbs
plain-sounding title doesnbt tell you, but FMRA encompasses a bold and
controversial project: allowing, by a date certain, much broader domestic
operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (bUASb)b or, as they are more
commonly described, bdrones.b

Congress instructed the Federal Aviation Administration (bFAAb) to devise
rules that, by late 2015, would allow widespread UAS useb both by private
individuals and entities, and by federal, state and local governments.
Between now and then the agency must meet a slate of statutory benchmarks.
To name but one of many, a rule authorizing the private use of bsmallb UAS
(those weighing less than fifty-five pounds) must be issued by August of
2013.

In this paper, bUnmanned at any Speed: Bringing Drones into our National
Airspace,b Wells Bennett assesses the current state of domestic drone
integration. Among other things, Bennett overviews:

   - FMRAbs most important deadlines, and the FAAbs progress in meeting
   them;
   - The legal and historical backdrop to FMRA, including the FAAbs
   longstanding, case-by-case approach to approving domestic drone flights;
   - Some of the most pressing air safety, security, cybersecurity, and
   privacy policy questions that must be addressed, policy questions that must
   be addressed, in order to allow for widespread domestic UAS operation under
   FMRA.
