 Russia's Biggest Spammer Brutally Murdered in Apartment

 Vardan Kushnir, notorious for sending spam to each and every citizen of
 Russia who appeared to have an e-mail, was found dead in his Moscow
 apartment on Sunday, Interfax reported Monday. He died after suffering
 repeated blows to the head.

 Kushnir, 35, headed the English learning centers the Center for American
 English, the New York English Centre and the Centre for Spoken English, all
 known to have aggressive Internet advertising policies in which millions of
 e-mails were sent every day.

 In the past angry Internet users have targeted the American English centre
 by publishing the Center's telephone numbers anywhere on the Web to provoke
 telephone calls. The Center's telephone was advertised as a contact number
 for cheap sex services, or bargain real estate sales.

 Another attack involved hundreds of people making phone calls to the
 American English Center and sending it numerous e-mails back, but Vardan
 Kushnir remained sure of his right to spam, saying it was what e-mails were
 for.

 Under Russian law, spamming is not considered illegal, although lawmakers
 are working on legal projects that could protect Russian Internet users
 like they do in Europe and the U.S.
