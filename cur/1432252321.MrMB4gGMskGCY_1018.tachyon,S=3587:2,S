my fault. cypherpunks.

you are the one missing the point by about, uh, the size of mexico. the
original poster of this thread had a specific problem. it doesn't matter
if an algorithm satisfies some arbitrary and, to be brutally honest,
mental-masturbation definition of perfect cryptography detection.
incidently, since he is working in a closed environment and CAN dictate
the crypto to be used (within limits, such as the requirement that the
software for it be available on all used platforms), the very
requirement you mention as the critical is in fact not only uncritical,
but not even a problem.

you should really go back and read the thread with this subject line
from the very beginning. we are NOT talking about any pipe-dream
"detects any imaginable form of crypto" algorithm, which I will agree
can not exist. this thread is about a very specific problem and possible
solutions.
