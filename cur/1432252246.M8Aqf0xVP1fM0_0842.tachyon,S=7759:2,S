Counter-stego detection.

Seems to me a main tool will be a 2-D Fourier analysis...Stego will 
certainly have a certain "thumbprint", depending on the algorithm. Are there 
certain images that can hide stego more effectively? IN other words, these 
images should have a lot of spectral energy in the same frequency bands 
where Stego would normally show.

>"The work we are doing is in multimedia, with a focus on digital images,"
>Boncelet said. "You can take an image on your web site and use
>steganographic techniques to hide a message in the image. The image looks
>completely ordinary but if you know the key, you can extract the secret
>message."
>
>"The object of the research," Boncelet said, "is to try to figure out how

>One of the earliest examples of steganography comes from ancient history,
>Boncelet said, explaining that a Greek city was surrounded by enemy
>soldiers and the leader wanted to get a message to his allies to send
>troops. He selected a slave and shaved his head, tattooing the plea for
>help on his scalp, then allowed the slave's hair to grow back over the
>message. The slave was sent out of the city walls, was captured and
>released by the enemy troops, and arrived safely with the message.

>In World War II, Boncelet said, American soldiers used steganography to
>provide information on their whereabouts to relatives back home by putting
>a pinprick on a map. Army censors were forced to pepper letters with
>hundreds of pinpricks to offset the practice. German spies used
>steganography in microdots, tiny images of typed pages that could be pasted
>over periods in seemingly harmless letters.

>The NSF grant is for one year and was awarded through the Approaches to

>Sciences, which supports new concepts in basic research and work force
>development with the potential to contribute to national security.
