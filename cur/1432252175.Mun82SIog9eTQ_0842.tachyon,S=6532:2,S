US enhanced airport security checks target electronics in latest
stretch for Total Information Awareness
 - not by the BBC 6 July 2014 Last updated at 28:45 GMT


Frustrated by technically savvy privacy extremists using encryption to
protect confidentiality of their data, the United States is preparing
a particularly clever ruse to rummage through your digital detritus.

The US announced new security measures last week, apparently in
response to a terror threat, but gave hints that multiple privacy
enhancing technology conferences  occurring this summer were of the
utmost interest.

Analysts say the changes have been couched in a conceit made to appear
to be in response to intelligence that Islamic militants in Syria and
Yemen developing bombs that could evade airport security.

"It's really clever if you think about it.", one anonymous expert on
the wiki explained. "First, they put the real terrorists on notice,
adding to operational paranoia. But second, they get to enable every
device crossing the border at their discretion with minimal concern!"

When asked for comment, the National Security Agency replied they
could 'neither confirm nor deny any knowledge of "mobile phones"'.
[EDITORS' NOTE: The NSA asked us to use scare quotes and not normal
quotes, yet in a brave show of defiance we stood up for our readership
and refused. "" Take that NSA! With Love, The Editors.]

"During the security examination, officers may also ask that owners
power up some devices, including cell phones," it said. "All devices
must be fully unlocked and past any full disk encryption
authentication to properly test the battery."

"Powerless devices will not be permitted on board the aircraft. The
traveller may also undergo additional screening once the device is
powered on and keyed up to be sure it is working correctly in
CUSTOMS."

Reuters news agency reported that officials had singled out mobile
phones made by Apple and Samsung for extra checks. Apparently these
devices are most often used by developers and other privacy
extremists.

More as this story develops. Back to you, Tom.
