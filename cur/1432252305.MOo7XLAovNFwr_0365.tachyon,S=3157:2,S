So you are suggesting that, because of the fear for one's life and rented
property, posters shut the fuck up and don't make waves ?

Isn't that the *goal* and raison d'etre of TLAs ?

So, to join fingerpointing on this e-mail list (like in "not a movement"), it
seems that you, JYA and others cautioning about imminent arrests are furthering
the cause of TLAs, and therefore probably are their contractors, no ?
