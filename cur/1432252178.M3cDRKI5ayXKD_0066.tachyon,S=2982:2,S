there always was security. just never enough to make a difference in the

there's a lot of people who couldn't care less. however, there are also
a couple of people who do care. for example, I have occasional
sysadmin-to-sysadmin contacts along the lines of "hey, by accident I
found that on your site..." - that would definitely not work as well if
by pointing out some config error to the guy running the site you risk
that if he's an asshole you're in a lawsuit.
