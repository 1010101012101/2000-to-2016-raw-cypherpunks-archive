Agent gordon,how olds your boy now? He will be a teenager one day and may 
call out his old man ala arbusto and herb.
It might be for something petty but it might also be because his dad locked 
up a guy for 10 years instead of getting an AVO (restraining order) on him.
He may also be a perfect son.(Like charles texas tower.)Id like to write to 
him with your permission.I have something to show him about you.
