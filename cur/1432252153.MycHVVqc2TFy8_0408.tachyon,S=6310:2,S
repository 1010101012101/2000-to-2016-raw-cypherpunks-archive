Many people have wondered how technological progress will affect 
political and civil freedoms. With the rise of encryption software 
and the FBI's Carnivore e-mail snooping program, this subject is no 
longer the exclusive domain of speculative thinkers or futurists, it 
is the subject of intense public-policy debate. Will 
privacy-enhancing technology improve faster than privacy-threatening 
technology? Should the government mandate privacy standards? Should 
it enforce contracts in cyberspace, or would private law do a better 
job? Economist and legal scholar David Friedman will discuss these 
and related questions about technological change and the case for and 
against government involvement.

About Law's Order

[Law's Order] is wide-ranging in scope, at once simple and highly 
sophisticated, consistently provocative, an excellent read, and a 
notable contribution to an exciting field of interdisciplinary 
studies.
- RICHARD A. POSNER, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit

"Whether one speaks of the complexities of marginal deterrence, the 
resolution of disputes between farmers and railroads, or the social 
functions of copyright and patent law, Friedman's book provides the 
outsider to the field with a comprehensive but accessible account of 
his legal subject matter."
- RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, University of Chicago School of Law


"Simply put, [Law's Order] is fabulously written, and readers will 
very much appreciate the lucid style, the humor, and the 
hold-nothing-sacred (except, perhaps, the market!) approach."
- STEVEN G. MEDEMA, coauthor, Economics and the Law: From Posner to 
Postmodernism


"The author is a talented and provocative writer, with a great 
imagination and the ability to make readers swallow the often 
counterintuitive conclusions of economics as common sense. The book 
is an entertaining tour through the mind of someone who has fully 
absorbed the 'economic way of thinking' as he attempts to explain and 
grapple with questions of social organization."
- PETER BOETTKE, George Mason University
