A dozen more warriors for Allah in this Jihad were recruited by this 
article. The U.S. is doing exactly what OBL is hoping for.

I haven't been "visited," at least not so far. Maybe I never will be.

I hope I have the presence of mind to say "You're trespassing. Get the 
fuck off my property."

I would only "answer questions" through an attorney, and I would only 
hire a $300 an hour shyster if I _had_ to. Meaning, I would say nothing 
(I would hope) unless they arrest me. Until then, they can stay the fuck 
off of my property.
(My last experience with security narcs was the event I described at 
Stanford. There, I did manage to have the presence of mind to answer 
none of their questions about my name, my reason for being on campus at 
the same time the Criminal Family was visiting, or about the contents of 
my bag.)
