My $0.2? Yes, the CD is a good source of material. Though to be fair I
have to admit that I do so much hands-on crypto that I've only got the 1st
ed. floppy around here somewhere. I'd also suggest taking a look at the
Dr. Dobb's line of CD-R's as well. I also found the CD for,

Number Theory: A programmers guide

useful, thought it does total only a couple of M's.
