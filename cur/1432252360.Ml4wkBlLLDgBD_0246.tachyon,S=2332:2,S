Despite supposedly being an "open source" project, "nop", the lead developers/project manager, has kept some of the source/procedures necessary to run iip rather closed (e.g., the server configuration and the source code for the public relay 'harvester').  There were quite a few iip users who expressed interest in helping out or taking over when iip's problems first became painful about six-nine months ago.  Now many iip users may have left, and a non-public project with much grander ambitions and truly open source is well along in development (spurred on in good part because of nop's lack of communication with the iip community).

This call for help may be a bit too late.
