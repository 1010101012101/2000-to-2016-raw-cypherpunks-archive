WSJ today reports on the war between web privacy firms
and the feds:

  http://cryptome.org/web-priv-war.htm

Lance Cottrell and other privacy protection firms are featured --
does Anonymizer really bring in up to a $1M a year?

Lance says he doesn't keep logs thus cannot respond to
subpoenas. Other privacy firms are said to cooperate
with the feds. One brags that national security trumps
making money. As if they natsec is not the biggest money
maker of all time, though homesec is coming on strong.
Privsec in the race, though deniability is mandatory.

It notes the demise of Zero Knowledge just before the Patriot
Act started the boom in people seeking protection from 
official spies. Darn. But then we don't know what ZK is
doing black with the contacts it eagerly gathered in its 
meetings with the feds.
