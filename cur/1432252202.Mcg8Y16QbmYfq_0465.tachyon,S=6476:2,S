Those kinds of backgrounds are, I think, quite reasonable. They're very 
obviously just backdrops, as the lights don't change, lights at night 
don't flicker, clouds don't move, etc.

CNBC uses them for San Francisco backdrops...usually the Golden Gate 
Bridge, or the Transamerica Pyramid, or the Bay Bridge. And they're 
even clever enough to usually have an "overcast" shot when the day is 
overcast, a "clear and sunny" shot as appropriate, and (less often for 
programming reasons) night shots.

I think 99% of the viewers understand that it's just a visual cue to 
remind those not hearing or reading the intro about where the 
interviewee is located.

Putting up fake newsrooms is quite another matter, though. I don't 
recall seeing this static shot of the "New York Times-Washington 
Bureau" newsroom. It seems like a silly thing to do, to have a photo of 
a newsroom with nobody in it.

On the backdrops themselves, I'm surprised they're not using blue 
screen technology. The weather reporters have it, though with a 
sometimes visible "edge" (which is distracting).

Since the War on (Some) Terrorists is the Wag the Dog War, we may soon 
be seeing actual faked war footage.

(The best news has been that 100 or so American reporters have "signed 
on" to wear actual uniforms, to be assigned to combat units, and to 
participate in battles if need be. This I count as "good news" because 
it may mean that captured reporters are not held-and-released the way 
Bob Simon, for example, was in Iraq. This time they may face the same 
fate other captured enemy face. And it erases any misconceptions that 
the unquestioning press is actually independent of the 
military-industrial-media complex. "Fox News -- Fair AND Balanced!")
