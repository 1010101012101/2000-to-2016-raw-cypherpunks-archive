Down, indeed.  In fact, it's gone.

This caused me to have to polish my SpamAssassin rules a bit to remove the 
Osirusoft contribution to scoring.  Gotta love email.  Monday, I had to add 
an alternate port to my hosted mailserver to get around the new Fuse.net 
policy of blocking outbound port 25.  I just hope they don't start blocking 
inbound 22.  That would be bad.
