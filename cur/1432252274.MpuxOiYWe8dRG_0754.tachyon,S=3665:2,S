It is an inherent problem with any democratic system, that it must be 
designed to produce and enforce a single definite decision on a multitude 
of matters where "the people" do not have any one clear opinion.  This 
leads to the well known voting paradoxes.

Thus democracy is inherently biased towards statism, towards imposing a 
single  solution from above on everyone, regardless of their diverse desires.

One solution to this is severe limits on the power of the majority.  The 
government should require a ten to one majority for any use force.  To 
collect taxes, incur debts, or expend money for any purpose, or to make 
war, should require ten yes votes for any no vote.

The problem is that those whose job it is to enforce such limits on 
government, personally benefit from escaping those limits, thus all 
attempts to limit government ultimately fail.
