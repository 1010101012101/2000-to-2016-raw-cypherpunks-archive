Certainly individuals are pretty hungry at least some of the time.
I remember a while back a way home there was an old lady
bum saying "please help me get something to eat, I'm hungry".
Experience told me that she would be there again the next day
saying the same thing.  But what made this day special was,  I
overheard another lady remark to her friend, "I'm hungry too,
because I worked through my lunch hour".  Then again,
she did look like she could afford to skip a few meals.
	What there isn't in the US is starvation.  This country has
its faults, but as far as providing food goes, there are an amazing 
number of morbidly obese "poor" people.
