Who owns each posting that goes through the CDR?

Standard Responce: Each individual author.

Does this not mean that each individual author has full protection under
the copyright law?

Question: Doesn't this mean that if the author of a post archived, without
	  specific permission mind you - implied by subscription perhaps,
          has the legal right to remove it from said archive?

Question: Wouldn't a refusal mean an open violation of copyright law?
