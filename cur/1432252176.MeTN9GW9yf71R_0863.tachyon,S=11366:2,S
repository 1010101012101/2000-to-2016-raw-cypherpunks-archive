Just FYI:

Chrome OS devices are not subject to roll back attacks because the verified
boot does not allow that.  Google has extensive documentation on this, and
you can review the implementation by viewing the source code.  Rollback
attacks were an attack vector they specifically designed to prevent.  In
fact as a chrome OS user this is as much an disadvantage as it an
advantage: updates are forced- you can not go back and bug regressions
which don't effect security but that are annoying can occur and there isn't
anything you can do about that.

Also, it isn't just verified boot an attacker would have to overcome.  The
DM verity means any OS and onboard application code must checksum correctly
or it will never run, this is true at all times.  Realize as well that all
of this code is always running off read only file systems.

Note that the builtin data partition (not executable code, in fact data
filesystem is mounted no exec)  encryption is defeatable in the minimal
sense that Chrome OS does allow users to choose to not have to login when
waking from sleep, so user stupidity allows a small opening here.  Heh-
happened to me.  Lost my chromebook and could not remember if I had left it
"locked" (long story!), but I knew it was asleep.  Finderay have had access
to my login session, albeit og little use since I changed my password and I
believe this deactivated access to current email login, eg.  Also
enterprise administrators may have the option of overriding user choice
here, saving users from their stupidity.

Another interesting point: the onboard ssh client is implemented partially
in javavscript (the terminal portion).  Before you whince, know that Google
argues this is more secure than normal ssh Unix clients because in addition
to all the usual ssh protections, it is necessarily running in a Chrome
sandbox!  They are probably right about that?  I think so.

Finally, I wrote up some stuff on their wiki: you can run in dev mode but
still have fully verified boot and auto update.  This gives the machine a
larger local attack surface (not remote though), but opens access to some
Unix user land such as the onboard openssl which you could use for
additional encryption.

Not too that chrome is devices share well and do while totally protecting
users from each other.

Not a security expert myself.  But I have been administering Unix systems
fulltime for over 15 years.  No question in my mind that these things are
more secure BY FAR than any other off the shelf solution you can buy as a
consumer.  That a normal Unix distro could be made to be as secure is IMO
not true as well.

Google has of course just made Chrome OS the target for their Pawnium
challenge this year.  Should be interesting!
