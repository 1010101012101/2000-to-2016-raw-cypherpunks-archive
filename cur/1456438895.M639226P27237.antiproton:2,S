The QA department is not responsible to understand how the code
(or gadget) works, they are responsible to verify that it does
work, and that the "thing that worked" is the thing that ships in
the product it goes with.

Conversely, whoever designed and implemented the cryptographic
system baked into the Apple hardware in question had /better/ be
aware of how to attack it:  Otherwise, a 3rd party's job when
attempting to break the system is likely to be way too easy.

The same people who made it /do/ need to be able to inspect their
own work, especially during the initial development and
implementation process, and the tools to do so will be familiar to
them.  That makes them just the right folks to ask for advice and
assistance when it's time to develop a process for unwrapping the
package they made.

The ability to monitor the supply chain inbound to the machinist,
measure the parts the machinist makes and track them to their
final destination in a larger assembly external customer, does not
imply the ability to prescribe a specific manufacturing process,
make the part in question, or to evaluate its fitness for use for
a particular purpose.  Those latter functions, and creation of
specifications as acceptance criteria, are jobs for design and
production engineers.

Dozens who want to hire them, worldwide; hundreds who will never
hire them, in their local job market.  Generally speaking,
business owners, executives and managers regard "whistleblowers"
and "refusniks" as proven troublemakers.

A Judge can order just about anyone to do just about anything,
subject only to the approval of other Judges up the chain of
command /if/ their legal authority to issue the order is challenged.

Yup.
