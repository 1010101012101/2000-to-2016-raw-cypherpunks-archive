It's not so much about weaponry, I don't think.  It's about 
organization and communication.  Muskets, in the hands of people 
who actually know where to point them and when, are still just 
as effective against mafia (et al) as they have always been. 

But it has become far more difficult to keep track of where to 
point them and when -- partly as a result of advances in surveillance 
and the availability of information about people that is beyond their 
physical control, threats against an individual can originate from 
far more quarters and in far more ways than ever before. 

These days I don't think of physical weapons as the appropriate 
tools of the revolutionary.  And face it; the "barriers to entry" 
are sufficiently large that they cannot practically be overcome 
on that score.  If you go pointing guns at government types, or 
even mere mafiosi, then sooner or later you will die. Because 
of the immediate response to weapons, the only resources you will 
take down first are those defined as expendable - police officers, 
treasury agents, low-level legbreakers, whatever.  These are 
resources that the organization can replace instantly and painlessly, 
and which will not cause it any real pain.

But these organizations have hierarchies.  Because they are not 
fully distributed, there are resources within each organization 
that serve a role or function, or have privelege, that is not 
the same as that of other resources.  If you pick things that 
are extremely hard to replace, and things in the absence of which 
the system will not function, then a very few moves can cripple 
the organization.  Sometimes such moves can be made with a musket, 
if one has sufficient intel. But just as often a pen or a camera 
or a tape recorder will do.

You are not speaking of government-as-we-know-it.  You are speaking 
of something which you envision that may replace government.
