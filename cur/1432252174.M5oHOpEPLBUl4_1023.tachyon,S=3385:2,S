Always a good read :) Part of me wants to see if one giant anonymous
general purpose filesystem will ever come about...

I think this required the use of https to be fully secure, just a
bit of extra setup for that is all.

They use it a lot for that. Admittedly I really should learn more
about the full mechanics of this one.

When I last looked briefly at this one a couple years back, the
users were not necessarily anonymous to each other. It seemed to
require users to know and/or trust one another. If that was the
case, anonymous transport layer would have been required underneath
it to match the level of anonymity the three projects I listed.
Maybe they solved that since then?
