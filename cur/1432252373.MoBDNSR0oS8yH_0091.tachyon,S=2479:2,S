   An anonymous reader writes "According to their website, the ACLU has
   filed a FOIA request seeking information on the new [1]Functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging service being made available to the
   government for use on suspected terrorists which can produce 'live,
   real-time images of people's brains as they answer questions, view
   images, listen to sounds, and respond to other stimuli. [...] These
   brain-scanning technologies are far from ready for forensic uses and
   if deployed will inevitably be misused and misunderstood.", said Barry
   Steinhardt, Director of the ACLU's Technology and Liberty Project.
   "This technology must not be deployed until it is proven effective --
   and we are a long way away from that point, according to scientists in
   the field,"'"
