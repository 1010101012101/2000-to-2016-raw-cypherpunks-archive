Jackson has wonderfully demonstrated how to be a rat, first
covertly, then openly, in order to make money, then save his
skin, even going so far as to act as though he's being punished.
Pity those he screwed, family, friends, associates, customers.

piggy banks, skipping pedo-abuse taxes on his illegal gains.
