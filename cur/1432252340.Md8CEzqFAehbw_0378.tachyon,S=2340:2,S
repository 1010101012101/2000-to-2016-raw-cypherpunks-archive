Ok fine, but what about the old saw that you can't lie to any law
enforcement types?  Are we to assume that no Law Enforcement Officer ever
watches Fox News?

By extension, does that mean any member of the media may lie to a Law
Enforcement Officer?

If so, why does does Fox get to lie, and Joe Spudweiser can't?  

Ok, what if Joe Spudwiser has his own neighborhood newspaper?


Can't have it both ways.  Then again, in this "envrionment" nothing makes
sense other than to assume that everyone is lying.
