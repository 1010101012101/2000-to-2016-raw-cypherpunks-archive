(Came back due to deprecated A/Q - the "lesson" is not feeding trolls, 
good behaviour, etc.)


>  seems every crop of new cypherpunks has to learn this lesson.

[1]

Try to remember the kind of September
  When life was slow, and oh, so mellow.

Try to remember the kind of September
   When grass was green, and grain was Yellow.

Try to remember the kind of September
   When you were a tender and callow Fellow[2].


Try to remember, and if you remember, then follow...




//Alif

-- 
Those who make peaceful change impossible,
make violent revolution inevitable.

An American Spring is coming:
   one way or another.



[1] Taken completely out of context from the Very Off-Broadway "The 
Fantasticks" - a show which was expected to run for a few weeks and then 
enter eternal obscurity.

[2] The original lyric has no capitalization of "Fellow".  Those who can, 
will draw the correct inference.
