One byproduct I'm noticing as a result of the MyDoom virus(es) is that we're 
seeing all sorts of email addresses we've never seen before. Does this mean 
these are all sorts of subscribers' names we've never seen before? Is a 
byproduct of this virus to "out" lurkers?

If that's the case, then it may be worth thinking about some interesting 
possible sources for virii of this type.
