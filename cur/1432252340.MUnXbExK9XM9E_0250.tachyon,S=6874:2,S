Subject: Re: Anonymizing Scam

Given how widely know my email address is, I am saddened that people 
would post this kind of unsubstantiated rumor without any attempt to 
check on the validity.

Anonymizer has always offered its services to all comers. This has 
always included law enforcement. They have used our services to keep 
an eye on certain websites for many years, without tipping them off 
to the focus of their interests. Seeing "fbi.gov" in the log files is 
a bit of a giveaway. They have no special access to our systems, and 
no ability to monitor our users.

Describing our policy of open access as "sucking up to the TLAs" is 
absurd. I would have thought my history in this field would have 
earned me some consideration before jumping to that kind of 
conclusion. Does government and industry have no rights to, or needs 
for, privacy? It seems a hypocritical position for Cypherpunks to 
take.
