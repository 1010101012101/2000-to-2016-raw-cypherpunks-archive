What you have shown is the docket for appeal case 99-30210.
Note:  There are two clues which show that this docket was forged and thus fraudulent.  The docket item number, which is immediately to the right of the date, should be sequential numbers starting from 1 and going up.  SOMETIMES these numbers aren't precisely sequential (they may appear as 1,2,3,5,4... etc) but they should ALWAYS be present.
When I received this docket about June 20, 2003, 29 of the 79 docket entries were MISSING.  That should NEVER happen!  What actually, apparently happened is that the 9th Circuit personnel FORGED (falsified) the docket about May 2000, after they discovered that I was demanding to have an appeal of the lower-court case.  Before that time (say, March 2000) those court personnel believed (correctly, as it happened) that I was not aware of the existence of this court case, 99-30210.  They expected this appeal case to 'die'.  My demand for an appeal, though I was not aware of the existence of 99-30210, really messed things up for them!  They couldn't refuse to give me an appeal, because I was already shown as having an appeal in progress!  
They appointed another corrupt attorney, Jonathan Solovy, to generate an appeal, but it was necessary to FIRST 'manipulate' the docket for 99-30210, to make it appear that this appeal had merely remained dormant in the period July 1999-April 2000. This I believe they did in May 2000.  The backups for appeal case 99-30210 (made during the period June 1999 through August 2000) should show this forgery. Solovy's job (which he did) was to conceal the pre-April 2000 existence of appeal case 99-30210 from me.
