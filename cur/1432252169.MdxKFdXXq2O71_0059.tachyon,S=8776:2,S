Folks:

With the help of new volunteer Patrick McDonald, we're going to start
publishing the Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News. You can see the inaugural
edition in HTML form (attached), in .rst source form (appended), or on
the web at http://tahoe-lafs.org/~zooko/TWN1.html .

We will *not* be sending the Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News to
p2p-hackers every week. Instead we'll set up a site
with an RSS feed that you can subscribe to if you want.

Oh, in fact, maybe we should create a new mailing list named
tahoe-lafs-weekly-news@tahoe-lafs.org that people can subscribe to if
they want the Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News in their inbox. Is anyone out
there interested? Let us know: Patrick McDonald
<marlowe@antagonism.org>, Zooko <zooko@zooko.com>, or
tahoe-dev@tahoe-lafs.org.

Regards,

Zooko

Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News, issue  number 1
==========================================

Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News,
brought to you by Patrick McDonald and Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, scribes.

Announcements and News
======================

Brian Warner is the release manager for 1.9.0_.  The plan for release
is late July with Kevan's Medium-Sized Distributed Mutable Files
(MDMF_) being the major new change. MDMF will implement almost the
same protocol and format as the current SDMF files. However it
provides the following new features:

* efficient random-access reads of arbitrary spans
* fairly efficient random-access writes to arbitrary spans
* allow more than one segment's worth of data

.. _1.9.0: http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/milestone/1.9.0
.. _MDMF: http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/393

Tahoe-LAFS needs people to do code reviews.  There is worry that the
mandatory code review process may be slowly down the project too much.
There are currently fifteen_ tickets which need review. Please help the
project out by reviewing a patch.  This page_ covers how to review a
patch.

.. _fifteen:  http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/query?status=!closed&keywords=~review-needed&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=keywords&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=time&col=changetime&desc=1&order=changetime

Planning has begun for the First International Tahoe-LAFS Summit, to
be held June 27 to June 30, 2011 in San Francisco.

The volunteergrid2_ is looking for inaugural members who meet their
requirements of uptime and capacity.

.. _volunteergrid2: http://www.bigpig.org

Peter Secor on behalf of AllMyData released_ the code for webdrive.
Webdrive_ is a JavaScript UI for Tahoe-LAFS that was developed by
AllMyData.

.. _released: http://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2011-May/006345.html
.. _WebDrive: http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-webdrive/browser

Peter Secor on behalf of AllMyData released the source code for the
Tahoe-LAFS `iPhone client`_.

.. _iPhone client: http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-iphone-client

Patrick McDonald volunteered to provide the Tahoe-LAFS Weekly News and
help with documentation.

Tahoe-LAFS is now one of the backends that git-annex_ can store files
in. git-annex is a tool that uses all of git's machinery for
identifying and tracking files, but stores the actual complete
contents of the files in a separate location instead of in the git
repo itself. See `The RelatedProjects Page`_ on the Tahoe-LAFS wiki
for other cool hacks.
