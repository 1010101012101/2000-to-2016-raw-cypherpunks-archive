I'm also putting up a lot of the software that's currently listed on
freshmeat (gnupg and it's associated library packages, pgp2.6,
some email crypto packages, Perl and python interfaces to crypto,
and a more) up on Gnutella. I will be allowing downloads at a restricted
bandwidth, but hopefully these packages will be picked up and mirrored
across the gnutella network.

For folks interested in getting involved in the effort to assure
crypto access, please check out my comments on pps.sourceforge.net
