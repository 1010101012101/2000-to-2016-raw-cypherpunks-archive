	This is a reference to a Monty Python sketch.  Tarqin
	Fintimlinbin-Whinbimlim-Bus Stop F'Tang F'Tang Ole Biscuit-Barrel
was
	the candidate for the Silly Party.  In case you're wondering, Kevin
	Philips BONG! was the Somewhat Silly Party candidate, and the Very
	Silly Party candidate's name is not possible to type.

These being 'interesting times', life imitates art:

The Official Monster Raving Loony Party has actually run
candidates in Britain, and obtained votes (but not won
any seats, so far as I know).

The North American Silly Party Homepage.
Doesn't look like this is a real one, but you could
