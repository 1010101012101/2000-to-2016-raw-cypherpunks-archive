Is not the aim to demonstrate that by hoisting your flag wherever
that you challenge that definition and fuxor their plans? At least
to the extent that you force them to hypocritically behave in an
unfair or ungentlemanly manner against you, or declare war on you.
All of which serves to support your legitimacy. After all, if you
are 'not' a 'something' as they say, then they would have no such
interest in you at all.

It itself is overhyped in media (RedBull), but the idea of challenge
and independance it represents is buried as too troublesome to
publish lest people get ideas.

It's not a purchase if you leave rights to the existing govt. That's called
a lease. Leasees always lose in the end. Look at Hong Kong.

Independance, set your own rules, the ability to generally say fuck off
and deal with whoever you wish to deal with however. aka: DPRK,
Venezuela, Iran, China, Cuba. It's not supposed to be easy.

Being so closely tied to Britain, Sealand is probably not nearly as clear
a situation as floating a square kilometer platform hundreds of km from
any coast with many countries would be. Say off northern SouthAm,
southeast Asia, west Africa.
