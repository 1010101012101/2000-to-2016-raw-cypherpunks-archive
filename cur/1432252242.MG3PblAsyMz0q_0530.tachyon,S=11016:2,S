While I have no doubt whatsoever that NSA is passively intercepting the 
majority (if not close to all) of the Internet traffic, this article is 
making claims that make no snse. In fact, the authors seem to have a 
fundamental misunderstanding of how te Internet actually works.  Why would 
NSA or anyone else leave cookies laying around for paanoid folk to find?  
It's certainly not necessary for the performance of the surveillance 
mission, and in fact endangers suc a mission - interception above layer 3 
just doesnt make a lot of sense, especially wen reconstruction of the 
higher layer activities is such a straightfoward matter if you capture all 
the layer 3 traffic.

I don't doubt that "we are all suspects now", or that NSA is watcing, but 
I seriously doubt that they are watching the way thse guys believe.  It 
sounds to me like these websites realized that FBI visitors were looking 
at the site and then assumed a lot of facts not in evidence.  Hell, I've 
had LOTS of lettered government visits to various web pages, whether by 
bored employes or for active surveillance - but none of those logged 
visits can be considered to be "secret" surveillance: after all, they left 
logs of their visits for chrissakes!
