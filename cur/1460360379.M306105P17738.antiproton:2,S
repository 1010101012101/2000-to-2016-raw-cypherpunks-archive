This comment was chosen by Mod HS from the post =E2=80=9CInternational<br>
Military Review =E2=80=93 Syria, Feb. 18, 2016=E2=80=9D.=C2=A0 The moderato=
r believes this<br>
comment reflects the West=E2=80=99s obsession with President Vladimir Putin=
<br>
and how their media demonizes him.=C2=A0 The commenter, mmiriww, responds<b=
r>
to the article written by Sharon Tennison. where she shares her<br>
thoughts as the Ukraine situation worsened. Unconscionable<br>
misinformation and hype was being poured on Russia and Vladimir Putin.<br>
Journalists and pundits scoured the Internet and thesauruses to come<br>
up with fiendish new epithets to describe both. Wherever Sharon makes<br>
presentations across America, she finds the first question ominously<br>
asked during Q&amp;A is always, =E2=80=9CWhat about Putin?=E2=80=9D.<br>
<br>
<br>
Comment by mmiriww<br>
Is Putin incorruptible? A U.S. insider=E2=80=99s view of the Russian<br>
president=E2=80=99s character and his country=E2=80=99s transformation.<br>
=E2=80=9CWhat about Putin=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
It=E2=80=99s time to share my thoughts which follow: Putin obviously has hi=
s<br>
faults and makes mistakes. Based on my earlier experience with him,<br>
and the experiences of trusted people, including U.S. officials who<br>
have worked closely with him over a period of years, Putin most likely<br>
is a straight, reliable and exceptionally inventive man. He is<br>
obviously a long-term thinker and planner and has proven to be an<br>
excellent analyst and strategist. He is a leader who can quietly work<br>
toward his goals under mounds of accusations and myths that have been<br>
steadily leveled at him since he became Russia=E2=80=99s second president.<=
br>
I=E2=80=99ve stood by silently watching the demonization of Putin grow sinc=
e<br>
it began in the early 2000s =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 Like others who have had di=
rect<br>
experience with this little known man, I=E2=80=99ve tried to no avail to av=
oid<br>
being labeled a =E2=80=9CPutin apologist=E2=80=9D. If one is even neutral a=
bout him,<br>
they are considered =E2=80=9Csoft on Putin=E2=80=9D by pundits, news hounds=
 and<br>
average citizens who get their news from CNN, Fox and MSNBC.I don=E2=80=99t=
<br>
pretend to be an expert, just a program developer in the USSR and<br>
Russia for the past 30 years. But during this time, I=E2=80=99ve have had f=
ar<br>
more direct, on-ground contact with Russians of all stripes across 11<br>
time zones than any of the Western reporters or for that matter any of<br>
Washington=E2=80=99s officials. I=E2=80=99ve been in country long enough to=
 ponder<br>
Russian history and culture deeply, to study their psychology and<br>
conditioning, and to understand the marked differences between<br>
American and Russian mentalities which so complicate our political<br>
relations with their leaders. As with personalities in a family or a<br>
civic club or in a city hall, it takes understanding and compromise to<br>
be able to create workable relationships when basic conditionings are<br>
different. Washington has been notoriously disinterested in<br>
understanding these differences and attempting to meet Russia<br>
halfway.In addition to my personal experience with Putin, I=E2=80=99ve had<=
br>
discussions with numerous American officials and U.S. businessmen who<br>
have had years of experience working with him =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 I believe=
 it is safe<br>
to say that none would describe him as =E2=80=9Cbrutal=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9Cthuggish=E2=80=9D, or the<br>
other slanderous adjectives and nouns that are repeatedly used in<br>
western media.<br>
<br>
I met Putin years before he ever dreamed of being president of Russia,<br>
as did many of us working in St.Petersburg during the 1990s. Since all<br>
of the slander started, I=E2=80=99ve become nearly obsessed with understand=
ing<br>
his character. I think I=E2=80=99ve read every major speech he has given<br=
>
(including the full texts of his annual hours-long telephone<br>
=E2=80=9Ctalk-ins=E2=80=9D with Russian citizens). I=E2=80=99ve been trying=
 to ascertain<br>
whether he has changed for the worse since being elevated to the<br>
presidency, or whether he is a straight character cast into a role he<br>
never anticipated =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 and is using sheer wits to try to do =
the best he<br>
can to deal with Washington under extremely difficult circumstances.<br>
If the latter is the case, and I think it is, he should get high marks<br>
for his performance over the past 14 years. It=E2=80=99s not by accident th=
at<br>
Forbes declared him the most Powerful Leader of 2013, replacing Obama<br>
who was given the title for 2012. The following is my one personal<br>
experience with Putin.<br>
<br>
The year was 1992=E2=80=A6<br>
<br>
It was two years after the implosion of communism; the place was<br>
St.Petersburg. For years I had been creating programs to open up<br>
relations between the two countries and hopefully to help Soviet<br>
people to get beyond their entrenched top-down mentalities. A new<br>
program possibility emerged in my head. Since I expected it might<br>
require a signature from the Marienskii City Hall, an appointment was<br>
made. My friend Volodya Shestakov and I showed up at a side door<br>
entrance to the Marienskii building. We found ourselves in a small,<br>
dull brown office, facing a rather trim nondescript man in a brown<br>
suit. He inquired about my reason for coming in. After scanning the<br>
proposal I provided he began asking intelligent questions. After each<br>
of my answers, he asked the next relevant question. I became aware<br>
that this interviewer was different from other Soviet bureaucrats who<br>
always seemed to fall into chummy conversations with foreigners with<br>
hopes of obtaining bribes in exchange for the Americans=E2=80=99 requests. =
CCI<br>
stood on the principle that we would never, never give bribes. This<br>
bureaucrat was open, inquiring, and impersonal in demeanor. After more<br>
than an hour of careful questions and answers, he quietly explained<br>
that he had tried hard to determine if the proposal was legal, then<br>
said that unfortunately at the time it was not. A few good words about<br>
the proposal were uttered. That was all. He simply and kindly showed<br>
us to the door. Out on the sidewalk, I said to my colleague, =E2=80=9CVolod=
ya,<br>
this is the first time we have ever dealt with a Soviet bureaucrat who<br>
didn=E2=80=99t ask us for a trip to the US or something valuable!=E2=80=9D =
I remember<br>
looking at his business card in the sunlight =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 it read Vl=
adimir<br>
Vladimirovich Putin.<br>
<br>
1994<br>
<br>
Putin as Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 90s.<br>
<br>
U.S. Consul General Jack Gosnell put in an SOS call to me in<br>
St.Petersburg. He had 14 Congress members and the new American<br>
Ambassador to Russia, Thomas Pickering, coming to St.Petersburg in the<br>
next three days. He needed immediate help. I scurried over to the<br>
Consulate and learned that Jack intended me to brief this auspicious<br>
delegation and the incoming ambassador. I was stunned but he insisted.<br>
They were coming from Moscow and were furious about how U.S. funding<br>
was being wasted there. Jack wanted them to hear the =E2=80=9Cgood news=E2=
=80=9D about<br>
CCI=E2=80=99s programs that were showing fine results. In the next 24 hours=
<br>
Jack and I also set up =E2=80=9Chome=E2=80=9D meetings in a dozen Russian<b=
r>
entrepreneurs=E2=80=99 small apartments for the arriving dignitaries<br>
(St.Petersburg State Department people were aghast, since it had never<br>
been done before =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 but Jack overruled). Only later in 200=
0, did I<br>
learn of Jack=E2=80=99s former three-year experience with Vladimir Putin in=
<br>
the 1990s while the latter was running the city for Mayor Sobchak.<br>
More on this further down.<br>
<br>
December 31, 1999<br>
<br>
With no warning, at the turn of the year, President Boris Yeltsin made<br>
the announcement to the world that from the next day forward he was<br>
vacating his office and leaving Russia in the hands of an unknown<br>
Vladimir Putin. On hearing the news, I thought surely not the Putin I<br>
remembered =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 he could never lead Russia. The next day a N=
YT article<br>
included a photo. Yes, it was the same Putin I=E2=80=99d met years ago! I w=
as<br>
shocked and dismayed, telling friends, =E2=80=9CThis is a disaster for Russ=
ia,<br>
I=E2=80=99ve spent time with this guy, he is too introverted and too<br>
intelligent =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 he will never be able to relate to Russia=
=E2=80=99s masses.=E2=80=9D<br>
Further, I lamented: =E2=80=9CFor Russia to get up off of its knees, two<br=
>
things must happen: 1) The arrogant young oligarchs have to be removed<br>
by force from the Kremlin, and 2) A way must be found to remove the<br>
regional bosses (governors) from their fiefdoms across Russia=E2=80=99s 89<=
br>
regions=E2=80=9D. It was clear to me that the man in the brown suit would<b=
r>
never have the instincts or guts to tackle Russia=E2=80=99s overriding twin=
<br>
challenges.<br>
<br>
February 2000<br>
<br>
Almost immediately Putin began putting Russia=E2=80=99s oligarchs on edge. =
In<br>
February a question about the oligarchs came up; he clarified with a<br>
question and his answer: =E2=80=9CWhat should be the relationship with the<=
br>
so-called oligarchs? The same as anyone else. The same as the owner of<br>
a small bakery or a shoe repair shop.=E2=80=9D This was the first signal th=
at<br>
the tycoons would no longer be able to flaunt government regulations<br>
or count on special access in the Kremlin. It also made the West=E2=80=99s<=
br>
capitalists nervous. After all, these oligarchs were wealthy<br>
untouchable businessmen =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 good capitalists, never mind th=
at they got<br>
their enterprises illegally and were putting their profits in offshore<br>
banks.<br>
<br>
Four months later Putin called a meeting with the oligarchs and gave<br>
them his deal: They could keep their illegally-gained wealth-producing<br>
Soviet enterprises and they would not be nationalized =E2=80=A6. IF taxes w=
ere<br>
paid on their revenues and if they personally stayed out of politics.<br>
This was the first of Putin=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Celegant solutions=E2=80=9D t=
o the near<br>
impossible challenges facing the new Russia. But the deal also put<br>
Putin in crosshairs with US media and officials who then began to<br>
champion the oligarchs, particularly Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The latter<br>
became highly political, didn=E2=80=99t pay taxes, and prior to being<br>
apprehended and jailed was in the process of selling a major portion<br>
of Russia=E2=80=99s largest private oil company, Yukos Oil, to Exxon Mobil.=
<br>
Unfortunately, to U.S. media and governing structures, Khodorkovsky<br>
became a martyr (and remains so up to today).<br>
<br>
March 2000<br>
<br>
I arrived in St.Petersburg. A Russian friend (a psychologist) since<br>
1983 came for our usual visit. My first question was, =E2=80=9CLena what do=
<br>
you think about your new president?=E2=80=9D She laughed and retorted,<br>
=E2=80=9CVolodya! I went to school with him!=E2=80=9D She began to describe=
 Putin as a<br>
quiet youngster, poor, fond of martial arts, who stood up for kids<br>
being bullied on the playgrounds. She remembered him as a patriotic<br>
youth who applied for the KGB prematurely after graduating secondary<br>
school (they sent him away and told him to get an education). He went<br>
to law school, later reapplied and was accepted. I must have grimaced<br>
at this, because Lena said, =E2=80=9CSharon in those days we all admired th=
e<br>
KGB and believed that those who worked there were patriots and were<br>
keeping the country safe. We thought it was natural for Volodya to<br>
choose this career. My next question was, =E2=80=9CWhat do you think he wil=
l<br>
do with Yeltsin=E2=80=99s criminals in the Kremlin?=E2=80=9D Putting on her=
<br>
psychologist hat, she pondered and replied, =E2=80=9CIf left to his normal<=
br>
behaviors, he will watch them for a while to be sure what is going on,<br>
then he will throw up some flares to let them know that he is<br>
watching. If they don=E2=80=99t respond, he will address them personally, t=
hen<br>
if the behaviors don=E2=80=99t change =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 some will be in p=
rison in a couple<br>
of years.=E2=80=9D I congratulated her via email when her predictions began=
 to<br>
show up in real time.<br>
<br>
Throughout the 2000s<br>
<br>
St.Petersburg=E2=80=99s many CCI alumni were being interviewed to determine=
<br>
how the PEP business training program was working and how we could<br>
make the U.S. experience more valuable for their new small businesses.<br>
Most believed that the program had been enormously important, even<br>
life changing. Last, each was asked, =E2=80=9CSo what do you think of your =
new<br>
president?=E2=80=9D None responded negatively, even though at that time<br>
entrepreneurs hated Russia=E2=80=99s bureaucrats. Most answered similarly,<=
br>
=E2=80=9CPutin registered my business a few years ago=E2=80=9D. Next questi=
on, =E2=80=9CSo,<br>

<br>
Late 2000<br>
<br>
Into Putin=E2=80=99s first year as Russia=E2=80=99s president, US officials=
 seemed to<br>
me to be suspect that he would be antithetical to America=E2=80=99s interes=
ts<br>
=E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 his every move was called into question in American med=
ia. I<br>
couldn=E2=80=99t understand why and was chronicling these happenings in my<=
br>
computer and newsletters.<br>
<br>
Year 2001<br>
<br>
Jack Gosnell (former USCG mentioned earlier) explained his<br>
relationship with Putin when the latter was deputy mayor of<br>
St.Petersburg. The two of them worked closely to create joint ventures<br>
and other ways to promote relations between the two countries. Jack<br>
related that Putin was always straight up, courteous and helpful. When<br>
Putin=E2=80=99s wife, Ludmila, was in a severe auto accident, Jack took the=
<br>
liberty (before informing Putin) to arrange hospitalization and<br>
airline travel for her to get medical care in Finland. When Jack told<br>
Putin, he reported that the latter was overcome by the generous offer,<br>
but ended saying that he couldn=E2=80=99t accept this favor, that Ludmila<b=
r>
would have to recover in a Russian hospital. She did =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 al=
though<br>
medical care in Russia was abominably bad in the 1990s.<br>
<br>
A senior CSIS officer I was friends with in the 2000s worked closely<br>
with Putin on a number of joint ventures during the 1990s. He reported<br>
that he had no dealings with Putin that were questionable, that he<br>
respected him and believed he was getting an undeserved dour<br>
reputation from U.S. media. Matter of fact, he closed the door at CSIS<br>
when we started talking about Putin. I guessed his comments wouldn=E2=80=99=
t<br>
be acceptable if others were listening.<br>
<br>
Another former U.S. official who will go unidentified, also reported<br>
working closely with Putin, saying there was never any hint of<br>
bribery, pressuring, nothing but respectable behaviors and<br>
helpfulness.<br>
<br>
I had two encounters in 2013 with State Department officials regarding Puti=
n:<br>
<br>
At the first one, I felt free to ask the question I had previously<br>
yearned to get answered: =E2=80=9CWhen did Putin become unacceptable to<br>
Washington officials and why? Without hesitating the answer came back:<br>
=E2=80=9C=E2=80=98The knives were drawn=E2=80=99 when it was announced that=
 Putin would be the<br>
next president.=E2=80=9D I questioned WHY? The answer: =E2=80=9CI could nev=
er find out<br>
why =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 maybe because he was KGB.=E2=80=9D I offered that B=
ush #I, was head of<br>
the CIA. The reply was, =E2=80=9CThat would have made no difference, he was=
<br>
our guy.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
The second was a former State Department official with whom I recently<br>
shared a radio interview on Russia. Afterward when we were chatting, I<br>
remarked, =E2=80=9CYou might be interested to know that I=E2=80=99ve collec=
ted<br>
experiences of Putin from numerous people, some over a period of<br>
years, and they all say they had no negative experiences with Putin<br>
and there was no evidence of taking bribes=E2=80=9D. He firmly replied, =E2=
=80=9CNo<br>
one has ever been able to come up with a bribery charge against<br>
Putin.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
&gt;From 2001 up to today, I=E2=80=99ve watched the negative U.S. media mou=
nting<br>
against Putin =E2=80=A6. even accusations of assassinations, poisonings, an=
d<br>
comparing him to Hitler. No one yet has come up with any concrete<br>
evidence for these allegations. During this time, I=E2=80=99ve traveled<br>
throughout Russia several times every year, and have watched the<br>
country slowly change under Putin=E2=80=99s watch. Taxes were lowered,<br>
inflation lessened, and laws slowly put in place. Schools and<br>
hospitals began improving. Small businesses were growing, agriculture<br>
was showing improvement, and stores were becoming stocked with food.<br>
Alcohol challenges were less obvious, smoking was banned from<br>
buildings, and life expectancy began increasing. Highways were being<br>
laid across the country, new rails and modern trains appeared even in<br>
far out places, and the banking industry was becoming dependable.<br>
Russia was beginning to look like a decent country =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 cert=
ainly not<br>
where Russians hoped it to be long term, but improving incrementally<br>
for the first time in their memories.<br>
<br>
My 2013/14 Trips to Russia Modern Russia, thriving<br>
<br>
In addition to St.Petersburg and Moscow, in September I traveled out<br>
to the Ural Mountains, spent time in Ekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and<br>
Perm. We traveled between cities via autos and rail =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 the=
 fields and<br>
forests look healthy, small towns sport new paint and construction.<br>
Today=E2=80=99s Russians look like Americans (we get the same clothing from=
<br>
China). Old concrete Khrushchev block houses are giving way to new<br>
multi-story private residential complexes which are lovely. High-rise<br>
business centers, fine hotels and great restaurants are now common<br>
place =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 and ordinary Russians frequent these places. Two =
and three<br>
story private homes rim these Russian cities far from Moscow. We<br>
visited new museums, municipal buildings and huge super markets.<br>
Streets are in good repair, highways are new and well marked now,<br>
service stations looks like those dotting American highways. In<br>
January I went to Novosibirsk out in Siberia where similar new<br>
architecture was noted. Streets were kept navigable with constant<br>
snowplowing, modern lighting kept the city bright all night, lots of<br>
new traffic lights (with seconds counting down to light change) have<br>
appeared. It is astounding to me how much progress Russia has made in<br>
the past 14 years since an unknown man with no experience walked into<br>
Russia=E2=80=99s presidency and took over a country that was flat on its<br=
>
belly.<br>
<br>
So why do our leaders and media demean and demonize Putin and Russia???<br>
<br>
Like Lady MacBeth, do they protest too much?<br>
<br>
Psychologists tell us that people (and countries?) project off on<br>
others what they don=E2=80=99t want to face in themselves. Others carry our=
<br>
=E2=80=9Cshadow=E2=80=9D when we refuse to own it. We confer on others the =
very traits<br>
that we are horrified to acknowledge in ourselves.<br>
<br>
Could this be why we constantly find fault with Putin and Russia?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we project on to Putin the sins of ourselves and our leade=
rs?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we condemn Russia=E2=80=99s corruption, acting like the<br=
>
corruption within our corporate world doesn=E2=80=99t exist?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we condemn their human rights and LGBT issues, not<br>
facing the fact that we haven=E2=80=99t solved our own?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we accuse Russia of =E2=80=9Creconstituting the USSR=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93<br>
because of what we do to remain the world=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Chegemon=E2=80=
=9D?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we project nationalist behaviors on Russia, because<br>
that is what we have become and we don=E2=80=99t want to face it?<br>
<br>
Could it be that we project warmongering off on Russia, because of<br>
what we have done over the past several administrations?<br>
<br>
There is a well known code of ethics among us: Is it the Truth, Is it<br>
Fair, Does it build Friendship and Goodwill, and Will it be Beneficial<br>
for All Concerned?<br>
<br>
It seems to me that if our nation=E2=80=99s leaders would commit to using<b=
r>
these four principles in international relations, the world would<br>
operate in a completely different manner, and human beings across this<br>
planet would live in better conditions than they do today.<br>

US Military Chopper Transfers ISIL Leaders from Fallujah to Unknown<br>
Location - 21 February 2016<br>
<br>
Informed sources disclosed that a US-made helicopter has taken several<br>
senior ISIL leaders out of Anbar province in Western Iraq to an<br>
unknown location.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CA US chopper landed in a farm near the main road linking<br>
al-Saqlaviyeh to Fallujah in Anbar province and took off=C2=A0 after one<br=
>
hour with ISIL leaders on board,=E2=80=9D the Arabic-language Sama Baghdad<=
br>
news website quoted informed Iraqi sources in Fallujah city as saying<br>
on Sunday.<br>
<br>
The sources noted that several ISIL leaders had gathered in Fallujah<br>
farm as if they had been informed of the helicopter=E2=80=99s imminent land=
ing<br>
in the farm.<br>
<br>
In a relevant development on February 13, senior Iraqi security<br>
sources lashed out at the US and its regional allies for supporting<br>
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, and said that Washington is the main cause<br>
of ISIL=E2=80=99s survival in his country.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CWe have compelling evidence that a US helicopter landed in Albu Ar=
im<br>
palms of Fallujah city to take out the ISIL leaders who were in<br>
contact with the Americans,=E2=80=9D a senior Iraqi security official,<br>
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told FNA.<br>
<br>
He noted that other US aircraft were flying over the region to protect<br>
the airplane which was boarding the ISIL leaders, adding, =E2=80=9CThe US t=
ook<br>
out the ISIL leaders in order to rescue them from possible attacks by<br>
the Iraqi Army and security forces.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
In relevant remarks in October, Spokesman of Iraq=E2=80=99s Kata=E2=80=99ib=
 Hezbollah<br>
(Hezbollah Battalions) popular forces Jafar al-Hosseini disclosing<br>
that captured ISIL leaders have acknowledged receiving logistical<br>
backup and intelligence support from the US.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CAs the ISIL commanders captured in Iraqi popular forces=E2=80=99 r=
ecent<br>
military operations have confessed, the US supports for the terrorist<br>
groups are not limited to the dispatch of logistical support,=E2=80=9D<br>
Al-Hosseini told FNA.<br>
<br>
He reiterated that the US has provided the ISIL with intelligence<br>
about the Iraqi forces=E2=80=99 positions and targets.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CISIL commanders trusted the US officials who had assured them that=
<br>
the Iraqi forces would not attack Fallujah because the US had urged<br>
the Iraqi government to prevent the popular forces from entering<br>
Fallujah and raid Beiji instead; hence the terrorists left Fallujah<br>
for Beiji to stay on the alert in there,=E2=80=9D Al-Hosseini added.<br>
<br>
Al-Hosseini had also stated on Wednesday that his forces plan to win<br>
back the city of Ramadi only after expelling the American forces from<br>
Anbar province.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9COur forces have two operations underway; first seizing Ramadi from=
<br>
ISIL and second keeping away the American forces from Anbar province,=E2=80=
=9D<br>
al-Hosseini told FNA.<br>
<br>
He underlined that preventing the US forces from getting close to<br>
Anbar province will expedite operations for winning back the province,<br>
specially after the military operations in Salahuddin province that<br>
led to the liberation of the city of Beiji.<br>
<br>
Iraqi officials have on different occasions blasted the US and its<br>
allies for supplying the ISIL in Syria with arms and ammunition under<br>
the pretext of fighting the Takfiri terrorist group.<br>
<br>
Also in October, the Iraqi army and volunteer forces discovered<br>
US-made military hardware and ammunition, including anti-armor<br>
missiles, in terrorists=E2=80=99 positions and trenches captured during the=
<br>
operations in the Fallujah region in Al-Anbar province.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi forces found a huge volume of advanced TOW-II missiles from<br>
the Takfiri terrorists in al-Karama city of Fallujah.<br>
<br>
The missiles were brand new and the ISIL had transferred them to<br>
Fallujah to use them against the Iraqi army=E2=80=99s armored units.<br>
<br>
On October 10, the Iraqi forces discovered US-made military hardware<br>
and ammunition from terrorists in Beiji.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThe military hardware and weapons had been airdropped by the US-le=
d<br>
warplanes and choppers for the ISIL in the nearby areas of Beiji,=E2=80=9D<=
br>
military sources told FNA.<br>
<br>
In February 2015, an Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the<br>
western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri<br>
terrorists in Iraq, revealing that the US airplanes still continue to<br>
airdrop weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL terrorists.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThe US planes have dropped weapons for the ISIL terrorists in the<=
br>
areas under ISIL control and even in those areas that have been<br>
recently liberated from the ISIL control to encourage the terrorists<br>
to return to those places,=E2=80=9D Coordinator of Iraqi popular forces Jaf=
ar<br>
al-Jaberi told FNA.<br>
<br>
He noted that eyewitnesses in Al-Havijeh of Kirkuk province had<br>
witnessed the US airplanes dropping several suspicious parcels for<br>
ISIL terrorists in the province.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CTwo coalition planes were also seen above the town of Al-Khas in<b=
r>
Diyala and they carried the Takfiri terrorists to the region that has<br>
recently been liberated from the ISIL control,=E2=80=9D Al-Jaberi said.<br>
<br>
Also in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq=E2=80=99s army=
<br>
has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the<br>
ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThe Iraqi Parliament=E2=80=99s National Security and Defense Commi=
ttee has<br>
access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed<br>
while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,=E2=80=9D Head of the committ=
ee<br>
Hakem al-Zameli said.<br>
<br>
He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this rega=
rd.<br>
<br>
The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in<br>
Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in<br>
al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes<br>
that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the<br>
terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation<br>
in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as<br>
it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.<br>
<br>
Also in February 2015, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out<br>
at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting<br>
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons<br>
have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CWe have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and<=
br>
Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL=E2=80=99s control in Al-Baqdadi<b=
r>
region,=E2=80=9D the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincia=
l<br>
Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.<br>
<br>
He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel<br>
were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city<br>
of Ramadi.<br>
<br>
Meantime, Head of Iraqi Parliament=E2=80=99s National Security and Defense<=
br>
Committee Hakem al-Zameli also disclosed that the anti-ISIL<br>
coalition=E2=80=99s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL =
in<br>
Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.<br>
<br>
In January 2015, al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main<br>
cause of ISIL=E2=80=99s survival in Iraq.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThere are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition=E2=80=99s m=
ilitary aid<br>
to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),=E2=80=9D he told FNA at th=
e<br>
time.<br>
<br>
He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that<br>
the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft<br>
weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation<br>
committee to probe into the matter.<br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThe US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing abo=
ut<br>
the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the<br>
reality with its allegations.<br>
<br>
He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence<br>
provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the<br>
popular forces, and said, =E2=80=9CThese documents are given to the<br>
investigation committee =E2=80=A6 and the necessary measures will be taken =
to<br>
protect the Iraqi airspace.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
Also in January 2015, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that<br>
the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL=E2=80=99s survival in Iraq.<=
br>
<br>
=E2=80=9CThe international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the I=
SIL<br>
and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,=E2=80=9D Jome<b=
r>
Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament,<br>
said.<br>
<br>
He said the coalition=E2=80=99s support for the ISIL is now evident to<br>
everyone, and continued, =E2=80=9CThe coalition has not targeted ISIL=E2=80=
=99s main<br>
positions in Iraq.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
In Late December 2014, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense<br>
Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist<br>
organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.<br>
<br>
MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out<br>
that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin<br>
province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.<br>
<br>
He added that the US and the international coalition are =E2=80=9Cnot serio=
us<br>
in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the<br>
technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and<br>
destroy them in one month=E2=80=9D.<br>
<br>
Gharawi added that =E2=80=9Cthe US is trying to expand the time of the war<=
br>
against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have<br>
its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.=E2=80=9D<br>

Although the 2016 presidential election is still in the primaries<br>
phase, contenders have already brought up America=E2=80=99s failed foreign<=

wars. Hillary Clinton is taking flak over Libya, and Donald Trump has<br>
irked the GOP by bringing up Iraq. But what of Kosovo?<br>
<br>
The US-led NATO operation that began on March 24, 1999 was launched<br>
under the =E2=80=9Cresponsibility to protect=E2=80=9D doctrine asserted by =
President<br>
Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. For 78 days, NATO<br>
targeted what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia =E2=80=93 which<b=

Clinton visited the renegade province in October 2012, as the outgoing<br>
Secretary of State. She stood with the =E2=80=98Kosovan=E2=80=99 government=

her comments were hardly a surprise.<br>
<br>
She is unlikely to be condemned for those remarks by her rival for the<br>
Democratic presidential nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.<br>
While arguing that Congress should have a say in authorizing the<br>
intervention, Sanders entirely bought into the mainstream narrative<br>
about the conflict, seeing it as a case of the evil Serbian =E2=80=9Cdictat=
or=E2=80=9D<br>
Slobodan Milosevic oppressing the unarmed ethnic Albanians. He saw<br>

<br>

After George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, his administration<br>
adopted the Clinton-era agenda for the Balkans, including backing an<br>
independent Albanian state in Kosovo. None of the Republicans, save<br>
2012 contender Ron Paul, have criticized the Kosovo War since.<br>
<br>
Billionaire businessman Donald Trump actually has been critical =E2=80=93<b=

and the bane of the GOP establishment. In October that year, Trump was<br>

<br>
This man gave me my first professional tape recorder (his own). With<br>
this man I drank wine at night in the town of Pale near Sarajevo in<br>
March, 1993, during the Bosnian War, with him reading me his poems in<br>
Serbian. A poet and psychiatrist, the Serbian politician Radovan<br>
Karadjic was=C2=A0 sentenced ( <a href=3D"http://www.kp.ru/daily/26508.4/33=

40 years&#39; imprisonment by a duplicitous International Criminal<br>
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for =E2=80=98crimes against humanity=E2=

own of Srebrenica<br>
when he had nothing to do with it. He was a politician, not a general.<br>
(By the way, when the =E2=80=98world community=E2=80=99 refers to the massa=
cre of<br>
Muslim men in Srebrenica, it forgets that it was in reprisal for the<br>
murder of Serbian villagers in neighboring towns and villages).<br>
<br>
There was a cruel civil war taking place in Bosnia back then, which<br>
began with shootings at a Serbian wedding party in Sarajevo. Bosnian<br>
Muslims got help from the West and the Muslim world, but no one helped<br>
the Serbs. Even Russia, though making loud statements, refused to<br>
supply arms.<br>
<br>
The Bosnian Muslims received $2 billion (!) to purchase arms over the<br>
3 years of the war, and 4,500 Al-Qaeda jihadists came to the country<br>
thanks to the US, including Osama Ben Laden. They cut off Serbs=E2=80=99 he=
ads<br>
and threw them like cabbages into a basket. We have shocking<br>
photographs <a href=3D"http://www.kp.ru/share/i/4/1084796/big.png" rel=3D"n=

 (not<br>
recommended for people under 18 and sensitive adults) of those<br>
murders. The murderers are still alive and recruiting new young<br>
terrorists around the world, including for ISIS.=C2=A0 When arrested, they<=
br>
were provided with new passports. And now for that interview with<br>
Karadjic.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &quot;My job was great=E2=80=9D, - he said. =E2=80=9CThousand=
s of Serbs were liberated<br>
and avoided genocide. Our biggest mistake was poor propaganda. The<br>
world is against us because we were proud and didn=E2=80=99t want to be<br>
humiliated by making excuses. We let this happen, and now the world<br>
considers Serbs evil incarnate.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Yes, it=E2=80=99s bad for us. But as a psychiatrist, I can sa=
y that the<br>
law that applies to an individual, such as =E2=80=98stay alone and you will=
<br>
become mature=E2=80=99, also applies to a nation. Forced isolation will bre=
ak<br>
him down if he is spiritually weak, or he will rise above it, if he is<br>
worth it. Now the Serbs are alone but this will bring them spiritual<br>
growth and wisdom. God knows we are in the right.=E2=80=9D<br>
<br>
Sometimes it seems to me that he=E2=80=99s talking about us Russians.<br>
