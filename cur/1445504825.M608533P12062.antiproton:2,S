What is the state of the art in malware owning the human, not just the
box?

...or DoS the human, making them inoperable.

Maybe it is something like 25th frame, possibly with auditory vector.

Or better remote hypnosis.

IIRC on some forum about epilepsy someone posted ``weird image'' which
causes severe crisis in some epileptics of certain form.

Some info about 25th frame:

According to Solntsev, one computer virus capable of affecting a
person's psyche is Russian Virus 666. It manifests itself in every 25th
frame of a visual display, where it produces a combination of colors
that allegedly put computer operators into a trance. The subconscious
perception of the new pattern eventually results in arrhythmia of the
heart. Other Russian computer specialists, not just Solntsev, talk
openly about this "25th frame effect" and its ability to subtly manage a
computer user's perceptions. The purpose of this technique is to inject
a thought into the viewer's subconscious. It may remind some of the
subliminal advertising controversy in the United States in the late
1950s.

F-secure claims:
Russian Virus 666
There is no virus by this name.

IIRC spammers used it for spam in animated images
