Considering your logic so far, this doesn't surprise me.

Exactly, and you ASSUMED A PRIORI that I would accept your definitions
without stipulation.

Since you're the representative of the 'government' and are making the
prooposal it is standard practice that the 'opposition' get to question
the definitions for relevency.

I did, you lost. Your definition of 'war' and 'terrorism' are inaccurate.

The claim that there is some 'legal definition' that prevents 'nations' or
'states' from participating in 'terrorism' is inaccurate. Even the US
(whose laws I'm ASSUMING you're are refering to) recognizes 'state
sponsored terrorism'.

In short the very pillars of your argument have been demonstrated to be
false. Your argument failed.

In responce you're not ingaging in straw man and ad hominim hoping that
nobody will notice.

Come back when you can play with adults.
