All true. And it's not as if the penalty, even if considered criminal,
would be anything more than trivial [1]. Further, if you are a business
owner who is judged against
- personally, you are your own employer so nobody can fire you.
- business license pulled, liquidate and sell it back to yourself.
A jury would likely "you're here for publishing this? Lol, go home."
The actual risk seems rather low. I'd do it just for the fame.

The US isn't doing so hot right now in the world reputation

being welcomed to stay for protesting your dissatifaction,
are probably approaching good.
