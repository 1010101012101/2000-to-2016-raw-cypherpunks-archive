For defense, yes.  The @stakes of the world will show vulnerabilities
in generic systems.  They will have automated tools for this.  
Having found a hole, they mark it and move on.

However the TLAs will invest in mapping these holes (and not notifying
anyone, including the public about new vulnerabilities) and in developing a
different and more aggressive strain of tools.  Different needs (defense
vs. offense) yield different tools.
