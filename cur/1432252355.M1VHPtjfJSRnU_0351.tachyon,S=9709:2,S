One can afford what they wish to give to and thus expect to get from
the network in return, no more, no less, as always. (Be it literally
from the physical  NIC network, or the logical networks created by
their applications riding over and within the physical.)

Full meshing of chaff addressed to all participants seems unnecessary.

That's the simple man's kneejerk response when initially contemplating
chaffed networks.

This depends on if you're network is a low latency one, or if it
uses a store and forward model. Even that is tricky due to
needs to hide the size of data each endpoint exchanges from
passive adversaries. It begins to approach constant higher
rate the more you data wish to pass securely.

Then you must wait until you can pass your wheat. Or plan your
needs according to the give and get model.

Delays (trading latency) are not the only way to achieve security.
You may also elect to trade available throughput bandwidth in a
wheat/chaff system.

There were some research references posted in the threads below.

Yes, a lot of oppurtunity exists to create new working networks
in this area that utilize fill traffic and/or delay.


You may want to review the recent guardian-dev and tor-dev side
threads below on this exact subject of link padding, latency and
analysis. Relavent papers and talk have been posted.
