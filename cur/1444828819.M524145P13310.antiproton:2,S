I would be surprised if he did deliver docs to the Russians.  Now
that we have had a better look at him, it seems that our Mr.
Snowden is a bit of a fiend for OpSec.  As such, I can't see him
carrying red hot docs, or the means of accessing them, around with
him after confirmed delivery to Greenwald & Co.  In the first
place, doing so would make him a more valuable target for multiple
State actors.  Second, it would provide a big reward to anyone who
might have managed to snatch him and turn him inside out; if he
had nothing, it would at least provide him the satisfaction of
knowing that his captors got nothing of value out of him.

Since it's very credible that Russia was not his intended
destination, the concept of buying his way in with classified
information (a la Lee Oswald) just doesn't fit.  Russia's handling
of Snowden so far has been consistent with their propaganda
objective of appearing to be morally superior to their US/NATO
adversaries in Cold War II.  One might also note that Snowden has
always spoken politely of his Russian hosts but has not made any
overtly pro-Russian propaganda broadcasts.
