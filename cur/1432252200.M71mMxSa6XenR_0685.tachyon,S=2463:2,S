HOUSTON -- Dell Inc. today is expected to add its support to an industry
effort to beef up desktop and notebook PC security by installing a
dedicated chip that adds security and privacy-specific features, according
to people familiar with its plans.

Dell will disclose plans to add the security features known as the Trusted
Computing Module on all its personal computers. Its support comes in the
wake of similar endorsements by PC industry giants Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines
Corp. The technology has been promoted by an industry organization called
the Trusted Computing Group.

The company is also expected to unveil new network PCs.
