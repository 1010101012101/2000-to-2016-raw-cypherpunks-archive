The feds that I know were uniformly terrified of any OOB activity prior to
9/11, in the absence of a secure authorizing paper trail (hard to get at
that time).

They are a lot more at ease nowadays :-/

What really interesting is that they don't see this.  Honestly, they
don't.  I've had endless discussions with not just feds, but state and
locals too - only one (and sometimes two) out of ~30 see that there is any
incongruity between what is, and what was intended to be.  Most of them
honestly believe that they are "handcuffed" with "too much restrictive
policy".

Perception is everything...
