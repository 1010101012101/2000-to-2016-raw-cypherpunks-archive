Just so. And some of the recent "remailers can't work" critics 
(Dillinger, Farr) are breathtakingly ignorant of what was common 
knowledge in 1992. Worse, they haven't heeded recommendations that 
they get themselves up to speed.

There is no sign that even the technologies described above 
(wireless, throwaways, worm-based, surreptitious, etc.) are needed to 
achieve excellent untraceability. A distributed set of remailers in N 
different jurisdictions is quite robust against prosecutorial fishing 
expeditions, though not as robust as we want against attacks by much 
more capable adversaries.

Ways to increase robustness have been discussed many times. (Increase 
N, increase pool sizes at each stage, adopt constant-bandwidth 
approaches like Pipenet, throw in wireless and "rooms full of 
remailers" approaches, even adopt DC-Net methods as cores for 
sub-nets.)

Dillinger and Farr have described only sophomoric attacks. Even the 
remailers of 1995-6 defeated the Scientologists.

Crap about IP addresses being traceable is just obfuscation to cover 
basic ignorance of how remailer networks work.
