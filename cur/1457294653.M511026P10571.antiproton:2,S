	I don't think so. There may have been some backlash caused by
	'excessive' police brutality, but overall the state's grip keeps
	tightening. And surveillance is a key factor.

	Also, if they kill a bit too many people and that hurts their
	'public relations' efforts, all they have to do is kill a bit
	less people. But it's not like the US state killers are going
	to surrender their guns any time soon.

	Yes, that's part of the damage. Given those problems (and there
	are more), how can you 'welcome' total surveillance?

	One would think that exactly the opposite happens.

	It's basic incentives... If doing X gets people jailed, maimed
	or killed, then people are less likely to do X, not more likely.

	That's nice wishful thinking but it doesn't address the
	original point : why should be mass surveillance be welcomed?

	That's a basic fact. It is THE basic fact of 'political
	theory'. I could in turn retort that trying to obscure that
	fact is propaganda...

	Anyway, I should have been more precise. State power
	comes from guns and organization. People who go against the
	state are ultimately facing an efficient organization of
	killers. Victims of the state are outgunned and outnumbered.
	
	It should be obvious that total surveillance on the hands of
	such organization is very problematic.

	That depends on particular circumstances. I wasn't
	primarily advocating armed conflict anyway...

	I agree.

	Well, yes. And intimidation and outright violence are pretty
	useful tools. It's not just 'propaganda' (although propaganda
	does play an important role)

	Like I said I should have mentioned that organization is the
	other source of state power, even more effective than guns if
	you wish. So, in order to counter the state organization some
	sort of coordination is required...

	Come on Steve =)

	You seem to believe that the state is done for because of its 
	'internal contradictions' or something like that but the
	evidence shows exactly the opposite. State power keeps growing.
	And the surveillance mechanisms you said you 'welcome' play an
	important role in extending state power, not limiting it.

	Meanwhile you can provide evidence supporting this claims 

	
	"the abuses of power [surveillance?] enables have already killed
	the State" 

	The state is alive and kicking.


	"a trans-national State hard wired for self destruction,
	defending that program by any means necessary, is "already
	dead."	

	Fact is, the most powerful nation states, 'led' by the american
	nation state can morph into a transnational state. Allegedly
	they already are morphing. And they are not 'self destructing'
	at all. They are increasing their power. 


	Sorry about not sharing your optimism, but the facts don't lend
	themselves to any optimistic twisting.
