Dark fiber.

"Dark Fiber" ain't a talisman you merely wave at data to get it to magically 
move to where you want it to.You've got to LIGHT that fiber, and to light 
that fiber you need LOTS and LOTS of power-hungry, space-occupying 
equipment. In other words, you'd need to duplicate a significant fraction of 
the current public transport network. And that can't be done in one 
location, you'd need this shadow network to have either it's own COs all 
over the country, or to have significant POPs in practically every CO in the 
country. And I can tell you unequivocally that neither are the case.

What this points to is CALEA + Grooming + Massive Optical Transport for 
offline sifting in a few centralized locations. And I strongly suspect that 
the recent GIG-BE contract is precisely the massive optical part.

What I get from what you've pointed out, however, is that processing power 
isn't the limitation any longer. If they COULD get it ALL, then they 
probably would. So perhaps that's just a matter of time (ULH systems can 
move lots of traffic very long distances these days, with only the 
occasional optical amplifier.)
