Merely notifying me that someone called is useful.

It wouldn't require rocket science to recognize an entire class C
address
as a friend.  And remember this proposal is fully back compatible with
earlier
versions of a sec phone.

If you wanted to mess with the protocol, you could obviously add an
identifier
exchange component.  I am not familiar with SpeakFreely's protocol so I
don't
know if it can be extended without breaking compatability.
