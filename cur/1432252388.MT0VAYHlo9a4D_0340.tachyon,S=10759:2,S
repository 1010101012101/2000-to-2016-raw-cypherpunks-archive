a|| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any cellu|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa|

contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,00O

units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov,

which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH
