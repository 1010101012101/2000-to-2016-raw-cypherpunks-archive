Here in Hong Kong, contactless "Octopus" smartcards (based on the Sony
FeliCa device) are well established for paying fares on buses, ferries and
subways, and also for small transactions with vending machines, convenience
stores and supermarkets. The implementation is definitely non-Chaumian (it's
based on symmetric encryption using shared secrets for both mutual
authentication and secure transfer of value) but the cards can be purchased
and reloaded with cash. Alas, the system does not allow uploads of value to
banks or peer-to-peer transfers, as Mondex did. For those who may be
interested, the standard is ISO/IEC 14443:
