...to an unsuspecting audience. Get it at

http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/MulleCipher

This is a small Framework that contains CRC32, MD5, SHA1, Blowfish and
Twofish implentations.  It's just the source and it should compile/work on
Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server w/o problems. It will probably not work out of
the box for Intel machinery, but should eventually with some some minor
tweaking.

Enjoy
	Nat!

P.S.	Feedback, Patches, Bug reports encouraged
