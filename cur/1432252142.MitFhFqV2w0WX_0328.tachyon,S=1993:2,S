Heh.  I'd love DSL.  It's a full-time dialup.
That's all I can get out here in the woods.

But there are advantages to running it here--
Since it's on a machine I own, I can hack up Majordomo
all I want, and I don't have to worry about the server's
owner getting upset over the list contents (or the ISP
either, since I just get straight IP).

If someone with a real server with real
bandwidth wanted to take over or let me have full
reign on their box to run it there, that'd
be fine with me.
