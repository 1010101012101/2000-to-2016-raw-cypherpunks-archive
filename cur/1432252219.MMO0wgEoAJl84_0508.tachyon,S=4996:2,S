You know, you might just have a point...

Voodoo bullshit to be sure, but I meant the big one, not their "career planning"
subtest:

"The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) instrument, the
restandardized version of the original MMPI instrument, is an empirically-
based assessment of adult psychopathology used by clinicians to assist with the
diagnosis of mental disorders and the selection of appropriate treatment.

Ten years ago, the standard settings in which psychologists practiced were
offices, clinics, hospitals, and schools. Today, more and more, clinicians find
themselves in the nation's courts, prisons, businesses, government agencies,
and other venues. Throughout the transition, the MMPI-2 test maintained its
position as the standard in psychological assessment and moved easily into
these new areas with setting-specific reports."


If you can ever imagine yourself in a situation where it might be to your
advantage to manipulate your test results to seem a little less antisocial or
whatever, getting familiar with how they control for deception and which
questions map to which personality "disorders" could come in quite handy.

The idea of pigeonholing people this way is morally repugnant: do pardon me for
not feeling like playing along.  Personally, I've never had to take it, but
couldn't resist the challenge of figuring out how to beat it. And practicing
until I got every goddamn scale to come out the way I wanted it to. Now I can
avoid being labeled...

4 Pd - Psychopathic Deviate
ANG2 - Anger: Irritability
CYN1 - Cynicism: Misanthropic Beliefs
ASP1 - Antisocial Practices: Antisocial Attitudes
TPA1 - Type A: Impatience
TPA2 - Type A: Competitive Drive
FAM2 - Family Problems: Familial Alienation
TRT2 - Negative Treatment Indicators: Inability to Disclose
O-H - Overcontrolled Hostility

and come out smelling like a rose with...

S1 - Beliefs in Human Goodness
S2 - Serenity
S3 - Contentment with Life

LOL!
