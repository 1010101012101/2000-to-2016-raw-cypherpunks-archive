         The real question is why weren't there enough polls to take
care of the number of people who want to vote -- it's not just St.
Louis, the same thing is happening in many places. In most states,
however, the polls are just staying open. If you have a line of people
waiting to vote, how dare they close the polls? The people should take
the polling officials outside and hang them from the nearest lamppost if
they try to close the polls.
           Not providing enough places to vote is on the same par as
requiring a poll tax or any of the other criminally enacted laws
designed to frustrate voters.
