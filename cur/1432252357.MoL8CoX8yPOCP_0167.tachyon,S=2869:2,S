It never had much in the way of compatibility problems (see e.g. RSA's S/MIME
interop page, if it still exists - even Microsoft's implementation would
interoperate without any real trouble).  It *did* have a problem that the
compatibility was typically at the level of RC2/40.  This hasn't been an issue
since the export controls were lifted.

Well, there's http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/index.html for
starters, which has been around for some years.

Peter.
