NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) - A college sophomore was charged Wednesday with 
the rape and torture of a 15-year-old girl who had swastikas carved into 
her face with a knife.
Police allege Brian Dance, 20, a University of California, Irvine student, 
met the girl in an Internet chat room and picked her up Dec. 20 at a mall.
Police said he took her to a parking lot, forced her into the back seat of 
his car, covered her eyes with duct tape and beat her for more than two 
hours with his hands and a belt.
The girl was sexually assaulted, robbed and had swastikas etched on her 
cheek and forehead with a knife, police said. She was treated and released 
from a hospital the next day.
A friend of the victim helped police nab Dance after contacting him through 
the chat room. She arranged to meet him at the same mall and he was 
arrested Sunday.
Dance could face 90 years to life if convicted of all the charges, which 
include rape by a foreign object, robbery and torture.
Dance's father, Larry Dance, said the family was stunned by the allegations.
Dance is to be arraigned Jan. 8 and has been denied bail

Guy sounds like a regular fun loving anarcho-capitalist to me.He's probably 
researching a book.Mein crypto Kampf.













pontificate to cops about whether
someone like me plans to do something. He chose to cooperate with the
Feds and speculated freely on what he thought I would do.
He's a rodent.
