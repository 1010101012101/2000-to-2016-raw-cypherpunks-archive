There is another option. First you get some idealistic laywers who are 
stuck with half a million in student loans they can't pay back and work
out a warrant canary system and pay them equity in the company that 
will deploy it as a retainer.

However, for this to work it requires **investors** and end users to buy
the product(s) the company is going to sell that have warrant canaries.

You might even be able to work out some sort of 'proof-of-retainer' block
reward scheme on a new canarycoin so the lawyers defending the company 
can get tradeable coins, and cash them out to pay off the loans.

All of this revolves around the business models. Figure that out and the 
legal jurisdiction is irrelevant, because if you have a good enough business
model, you can buy the legislation you want.
