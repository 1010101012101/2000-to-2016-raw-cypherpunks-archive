I hope the subject line was not too obscure, mon.

ASK = amplitude shift keying, which I believe is the RFID modulation
Elmer = guru/wizard/elder in HAMspeak
Jingle: Ask any mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna? Chicken

Ie, fish in cans.

Sorry Charlie.  Charlie don't surf, but that's because tuna cans don't
give enough forward gain.
