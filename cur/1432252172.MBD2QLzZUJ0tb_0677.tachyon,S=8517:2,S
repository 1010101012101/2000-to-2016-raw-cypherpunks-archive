What I now implemented and put as a github pull request to the original
project:

the extension user can now use a chrome pop-up for writing the mail
(not meaning pop-up as an annoying ad window, but as a chrome
extension window that displays when you click on the extension icon)

AFAIK, no javascript can display such an extension pop-up and also
can't intercept anything.

I also added a big red warning, instructing to open the pop-up, that
shows whenever the original encryption is triggered from inside the
regular webmail DOM (it's still possible to use the extension is
"unsafe" way with mail provider intercepting, but you have to ignore
the warning).

Let's hope Thomas accepts those changes and adds them to the main extension
:)
