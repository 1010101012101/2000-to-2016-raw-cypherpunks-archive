There was no discussion on the 'nature of western governments and
western propaganda'. There were childish arguments between apologists of
Russia, US, and anarcho-capitalism. Although it is misrepresetation to call the
USsian in the conversation an apologist.

I think members of the group would be much more receptive to the
'nature of western governments and western propaganda' as a mature
discussion. As it was, how many of these can you count?

As for 'censoring' these discussion, a delicate topic on a mailing list
for people who support cryptography as a way to oppose censorship, have
anonymity, etc, why don't we go with simply allowing the users to block
members if they need to on their own mail clients. This seems
compatable with the philosophies of a cypherpunk(I would guess), 'leave
the user in control'.

What? You're delusional. Just because I see your fringe ideology for
what it is doesn't mean I suddenly support USA Gov or military.
