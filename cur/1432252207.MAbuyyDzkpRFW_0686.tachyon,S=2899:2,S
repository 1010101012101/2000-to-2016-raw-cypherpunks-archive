After reading the press release about Cisco's new low-cost wifi mesh
systems, built from tecchnologies developed by Airespace.com ( cisco is
a prinsipal investor)

http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml?articleId=1736005

I was clicking around for technical specs, I came across this:  Besides
mesh networks, Airespace offers central location surveillance capabilty
to do [imprecise] tracking of users' and devices in realitme in an
Airespace (cisco?) Wi-fi network.

http://www.airespace.com/technology/benefits_of_location_tracking.php

"Airespace uses advanced RF fingerprinting technology to identify and
track users to within 10 meters of their exact location - anywhere they
roam throughout an enterprise environment. This enables IT staff to
establish access control policies that are based on geographic location,
immediately identify the source of unauthorized WLAN activity such as
rogue Access Points,"
