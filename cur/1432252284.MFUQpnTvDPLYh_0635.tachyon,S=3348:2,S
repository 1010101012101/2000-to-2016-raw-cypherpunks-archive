The Catalonian "anarchists" needed a leadership in order to 
impose socialism, resulting in such bizarre and amusing 
titles as "Anarchist minister of the economy".  This had the 
usual unfortunate side effect that the midlevel militants, 
the nomenclatura that operated the bureacracy, the prisons, 
and the killing fields, found themselves utterly powerless in 
the hands of their leaders, as was illustrated when the
leadership casually dissolved the local committees.
