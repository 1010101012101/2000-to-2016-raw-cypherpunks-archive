Active attacks at the network layer are relatively rare, but definitely
not non-existent. Spammers occasionally hijack BGP prefixes, send some
spam and move on. They can also hijack nameserver IPs, MX host IPs, but
for now they prefer sending over receiving. This will likely change,
the playbook of organized crime on the net has been expanding steadily
when money overtook teen-age dare-do as the most common motivation for
active attacks in ~2002.

They keep moving around, some ISPs turn a blind eye in return
for the revenue stream.

No, that's the whole point. What works for the individual administering 10
machines, does not scale to organizations with hundres of administrators
managing tens of thousands of machines. With KEX you trust Kerberos,
not your key store. The problem is that one also ends up trusting, DNS
or NIS or LDAP, ...

Quite the converse, the PKI keys are too durable. (Segue to Wheeler &
Wheeler) the Kerberos online verification model is actually superior,
but in practice the implementation runs into issues with insecure
nameservices. We need a more secure stack.

Yes, but the scammers are getting into more markets, first spam and
advance fee scams, then phishing, now pump and dump scams, they are
evolving fast. We are largely standing still.

Workable DNS-SEC exists, what lacks now is the will and political muscle
to make it happen. Signing is done on update, not on read.

The real question is not how to do DNS-SEC, but how soon, and then how to
leverage it in real protocols. Will there be a reasonably comprehensive
set of Internet integrated services that work *together* "securely" in
a reasonable fashion, or are we still building the tower of Babel (now
in software). A more trustworthy DNS would IMHO be a good foundation.
