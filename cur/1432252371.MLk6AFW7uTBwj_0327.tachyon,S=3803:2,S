Yeah, I favor freedom and free markets. Obviously.

Something I _don't_ favor is wasting time responding to weird rants like 
the ones from "mattd."

The expression "get back on your medications" is sometimes overused on 
the Net, but in this case it clearly applies. This "mattd" person 
oscillates from fawning about "crypto anarchy" to foaming that people 
like me should be hanged. All written in an illiterate, pseudo-dyslexic, 
run-on sentence, crude imitation of John Young.

I have yet to see a single idea come out of "mattd."

There are more interesting fish to fry.
