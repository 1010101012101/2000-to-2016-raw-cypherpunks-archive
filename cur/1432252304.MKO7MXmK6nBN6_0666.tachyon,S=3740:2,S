Dave,

Coincidentally ? the EU is also clamping down on flights from the US.
(with thanks to HJ Affleck who posted this Washington Post piece to
the FIPR list this morning.)

If US citizens do not have to provide fingerprint data when they ask
for a passport to travel out of the US then should the US government
want this data on their citizens I suppose they can always ask the
Europeans, Japanese, Brazilians .....

Travelers to Europe May Face Fingerprinting

By Ellen Nakashima and John Ward Anderson
Washington Post Staff Writers

Tuesday, February 12, 2008; Page A01

The European Commission will propose tomorrow that all foreign travelers
entering and leaving Europe, including U.S. citizens, should be
fingerprinted. If approved by the European Parliament, the measure would
mean that precisely identifying information on tens of millions of
citizens
will be added in coming years to databases that could be shared by
friendly
governments around the world.

The United States already requires that foreigners be fingerprinted and
photographed before they enter the country. So does Japan. Now top
European
security officials want to follow suit, with travelers being
fingerprinted
and some also having their facial images stored in a Europe-wide
database,
according to a copy of the proposal obtained by The Washington Post.

The plan is part of a vast and growing trend on both sides of the
Atlantic
to collect and share data electronically to identify and track people in
the name of national security and immigration control. U.S. government
computers now have access to data on financial transactions; air travel
details such as name, itinerary and credit card numbers; and the names
of
those sending and receiving express-mail packages -- even a
description of
the contents...
