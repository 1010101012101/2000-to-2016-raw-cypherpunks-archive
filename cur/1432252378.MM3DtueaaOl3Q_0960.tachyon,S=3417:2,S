How much plain text can ~10^9 online monkeys daily enter into their keyboard?
A ~10^3 average ballpark gives you a TByte/day (minus the redundancy), which
is currently a 1U worth of SATA RAID/day, or 3 years worth of world's entire
traffic
in a 10^3 node cluster, which is on the low side these days.
Hard drive storage density goes up exponentially, and probably
faster than people can go online (the old world has saturated) -- it isn't a
problem, given that population increase doesn't occur at these growth rates.
You don't have to delete anything, ever.

Given what Google manages with some 10^4..10^5 nodes, this problem set looks
puny in
comparison. Keeping the data on a cluster gives you the local crunch to do
some very nontrivial data mining, especially if you narrow the scope down
sufficiently to be able to lock the data in memory and crunch it there.

Fax OCR/telex is just as easy, speech recognition doable, given the budget.

We don't know whether they are actually doing it (I *think* these people are
too conservative to be doing clusters right now, so they're probably doing
storage hierarchies with tape libraries -- but then they as well could be MIB
types years ahead of the mainstream), the point it is that they
could, given the documented amount of hired talent and official budget.
