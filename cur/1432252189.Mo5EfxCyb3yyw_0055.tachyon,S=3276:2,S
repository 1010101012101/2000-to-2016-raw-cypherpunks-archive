We've completed transcription of the subpoena and attachments:

   http://cryptome.org/jdb-subpoena.htm

The Information for Grand Jury Witnesses says, 

  "The witness is required to answer all questions asked, 
  except to the extent that a truthful answer to a question 
  would tend to incriminate the witness. A knowingly false 
  answer to any question could be the basis for a prosecution 
  of the witness for perjury. Anything a Grand Jury witness 
  says which tends to incriminate him may be used against 
  him by the Grand Jury, or later used against him in Court."

That's good 5A advice to protect against coercion, intimidation,
squealing, fishing, entrapment, blindsiding, ham sandwiching,
and believing you're saving your ass by disbelieving what the
witness Information threatens:

  "The mere fact that this information accompanies your subpoena
  should not be taken as any indication or suggestion that you
  are under investigation or are likely to be charged with a crime."
