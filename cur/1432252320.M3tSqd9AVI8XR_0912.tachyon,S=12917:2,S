i post this here as a reminder of anarchist models and how they can be
utilized in fascist occasions and are anti facsist but also are anti
capitalist - anarchist models are found in every sector that i know of
ideas of autonomy and horizontality - direct democracy but there is an
overwhelming desire of some to subvert these tendencies - look for them in
yourself...

The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto Timothy C.
May<ftp://soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/people/tcmay.html><
tcmay@netcom.com>

A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for
individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a
totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct
business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True
Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be
untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and
tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly
perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central
importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of
today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government
regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust
and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and
economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods
are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof
systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication,
and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in
Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security
Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers
attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the
next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks,
ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters,
multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development
will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers
and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these
concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be
trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An
anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for
assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be
active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto
anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic
methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government
interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information
markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all
material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly
minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast
ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property
rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out
of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which
dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!
