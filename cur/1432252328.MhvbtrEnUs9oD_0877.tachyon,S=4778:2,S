Firstly, the US army has not violated the Geneva convention: 
Saddam was eligible for being shot on sight.

Secondly;  It is being overly sensitive about the feelings of 
those poor fragile souls that hate us and seek to murder us,
that got us into these trouble. Our enemies take it for
weakness, reasonably enough.  We should make it obvious that
nothing will stop us from striking at our enemies, that we will
cheerfully wade knee deep through blood and the body parts of
innocents to destroy those that threaten us, as the crusaders
waded to the holy sepulchre.

As Bin laden said slaughtering the occupants of the twin towers 
made them look strong:

To the best of my knowledge, the UN only grants those awards to 
those who inflict quite extraordinary ruin and horrible 
destruction on their subjects -- such awards are as infamous 
and perverse as the UN human rights commission, headed by Libya 
las time I heard.

The UN is a cartel of governments against their subjects.  Just 
as a cartel of ordinary businesses requires its members to 
charge high prices and supply low quality, and grants honor and 
recognition to those members that charge remarkably high prices 
and unusually low quality, in the same way the UN grants honor 
and recognition to unusually destructive episodes of looting 
and pillaging against formerly prosperous law abiding peaceful 
subjects.

The UN was established to protect against direct military 
conflict, but in ordinary day to day life, peaceful competition 
is a greater threat to the rulers, for example "harmful tax 
competition".  One of the major goals of the EU is to restrain 
'harmful tax competition".  Similarly one of the major goals of 
the WTO is to prevent what cypherpunks call regulatory 
arbitrage.
