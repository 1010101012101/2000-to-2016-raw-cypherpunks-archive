In a slightly confused report, HNN said the state of Colorado
would start using facial recognition software in a year.

"Mainly to prevent duplicate driver's license issuances."

"Where the cameras will be placed is secret."

Well, if you were going to check for license dups,
you'd use it in the DMV after taking the picture
of the person wanting a license.

If anyone finds a less confused report on this, please post.

#    Man Gets Ten Years in Prison for Pornographic Diary Entries
#
#    An Ohio man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after writing
#    fictitious stories about torturing and sexually abusing young
#    children.

#
#    Still, Dalton was guilty of pandering obscenity because he "did
#    create, reproduce or publish any obscene material that has a
#    minor as one of its participants or portrayed observers," the
#    indictment said.
#
#    "Even without passing it on to anyone else, he committed a
#    felony," Domis said.
#
#    Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien called the case a
#    "breakthrough" in the battle against child pornography.

Well, isn't that special.

Thought crime in the first degree.

  19  Bobby and Cindy were 14. While both had masturbated, neither was
  20  really sure what sex was all about. That's why they were hiding in the
  21  closet in Marcia's room. They had watched everything Greg and Marcia
  22  had done, and were more than ready to give it a try.  Bobby's almost
  23  hairless cock had gotten hard before Greg had even mounted Marcia, and
  24  it was still hard. Cindy's virgin pussy was so wet her panties were
  25  soaked. As soon as Marcia and Greg were gone, they rushed out of the
  26  closet and fell onto the bed. They had stripped while they watched,
  27  but were too afraid of making noise to do anything.
  28  
  29  Bobby pulled Cindy close, kissed her eyes and mouth the way he'd seen
  30  Greg kiss Marcia. He moved down to Cindy's tiny, barely bulging
  31  titties and began to lick and suck the nipples. They hardened even
  32  more, which surprised him. He hadn't known that would happen.
  33  
  34  Cindy held Bobby's cock gently. It was her first, and she wasn't sure
  35  it wouldn't break. Bobby covered her hand with his and squeezed, then
  36  stroked his shaft, showing her how to jack his dick.  She stroked it a
  37  few times on her own, liking the way it felt in her hand.
  38  
  39  They skipped the rest of the foreplay they had seen. Both were eager
  40  to fuck. But Cindy was a virgin, and they both knew a girls first fuck
  41  could be painful. Cindy liked Bobby, trusted him, wanted him to be her
  42  first. She lay on her back, her face framed by blond curls, her
  43  lightly haired snatch a slightly darker blonde. She spread her legs
  44  wide, fingered herself for a moment, letting Bobby look at her
  45  pussy. Bobby stretched out above her, his knees between her legs, his
  46  arms supporting his weight, his young, hard cock touching her
  47  belly. Cindy took hold of his tool, guided it to her cunt, helped him
  48  enter her. He entered slowly, stopping when Cindy flinched. He started
  49  to backup, not wanting to hurt her. She grabbed his ass with both
  50  hands, pulled him hard towards herself, felt a tearing pain in her
  51  cunt. She buried her face in his shoulder, stifling a scream.  She
  52  told him not to move, told him that she had been told the pain would
  53  go away in a few minutes.
