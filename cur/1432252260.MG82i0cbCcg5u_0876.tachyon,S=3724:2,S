So why are so many people making the same mistakes and feeling shocked and 
indignant when they end up with the same results, i,e. failure? 

Getting away fron digital cash for a moment, If you'd care to point me to any
examples of crypto companies really focused and committed to developing
applications that are commercially appealing to Joe Sixpack AOLuser, I'd be
interested to hear about them. Is it really such a stretch to say that most
people in the crypto community don't really give a damn about Joe wants or
needs? How many times have you heard people here implicitly echo the
sentiment: "If they're too lazy or stupid to get it, then screw em." 

Maybe the technology isn't far enough along to waste time worrying about
Joe at all. But the disdain so many "high priests of the code" seem to feel
towards the uninitiated might go a long way toward explaining why revenues 
aren't all they could be.
