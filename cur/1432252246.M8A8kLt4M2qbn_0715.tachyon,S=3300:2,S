There you go again, inaptly contrasting the soft-hearted duck the draft 
liberals with the hard-hearted war lovers of the duck the draft Bush 
persuasion. Aptly, the soft-hearts and hard-hearts are two sides of the 
same golden butter pat, the first wring their hands at the awfulness of 
the hard-hearts while lapping up the luxurious benefits paid for by 
bacon rind predations of mean sonsofbitches, the second snarl at their 
bete noire faux-cripples and ne'erdowells on the dole ("useless eaters") 
while reaping the benefits of dirt cheap servitude in the US but mostly 
offshore safetly distant from the easily penetrable fortresses begging 
for mob assault by plane, train, careening dodge ram.

No, there's no contrast between commies and libertarians, left and right,
they're all producing vast lakes of pig shit and blaming the foul odor of
bloated self-interest on low-brow non-think chimeras of the government, 
corporations, the rich, the poor, the opposite, the other, those who are
different, those who have more, or less, or get more attention, or fail
to show respect, or who make fun of your fundamental beliefs, or insult
your morals, ethics, aesthetics, politics, accomplishments, looks,
way of talking, writing, joking, and worse, who have a knack for pushing 
overmuch sacred buttons of your ingrown fearful neurotic cult armed to
the teeth with weapons of iron and spleen and inner infant hurt feelings,
not understanding or giving a whit what you're deeply serious about,
pathologically incapable of escaping the force of.

It's not a choice, Nomen, between violence or peace, it's a matter
of spreading the golden butter infinitely thin so nobody gets an
undue globule. Fat chance in America totally committed to
cheating at rigged gambling, call that free market at the end
of a gun.
