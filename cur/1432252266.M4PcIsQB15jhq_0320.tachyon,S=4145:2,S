While Bill Maher loses his advertisers for suggesting that lobbing cruise
missiles from 2,000 miles away is more cowardly than personally flying an
aircraft into a building, we now have a first look at the "features"
present in the anti-Terrorism bill, to be submitted to Congress on Friday.

According to AP, the bill permits prosecutors to use evidence collected by
foreign governments, even if that evidence was collected in ways
unconstitutional in the United States.

It will also permit law enforcement to seize billing records of ISPs
without a court order, so that they may be grepped through to identify
anyone who uses the service with an assumed name.

The definition of "terrorist" will be augmented to include any person who
supports in any way any organization they know or should know is a
terrorist organization.

Criminalize the possession of chemicals that could be used in chemical or
biological weapons in quantities the Feebs consider suspicious.

Criminalize giving "expert advise" to "terrorists."

Permit the seizing of the property of any person, organization, or
country, that attacks the United States.

Permit access to education records by law enforcement, without the
permission of the student or their parents.

Permit terrorist DNA fingerprinting, and remove the $2 million cap on
rewards for fighting terrorism.

The gauntlet has been thrown down.  How long before the estates of
"terrorists" Bill Maher and Tim May are seized at gunpoint for the Greater
Good of the Reich?
