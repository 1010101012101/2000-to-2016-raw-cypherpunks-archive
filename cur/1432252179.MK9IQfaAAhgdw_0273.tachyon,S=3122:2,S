I used to think so too, but there are a lot of hausfrau who
use polynymy.  They're not clued in to the subtleties
of recognizing prose by style, because my informant has told
me that they are recognizable.  I doubt many cpunkly anonymous posters
put their prose through a few cycles of 'the fish'.  Perhaps 
short prose is their solution; what is *your* unicity distance? 

In a different but related thread, the whole point of 'human factors'
studies and gui design is to use whatever the user brings with him
--including metaphors from meatspace.  Postcards = IP.  Envelopes = crypto.
 Phone books = PKI directories.  Multinyms = "doing business as".
Reputation = reputation.
