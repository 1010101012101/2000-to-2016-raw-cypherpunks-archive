The usual principle of
"Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity"
applies here, though with governments having ample supplies of both 
commodities,
you can't always be sure.   NAI's US organizations can't sell directly to
anyone in countries on the Yanqui Enemies List, be they freedom fighters,
government thugs, or just everyday businessfolks, but even Official Enemies
can still download freeware off the PGPi non-US-owned sites.
