I have no patience with "If _EVERYBODY_ did foo, then...." arguments.

Contrary to what many of the newcomers (last 5 years) here have argued, 
crypto anarchy was never about converting the world to one true 
political system--it was, and is, about those motivated to do so to 
find ways to drop out of the system and find ways to sabotage the 
various politicians and socialists and minorities using government to 
steal from them.

Finding ways to destroy large nests of socialists and minority welfare 
mutants is of course consistent with this individualist approach.

But silliness about "if everybody used encryption, then..." is just 
that, silliness.

"First we convert the world to our viewpoint" is an empty philosophy.

"Tyler Durden," you have never shown a trace of sophistication or 
cleverness in the several months you have been on this list.
