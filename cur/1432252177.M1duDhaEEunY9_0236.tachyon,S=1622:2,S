Because she got charged with *lying*  to a fed when she
was *not* under oath.

The lesson is real.  The ordinary pig on the street --not just a fed--
can lie
to you, and bust you if you return the favor.

*You* of all people should know this.  Perhaps you're too
impressed by sharp suits and polite haircuts.

I don't give a rat's pastel ass about Stewart (or Padilla, etc), except
as
a citizen, which pretty much means fodder for the gestapo
these days.

The only reason to speak to feds or cold-calling police is
counter intel, learn what they're interested in.  And then publish that.

With faces if acquired.
