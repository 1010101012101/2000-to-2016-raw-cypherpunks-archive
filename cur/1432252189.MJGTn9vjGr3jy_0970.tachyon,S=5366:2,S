This is still a mis-reading. The population they are refering
to is self-selected - men who, for one reason or another,
decide to spend the $450 - $600 it costs to do the tests.

For most people, that's not an insignificant outlay, and will
not be taken unless there is some other reason for suspicion.
When the price gets down to the <$100 range, I hope that it
becomes a standard part of the childbirth package.

I heard somewhere that ~10% of firstborns are cuckoos (can't 
give a cite), but the number is lower for later children.
