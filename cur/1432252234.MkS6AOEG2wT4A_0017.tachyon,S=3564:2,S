Nonsense.  Targeting innocents is evil according to EVERY human culture.
The fact that people do it, does not make it "relative."  It just makes them
evil.  Period.

When generals close to Hitler saw the writing on the wall, their basic
humanity drove them to try to blow him up.  Had they succeeded they would
have ended a great evil and prevented ALL the evil excesses of the
WWII--from the holocaust to Dresden to Hiroshima.  What they did was not
evil, but moral.  Unfortunately, they failed.

Did you even read what I wrote?  Please do so before asking such asinine
questions.
