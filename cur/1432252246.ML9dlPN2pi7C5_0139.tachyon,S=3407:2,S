My impression is that Byzantium's ad-hoc mesh network would look a whole 
lot *like *the networks we're used to, though. If it grew big enough. Am I 
mistaken? Maybe Byzantium doesn't scale the way I've assumed it does, and 
you'd end up with a sort of "clumpy" situation, where you have less of a 
global Internet and more of a smattering of smaller imperfectly-connected 
internets. I guess that's implied by the emphasis on wireless connections 
-- hard to get WiFi across continents. It seems clear that cjdns is 
intended to scale to arbitrary sizes. So, the infrastructure goes down and 
you rely on Byzantium until the new infrastructure (based, perhaps, on 
cjdns) comes online? Is that the idea?

Seems like it'd be more efficient to just give the emergency system the 
ability to "grow up" into a new status quo. Then I wouldn't have to install 
a new distro when the post-post-apocalypse rolls around. You have to be 
practically there already, given that Byzantium interfaces with the 
contemporary Internet without complaints, yeah?

(Thanks for humoring me. I hope my profession of ignorance is less painful 
for you than it is for me.)
