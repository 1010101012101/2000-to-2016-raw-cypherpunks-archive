Yep, and I've never understood why someone would do that. I read email
using mutt/lynx and Eudora (with "Automatically download HTML
graphics" turned off). Heck, sometimes I'll use /bin/mail or cat. I'd
never register as having read the email. Guess I'm not the target
audience; the Outlook crowd is.
