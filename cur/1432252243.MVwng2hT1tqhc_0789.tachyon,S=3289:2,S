       This is most likely part and parcel of the same cointelpro that is 
harrassing Jim Bell. What they want to do is provoke Tim into making a 
rash statement, a "threat" of some sort, so they have "probable cause" to
execute a warrant and/or arrest him on some spurious charge. 
        Typical feeb scum mentality these days. Tim's right -- there are
a great many traitors in this country today who need executing. Anyone who
has taken part in any cointelpro or agent provocateur activities will be at
the top of the list, along with the Waco and Ruby Ridge murderers, all BATFags
and DEA filth.
