Actually, that won't help you much: emissions from LCD screens can be 
easier to decode than those from monitors. Active matrix LCD screens create 
very strong and clear emissions--as long as a display uses some form of 
pixel sweep where each pixel is activated at a unique time, then the 
emissions are simple to decode. Though in theory LCD screens emit less than 
a VDU, recent EMC controls have greatly reduced emanations from VDUs--with 
the result that the graphics card will often be the greatest source of 
compromise.

Hope that helps!
