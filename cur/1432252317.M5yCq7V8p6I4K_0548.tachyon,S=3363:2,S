The 419 scam has been going on for the best part of half a century.  The 
advent of the net and email has only allowed it to spread farther and 
wider, while law enforcement has been unable to stem it significantly. 
If reverse-scamming some Nigerian fraudster out of the month's food 
budget incents him to seek out legal means of income, that's one less 
419er.  If a few of his friends drop their fraud careers after seeing 
one of them get taken, that's more ex-419ers.

Including the responsibility to tacitly underwrite a massive, 
national-scale fraud campaign?  Somehow, I don't think so.

But it's the proper station of that poor black African to attempt 
picking the pocket of any number of comfortably well-off white people? 
419ers are criminals.  They steal money by dint of deception.  They 
break the social contract.  I can't get too worked up about turning the 
tables on them.  Think of it as evolution in action.
