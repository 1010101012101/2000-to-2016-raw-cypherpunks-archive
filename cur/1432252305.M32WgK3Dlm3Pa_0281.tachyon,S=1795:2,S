Recently here in Palo Alto, a latino teenager was railroaded by the cops and almost convicted of raping an elderly white lady.  Nevermind those pesky DNA tests, he confessed after many hours in police custody without representation.

Lawyers kept him from being framed by forcing a DNA test that failed to match his DNA with that of the rapist.

The lawyers that freed him might not consider the law "majestic", but I think they have good reason to sleep well at night.
