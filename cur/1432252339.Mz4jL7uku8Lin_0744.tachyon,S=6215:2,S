The most useful strategy I've seen is to use multiple authentication
methods or the "a few really hard passwords + random statement for each
site."

Ie. you can probably memorize something like

lMB^9Pl!

so use that for the sites and then tack on something like

lMB^9Pl!Ilikeshopping123

Then the probability of actually cracking that password is low, and
unless you are being specifically targeted, even if they got that
password they wouldn't immediately be able to use it on other websites.
It's easy to remember because that 8 digit code you'll type everywhere,
and the ending is always something cognitively easy.
