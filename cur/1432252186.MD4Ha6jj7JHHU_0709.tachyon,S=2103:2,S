On Wednesday 14 May 2003 18:55, Major Variola (ret) forwarded the 
following Al-Reuters dreck:
> ...vigilante group...
> ... vigilante group...

> armed... hand over any illegal immigrants they find to U.S.
> Border Patrol agents.
> ...vigilantes... forward those

_Some_ of these "vigilantes" are armed, and they plan to send the 
location of illegals to the Border Patrol? Has "vigilante" been defined 
down, like "assault weapon"?

I'm surprised Al-Reuters isn't calling these guys terrorists. 
"Terrorist" is currently unused in their various news reports, as they 
generally refer to not-so-smart bombs as "radicals".
