I see I was unclear.

I never said ORBS is an *accurate* reputation-publishing tool. I have
never said it was entirely focused on spammers. I have never said I
uncritically accept it or use it on the machines for which I am responsible.*

But it is, nevertheless, beyond question that ORBS and its progeny
allow their operators to broadcast their views about what they think
about some certain network addresses or domains. If they go too far
and are too zealous, the market will move toward a better solution.

Like I said, very cypherpunkly.

* In fact, I wrote earlier this year: Slashdot ran a thought-provoking
piece not so long ago about how anti-spam measures (that I have long
endorsed) like the RBL and its progeny are moving from blackholing
spammers to blackholing sites with software that *could be used* to
spam. While that's a private activity, it's treading the same path
that Rep. Bob Goodlatteis with his plan to criminalize software that
could be used to send bulk messages. At least the RBL is limited by
market pressures: If it goes too far, ISPs will stop using it. But
while free markets are the best way we've found yet to order society,
they're hardly perfect, and RBL could overreact and restrict some
folks who are undeserving in the interim.
