Considering the latitude to which the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to 
interpret "limited time' I doubt they would mind.  Ask Larry Lessig :)

>Second, who would judge market penetration?

Good question.  Because of the difficulty, I was inclined to focus on only 
markets which make up a substantial fraction of the GDP.  These have been 
tracked, relatively well, by the Department of Commerce's Standard Industry 
Codes (SICs).  Microsoft falls under software publishing.  I would propose 
that, for purposes of aiding implementation of this IP regime, these codes 
be broken down into segments which exceed some minimum (say at least 10%) 
of the original SIC.

Not likely.  See above.

Trademarks are of primary importance.  Imagine what would happen if MS lost 
any control of the term Windows (indeed they might anyway) related to OS 
user interfaces.
