Who's "job" is that? Are you defining this job for someone other than yourself?

These two sentences are approaching incoherent. Would you like to try
again? It is probably not constructive for me to respond to
incoherence - there is perhaps some truth or pain or seeking which has
not been expressed clearly, which I would hope you feel confident
about expressing, or re- attempting to express - such is in our
collective interests.

Agreed.

So say you.

If you wish an intelligent discourse, please put more effort into
explaining this "problem" you assert, describing why you think there
is a problem, etc in a way which others might be able to agree with
you - asserting that something is a problem, in and of itself, says
close to nothing, and is therefore not useful. You might want others
to agree with you that there is a problem, here in this tiny (!!)
corner of the world called the cypherpunks mailing list. You might
even be able to cite coherent facts demonstrating your position - none
of this means I or any other individual has to agree with you, though
some may.

Making you assertion is presently an island waiting for supporters -
nothing more than a political position in search of part members. This
is not the place for such superficiality. I personally seek deeper
conversation.

Your assertions leave me raising my eyebrows.

And again.

Possible actions based on unsubstantiated presumptions. This -is-
objectionable to me.

You want me to buy in to your political cause? You might consider
presenting a more substantial position, perhaps one based in fact.

This is flame bait. Persistent flame baiting is regarded as trolling.

We share the same hope. For me it is a certainty - I need no hope
about "all being welcome", since it is already a fact.

Your assertions to the contrary notwithstanding...

Is it your position that humans in general have no right to create
communication spaces, semi public as this one is, that fit their
desires?

Do you assert that you would like a particular communication space to
exist, which does not currently exist, but which is somehow similar to
cypherpunks mailing list, but perhaps a little different?

If so, have you tried to create such a space?

Or are you simply begrudging this space that has been created not by
you, and not specifically for you (although you are welcome), for some
reasons (perhaps it does not quite meet your expectations?, perhaps
you have taken certain words posted as adversarial to your own actual
intentions to participate?)?

With your assertion of problems existing in this particular space,
without any substantiation of fact, there is not much of a
conversation besides "I want more of something undefined and other
should provide it to me" is there?

Before I turn my own vehemence into another strawman, perhaps
reconsider your presentation/ wording?

Creating spaces in this world that -you- want, is up to you. You may
of course try to enroll others into you intentions, but at the moment,
you might like to work on refining that last bit...

Good luck,
Zenaan
