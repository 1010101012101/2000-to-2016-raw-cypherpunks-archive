 >>This is a terribly important point. Implementing this "atomic 
transaction" would be a major step. Having a Web site that does this EVEN 
WITH PLAY TOKENS would be a useful step. (Many dislike toy applications, 
but a site which did this would be a way to play with the software, test 
the reliability, and get ideas for further developments. The "Play Tokens" 
would be of literally no value, ostensibly.) << Tammy May

Obnoxiously after boosting 'sweet spots' and some rubbish called 
anarcho-capitalism I now want to play on Xmas day!
Fork off uncle scrooge.

 >>Like a cellular automata, the basic rules dramatically affect future 
evolutionary paths.<<

Like a sneak thief and coward stealing "anarchy".Now the virus seeks to 
hijack the cell.Theres precedent.Tammy "Mitochondria" May

 >>With the proper atomic transaction protocols, the rest unfolds 
naturally. Money changers can profit by returning some fraction (e.g., 
0.99) of what they are given. <<

Im an expert on atomic energy(in favor) and micro-transactions,Dont listen 
to Dr jeckle May who scorns micro-payments.

nog}

You can keep your slaves as well and all.No wonder george Mason refused to 
sign that crap.Tammy boys now free to frantically oil his barrel ,low 
calibre,large bore.
