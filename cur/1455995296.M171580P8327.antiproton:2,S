Transliteration... The feds tampered with the phone and apparently
fucked up their own investigation.

> The idea was to force the iPhone 5C to auto-backup to Farook=C3=A2=C2=80=
=C2=99s
> iCloud account. With a legal court order, Apple can and does turn over
> iCloud data. For some reason, Farook had not backed up the phone for
> roughly six weeks prior to the attack. The executive said Apple does
> not know whether the auto-backup was disabled or enabled, but he did
> say that the previous iCloud backups, which were handed over to
> investigators, were sporadic.
>
> Apple suggested that the FBI take the iPhone 5C, plug it into a wall,
> connect it to a known Wi-Fi network and leave it overnight. The FBI
> took the phone to the San Bernardino County Health Department, where
> Farook worked prior to the December 2, 2015 attack.
>
> When that attempt did not work, Apple was mystified, but soon found
> out that the Apple ID account password had been changed shortly after
> the phone was in the custody of law enforcement, possibly by someone
> from the county health department. With no way to enter the new
> password on the locked phone, even attempting an auto-backup was
> impossible. Had this iCloud auto-backup method actually functioned,
> Apple would have been easily able to assist the FBI with its
> investigation.
>
> The executive only revealed this detail to reporters now because it
> had thought it was under a confidentiality agreement with the
> government. Apple seems to believe this agreement is now void since
> the government brought it up in a public court filing.
