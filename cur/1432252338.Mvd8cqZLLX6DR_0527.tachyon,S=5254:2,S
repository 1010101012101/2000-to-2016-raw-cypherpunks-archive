Subject: Proffr1 the Illuminator.

Born 1955 died 2091,proffr1 the illuminator is the eco-anark 
apostle,international insane saint and punk patron of
Anarchia.He was the first to institute global democratic libertarian 
socialism as crypto-anarchy.
The anarchists mainline that the faith was preached by the apostles bart 
and thaddeus.Thaddeus
especially.(thanks chief!)The story has been taken over somewhat by the 
ameroanachists.Their land
being the first to turn crypto-anarchist.In their version proffr1 was the 
son of a panthein anark
who murdered king kong 2 and then drowned while crossing the river 
murri.Proffr1 was sepporated and baptized
in the fosters by a surfragette who acted in accordance a 
tele-vision.Proffr1 married, then soon after smarted from
his wife who became a pro,singer,dancer,actress and dowager empress on 
rollerskates.
Proffr1 had travelled to americana where he refused to take part in human 
sacrifice ordered by
king george.He further enraged the king by declaring himself an anarchist 
so when king george
found out proffs father slew king kong he had him thrown into a 
supermax.There he was tortured in
various ways with christian video nasties and bad food and coffee.The only 
thing that kept proffr1
sane was when he befriended a rat who passed messages between cells.Proffr1 
was also sustained
in his time of trial by a pious widow who bought him psychodalek drugs and 
pron and daphne.
Meanwhile the tyrant george had gone from bad to worse.A holy virgin who 
resists the crazy kings
depraved advances is martyred.Rhizsome plays a great part in this story as 
she is driven mad
by the sadistic lust of the bloodthirsty vampire king george the 
wicked.Finally as the crowds recoil
in complete horror,the kings brother see's that he is mad and prays for 
help.At the very moment of doom he see's
a vision off cape canaveral that only proffr can save king george.Proffr1 
is bought from the
dungeons, and placed before the bestial george, proceeds to exorcise the 
evil from him.
His logical,precise and poetic lucidity charm the entire court.The long 
discourse of the anabasis
of proffr1 becomes required holovid viewing and outrates anal gang bang 
6.on channel 99.
Following the fantastic conversion of a boar into a peacable learned 
primate,proffr1 moves
around the kingdom in style staking unregenerate KG wannabees and larrabees 
that refuse enlightenment.There
are suprisingly few as excited web surfers and SMSers spread the word of 
his and Rhizsomes coming.The contrast
could not be greater as if lemon were suddenly squeezed into full cream 
milk.The false gods
and werewolves are driven into caucus were they perish beneath a 
cypher/sword and mentalstorm.Eventually the movement leads to the collapse 
of govts worldwide.Truly it is written that we were in darkness before 
knowing of the cypher/sword of crypto-anarchy wielded by mentalstorm 
prophet and honorary professor1, the Illuminator.
