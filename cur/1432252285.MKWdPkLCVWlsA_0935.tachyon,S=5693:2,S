That's assuming they recognize multipart/signed as containing parts
that can be displayed.  The entire problem is that Eudora et al. do
not---multipart/signed is unrecognized, so the entire message is
treated as unopenable and displayed as an attachment.

I hope you don't mean this.  I don't think there is a Windows MUA that
supports RFC2015 at all---are you saying that all Windows users need
to suffer?  I don't like Windows, but lots of people just can't or
don't want to handle anything else.

And speaking of not playing nicely, what do you call "...people who
use broken MUAs need to suffer..." ?

The Internet is based on _suggested_ standards such as RFC2015 (note
its disposition---it's not an official standard).  No one is forced to
comply with them, and those who wish to communicate effectively do
their best to use their software in such a way as to be able to do so.

It is obvious that you have no wish for the majority of people to be
able to read your mail, as you refuse to acknowledge that your
messages are not in a format that people support.  You hide behind
RFC2015, saying "look, I'm following the standard.  I must be right."

The fact is, there's no "right."  It comes down to what you're trying
to accomplish.  If you're interested in pissing people off and being
ignored, then you're doing OK.  Otherwise, you might consider backing
down on this one.  The only thing you're going to acheive is an
inability to communicate with the majority of internet users.
