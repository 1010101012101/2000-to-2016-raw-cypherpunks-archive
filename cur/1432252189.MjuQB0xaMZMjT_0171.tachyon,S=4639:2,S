Yeah, it'd be ideal for the CIA and FBI and KGB and Mossad and MI5 and ...
The perfect virus, unseen and untouchable.

who's "we"?

Yeah, much worse - it might let the user know that somebody was watching
them!

I don't see the perfect virus as something desirable.

Dude, you seem to be on some really nice drugs.  Can you get me some?
