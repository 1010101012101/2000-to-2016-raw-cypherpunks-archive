No, absolutely _nothing_ in the First can possibly imply any "enforced 
delivery" or "obligation to read." I assume you are semi-joking, but 
this bears repeating, especially for those here who seem to be unclear 
on the concepts.

Secondly, most if not all of the "anti-spam laws" are, in fact, 
directly in contravention of the First Amendment. (This applies to out 
of country spammers, such as our friends like Dr. Igaboo Umbalago, 
Director of Petroleum Resources of Nigeria. Why this is so is not 
because the Nigerians are Americans but because "shall not be 
infringed" means that neither Congress nor the cops can set up 
screening operations to examine the content of mail or telephone calls: 
there simply is no authority for such things, which means those who 
send letters or e-mail or who make telephone calls from France or 
Nigeria or Taiwan are all de facto and de jure covered by the First. 
The "penumbra," some might call it.)

Several lists or groups I am are consumed by spam and anti-spam 
debates. Nearly all participants in the debate miss the importance of 
the First.

The First does not allow government to be in the content examination 
business. Those who think otherwise need....well, you all know what 
they need. I am serious. I am fucking sick and tired of bureaucrats, 
legislators, and even people on lists like this thinking that they have 
some authorization to examine the letters or e-mails I receive.

Perhaps rather than retaliating against spammers, as many here have 
written about, we should be talking about mail-bombing and spam-bombing 
any politician or lawmaker who supports anti-spam legislation.
