       Rastafarians, Hindus, Native Americans, and all followers of
shamanic religions are certainly persectired under the multitude of laws
now "prohibiting the free exercise thereof.", and being the reknowned,
rabid anti-drug warrior that AssKrof is, that will only escalate under
his hand.
       Asskroft is not only a confirmed fascist, but also a blatant
Kristian bigot as well. Son of a Pentacostal (Holy Roller) minister, he
himself is a Holy Roller minister. Ayatollah Asskroft.
       No doubt Ayatollah Asskroft will seek the guidance of his god, be
slain in the spirit (fall on the floor in a trance) and issue orders in
tongues when sending out his jackbooted thugs to burn witches and
rastas.
