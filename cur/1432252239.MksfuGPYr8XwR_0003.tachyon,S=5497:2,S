Subject: Re: [IP] [EPIC_IDOF] Getting consumers' consent to sell
cellphone tracking data

Interesting debate.  I don't see the big deal here, though.  A lot of
valuable information can be gleaned from using cell phones as anonymous
mobile transponders.  The key is that the wireless carriers not pass
on any
personally identifiable information to the company doing the
aggregation and
analysis, and that the scope of the information is geographically
limited.
Requiring consumers to opt in would render this concept DOA.  I would be
interested in seeing the details of what raw data they are intending
to turn
over.

The way the wireless carrier should do this to keep me happy as a
consumer
who values his privacy is to send the aggregator a feed of lat/long with
some ephemeral ID that is constant for my phone (maybe changes
daily), but
cannot be resolved back to the ESN or phone number.  Moreover, they
should
only do this if the location is within some geographic mask that
represents
highway systems of interest.  I wouldn't want them to send a record
of me
pulling into my driveway, for instance.  This way, we get the utility
without giving up privacy.  Seems like a win-win to me.
