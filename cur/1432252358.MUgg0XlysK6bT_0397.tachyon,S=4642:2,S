2004.12.18:

"A new crime is sweeping the nation.  Criminals everywhere are now cloning 
implanted chips of passerby well to do rich.  Some have been caught hiding 
outside the bushes of the rich with a high powered RFID transponder, 
waiting for their victims to drive by.  Congress has been presented with a 
bill outlawing all RFID readers, except by store owners."

2005.03.22:

"In the news today, actress Jennifer Lopez has been found dead in a 
dumpster near a shady street with her hand severed.  Her American Express 
implant chip records show that unscrupulous fiends have ran up several 
million dollars in bar tabs all over downtown Los Angeles, and several 
large money wire transfers to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Iran.  Ms. 
Lopez apparently instructed AMEX to remove all her daily spending limits on 
her credit chip after her chip refused her intended purchases at her local 
Porsche dealer.  A recorded conversation with AMEX customer support reveals 
she believe it cramped her style.

"The FBI is searching for her killers.  Special Agent Tom Jones said that 
no further information will be made available at this time, as that the FBI 
does not wish to comment on an ongoing investigation since it may aid the 
perpetrators, and that citizens should switch to cash immediately.

"Random J. Citizen on the street commented: 'Well, what do you expect? 
Congress Outlawed RFID readers, and now the thugs have resorted to chopping 
off hands.'

"Meanwhile thousands of implanted citizens are suing American Express for 
refusing to allow removal of their credit card chips, some demanding 
billions of dollars for their severed hands."

2006.03.23:

"In an unsurprising move today, CEO Jim Jones of American Express 
Corporation has stepped down after his company recently filed for Chapter 
11 protection after Visa Corporation backed out of purchase negotiations."
