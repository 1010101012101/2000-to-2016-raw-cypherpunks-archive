I have, for many years. Check the archives.

I've also claimed that strictly speaking the Air Force, NASA, NSF, NOAA, 
etc. are actually unconstitutional. Why? Because the 10th requires some
sort of deligate (at least a sentence fragment) in the Constitution for
all laws. And there ain't one for any of these efforts.

[Note: I also do not suggest they be shutdown, only that a discussion of
       existance and suitable amendments be created. Especially NASA,
       I believe strongly that a federaly mandated support level via
       amendment is in their best interest. At least they'd have a
       guaranteed minimum. ]
