And, following up my own post:

The next two messages I read were from Eugene Leitl, who is someone
that I see duplicates from on every post.  His Message-Ids were 
technically the same, but they are long, and someone's server is
splitting them into two lines:

Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.4.33.0107271859290.18600-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de>

Message-Id: <Pine.SOL.4.33.0107271859290.18600-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.   
  de>

I think formail should be concatenating the lines before making the
check, but I see that it has a -c option that may help.
