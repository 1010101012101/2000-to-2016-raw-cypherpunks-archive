We also have that in the US, these daya particularly with artists whose 
preferred
medium is television, and in the past lots of WPA stuff, often on gov't 
buildings.
The National Endowment for the Arts subsidizes a range of works from
deep, emotionally complex performance art by Karen Finlay to Jesse Helms's 
favorite
black-velvet paintings of Elvis :-)

That's the case today - see Courtney Love's rants.
90% of the artists in the record business don't make money today,
or at least not for more than a couple years of obscurity with
an occasional 15 minutes of fame.  This is somewhat related to the
problem that 90% of everything is crap, but unfortunately there's
not always a close correlation between the two 90%s. :-)

A century ago, music was largely an individual, family, or
social activity, with most paid performers receiving payments for
live performances in front of audiences, though sound recordings and
player pianos were starting to emerge and commercial sheet music
had been around since about the 1840s.  The transformation of their work
from performing live into preparing packaged goods for mass distribution
is a relatively recent thing, and much of it dates from about the 50s
and the adoption of the transistor radio.  Some of it's also the
emergence of CDs as a durable product (since playing vinyl
records is a fundamentally destructive process.)

Feh.  They've already taxed us heavily for decades, not in money but in kind,
by nationalizing the airwaves and parceling them out to the politically 
connected.

There used to be a lot of this - we called it community theater,
and it's still thriving in the socialist community I grew up near.
In the rest of the country, too many people stopped doing that
when they got television.

I agree, and I'd also say that using anti-trust arm-twisting to
forbid Microsoft from bullying manufacturers into implement it
is *also* not a legitimate function of a minimal government.
