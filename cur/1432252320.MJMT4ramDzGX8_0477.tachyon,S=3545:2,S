I doubt you can get at the raw packets coming out of the GSM codec and
going to the modem without some serious mangling of the phone's
firmware. Initiating data-calls which then carry the encrypted voice
packets seem like a much more feasible idea. From what I've heard, some
of the recent crop of PDA phones, notably the Nokia 7650 and the
Sony-Ericsson P-800, contain an ARM-9 core with a clock speed above 100
MHz, which might just be sufficient for getting encrypted voice
communications on these gadgets of the ground. This of highly course
depends on how much cycles your voice codec chews. Seeing that both
phones run under Symbian OS 6 and 7 respectively you might even get
portability for your application.

Easier still might be porting Nautilus or Speak Freely to the Zaurus or
just using ZMeeting over an IPsec tunnel over a GPRS connection.

Cheers,
Ralf
