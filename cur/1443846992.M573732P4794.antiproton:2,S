More like, fatally flawed.

Here and there I wonder of possible constitutional clauses
(/amendments) which might somehow "balance" the degradation of the
state, whilst maintaining it's potential or claimed benefits:
 - eliminate politician salaries (or at least set them to a maximum of
the mean (not median) of government subsistence handouts (now -that-
might cause a rapid shift to "a living wage for everyone no
exceptions" :)
 - criminalise campaign donations (like HTTPS, raising the bar?)
 - do a Switzerland/ Israeli "every child must learn to competently
use a machine gun, and every household must possess at least one"
 - legalise at least all plants, probably all drugs
 - more?

So how does political anarchy improve on handling this 'problem', or
is it not a problem but a reality we must accept?

It is human nature to gather with or cooperate with those who hold
power, to the extent that it is in one's self interest - just as you
say above about those already holding power cooperating amongst
themselves.

I don't think any particular political system can solve the problem of
the base nature of humans, although I do think some systems may have
better prospects for social stability over some period of time -
although more fundamentally is the state of consciousness of "we
humans" - and educating the next generation to strive for something
higher than the pursuit of greed.

Re education, I do recommend John Taylor Gatto - I read one book a few
years ago and promptly ordered a few more to read, he is that
incisive, on topic and speaks from personal experience 'battling the
USA education system'.
