"Cryptography is increasingly becoming the centerpiece in the attempt by 
corporate interests to protect their intellectual property. This is 
particularly true in the case of the TCPA (Trusted Computing Platform 
Alliance) or Microsoft's Palladium. Furthermore, the attempt to apply 
cryptography to protect copyrighted material against unauthorized 
reproduction is still creating tremendous debate, particularly regarding 
the CBDTPA (Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act), not 
to mention the BPDG (Broadcast Protection Discussion Group). The general 
idea behind all of these groups and concepts is to mandate strong security 
through crypto hardware, which greatly benefits the entertainment industry, 
while potentially threatening the Open Source community..."
