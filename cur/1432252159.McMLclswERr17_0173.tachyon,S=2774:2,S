Remember not only to wear gloves when Anthraxing,
but to obtain your common materials from another city visited
tracelessly.  The prints of the salesclerks can give you away.
Maybe wash the paper in solvents?

This is why Ted K. sanded all the parts of his gizmos, even
though he wore gloves, ---to erase others' prints.  According
to the book by Shores & Waits.

Ted K. also encrypted his 'queerer' (more incriminating) stuff, with a
homemade cipher,
but he included the "key" amongst his written materials.  Classic
mistake.  [Alas
more details of algorithm not given; maybe strike up a written
correspondance with TK?]
