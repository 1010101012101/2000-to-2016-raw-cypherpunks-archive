The difference is: those people are incompetent in performing the roles
which they were elected for (i.g. being governors of country's wealth,
building laws and rules in the country to assist economy development and
such), but those people are very *competent* in ripping the other people
off. That is the primary reason why they went for the game to be elected
in government and that's the primary reason why they got power to do so.

Indeed. "Don't give power to those who desire it. Those who do, desire
it for their own profits".

I doubt that a significant number is either. There could be certain
percentage that is higher than in other countries, which might be the
reason of such image of a nation to exist.

Well, hard to say which 'real version' of capitalism is good. I would
strongly vote against american model for sure, which turns people and
people's relationships into mostly money-based relations. IMHO
relationships in eastern europe and asia are more human and less money
dependent than in US pretty much because of such reason.

It was a good thing (tm). That's what european union is coming too.
Easier econimics relationship between parts of the union. Easier
traveling. Centralised model of control of such union is a bit flawed
though, but definetely is better than heaps of small countries with its
own barriers.
