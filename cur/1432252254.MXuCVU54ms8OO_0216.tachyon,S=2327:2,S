I was around and subscribing to CNN during Oil War I. CNN did not 
profit from advertising, but from reputation. Not because their news 
team was especially great, but because CBS, NBC, and ABC were running 
"Wheel of Fortune" and "Entertainment Tonight" precisely when many 
Americans wanted to see what was happening. Those who did not already 
have cable sought it out.

Oil War II was not much different in coverage, despite the silly 
"embedded reporters." The difference was that most households now have 
access to cable or satellite, and having CNN and Fox and MSNBC is no 
longer a big deal.
