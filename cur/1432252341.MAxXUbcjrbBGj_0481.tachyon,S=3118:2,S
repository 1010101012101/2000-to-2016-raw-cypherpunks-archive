He doesn't plan to - mention of it will be out of sight due to the "co-operation" of the
media, and the rest of the world knew there was no justification for the attacks anyhow.  In
the mind of the majority of americans saddam was directly or indirectly responsible for the
9/11 attack (and Shrub really needed to win a war with *someone* over that; OBL is
conspicious in his non-capturedness, but that is the problem that the Russians had with him
back when the CIA were training and funding him, so that the US can't now find him (when he
was trained by them and had all that experience dodging the russians) is little surprise).
  Note that the promised evidence (that was "utterly convincing" but "could not be released
due to security considerations") has not only not surfaced, but probably never will
(excepting the equally convenient find of "OBL's planning PC" by the Wall St Journal and
their cracking of the EFS on there in three days - which may be possible if
http://www.crackpassword.com/products/prs/otherms/efs/ isn't snakeoil, but that OBL trusted
american export crypto seems unlikely given his traning)

The intel was creatively edited at best. Given the way the US treats countries that *do*
have WMD (such as N Korea) the very fact that the attack went ahead is probably all the
evidence you need that the US didn't expect saddam to have a usable defensive force, never
mind a WMD or three.

And it looks like they don't need to....
