Jim,

I'm more than a bit surprised that Ari says he's surprised. I think he's been =
around in the digital currency arena for decades and perhaps is only feigning =
surprise that social outliers and criminals are early adopters of disruptive =
technology. If one acknowledges that governments routinely exempt themselves =
from many of the criminal statutes applied to citizens (including murder) then =
the ability of those outside the halls of power to use these new services to =
their upmost can only be to the long term benefit to society even if some "elite's =
eggs are broken" to make new social compact omlettes.
