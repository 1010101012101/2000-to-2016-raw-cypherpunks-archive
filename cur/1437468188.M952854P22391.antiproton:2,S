Polymer 1.0 web app, which is the cleanest HTML / Javascript yet, talking via Swagger IO library to a Go single-executable Docker 
container (break out of that!) with a very simple matching webAPI app structure...  That was some work to find, validate, and 
select; you're welcome.

I love how Microsoft is happy that their mini Windows VM is "only" 400MB to start.

Web browsers are the new operating system, so I cut Firefox some slack.  Most of what you interact with in the browser API is a 
Javascript web app anyway.  I often have up to 700 tabs open...  It is the Javascript on those tabs that makes it a pig.

Nope, no bloatware round these parts. Someone missed the memo...
