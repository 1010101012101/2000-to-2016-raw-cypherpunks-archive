1. Modern munitions arm this way.  If you are an artillery shell
and you've been told to arm, and then felt 10s of Gs along
one axis and a lot of rotation around that axis, you've probably
been fired and can 'safely' explode when you hit something.

2. Why arm a satellite to do this is clear: During launch the rocket
could
screw up and dump your Top Sekrit satellite into the
drink where Mr. Not-so-Friendly Submarine picks it up.

It doesn't even violate a treaty if you can't use the satellite
offensively (no glide next to a target satellite and go boom).
And everyone puts a self-destruct charge in the launch
vehicle anyway.  Stressful jobs, RSO.
