an opportunity to gleefully to correct my ignorance, alas, trigger
happy Jake fumbled it.

Jake and i don't get along. i call him out on his bullshit opinions
and lack of expertise in various technologies/languages when he speaks
out of ignorance, and i care nothing for his attention seeking and
ego.

it's interesting to see the myriad perspectives of those who interact
with him.  some grant him way too much credit and reverence, others
have been on the receiving end of his "colorful personality" and keep
a darker opinion.

in any case, whenever i feel bad about his posturing i just pull up my
favorite cell vid of him at DEF CON 19,
 "You can't record me. Don't you know who I am?? I'm Jacob Fucking Applebaum!"


best regards,
  coderman (who is a jerk for speaking ill of Jacob, i do admit!)
