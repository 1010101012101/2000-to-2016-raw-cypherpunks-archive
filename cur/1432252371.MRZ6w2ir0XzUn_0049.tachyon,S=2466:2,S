There are two fronts in the crypto war.

One is the between professionals who don't really waste time reading popular
press and associated crypto-propaganda. It's highly probable that even minor
principalities and their dictators have sufficient access to the basic crypto
expertize - and practical implements like PGP source code. For less than a
$1000 one can put together quite secure pgpfone over POTS, radio or whatever. I
don't think that anyone today reads anyone else's big secrets. What happens in
the field, among ordinary mercenaries is another issue - small portable secure
communicators are probably more common in us forces than among taliban.

Another front is more interesting, it's the current strategy against crypto for
the masses. The strategy is a very good one and it works better than anything
before: the crypto is simply not mentioned at all. In my own experience, more
lay people were aware of crypto issues in mid-90ties than today. By forcing it
below the radar of pop interest, the crypto was dealt the strongest blow so
far. The discrepancy between perils of data harvesting and awareness of it is
rising. This falls. I guess, in the Big Lie axiom: the bigger the lie, the more
will believe it.
