For low security applications I just (carefully) break them by hand (careful:
ballistic
polycarbonate, so cover your eyes). Shredding would be good, but it would
take
an expensive shredder. Sudden thermal stress (liquid nitrogen, etc) might be
good enough
to delaminate, leaving clear disks behind.

For no adequately explored reason I've tried various ways of physically
destroying CDs:

- Hammer on hard surface: Leaves lots of little fragments, generally still
stuck
  together by the protective coating.

- Roasting over an open fire: Produces a Salvador Dali effect until they
catch
  fire, then huge amounts of toxic smoke ("fulfilling our carbon tax quota"
  was one comment) and equally toxic-looking residue.

- Propane torch: Melts them without producing combustion products.

- Skilsaw: Melts them together at the cutting point, rest undamaged.

- Axe: Like skilsaw but without the melting effect.

- Using the propane torch and hammer to try and drop-forge a crude double-
  density CD: Messy.

Peter.
