Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real problem that is inherent in 
a|| current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Personal Gateway from any cel|u|ar or land|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 20O,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|liOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wil| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov

respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||u|ar phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a g|obal scale. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met
