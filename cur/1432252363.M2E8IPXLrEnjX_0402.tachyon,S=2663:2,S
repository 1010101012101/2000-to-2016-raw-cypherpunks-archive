Subject: UK must balance surveillance and data collection with privacy

Britain's House of Lords Constitution Committee released a report
Friday saying that the country's use of widespread video surveillance
and personal data collection pose a threat to citizens' privacy and
freedom. The committee said that while such surveillance and data
collection could serve legitimate law-enforcement purposes, those
interests should be balanced against privacy concerns, including
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The committee
also issued specific recommendations that DNA data on individuals be
consolidated to the National DNA Database, and that closed-circuit
television surveillance only be used under strict oversight and where
it has been shown to be effective.
