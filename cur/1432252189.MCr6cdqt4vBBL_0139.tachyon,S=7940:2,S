This says nothing about current development.  Word I've heard (from
someone tangentially involved with the project) was that the release was
something of a desperation move.  As someone who watches free software
licences closely, the Plan 9 license is one of the more twisted bits of
corporate-authored licenses.  Not necessarially bad, but it reeks of
compromise clauses speaking to internal battles.  Rumor was that a
codebase that had been stable for a couple of years saw a slew of
commits in the weeks leading to the public release.

How about its external use track record?

The license is *not* OSI certified, nor is it considered Free Software
by the FSF.

This is a plus.  There are other systems which provide this, from
Guardian GNU/Linux to, IIRC, Jon Shapiro's EROS.  EROS shares a number
of design similarities with Plan 9, as I understand, though I can't
admit to more than a nodding aquaintance with either.

Ditto GNU/Linux.

What does this mean?  How does this compare with, say, GNU/Linux and
/proc?

How does this compare with, say, journaled filesystems?  I'm not
challenging, I don't understand the statement above and am not familiar
with the technology.

Built into what?  Filesystems?  Networking?  How does this differ from a
GNU/Linux approach of providing encrypted filesystems and/or FreeSWAN
and/or SSH as modules and/or userspace.

Oh, now *that's* compelling....

What's Inferno?
