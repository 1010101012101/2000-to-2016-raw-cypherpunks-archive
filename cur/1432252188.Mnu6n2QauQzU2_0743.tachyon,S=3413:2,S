Interesting. I'll have to read that J-STD-025A.

-TD


ALAMEDA, Calif. -- MetaSwitch, supplier of the VP3500, the industry's first 
true Next Generation Class 5 Switch, announced today that it has completed 
an extensive review with the FBI, which demonstrates that the MetaSwitch 
CALEA specification meets the J-STD-025A standard for circuit switching 
equipment.

CALEA, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, requires that 
U.S. carriers provide Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) with the continued 
ability to perform electronic surveillance with existing and new 
telecommunications switching equipment. Electronic surveillance consists of 
either the interception of call content (commonly referred to as wiretaps) 
and/or the interception of call-identifying information (commonly referred 
to as dialed-number extraction).

"We simplified providing CALEA compliance for our customers by incorporating 
CALEA functionality on-board the MetaSwitch VP3500 rather than requiring 
additional external equipment", said John Lazar, Vice President of Sales and 
Marketing. "We are ensuring the completeness of our solution with ongoing 
testing with the FBI."

In light of the current uncertainty in world events, electronic surveillance 
is becoming increasingly important as a tool for law enforcement agencies. 
Therefore it is vital that vendors and telecommunications carriers develop 
and deploy solutions that support electronic surveillance, in both 
traditional TDM and next generation packet-based networks.

Technical requirements or standards for CALEA capabilities have been 
established for several categories of telecommunications by industry 
associations or standard-setting organizations, in consultation with 
representatives of the law enforcement community. The Telecommunications 
Industry Association (TIA) and Committee T1, standards organizations, are 
currently working on a further revision, J-STD-025B to cover packet based 
networks.
