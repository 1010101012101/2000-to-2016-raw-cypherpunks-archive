How does whining not qualify as fixing the problem?

But only one of us has to do it, and the post the real link. That takes
almost zero effort and benefits everyone else on the list and reading
the list in decades to come.

Also, BAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.

You're right! How could I not see this before! Obviously the
Illuminati/Freemasons/Majestic-12/Walt Disney+Adolf Hiter have hacked

I believe I do. If I could summarize your main points:

     I. BAWWWWW BAWWWWWWWWWWW BAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
    II. BBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
   III. BAWWW! BAWWWWWWWWWW! BAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW...

Did I get everything right?

See, there are two routes you, as first responder could have taken.

     1. Resolve the complete, un-shortened link, or
     2. Bitch and moan about how nobody has the cypherdick you do.

(1) is productive and helps everyone. (2) is a stupid pointless waste of
time. Is that the tr00 cypherpunk way?

No hon, I just grabbed it from the HTML I posted. How much cred have I
lost? Should I just burn this key and switch to a new nym?

Well you have a poopy face.
