And in another message:

I said:
=> In other words, the manufacturer has access to all your data because
=> they have the master storage key.
=>
=> Why would everyone want to give one manufacturer that much power?

Who owns PRIVEK?  Who controls PRIVEK?  That's who own's TCPA.

And then there was this comment in yet another message:

Just how "immune" is this program space?  Does the operator/owner of
the machine control it, or does the owner of PRIVEK control it?  So
the owner of PRIVEK can send a trojan into my machine and take it over
anytime they want.  Cool, kind of like the movie "Collosis" where a
super computer takes over the world.

The more I learn about TCPA, the more I don't like it.

Patience, persistence, truth,
