I have been thinking about the DMCA recently, in respect to the limited
ability granted to researchers for analysis of security protocols. 

I doubt we'll see a significant rise in the reverse engineering of
security protocols. We *will* see a rise in the use of anonymous remailers
to reveal vulnerabilities, but overall, I think that such research will
decrease.

Would GSM have been broken if the researchers couldn't have taken credit
for it? Inside the NSA it would have been, surely. But where is the
incentive for private researchers to attack these protocols if they can't
take public credit for their work? 

The allowances that the DCMA makes for academic research is not sufficient
to continue to provide motivation for such research. Which is exactly what
the manufacturers want: security through obscurity, and obscurity through
legality.
