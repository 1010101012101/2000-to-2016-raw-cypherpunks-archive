But this is a well-established unsolvable problem in
philosophy. It is impossible to examine your fundamental
ideas for they are what you stand on to examine. What
you think are basic are at least one step up from fundamental.

Another person can see your fundamentals but not you, and
vice versa.

Faustine demonstrated this with her parable about locating
a long-lost acquaintance, as did he her, uh, her he. He did
not could not recognize what she saw in him, and she did
not see how he identified her. What she saw was a secondary
appearance he claims to have seen in her writings, not primary.

There is no way out of the dilemma of not being able to see in 
yourself what others do, what they see in you is transparent
to you. An unexamined life is the only possibility -- the joke
of the opposite canard.

Camouflage at will, but it will take another party to check
how you blindly failed to protect yourself.

That's why relying on your own secret remailer the first hop 
is futile.
