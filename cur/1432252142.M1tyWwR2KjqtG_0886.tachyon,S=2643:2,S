There is no standard size. Usualy county lines are drawn for historical
reasons. Though at time of statehood this does get reviewed and modified.

Texas has over 200. Some have several M (I live in Travis and it has 1M,
Harris Country [Houston] probably has close to 5M) a couple in W. Tx. have
only a few thousand.

I'd be surprised if many (any?) states have any sort of program to get
people to perferentialy live in certain counties. I suspect the other
counties might get upset.

I suspect Florida is quite similar.
