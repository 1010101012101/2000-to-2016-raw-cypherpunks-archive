I have seen "private" and "secret" defined in exactly the opposite fashion
as regards keys:  a "private" key is private because you never ever share
it with anyone, whereas a "secret" (symmetric) key is a secret because
you've told someone else and you expect them to not share it (in the sense
of "can you keep a secret?").

Clearly there's not a common understanding of these simple words.  Seems
to me that Dan's mini-rant was referring to "privacy" in the sense you
define it above (controlling spread of info already held by others).
