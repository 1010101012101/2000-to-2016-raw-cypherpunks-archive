How to get connected with the people, to demostrate empathy and an
understanding of the real concerns of particularly the younger
generations, how to build that bridge between government and their elite
backers and, well everyone else who's not part of the one percent?

Well here follows at least one person's demoncratic
attempt to build this needed neo liberal bridge.

Enjoy.

Germany Sochi Boycott

It is an unbelievable statement, but also a very revealing statement
that shows just how arrogant and untouchable the Brussels elite ruling
class believe they have become.

In much the same fashion as teflon Hillary Clinton in the United States,
the German political class is also under the impression that they are
the chosen rulers of a peasant population that simply does not
appreciate their benevolence and kindness to the sheeple masses.

In a recent TV interview, German President Joachim Gauck said…

“The elites are not the problem, the people are the problem.”

Germans did not take kindly to the President’s statements, and let him
have it with boos and spit.

The anger that is building up all over the western world towards the
global elites is breath taking. It is only a matter of time anger spills
over into blood and revolution. Zerohedge reports
(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-13/german-president-booed-attacked-after-claiming-people-are-problem-not-elites)
…

Official German State TV and State Radio reported that “a handful of
right wing extremists” have attacked the president and disturbed the
otherwise peaceful and welcoming reception of the President. This is
simply not the case, as seen in the video…

The people repeatedly shouted “Traitor!”, “Get out!”, “We don’t want
STASI Pigs” and “We are the people!”.

One man, carrying his young son on his shoulders, appears to have spit
on him whilst exclaiming insults. Other citizens were heard saying “You
killed our children” and “What have you done to us?”. They were blocked
by police in riot gear, to whom they said “You are protecting
warmongers, shame on you!”

The situation escalated and the riot police was forced to use pepper
spray.

Heiko Maas, the German Justice Minister, called the attackers “cowards
who insult the president because of their personal frustration”. He
himself was booed off the stage as a traitor by hundreds of Germans at
the annual Labor Day celebration on the 1st of May. He said that they
will be persecuted immediately, as “it cannot be allowed that such a
tiny minority has influence on the political climate in Germany”.

Germany, the stalwart of the EU, is a social mess. Financially, Deutsche
Bank is a house of cards. Europe be warned, the “tiny minority” is
sending a message which the political class chooses to simply ignore.
