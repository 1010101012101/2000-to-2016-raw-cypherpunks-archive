OpenSSH, sshurely.

Is that UK-based? OpenSSL might well be, at least sort-of, but OpenSSH? I
dunno, but I doubt it.

There are potential problems ahead for OpenSSL in the UK. The EU dual-use/
(including crypto) export control regulations might be about to be
implemented here, under the Export Control Act 2002,.. but it won't affect
the actual releases, just talking about them beforehand...
