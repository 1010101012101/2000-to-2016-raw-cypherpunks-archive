How to get there from here.Is this the long dark night of the cypherpunks 
soul? I would argue that its the cliche darkests
hour before the dawn.The alphabet police soup are on us like a cheap 
suit,the list becomes the prototype of the entire web.
things look bloody bleak,Ill grant you that.Yet put yourself in their shoes 
for a sec,we are a bit like a motley bunch of global justice seekers that 
take over cities and scorn borders,advancing in diversity, we  strike in 
unison.
The logic and morality of the state is letting them down,dictatorships so 
much easier.Where does all the repression and money in the world lead them 
though? They cant catch every cypherpunk and run down every anarchist.What 
if we were to start using barter? I do some work for you and accept 10 
kudos instead of dollars,our contract calls for stiff defence of all 
attempts to tax the 'kudo'.Does the 'sweet spot' lie in the rush to provide 
the state with the means to torture,imprison and enslave? Or withdraw from 
the powder tainted means of exchange thats turning this place into 
venus.Paper money should share the same fate as repression,cypherpunks can 
mark the trail to the promised land,you know theres no other way.
Viva HAWALA!
