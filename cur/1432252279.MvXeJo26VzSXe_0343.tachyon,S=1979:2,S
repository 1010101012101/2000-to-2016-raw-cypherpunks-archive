	Has it occured to anyone this might be a covert US (or Chinese
or ....) operation to destroy the PRK nuke test setup, say with cruise
missiles, stealth B2 bombers,  or a infiltrated sabotage team ?

	That could produce a large explosion (but little radioactivity)...

	And with obvious PRK preparations for a test far advanced (see
today's NYT) , I would think it was now or never for such a covert
attack.

	Maybe that is why Dubya was completely shitfaced getting off the
helo at the WH on the way back from campaigning in Johnstown Pa this
past Thursday  ?   Too much pressure to keep that Jim Beam bottle in
the cabinet... one almost can't blame him...
