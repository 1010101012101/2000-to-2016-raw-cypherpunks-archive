I guess it has more to do with a mixture of all that.
Those who are going to school's, colleges are more
vulnerable to 'propaganda' and 'recruits'. Once the
propaganda sinks in,it is easily communicated among
peers and it grows.The uneducated are also vulnerable.
So, maybe the question is-how easy it is to
'brainwash' the individual. Some fall easy prey, some
fall in and are able to get out before they land in
trouble and some totally stay out of it.

 I guess only a part of them have really been
suppressed. The others would have just listened to
propaganda stories and that's cause enough for them.
