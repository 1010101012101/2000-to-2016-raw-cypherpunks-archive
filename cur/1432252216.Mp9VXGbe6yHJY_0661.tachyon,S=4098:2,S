A leading official in the new administration of Argentina's interim 
President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa resigned early today following massive 
street protests that erupted in the centre of the capital.
Police used tear gas and high-pressure water to disperse thousands of 
protesters who gathered at the the Plaza de Mayo, in front of the 
presidential palace, demanding the resignation of top government officials 
accused of corruption in past governments.
On December 20 mass protests at the Plaza de Mayo led to the toppling of 
former president Fernando de la Rua, who was replaced days later by interim 
President Adolfo Rodriguez Saa.
Carlos Grosso, a chief presidential aide resigned hours after the the 
protests started.
Presidential adviser Luis Lusquinos confirmed to reporters early today that 
Rodriguez Saa had accepted Grosso's resignation.
Grosso was one of the least popular figures named to the new government 
because of alleged corruption while he served as mayor of Buenos Aires 
during the presidency of former president Carlos Menem.
Late yesterday and early today thousands of demonstrators across the 
capital spontaneously took to the streets, banging on pots and pans to 
protest the incorporation of allegedly corrupt officials into government, 
as well as continued limits on withdrawing of money from bank accounts.
Argentines are angry because the new government has maintained limits on 
cash withdrawals from the banks to 1,000 pesos (dollars) a month.
Officials also announced that once the restrictions are lifted, term 
deposits will paid out in the new currency - called argentinos - that has 
depreciated even before it hits the streets, further adding to public 
discontent.
