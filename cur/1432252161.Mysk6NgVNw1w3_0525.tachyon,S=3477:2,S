Uh.  Not the one I took.  Blue books and more blue books.  Three days of blue
books.

Not only that but not all schools "teach the test."  Most "national" law
schools don't teach bar stuff at all.  The passage rate for Harvard or
University of Chicago is much lower than the Law School at De Paul University,
for example.  Some schools have an academic program focused on the law in the
state you are in.  Some don't.
