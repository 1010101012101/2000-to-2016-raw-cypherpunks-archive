experience includes 4 days spent touring Northern Italy in your chosen 
Ferraris, VIP treatment in the Ferrari museum and 3 nights in 4* hotels.

This VIP trip includes flights, helicopter transfers and 2 nights in 
a luxury hotel in Monte Carlo.

'In The Know' Prize Draw: You don't have to be the fastest though.
