The secular bible: Our project

 

First let me speak to my Christian brothers and sisters. I mean you no 
disrespect by using the term "bible" in an unholy attack on your faith.

The project of this secular bible honors the sanctity of holy documents.

A secular bible could only be true to itself is it stood for tolerance 
and cooperation.

 

 

We all know of the worldwide spread of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. 
We acknowledge the existence of what we can only call "evil" in the world.

We have less agreement on what we call "good" or "godlike"  We have not 
found enough agreement on what to do about evil.

 

There are those among us who hold to the principle no agreement is 
required. The proper agents in the war against chaos are the free and 
independent thinkers of the mythical open society. The radical edge of 
this stance is the notion that cooperation always entails disaster in 
the form of unintended consequences.

 

There are those among us who are afraid of the unknown. Many of us 
prefer to keep to the familiar. We find ourselves in circles of friends 
and relatives and find comfort or at least solace in the company of 
these others. We become "us".

 

There is a subtle danger in this. The formation of community is also the 
formation of "them"

 

There are those among us who fear "them" so much that the very thought 
of cooperation is scary. To them the idea that there could be a science 
of cooperation is absurd. They will cite economics and rational self 
interest to avoid gambling on trust. The run-away paranoia that can 
ensue will tax their freedom as surely as the state must.

 

The project of the science of understanding, this secular bible giving 
people an understanding of their part in the universe, and the tools 
they need to get along with all manner of thinkers.

Of course this is all meant sarcastically.

The Lord knows, nobody wants to just get along.
