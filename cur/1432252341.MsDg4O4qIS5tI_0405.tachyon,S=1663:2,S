Excellent humor, this Hooverismo, got all the usual targets
in his insulting-like-Lenny-Bruce jibe. Probably high on
narcotics like Lenny. Imagined victory turns on losers.

A bit excessive with hyperbole, but that's code by comics.

Remember the CIA Comic from the late 90s? Told hilarious
inside the agency jokes that made everyone outside the
cocoon blanche and puke, sorry, Bob blew coke through
his nose.

That comic has not been heard since 9/11, thanks to
DoD takeover of the howler stage.
