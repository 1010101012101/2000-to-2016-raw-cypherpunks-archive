The word murder does appear.  Murder is defined as "wrongful killing.", 
hence is by definition a particular kind of evil.  Indeed it is the 
archetypal example of evil, the type specimen of evil.

The point is that to know whether a killing indicates the killer is likely 
to kill me, I have to make a moral judgement of the killing, to determine 
that the killing is morally similar to killing me.

Trotsky thought that killing political enemies of the bolsheviks was 
different from killing Trotsky.  He was wrong.

Conversely people who believe that the Vietnam war was an evil act of 
aggression are likely to erroneously believe that Vietnam veterans are 
dangerous people, whereas people who have a more balanced view of the 
Vietnam war have a more accurate perception of Vietnam veterans.

Surely the events of the twentieth century settled the matter 
decisively.  Those who believe otherwise are monsters or fools, knaves or 
dupes.  When people die as a result of their error, others should learn.

If this was so, why do regimes that propagate evil ideas find it so vital 
to control all sources of information?  Their hostility to empirical 
evidence, their hostility to the mere act of paying attention to empirical 
evidence, shows that it is not so easy to maintain false moral beliefs in 
the face of the evidence, shows that most people can not only easily cross 
the is-ought gap, but scarcely refrain from doing so.

Anyone who propagates false moral beliefs also propagates false emprical 
claims supporting those false moral beliefs -- hence for example the 
continual debates where Marxists claim that Marx's predictions are coming 
true.  If there was an is ought gap, they would find it unnecessary to so 
tightly couple moral and factual claims.

But they did not die for their beliefs.  Had they died fighting jews they 
would of died for their beliefs.  Instead they were killed by their fellow 
nazis.

Evil, wrong, and murderous are not different categories.  "Murderous" is 
the classic example of evil, and when I talk of "wrong" I say that the 
Trotsky's moral judgements were in error.

Those who are aware of the existence of objective evil predicted that the 
nazis and the commies would murder friend and enemy alike.  Those blind to 
this obvious fact failed to make that prediction.
