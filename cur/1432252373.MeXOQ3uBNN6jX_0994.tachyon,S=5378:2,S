Hospital internet system could spot bioterrorist attack
10:09 17 December 01
Duncan Graham-Rowe
A computerized early warning system may soon be monitoring US hospitals for 
the first signs of a bioterrorist attack. By raising the alarm quickly, it 
could reduce the spread of diseases such as smallpox, say its developers.

Called the Lightweight Epidemiology Advanced Detection and Emergency 
Response System, it should spot outbreaks of infectious diseases before 
doctors are even aware of a problem, says Brigadier General Klaus Schafer, 
assistant surgeon general for medical readiness, science and technology for 
the US Air Force.

Via a secure internet connection, LEADERS can extract details of patients' 
symptoms and lab results from hospital records, regardless of what software 
a hospital uses. This means hospital staff won't have to do any extra work, 
says Schafer. "Nurses don't have time to enter stuff into a computer," he 
says.Leaders,patriot etc,its time for C.R.A.P
Yes the Committee for Reform of An acronym Policy is in the house.Please 
push hard and give C.R.A.P. all you can.
