I have a solution.

I keep MIME turned off, and if the 7-bit representation of the 
message is not instantly recognizable as substantially English, 
I hit delete. 

Sometimes, if I am in a bad mood, I hit delete upon seeing the 
large "M" next to the message on the index, and don't even bother
reading it.

If the MIME infestation proliferates, this process can be automated.
