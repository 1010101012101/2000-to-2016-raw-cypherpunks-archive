Completely agree

There are serious fucked up forces at work if you dont think so just look

There arent really aha moments it is a build

But i would say you take this too far its like the axiom of the alcoholic
admitting there is a drinking problem is half the battle

And ignoring the repeat button played by the parasite of the mind in our
own lives is never getting off the merry go round

but learned work arounds in order to amp the build of state power

See dick cheney - bombs panama ... experiences no lasting backlash as
secretary of state then bombs iraq as vp with relative ease
