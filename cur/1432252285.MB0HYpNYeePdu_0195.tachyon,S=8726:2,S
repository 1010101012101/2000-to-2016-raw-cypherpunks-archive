| I'm not so sure. If you create a nym as a unique entity which has
| control of keys which control assets, the word "unique" points to
| bearer-instrument protocol of some kind. A stock-exchange seat comes

What is the unique entity seperate from its key?  You can't have a pen 
legally controlling your stock exchange seat, so how can a keypair?

You can use a keypair to show control (like a chop), but I'm unaware
of anywhere the instrument is considered to have control.

| Which means, you need a different protocol for selling them. I think

| instrument, a contingent claim of some kind. Title to assets, at the
| very least, plus or minus "goodwill", for lack of a better word. I

| of a collection of assets that are worth more together because they
| can transfer the value of those assets for more competitive advantage
| internally than the firm gets if those assets are sold into the
| market directly.

Nyms don't have assets.  People and legal fictions have assets.

| See, you're talking about finance already :-). Insurance is a
| contingent claim on assets based on external events. Remember how
| they called program trading of various derivatives "portfolio
| insurance" once apon a market crash?

All men are Socrates.

I can buy insurance against the value of things without needing to
allow those things to own other things.  For example, I have this fine 
diamond ring, which is insured.  I have this fine .jpg of Bill and
Monica, which is not insurable, because it is copyable.  Neither my
diamond ring, nor my jpg, may own property.

| 
| First of all, I think that music shouldn't be copy controlled,
| because it's "software", in the pure Beckerian sense of something
| that can be copied, and, on the net it can be copied for almost
| nothing, something that probably makes Coase smile, somewhere, which
| was my point about commodity markets for information.

So, how does music differ from a key?  Its all bits, and those bits
are easier to create than musical bits.

| The part about selling something once is what Chaum did already with
| DigiCash. The mint keeps a copy of the first "note", and, if another
| one crosses the transom, the key of the counterfeiter is revealed.
| Anyone who takes the cash offline, without the participation of the
| underwriter, deserves what he gets if the cash is double-spent,
| right?
| 
| I think the apparatus for selling nyms is there already. Like I said
| before, all we need is an exchange protocol, something, like price
| discovery, has already been solved by lots of people (Micali has one,
| for instance, though I'm not sure how good it is because I'm not
| qualified to examine it), so we just have to find the best one.

And why can't we apply those to music?
