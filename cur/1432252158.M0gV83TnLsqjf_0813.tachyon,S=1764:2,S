What expectation of privacy do you have, using facebook?

As far as I know, facebook can only be accessed through a plain-text
real time connection.  These emissions from your site, along with all
the others, are subject to being archived by your adversary.  Being
plain-text, they can later be used to assemble a dossier on you.
Privacy is lost.
