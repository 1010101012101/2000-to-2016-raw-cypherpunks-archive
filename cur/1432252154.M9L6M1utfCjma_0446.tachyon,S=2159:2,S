   Part of which says:

(b) Termination review of national emergencies by Congress

Not later than six months after a national emergency is declared, and not later
than the end of each six-month period thereafter that such emergency continues,
each House of Congress shall meet to consider a vote on a joint resolution to
determine whether that emergency shall be terminated.

   Funny, I've never heard or read anything about them doing this.
