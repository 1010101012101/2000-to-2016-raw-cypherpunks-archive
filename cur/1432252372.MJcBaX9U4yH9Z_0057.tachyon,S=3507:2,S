Congratulations, you just discovered the "Range Safety Officer" who
gets to press the button when a rocket goes astray.

Problem with putting this on a plane (I realize this is not what
you proposed tongue-in-cheek or not) include 
* malicious spoofing of the destruct signal by folks on the ground
* jamming the destruct signal so you get to keep flying the cruise missile
* real, but unnecessary, FAA/NORAD destruct signals, e.g., machine or
personnel failure

(Shades of giving cops the ability to stall a car to prevent chases..)
