Yep, it is the fact that my conversation programs are stateless that
makes the situation most appalling.

But the point it, the illusion that Splotchy (see www.algebra.com)
is a human is created because a lot of humans participate in
conversations without even keeping their own "state". Remarks like
"oh realy", "that's terrible", etc etc, are stateless form of
conversation.
