Defense and Aerospace Systems Supplier Licenses CRI's Differential Power
Analysis Countermeasures

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Cryptography Research, Inc., a
worldwide leader in security systems, today announced that it has licensed
its Differential Power Analysis (DPA) countermeasure technologies to
Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN - News). In addition, Raytheon also purchased a
tool suite and training for its personnel to establish an internal group
focused on DPA countermeasures.

"DPA can be used to break implementations of almost any symmetric or
asymmetric cryptography algorithm, including proprietary and heavily
modified industry standard algorithms. The widespread use of strong
cryptography in both software and hardware has given DPA attacks and
countermeasures an increased importance," said Paul Kocher, president and
chief scientist of CRI.

"We are pleased to be working with Raytheon Company, and that they selected
CRI for its leading-edge countermeasure technologies," said Kit Rodgers,
vice president of licensing.
