an early report of this "Malicious Foreign Actor" status is from last year:
"Snowden Documents Reveal Covert Surveillance and Pressure Tactics
Aimed at WikiLeaks and Its Supporters"
 - https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/

where is stated:
 'A third document, from July 2011, contains a summary of an internal
discussion in which officials from two NSA offices – including the
agency’s general counsel and an arm of its Threat Operations Center –
considered designating WikiLeaks as “a ‘malicious foreign actor’ for
the purpose of targeting.” Such a designation would have allowed the
group to be targeted with extensive electronic surveillance – without
the need to exclude U.S. persons from the surveillance searches.'


and finally, note this quote:
"""
Asked if it would be permissible to “target the foreign actors of a
loosely coupled group of hackers … such as with Anonymous,” the
response is unequivocal: “As long as they are foreign individuals
outside of the US and do not hold dual citizenship … then you are
okay.”
"""
 - i'd love to know how many times that guidance is violated!


best regards,
