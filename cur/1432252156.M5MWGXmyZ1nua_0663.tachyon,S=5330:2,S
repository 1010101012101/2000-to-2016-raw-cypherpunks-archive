I gave a little bit of thought about what an encrypted email client 
should look like for joe sixpack to use.  Here's how the DEFAULT
behavior would work:

When you install the   software, it generates a public-private key
pair. It saves your private key right there on your hard disk
unencrypted, no tricky passphrase to remember.  It then uploads
your private key to some central server.

The software maintains a list of public keys, if you want to send
mail to someone for whom  you don't have a public key, it'll
check the server for one. If you have a key for someone, it'll
automatically encrypt. If you receive encrypted mail, it'll 
automatically decrypt (and save the decrypted mail on your hard 
drive). It'll have a little icon on a mail message indicating if
it was encrypted, and there'll be an icon next to each name
in the address book indicating if you have a key for that
address, but for the most part it'll encrypt opportunistically
and the user won't need to know or care  if a message is
encrypted or not.

I'm sure I don't need to go into detail explaining what's wrong with 
this, but it should be obvious that every convenience violates
an important security rule.  And it pretty much has to be that way.
You either have to remember a passphrase and key it in, or
any fool who gets access to your computer can easily read your
private key, and so on.

Personally, I think it'd be better if the sixpackers used this kind
of encryption than no encryption at all, if I thought that people
wuld use this kind of email client I would write it, it shouldn't
be too hard since I could probably steal most of the code.
