Sure it is. The measures, if any, taken to insure that the "person" being granted a "digital voter registration card" is a 
"qualified voter" can be as lax or as stringent as the issuer may require. There is no reason that they would need be more 
stringent than current process, which, in the US, prohibit voter registration staff from requiring verification of identity. 
See the "Motor Voter" law.

Except in Chicago, etc., etc.

No different from the current arrangement. Voting in many jurisdictions can be done today by mail. How would a digital vote, 
using cryptographic protocols to insure anonymity, and authenticity (the registered person who was issued the digital voter 
registration has digitally signed the vote) be less likely to be "sold" than a mailed in vote?

And pardon the political comment, but almost all votes are sold now, as in the United States the democratic custom has 
declined to using votes essentially to transfer wealth from earners to voting blocs.

It is quite simpler to do such fraud with mail in votes, or even "buy me a drink and I'll vote however you'd like", or "yes, 
this is my pictureless voter registration card, and I'm here to vote".

A laugh a day keeps the economists away.

The "sold vote" boogeyman".

You need to submit evidence that "anonymous" "internet" voting is more likely to be fraudulent than paper, voter-present by 
mail voting. You have submitted none, and the "cryptography" word is insufficient to scare me off.

The "bogus digital voter registration" boogeyman.

You may also wish to show how digital voter registration cards would be more likely to be bogus than "Motor Voter, no-id 
required" registration cards. Good luck.

The "crypto" boogeyman.

I challenge you to show that current, published crypto voting protocols cannot accomplish the following:
1. one digital sig, one vote, the first one, and the others are discarded
2. no dig signature, no vote
3. no dig voter registration, no dig sig
4. anonymity, i.e., no connectibility between the voter's choice and his identity.
5. auditability, i.e., connection between each voting "lever throw" and a dig sig for the current vote.

Next, the "internet" boogeyman.

It's just a pipe/wire/whatever. Bits. Don't be afraid. If the bits are properly signed, no problem and whether "internet" 
bits or voter-machine-punched-paper-tape-bits is irrelevant.
