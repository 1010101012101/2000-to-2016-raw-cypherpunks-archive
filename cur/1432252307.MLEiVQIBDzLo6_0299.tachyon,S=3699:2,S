      So right -- all these people talking about "it had to be a big, well
funded, well organized group with lots of resources" are talking total nonsense.
It could have been a tiny cadre of eight or twelve people with no more money
than to buy some plane tickets. Flying a plane doesn't take a heck of lot
either, once it's in the air. It's not even that hard taking off -- landing is
the bitch.

        What would be so hard about getting past security if they used plastic
knives -- those zytel daggers sold all over the place would be pretty damn
effective. I would imagine that they wouldn't have just threatened with them
anyway, they would have just used them and killed the crew quickly. A plastic
knife would be all they needed, and no metal detector would spot that.
