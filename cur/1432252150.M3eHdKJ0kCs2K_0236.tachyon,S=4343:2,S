XSSatEGOLD-Content-Tech

XSS flaw found at "https://www.e-gold.com"

technically, it's nothing new. 

XSS at E-gold is very dangerous. E-gold is one of the most popular way to 
do international business. and unlike credit card system, e-gold sent, it 
never comes back. there is no refund policy. 

so stealing passphrase means stealing real gold. 

it's important, so i take it seriously.

[exp]

technically, there is only one thing important for XSS attackers:
some CGI can only be found when you are logged in, but they can be reached 
even if you are not logged in.
of course, the module dealing with logged-in users is different from the 
one dealing with un-logged-in users.
so, you have to test in both situations to ensure it's not XSS vulnerable.
