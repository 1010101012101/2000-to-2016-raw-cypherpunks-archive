And Ray knows, because he's surveyed ALL THE COUNTRIES. No, not just all
the countries ALL THE CULTURES. No, not just all the cultures. ALL THE
TRIBES. No, no... silly me. ALL THE PEOPLE. That's it. Ray has spoken to
and speaks for all the people. That's why he can so safely make categorical
statements about human society on a global level.

Oh, wait. None of that's true. And the rest of Ray's email makes twice as
many good points as he did in that statement! ;-)

LOLing @ the ignorance and hate, and @ Ray's complaining of people only
talking about LGBT affairs when they have "AGENDAS", and "AGENDAS" are
apparently bad, but Ray doesn't have any "AGENDAS". Good job blowing the
cover on that CIA op, Ray. We spent a lot of time and money on that,
backstopping their IDs and producing plenty of pocket litter. We should've
known you'd use a translated statement of "they weren't regulars" to prove
it was a black ops CIA team. We thought we were so clever being
revolutionaries in Russia and using hammers to demolish stuff as part of
PROJECT SICKLE. Damn and double damn, and also other Shatnerian rants
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcC1f1jqCPI>.

Don't worry though, Ray - I'll put in a good word for you at the GCI (Gay
Central Intelligence) and the BSA (Bisexual Security Agency). I don't have
any real contacts at NALO (North Atlantic Lesbian Organization)
intelligence though, so you're SOL (Sodomized Out of Luck) there.

But remember, when in doubt, turn to Kevin Smith and Malcolm's immortal
words on the sins of homosexuality and the pure love that is the Westboro
Baptist Church of Hateology
