Dear Sir/Madam   
  
logoffice.Com   US$ 640 
 
Please note that after years, the registration on the domain name  
logoffice.Com  was not renewed and this   
domain had become available to  register.  
  
Consequently, we have been approached to market this domain name that has  been 
tracked and registered by a client.    
As result,logoffice.Com  now  available from us for IMMEDIATE transfer.    
  
With so many companies that could benefit from this domain, along with  what 
many would consider to be a "wholesale   
price", we hope to secure a  quick transfer.  
  
Please note that the domain name market is extremely solid at the moment  and  
similar domains are currently selling on   
afternic.com, greatdomains.com  (domain auction sites) and by domain name 
brokers, in some cases, for many  thousands   
of US dollars.   
  
Please note that transfers take just 15 minutes and are extremely  
straightforward - absolutely NO technical knowledge   
required!  For our client's peace of mind, we use an escrow service for all  
transactions and domains are ALWAYS secured   
by the buyer prior to us  receiving any funds. We pay all fees connected with 
the escrow process.   
  
If you would like to use Www.logoffice.Com  for your online business,    
please contact us at your earliest convenience. We will be on hand should you 
require any   
further assistance or information.   
We thank you for your attention and sincerely apologise if this e-mail has  not 
been of interest to you.   
  
  
Yours sincerely,   
  
MO,  
  
Sales,  
  
Marketing P-Z
