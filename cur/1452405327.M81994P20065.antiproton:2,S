note, the answer may be "no one"! :)

regarding my earlier comment about reverse engineering, sometimes
you're looking to prove a negative with a request - the "metadata" or
side channels associated with processing the request sufficient to
provide an answer, even if the content itself is all "[REDACTED]".

What Sidney Blumenthal’s Memos to Hillary Clinton Said, and How They
Were Handled

By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTMAY 18, 2015

In 2011 and 2012, Hillary Rodham Clinton received at least 25 memos
about Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and confidant who at the
time was employed by the Clinton Foundation. The memos, written in the
style of intelligence cables, make up about a third of the almost 900
pages of emails related to Libya that Mrs. Clinton said she kept on
the personal email account she used exclusively as secretary of state.
Some of Mr. Blumenthal’s memos appeared to be based on reports
supplied by American contractors he was advising as they sought to do
business in Libya. Mr. Blumenthal also appeared to be gathering
information from anonymous Libyan and Western officials and local news
media reports. What follows are descriptions of some of the memos and
how they were handled by Mrs. Clinton and her aides.

Clinton Says Idea on Rebels Should Be Considered

In April 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo about the rebel
forces fighting the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The rebels, Mr.
Blumenthal wrote, were considering hiring security contractors to
train their forces. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the memo to her aide, Jake
Sullivan, and said that the idea should be considered. (Pages 1-3)

Clinton Friend’s Libya Role Blurs Lines of Politics and Business

Sidney Blumenthal counseled Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was
secretary of state about Libya, where he was also advising a business
venture.

In 2011 and 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded 18 memos to Mr. Sullivan, who
in turn circulated them to senior State Department officials,
including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the
2012 attacks in Benghazi, and Ambassador Gene A. Cretz, who preceded
him.

=An Alert to Possible Terrorist Attacks in Libya
In May 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo reporting that
affiliates of Al Qaeda in Libya were plotting attacks in revenge for
the United States’ killing of Osama bin Laden. Mrs. Clinton forwarded
the email to Mr. Sullivan, saying that it was “disturbing, if true.”
Mr. Sullivan questioned its accuracy, but said he would share with
others. (Pages 4-5)

=Highlighting the Role of a Potential Business Partner
In January 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton about challenges
facing Libya’s new government. In the memo, Mr. Blumenthal said that
Libya’s prime minister was bringing in new economic advisers, and that
a businessman, Najib Obeida, was among “the most influential of this
group.” At the time, Mr. Obeida was a potential business partner for a
group of contractors whom Mr. Blumenthal was advising. Mrs. Clinton
instructed Mr. Sullivan to ask for a response from senior State
Department officials including Mr. Cretz, then the ambassador to
Libya. (Pages 6-15)

=A Memo Is Passed On, Despite Questions
In March 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded a memo by Mr. Blumenthal to Mr.
Sullivan, saying that she was dubious about its content. Mr. Sullivan
agreed, stating that Mr. Blumenthal’s report resembled “a conspiracy
theory” — but still asked State Department officials to review it.
(Pages 16-17)

=A Warning Is Forwarded to Incoming Ambassador
In April 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton warning about the
imminent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. Mrs. Clinton
forwarded the memo to Mr. Sullivan, who sent it to Mr. Stevens, the
incoming United States ambassador to Libya. Mr. Stevens’ response —
that the Brotherhood in fact had a relatively small following in Libya
— was passed on to Mrs. Clinton. (Pages 18-24)

=Clinton Suggests Sharing Information With Israel
After receiving an August 2012 memo from Mr. Blumenthal about how the
new Libyan prime minister wanted to have a better relationship with
Israel, Mrs. Clinton suggested to Mr. Sullivan that they pass the
intelligence along to the Israelis. (Pages 25-27)
