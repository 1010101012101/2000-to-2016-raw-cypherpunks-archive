Subject: [eff-austin] Super-DMCA hearing

Last night the Texas legislature held a hearing on HB2121, aka "super DMCA"
proposed by the MPAA. I don't have time for an extended comment, but thanks
primarily to testimony by EFF-Austin directors Doug Barnes and Adina Levin,
there was no action on the bill. Says Doug, "The chair ended saying that the
bill clearly needed a lot of work, and
encouraging the various folks in attendance to work on modifying the bill."

We'll follow up with more info about next steps etc.

We should all thank Doug and Adina for making it down to testify effectively
with little notice.

best,
Jon L.
