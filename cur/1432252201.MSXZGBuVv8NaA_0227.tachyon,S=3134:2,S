The War on Drugs could be stopped.  Think of it as a security problem.
The threat is "drugs are available in the US at free-market prices".
If there were a sucessful attack (ie, drugs became available at
free-market prices) the cost would be in the trillions of dollars per
year to the drug industry (ie, traffickers, law enforcement, military
anti-drug enforcement, intelligence agencies, etc).  To prevent this
threat from happening, two things need to be done: one, drugs must be
stopped at the border; and two, drugs must not be produced inside the
US.  A certain large amount of money is spent on these two security
policies.

Billions of packages move in and out of the US every year.  Every
single one of them could contain drugs.  If something were done to
radically increase the cost of hunting for drugs in these packages,
the War would come to an end.  Likewise, a huge amount of stuff is
produced, transported, and sold in the US, and if things could be done
to dramatically increase the cost of monitoring people, the war would
end.

Just some thoughts.
