What, all this to shut down a remop? Could as well reprogram one of these
aging ICBMs...

Which threat model? Individual remop, a country, a bloc?

Last time I looked US deficit was well on the way to turn thalers into
Soviet-era paper. It is somewhat hard to posture as a world hegemon if
everybody knows you're only operating because every significant investor is
propping you up, since running danger of losing their entire investment (in
for a penny...).

If it's going to give, it's going to be a landslide. Of course, then the
entire house of cards is going to crash down, which would suck. It could even
bring down the tigers/dragons, though they probably have enough own momentum
by now.
