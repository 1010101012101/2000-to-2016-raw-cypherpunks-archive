SEPA and bank transfers are (sometimes) also easily reversable. Paypal has
a policy against virtual currencies, after a quantity of bitcoin-related
paypal accounts had been closed people stopped using it. Wisely so, Paypal
has strange account-freezing policies.
You may still get a Paypal to Bitcoin exchange in a person-to-person trade
though, ask around. Bitcoin OTC can give you an indication of
someone's trustworthiness.
