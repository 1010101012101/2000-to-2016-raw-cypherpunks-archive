   I don't believe that corporations do have rights, or at least they certainly
shouldn't. There is a case before the Supreme Court as we speak about whether
Nike has a right to freedom of speech. Hopefully they will say no, which would
end corporate political contributions, the bane of our current political
situation. 
   However, along with freedom of speech, there is also a First Amendment
"freedom of the press" as well, so the press, including newspapers, can print
anything they want unless it's libel.
