 .........................................
Another day, another dollar Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. One good turn deserves half the blankets He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill! Lightning never strikes twice in the same place. We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  Opportunity seldom knocks twice. The Moon does not heed the barking of dogs 
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder You are a long time dead A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me. You get what you give There but for the grace of God go I  A gift given in secret soothes anger, and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath. 

Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs Little Strokes Fell Great Oaks Turn the other cheek Make love not war A miss is as good as a mr. Everything comes to him who waits One of these day is none of these days. Hasty climbers have sudden falls No wind, no waves Kill two birds with one stone The price of greatness is responsibility The pen is mightier than the sword. Great groups from little icons grow. Every body wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die


Without rice, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook  Silence is golden. Whah hurt eye does mek nose run water. God is Always on the Side of the Big Battalions Yuh gat fuh blow yuh nose where yuh stump yuh toe.	 Kill two birds with one stone 

Dah mouth dat man tek fuh court woman, ah de same mouth he ah tek an put she ah door. When the blind leadeth the blind.. get out of the way. What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive Life is like a horse race there are winners and losers He That Brings Good News Knocks Hard The best of men are but men at best
