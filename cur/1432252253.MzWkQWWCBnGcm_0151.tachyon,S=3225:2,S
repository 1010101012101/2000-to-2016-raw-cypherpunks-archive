I checked. "The Ungoverned" is in "True Names and Other Dangers." 
However, one should buy either or both of these as they are found.

There's also a very scarce compilation of "The Peace War" and 
"Marooned in Realtime" which is called "Across Realtime." It contains 
"The Ungoverned" in between the two novels. Good luck in finding it, 
though.
