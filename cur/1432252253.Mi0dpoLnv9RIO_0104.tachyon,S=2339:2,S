This is very bad news. A lot of people will loose
their homes to private 'economic developers'. It
certainly means no right to have a permenant home.
When suburbs start developing, the people are going to
be evicted over and over. How long will this continue?
If they cant do any good for individual citizens, how
are they going to do it for the public good?
