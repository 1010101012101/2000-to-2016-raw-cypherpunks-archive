Proxy vote.  I did it for two 'invalid' relatives this year.

Besides, this isn't requiring them to vote.

Not in the first year, no.  And not in the second year, nor in the third.
But in the fourth, you'll see a drastic drop in the number of apathetic
voters -- the ones who don't care.

What this /won't/ have an effect on is mis-informed voting.  People who vote
because they've been paid to do so, or because some other influencing
factor(s) got the voters out there, aside from knowing the candidates and
voting for the one you honestly believe will do the best job.

Australia has mandatory voting.  I think that's what you're arguing against
-- this is essentially a way to say, "I'd rather not vote" by not actually
doing anything.  It's perfect for the already lazy and apathetic folks.  It
forces nobody's hand, places no undue expectations on anyone, and doesn't
bend the rules of democracy.  It simply says that if you don't want to vote,
fine, we just won't include you in the valid voters list.

AFAIK, you can't toss your ballot out in Canada.  And there's a certain way
to mark it to 'abstain' -- not just drawing cartoons on it.
