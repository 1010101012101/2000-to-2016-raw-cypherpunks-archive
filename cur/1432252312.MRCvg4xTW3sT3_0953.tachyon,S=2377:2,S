Assuming you want your own SLD name, yes.  But if you can be satisfied 
with a third-level, there are a lot of domains at freedns.afraid.org 
that will let you tag on a subdomain with just a registration (and you 
can probably supply a @dodgeit.com address).  Then just add a web 
forward pointing to the Tor gateway.
