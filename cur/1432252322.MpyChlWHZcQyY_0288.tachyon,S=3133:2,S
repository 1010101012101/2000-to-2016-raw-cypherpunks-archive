This depends largely on whether your home is equipped with a
camcorder. Assuming it is, here's the instructions:

1. Get a piece of Scotch tape, and your copy of last month's WWF
Pay-Per-View that you foolishly bought. Put the tape over the little notch
on the end of the tape, so you can record over the TLC ("Tables, Ladders,
and Chairs") (oh my!) match.

2. Call up five of your friends (assuming one of your friends is Paul
Anderson and another one is Kurt Russell).

3. Get some guns. These should be easy to acquire. If you already have one
gun, you can use it to acquire more; this, however, is beyond the scope of
these Step By Step (TM) instructions.

4. Go to your local junkyard at night.

5. Have random people start shooting the guns at Kurt, while he mutters
and grunts but doesn't say anything. Have Paul point the camera at random
stuff.

There you go. You've just re-created the bomb "Soldier."

HTH. HAND.
