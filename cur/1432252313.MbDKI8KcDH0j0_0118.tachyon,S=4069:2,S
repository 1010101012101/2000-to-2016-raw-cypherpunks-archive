Yes it is. If you are a US citizen your income can be taxed anywhere in
the world. However, there is a trick here, there is a certain ammount (I
believe it to be around $80k) up to which you're exempt from taxation.

As far as I know, all money made in the US (investments or otherwise)
are taxable as US income. Where the "owner" of the money resides is
irrelevant.

This question has multiple parts. First off, you can't have a green card
and not be a US resident. The requirements for both go hand in hand, if
you stay out of the US long enough to not be taxed, you're also out of
the US long enough to lose your green card. Likewise, if you get US
citizenship, you're subject to being taxed anywhere in the world. (see
the paragraph above)
