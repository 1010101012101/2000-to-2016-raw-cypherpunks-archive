Jeffrey Rosen writes about this in "The Unwanted Gaze."  He recounts
the story of John Wilkes, an MP in the 1760s whose diaries were
seized, and how the law evolved from allowing only the seizure of
contraband, and not papers for use as "mere evidence."  I found it an
entertaining read for $13, and there was useful historical context and 
interesting tidbits.

The trends Tim describes would have been very familiar to the
founders, and have been going on for longer than 20 or 40 years.
