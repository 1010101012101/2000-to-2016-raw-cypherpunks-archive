The world has had well over ten years to adjust to using editors to 
supply sufficient context.

As "demanded" by the negroes and their Jew "speaker-to-negroes" 
handlers.

(A high school teacher of mine pointed out that when someone "demands" 
something, reach for your gun. She left teaching not long after.)

Because the Jews and negroes have demanded that all students be taught 
stuff they obviously will never use. Most innerr city mutants should be 
taught practical skills, not abstract stuff their previous education 
has been bereft of.

I don't give a shit whether they're "fully human" or not. I only care 
that they stop stealing from me, that liberal Jews stop saying that my 
taxes have to be increased to support these "fully human" bags of shit.

Then your education in physics about von Neumann is sorely lacking. Von 
Neumann spend part of several years investigating self-replicating 
machines, using some ideas of Ulam and others. Well-covered in the 
cellular automata literature.

In science fiction, one will find the general assembler literally 
referred to as the von Neumann probe. Cf. 35-year old fiction by 
Saberhagen on "Berserkers," or slightly more recent fiction by Roger 
Macbride Allen and others, for example. Von Neumann machines are more 
than just non-functional bottleneck machines.

As for nanotech, I wasn't endorsing it, just noting the context. My 
skepticism is noted in Crandall's book on nanotech.

Snoop is razzlekamazzled by the negroes, who have the money they stole 
from gullible whites, which is reason enough for niggers, whiggers, and 
chiggers to all be jivin' like daze shit.

No, on both counts. The niggers and whiggers _WON"T_ be with us 
forever, due to GAs, and that _WON"T_ be shame.

Those who steal need killing. Killing the guilty is about to get a lot 
more efficient. Billions in the world need killing, and tens of 
millions in the U.S. are part of this. I use to say, "regrettably, most 
negroes fall into this category." Now, I just laugh at their 
animalistic stupidity. They are like children....stupid children.
