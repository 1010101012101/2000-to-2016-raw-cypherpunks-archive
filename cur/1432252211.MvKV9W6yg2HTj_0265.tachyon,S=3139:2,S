Yes, it would be interesting to hear from all the authors how they
decided to publish the HDCP crack, first at a recent conference, then
to publish on the Web -- as far as I know none besides Scott Crosby,
the principal author, agreed to publish on the Web.

Scott, a student at CMU, first broke HDCP program before Niels 
Ferguson refused to publish his cryptanalysis of HDCP due to
DMCA:

  http://cryptome.org/hdcp-weakness.htm

Scott said at the time of the initial break that he was fearful then 
about being punished under DMCA and even more so now. He 
says he now agrees with Neils to not publish additional cryptanalysis 
under threat of the DMCA.

It is possible that the HDCP owners don't give a damn for the program
was openly published and there's been no public complaint about
Scott's first crack, Neils or the latest. To be sure, that lack of initiative
might be due to fear of cyberterrorism initiated by Richard Clarke
or it may be due to confidence that the FBI will take care of
all the nation's problems in about 150 years.
