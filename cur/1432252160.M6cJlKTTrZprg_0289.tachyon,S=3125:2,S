Ew, ick. 

This seems to be devolving to the level of "Fear and Loathing".

Don't these clowns realize where political assassination goes 
once it gets started?  Do they just not read history books? 

I guess the thing is, there's not only the traditional pitfalls... 
In a world with widespread anonymous communication, there are 
scads of new pitfalls, too.  None of which makes assassination 
look like a good idea.
