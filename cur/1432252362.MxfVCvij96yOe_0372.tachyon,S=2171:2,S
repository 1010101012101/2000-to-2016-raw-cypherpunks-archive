Mine, an Samsung I330 PDA/Phone (actually a rebranded Handspring) allows
you to selectively *disable* non-lea queries.  Based upon this, I do not
believe that the system is broadcast-based, but rather operates solely
upon a query-response model.

Mine does not, but I understand that there are models now coming into the
market which do.
