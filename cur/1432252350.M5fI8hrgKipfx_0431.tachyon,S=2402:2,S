When the strike first happened, my brother, who has cable, heard this
Jaguar stuff on Fox, called me up about it. I told him then that lots
of so-called "encrypted" telephony, like GSM, had big gaping holes,
that something older than that probably didn't have a sufficient
keysize to survive Moore's Law, and that they probably didn't *need*
a back door.

Also, I told him that just listening for enough undecipherable
telephone traffic would give you sufficient impetus for a kinetic
denial of service attack, and that that's what probably happened.

Nothing I've heard since, here or elsewhere, dissuades me of any of
the above.

Cheers,
RAH
