A while back I was reading a training doc for intelligence
analysts that used Iran in one of its examples.  Per this text,
Iran is believed to be working to prevent a U.S. invasion by doing
whatever it can to keep U.S. forces busy elsewhere in its
neighborhood, drawing down U.S. manpower and material resources
and denying the U.S. safe access to staging areas, well controlled
rear areas and flanks, etc.

So... if successful, Iran's nuclear weapons program would render
their present defence strategy obsolete, presumably closing out
their sponsorship of "destabilizing" forces in the region.  If
Iran gets The Bomb, U.S. sponsored "stabilization" elsewhere in
Iran's neighborhood would most likely get a big boost.  It's a
win/win proposition for the U.S. and Iran, unless of course the
U.S. National Interest requires the annexation of Iran - which it
does, as Iran sits right in the middle of the future U.S.
Protectorate of Pipelineistan.

Taking in the larger picture, I would agree with General Turgidson
that we can not allow a mineshaft gap.
