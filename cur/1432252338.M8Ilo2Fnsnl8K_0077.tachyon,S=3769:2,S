 Press Release:
ADC Shocked By Congressman Cooksey's Remarks

Washington, DC, Sept. 19--The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee (ADC) is outraged by the comments made on Monday by
Representative John Cooksey (R-LA) on Louisiana radio stations stating
that someone who comes in thats got a diaper on his head and a fan
belt wrapped around that diaper on his head, that guy needs to be pulled
over.

Representative Cookseys racist remarks are particularly shocking in
light of the ongoing national backlash against Arab Americans as a
result of last weeks terrorist attack in New York and the Washington,
D.C. area.

ADC President Dr. Ziad Asali said, It is totally unacceptable in the
midst of this national crisis that an elected official of the United
States Congress would utter such hateful and irresponsible words.  It is
a disgrace to Congress and to the medical profession.  Dr. Cooksey owes
Arab Americans and indeed the nation an apology.  As a member of
Congress he should realize that honoring constitutionally protected
civil rights is not simply trying to be politically correct as he
stated.

ADC officials have requested a meeting with Representative Cooksey upon
his return to Washington, D.C. this evening.
