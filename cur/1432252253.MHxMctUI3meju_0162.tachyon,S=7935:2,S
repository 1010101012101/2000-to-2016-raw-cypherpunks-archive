This reminds me of another thing that occurred to me, but as I'm no computer 
engineer I can't tell how much of a defense it would be. (At the very least 
a nice stopgap for a while...)

To get around keystroke loggers, it would be nice to have some fom of 
onscreen keyboard, perhaps available over the web. The keyboard would likely 
work only with the mouse (making it slow to use, of course), and each time 
the keyboard appears (and at periodic intervals) the keyboard scrambles its 
keys.


I suspect it would be MUCH harder to figure out what has been typed.
