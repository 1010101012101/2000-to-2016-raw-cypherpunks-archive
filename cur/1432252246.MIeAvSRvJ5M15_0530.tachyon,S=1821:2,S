Response 1:
When the US sneezes, the world catches a cold.

Response 2:
The cpunks list isn't US-centric, but most of the regular posters are in
the US. Even if you don't count Bob Hettinga because he mostly forwards

Durden and me because we're idiots, I think you still have mostly
Americans posting.
