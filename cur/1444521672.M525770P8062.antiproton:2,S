Also, just to be clear, here's how I would have handled this. So I have
these Cryptome archives. And I upload them to the Internet Archive. And
then I notice that [what the fuck!] they include weblogs! And so I
contact the Internet Archive, and make sure that they don't propagate my
upload. Then I remove the weblogs from the Cryptome archives, and upload
them to the Internet Archive. Then I email JYA etc etc etc.

For whatever that's worth ;)
