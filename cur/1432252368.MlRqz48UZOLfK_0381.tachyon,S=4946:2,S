Good points; though to be fair, there is a body of fairly influential literature
out there that does address the problem you're getting at. You might be
interested in a book (available as a free online pdf) called "Countering the
New Terrorism". http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR989/ I read it when it
came out in 1999, probably ought to have another read myself...

Here's a summary:

Traces the recent evolution of international terrorism against civilian and
U.S. military targets, looks ahead to where terrorism is going, and assesses
how it might be contained. The authors consider the threat of information-based
terrorism and of weapons of mass destruction, with an emphasis on how changes
in the sources and nature of terrorism may affect the use of unconventional
terror. The authors propose counterterrorism strategies that address the
growing problem of homeland defense.
