Beginning next year, NRO will be in charge of the new Offensive
Counter-Space program,
which will come up with plans to specifically deny the use of near-Earth
space to other
nations, said Teets.

If allies don't like the new paradigm of space dominance, said Air Force

secretary James Roche, they'll just have to learn to accept it. The
allies, he told the
symposium, will have "no veto power."

"Negation implies treating allies
poorly," Robert Lawson, senior policy
adviser for nonproliferation in the
Canadian Department of Foreign
Affairs, said at a Toronto conference
in late March. "It implies treaty
busting."
