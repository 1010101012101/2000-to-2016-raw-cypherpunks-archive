GSM and GPRS are vulnerable to MitM due to lack of two factor authentication etc. WCDMA (3G) and LTE (4G) should be safe as they have much better security. Not sure about 3GPP2 (CDMA) or WiMAX systems, perhaps early version of CDMA has similar problems as GSM. But saying that '4G' is vulnerable is a pretty broad statement as it consists of at least LTE and WiMAX, and some US operators also refer to their WCDMA HSPA as 4G. There is also a difference between 'the standard has security flaws' and 'the operator has deployed an insecure network' as operators might run their network with security features turned off.

Anyway, the paranoid should turn of GSM and run WCDMA instead.
