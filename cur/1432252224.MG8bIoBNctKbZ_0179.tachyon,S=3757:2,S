  NYT 'SPYING' SPLASH TIED TO BOOK RELEASE
  Fri Dec 16 200 11:27:16 ET

  **Exclusive**

 Newspaper fails to inform readers "news break" is tied to book publication

  On the front page of today's NEW YORK TIMES, national security reporter
 James Risen claims that "months after the September 11 attacks, President
 Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on
 Americans and others inside the United States... without the court approved
 warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government
 officials."

  Risen claims the White House asked the paper not to publish the article,
 saying that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert
 would-be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny.

  Risen claims the TIMES delayed publication of the article for a year to
 conduct additional reporting.

  But now comes word James Risen's article is only one of many "explosive
 newsbreaking" stories that can be found -- in his upcoming book -- which he
 turned in 3 months ago!

  The paper failed to reveal the urgent story was tied to a book release and
 sale.

  "STATE OF WAR: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration"
 is to be published by FREE PRESS in the coming weeks, sources tell the
 DRUDGE REPORT.

  Carisa Hays, VP, Director of Publicity FREE PRESS, confirms the book is
 being published.

  The book editor of Bush critic Richard Clarke [AGAINST ALL ENEMIES] signed
 Risen to FREE PRESS.
