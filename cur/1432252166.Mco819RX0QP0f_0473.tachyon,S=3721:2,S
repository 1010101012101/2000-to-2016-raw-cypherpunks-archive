What would actually happen is that in order to commit an act of suicidal 
terrorism all you'd have to do is stand up and rely on the other passengers to 
shoot up the plane for you. It's a great stratagy, requires almost no effort 
and no weapons. I everyone in the Us had that kind of attitude and a handgun 
how many innocents would hav been killed for looking suspicious so far?
