  So. Same show. Two different headlines.

  Specter: Administration broke law

  WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the
  Senate Judiciary Committee, says President George W. Bush's warrantless
  surveillance program appears to be illegal.

  Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Specter called the administration's
  legal reasoning "strained and unrealistic" and said the program appears to
  be "in flat violation" of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

  Hearings into the surveillance program are scheduled to begin Monday on
  Capitol Hill.

  Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, the former head of the National Security
  Agency, defended the surveillance on ABC's "This Week" and the Fox News
  Network, the International Herald Tribune reported.

  "It's about speed," General Hayden said in his ABC appearance. "It's about
  hot pursuit of al-Qaida communications."

  The Bush administration says the surveillance has been carefully monitored
  and targeted at individuals with known or strongly suspected terrorist
  ties. But officials have also given different estimates of the amount of
  monitoring.
