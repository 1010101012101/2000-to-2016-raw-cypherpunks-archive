Actually, this is not a question for the individual person, rather a
rhetorical question. Did anyone know how much television would change
the radio industry? In fact, for the first several years after its
inception, TV was a money losing business. The question of *how* doesn't
need to be answered now (this is a proverbial "now" which actually means
ever or "for a long time to come.") In fact, we have these problems now
and they don't seem to retard the economy in any way, rare anythings
pose this problem everyday. In fact, relative values pose this "problem"
everyday. Ever hear  "One man's trash is another man's treasure"?

Well, since markets are made up of individual people going about their
business to create the market as a whole, I don't see any problems with
this whatsoever. Joe Musician knows that this is the way music works. In
the olden days, people copied music from one another by word of mouth
over and over, songs were "stolen" by musicians and played for other
audiences. The musical business wasn't the joke that it is today. Back
then, it was accepted that music is sound and sound, well, can be
repeated, if not by a recording on a cassette or cd, then by voice. It
isn't a market problem that some people don't get their way. Nor is it a
good idea to have the government dictate who gets what in a free and
willing exchange scenario. Joe Musician does not have to play his music
or "give it" to anyone (imagine the hoopla when someone records a live
show) he does so willingly and of his own free will. Are we to accept
that because he doesn't feel he gets enough for his music that we should
bank the cost of having it mandated that we pay Joe? If he doesn't get
enough for his music, he is free to NOT release it, DON'T publish the
damn thing and stop bitching. I mock those who present reports showing
that the market didn't correspond to previously created models. Markets
aren't wrong folks, the models are.

| Markets do not handle public goods well. 

Markets are people, people don't handle public goods well. Perhaps
because people as a whole see the inpracticality of restricting access
to goods that are, well, public. Maybe there is a lesson to be learned
there somewhere.

This is interesting. Just about every system in the world has free
riders. This country has "free riders" that are tax-evaders, car
thieves, you name it the standard, society has someone who doesn't abide
by it. That does not in any way make a system "broken." That the system
has flaws is to be expected, unless he who designed the system doesn't
recognize basic human mistakes. Systems with free riders are not
necessarily broken systems, nor are systems without free riders
necessarily working ones.

There is no "content industry" in the tradional market sense. Such an
industry is a fiction created by government exerting control far and
beyond the original intent of government itself. It is proposterous that
because a small group of people cannot get what they want by free
association, they manage to get what they want by manipulating the law
to their benefit. Don't get me wrong, there is a market for content and
music, as long as someone puts a subjective value to a song, there will
be a content market, likewise for weapons and anything the government
deems itself fit to regulate and control, but by and far, that isn't the
"real market" for it does not constitute free association.

The alternative to DRM for whom? The folks who don't like the way things
are now (read: don't make as much money as they feel they should?)
Musicians out there don't have to "release" (the term itself should give
a clue to those who wish to perform the act on what its implications
are) their music. The true alternative to DRM is for people to "wake up
and smell the coffee." I will gladly make a bet on the fact that
government control on any market is not a good thing for the whole of
society. DRM, in a government mandated form will do nothing but remove
freedoms, however basic they may be. If you understand economics, you
will see that the loss of choice is in fact THE outcome that must be
avoided at all costs, not just if at all possible.
