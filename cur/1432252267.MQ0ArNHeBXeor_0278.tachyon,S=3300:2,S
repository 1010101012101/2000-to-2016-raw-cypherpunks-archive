Please list the companies.

What state are you in?  In some states the evil weed is more evil than
others.

If you were squeaky clean since, and your friends were too, you could
work for the NSA, so its funny that you should run into that much

Have you looked into having this removed from your record?
Sometimes judges will do that.

For Jah's sake, tossing a dog into traffic only gets you probation...
