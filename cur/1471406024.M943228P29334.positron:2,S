Then please be persistent in using that terminology (which correctly
names what you intent to be talking about).

That's the kind of assertion, which those who value science, will always
kick back at.

The best "you" (those pushing the anthropogenic climate change
'science' agenda) have is computer "models" - which use as inputs
(demand) in this case assumptions, projections, and a lack of enough
detailed historical facts to otherwise avoid such assumptions and
projections, and so remain as scientific "theory" and not scientific
"facts".

Yes we are impacting the environment (pollution), yes we are pumping
various gases into the atmosphere, no we cannot be certain of
anthropogenic global warming OVER AND ABOVE 'natural' causes (the sun
cycles, natural/ cyclical changes in the earth, more?)

Vehemently claiming "theory" is not theory and is actually "fact" does
not make said theory, facts, and only serves to highlight the
possibility of "agenda". Now, in your case, the agenda may be nothing
more or less benign than an intention to "waking people up out of
ignorance", but is nevertheless, whatever it is, an agenda (thorougly
guilty of such vehemence myself in my younger years - such as at least 4
months ago...).

Don't mix up "reasonable mathematical model giving weight to a
scientific theory", with "scientific fact". Around these parts (you may
have noticed) you'll keep coming unstuck on that one :)
