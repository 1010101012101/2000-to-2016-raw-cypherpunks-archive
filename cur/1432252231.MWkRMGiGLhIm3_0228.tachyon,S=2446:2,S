Of course, that always hasn't worked right in other industries.

The peculiar institution of geographic force monopoly will be an
interesting test case.

One could imagine how it would devolve, starting with licenses, like
say, letters of marque... :-).


Nozick argues force-monopoly naturally emerges from *any* force
market, that, IIRC, associations will collude and eventually merge
under peaceful circumstances, and, of course, if one fights the
other, it takes the other's turf.

Personally, I wonder if that's an artifact of human switched
networks, though, but I'm supposed to say that. :-).

Ayup. See Pierpont Morgan, an old chestnut from my .sig file, below.

Indeed. Ronald Coase is your friend.
