   from the i-feel-safer-already dept.
   crem_d_genes writes "A bill to modify the USA PATRIOT Act that would
   have blocked part of the legislation's provisions that allow for the
   investigation of people's reading habits [1]was defeated by a 210-210
   vote in the U.S House of Representives. The House leaders kept the
   roll call open for 23 minutes past the 15 minute deadline to persuade
   10 Representatives to change votes. According to the article 'Rep.
   Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said he switched his initial "yes" vote to "no"
   after being shown Justice Department documents asserting that
   terrorists have communicated over the Internet via public library
   computers.' On the other hand, 'Critics of the Patriot Act argued that
   even without it, investigators can get book store and other records
   simply by obtaining subpoenas or search warrants.'"
