       Biodiesel is being sold in the US as we speak for anywhere from $.99
to $2.50 a gallon, depending upon whether it's made from waste or virgin
vegetable oil. Given the economies of scale working here, once they build
up a larger presence, those prices will drop. And, if I'm not mistaken,
much of Europe is already mandating that all diesel be sold with at least
20% biodiesel.
        You might also look at Brazil which fuels a large portion of it's
vehicles with ethanol already.
          VW's new fuel will be even cheaper.
