As Spain was for new German weapons prior to WW II, looks like the Afgans 
will be the unwilling beta testers for these new U.S. techno devices.

If recent history is any guide they will mostly fail to live up to the 
public DoD expectations, the truth will be hidden from Congress and the 
media until they have managed to move the short-term memory of the public 
discourse onto the next great, expensive, program they are pitching.  I 
suggest that the program mangers for these weapon systems should be 
required to be combatants using their creations in real fire 
fights.  Darwin will quickly sort out the workable solutions and competent 
program managers.
