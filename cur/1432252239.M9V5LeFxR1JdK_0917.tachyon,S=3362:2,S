Which is why I was careful to say "mechanosynthesis" and even to 
qualify the type of replicator as "Drexler-style."

We've had systems which can replicate in 25 minutes or so for as long 
as we've existed. But making bread is not the same thing as making 
computers, or Boeing 747s, or non-bread kinds of food.

Specialized biologicals making specialized things is probably where 
"nanotechnology" will be a commercial success, but it just ain't real 
nanotech.
