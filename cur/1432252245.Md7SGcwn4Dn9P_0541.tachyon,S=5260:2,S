"And this was a prime target.  Financial disruption from *just* the tower
collapses was significant across the economy as a whole: lost records,
insurance claims, lawsuits, etc., exacted a very substantial loss against
their enemy."

That was nothing compared to the real damage, which I've heard few people 
point out. There was a telecom CO in (I think) #4 World Trade Center, and 
falling debris took the giant Verizon CO across the street on West Street 
offline for almost a week. The result was that Wall Street was basically cut 
off for several days...the effect of that dwarfs all the other stuff. 
(Although I wonder...Pipar Jaffrey was pretty much wiped out. Even if the 
records survived, they lost so much manpower that might have actually had a 
small but worldwide impact.) Of course, I truly doubt OBL & his posse 
realized this when they targeted the WTC (and the fact that they continue to 
pretty much ignore relatively ungarded COs shows they still don't realize 
this). If they took out a few key COs downtown one morning the effect on the 
economy would be significant.
