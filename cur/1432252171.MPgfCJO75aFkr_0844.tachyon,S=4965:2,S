Absolutely.  It's my weak understanding of a beginning physics book.

My book defines "radiance" in terms of the amount of energy radiated
per surface area.  (It likes to use W/cm^2.)  The radiance of the
surface of different materials at various temperatures can be
compared.

The radiance of a cavity to the surface material can be compared and
it is higher.  The radiance of two cavities is the same, but this is
not immediately obvious to the uninitiated.  It's a reasonable thing
to measure and discuss.

If you don't already know, it's actually surprising.

It's not surprising when a hot body and a cold body approach the same
temperature.

But, in the case described the two bodies start out at the same
temperature.  One radiates more energy towards the other one at that
particular temperature.  So, you would expect that one body would
become hotter than the other.

This effect (if it really occurred) could be exploited to make an
engine which would return the two materials back to the same
temperature, but also do some work in the meantime - a perpetual
motion machine.

>From the hints you've dropped I see the general outline of the
solution.  The photons going between the two blocks of metal will
"thermalize" and the volume between the two blocks will look like the
inside of a cavity.  The rate of energy transfer in each direction
will then be the same.

In fact, if the two blocks were contained in a large thermos which
perfectly reflected the photons, the same effect would occur.  It
would be like an inside out cavity.  Each block would end up at the
same temperature.  (Perhaps slightly lower than the start temperature
because it must take some energy to fill the space with thermalized
photons.)
