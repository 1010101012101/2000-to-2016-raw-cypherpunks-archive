Many of the people who "know something about TCPA" are constrained
by NDA's with Intel.  Perhaps that is Eric's problem -- I don't know.

(I have advised Intel about its security and privacy initiatives,
under a modified NDA, for a few years now.  Ross Anderson has also.
Dave Farber has also.  It was a win-win: I could hear about things
early enough to have a shot at convincing Intel to do the right things
according to my principles; they could get criticized privately rather
than publicly, if they actually corrected the criticized problems
before publicly announcing.  They consult me less than they used to,
probably because I told them too many things they didn't want to
hear.)

One of the things I told them years ago was that they should draw
clean lines between things that are designed to protect YOU, the
computer owner, from third parties; versus things that are designed to
protect THIRD PARTIES from you, the computer owner.  This is so
consumers can accept the first category and reject the second, which,
if well-informed, they will do.  If it's all a mishmash, then
consumers will have to reject all of it, and Intel can't even improve
the security of their machines FOR THE OWNER, because of their history
of "security" projects that work against the buyer's interest, such as
the Pentium serial number and HDCP.

TCPA began in that "protect third parties from the owner" category,
and is apparently still there today.  You won't find that out by
reading Intel's modern public literature on TCPA, though; it doesn't
admit to being designed for, or even useful for, DRM.  My guess is
that they took my suggestion as marketing advice rather than as a
design separation issue.  "Pitch all your protect-third-party products
as if they are protect-the-owner products" was the opposite of what I
suggested, but it's the course they (and the rest of the DRM industry)
are on.  E.g. see the July 2002 TCPA faq at:

  http://www.trustedcomputing.org/docs/TPM_QA_071802.pdf

  3. Is the real "goal" of TCPA to design a TPM to act as a DRM or
     Content Protection device? 
  No.  The TCPA wants to increase the trust ... [blah blah blah]

I believe that "No" is a direct lie.  Intel has removed the first
public version 0.90 of the TCPA spec from their web site, but I have
copies, and many of the examples in the mention DRM, e.g.:

  http://www.trustedcomputing.org/docs/TCPA_first_WP.pdf  (still there)

This TCPA white paper says that the goal is "ubiquity".  Another way to
say that is monopoly.  The idea is to force any other choices out of
the market, except the ones that the movie & record companies want.
The first "scenario" (PDF page 7) states: "For example, before making
content available to a subscriber, it is likely that a service
provider will need to know that the remote platform is trustworthy."
  
  http://www.trustedpc.org/home/pdf/spec0818.pdf     (gone now)

Even this 200-page TCPA-0.90 specification, which is carefully written
to be obfuscatory and misleading, leaks such gems as: "These features
encourage third parties to grant access to by the platform to
information that would otherwise be denied to the platform" (page 14).
"The 'protected store' feature...can hold and manipulate confidential
data, and will allow the release or use of that data only in the
presence of a particular combination of access rghts and software
environment.  ... Applications that might benefit include ... delivery
of digital content (such as movies and songs)."  (page 15).

Of course, they can't help writing in the DRM mindset regardless of
their intent to confuse us.  In that July 2002 FAQ again:

  9. Does TCPA certify applications and OS's that utilize TPMs? 
  
  No.  The TCPA has no plans to create a "certifying authority" to
  certify OS's or applications as "trusted".  The trust model the TCPA
  promotes for the PC is: 1) the owner runs whatever OS or
  applications they want; 2) The TPM assures reliable reporting of the
  state of the platform; and 3) the two parties engaged in the
  transaction determine if the other platform is trusted for the
  intended transaction.

"The transaction"?  What transaction?  They were talking about the
owner getting reliable reporting on the security of their applications
and OS's and -- uh -- oh yeah, buying music or video over the Internet.

Part of their misleading technique has apparently been to present no
clear layman's explanations of the actual workings of the technology.
There's a huge gap between the appealing marketing sound bites -- or
FAQ lies -- and the deliberately dry and uneducational 400-page
technical specs.  My own judgement is that this is probably
deliberate, since if the public had an accurate 20-page document that
explained how this stuff works and what it is good for, they would
reject the tech instantly.

Perhaps we in the community should write such a document.  Lucky and
Adam Back seem to be working towards it.  The similar document about
key-escrow (that CDT published after assembling a panel of experts
including me, Whit, and Matt Blaze) was quite useful in explaining to
lay people and Congressmen what was wrong with it.  NSA/DoJ had
trouble countering it, since it was based on the published facts, and
they couldn't impugn the credentials of the authors, nor the
document's internal reasoning.

Intel and Microsoft and anonymous chauvanists can and should criticize
such a document if we write one.  That will strengthen it by
eliminating any faulty reasoning or errors of public facts.  But they
had better bring forth new exculpating facts if they expect the
authors to change their conclusions.  They're free to allege that "No
current Microsoft products have Document Revocation Lists", but that
doesn't undermine the conclusion that their architectures make it easy
to secretly implement that feature, anytime they want to.
