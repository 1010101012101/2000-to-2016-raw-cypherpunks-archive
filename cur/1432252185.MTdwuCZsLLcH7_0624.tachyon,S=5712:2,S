ORBS/MAPS/etc. "participate" by connecting to and reviewing sites,
much like I go out to and watch movies to review.

As usual, Choate fails to grasp the point. I am not saying anyone
has a duty to "help them." 

In fact, as I said in an earlier post, I'm not sure I even agree with
what they're doing. But I do believe they have a right to publish
their reviews of mail relays, just as I have the right to publish
movie reviews -- even if you disagree with what I say in them.

To tell them not to speak their mind about you is censorship no less
than if you attempt to force me not to speak my mind about that
rather awful Operation: Swordfish movie.
