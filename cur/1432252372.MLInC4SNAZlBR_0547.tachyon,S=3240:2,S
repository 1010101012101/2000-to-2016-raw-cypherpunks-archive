These auto-rants were copied to many newsgroups about a month or so ago.

I doubt they are any kind of stego communication. For one thing, by 
being so obvious, they are not actually stego. Might was well just post 
pure crypto text. For another, the tight clustering in time suggests 
just a scattershot attempt to have some newsgroup fun.

The inclusion of words like "SSL and "Blowfish" suggests to me that 
someone just inserted these into the particular Markov rant generator. I 
don't know which particular rant generator was used,  however.
