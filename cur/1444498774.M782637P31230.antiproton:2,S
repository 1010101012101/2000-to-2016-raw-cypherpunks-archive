Just had it pointed out to me "luser" was just internet slang, and not reall=
y an insult. Sorry I got a little defensive after that. =20

For me, "national security" is anything a nation needs to prosper and surviv=
e, including national medical care, education, ensuring a healthy job market=
 and that there's infrastructure for everyone to get food, water, informatio=
n, and from place to place. A lot of my emphasis is on the intelligence aspe=
cts of national security, because I started off and got hooked on the subjec=
t while reading military history and ex-spook/spy memoirs. I'm fascinated by=
 the economic side of things and think it's under represented, and we need m=
ore/better education (at least in the U.S.) that's gauged to a realistic job=
 market and caters to the individual's actual capabilities. I generally don'=
t talk about that part because I only understand it in the broadest terms, a=
nd the best I can do is try to listen to the experts in that field and peopl=
e who are smarter than me. And then there's separating policy from politics.=
..

I hope that helps clarify some. Sorry again for assuming that your question w=
as insincere/attacking.=20
