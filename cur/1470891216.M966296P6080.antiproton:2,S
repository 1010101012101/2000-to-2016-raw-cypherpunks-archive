Mirimir, I thought you were quite clear where you added "whatever" in
your "transgender whatever" phrase ... as in "transgender, queer, bi,
blah blah blah whatever...".

At least that's how I read it, and as you point out - an observation,
with no judgement or bigotry that I could discern.

Everyone on the same page, just a dropped checksum I think...

Now frankly Mirimir, even if you had expressed a personal sexual
preference (for say, some personal definition of conservatism or
whatever), that too MUST be entirely acceptable.

Just to be clear.
