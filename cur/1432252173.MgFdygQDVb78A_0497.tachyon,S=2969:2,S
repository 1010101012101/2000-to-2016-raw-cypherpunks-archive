Moon Jones sees no added value as he subscribes to the very same
lists as me. (There is added value for less omniscient/omnipresent, 
though in order to see it you have to see it from my point of view, 
and it's not super-big -- I'm mostly a Layer 8 router).

I presume filtering for duplicates is easier if I do bounces,
so I'll do more of that in future.

The relevance is in the followup threads others generate.
