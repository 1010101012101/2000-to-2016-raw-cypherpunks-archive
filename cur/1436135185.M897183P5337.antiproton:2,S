Cancer LOL. Lymphona LOL Brain tumors LOL. Leukemia ROFL. Cell phones are  
so safe, the 500 Billion dollar a year industry needed to obtain special  
legal protection absolving them of any liability in a 1998 U.S.  
Telecommunications bill rider.

Companies need special legislation drafted and passed that absolves them  
of all legal liability **only** when the products they are selling  
completely safe and harmless, everybody got that? Just like the vaccine  
industry was granted immunity from legal liability in the United States in  
1986. Because their products are so safe.

Those of you that are interested in a fact based breakdown on the risk of  
RF exposure from evil-genius meters should watch this 2010 presentation to  
the San Francisco Tesla Society by consulting engineer Rob States:

If there's any silver lining to the deadly health impacts of these devices  
it's the golden opportunity dropped into the lap of privacy and freedom  
loving people to leverage opposition to health threat to simultaneously  
drive out the privacy and data-enslavement threats.
