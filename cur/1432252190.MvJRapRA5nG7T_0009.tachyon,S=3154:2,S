Dual Counter was a serious crypto product that was broken and failed.

But Skipjack was apparently strong enough, within the limits of 80-bit keys,
and while the academic whitewash team didn't have time for more than a
cursory examination, that wasn't the real problem with the system.
After all, it came with a guaranteed wiretap capability,
was a clear political scam, and rapidly acquired public hatred and ridicule,
plus the only advantage it had was being stronger than 1-DES,
which was in practice strong enough for almost all non-money-transfer apps.
The whole system reeked badly, but the Skipjack part was the strongest link.
