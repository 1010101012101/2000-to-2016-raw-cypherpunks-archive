when i read what he wrote, in the context of how i expect this system
is built, it is to me a violation of the implied assumptions in crypto
that he is discussing.

assumptions like "SSL private keys are kept on the servers, not
provided to third parties" ... for national security reasons.

assumptions like "i'm using ZRTP, my call is end-to-end secure!" (why
the !^@# is ZRTP termination the usual mode in VoIP server
implementations? E.g. wiretap mode. Oh, nevermind...)

the list goes on.

you'll notice that all of the targets mentioned above have a public
key exchange mechanism where by session secrets can be exchanged in
presumed privacy - unless forward secrecy is used. we've seen how the
"latency" added for forward secrecy provides fig leaf coverage for
real reason.  keep-alive don't care about your start-up latency!

in short: #1 with the private keys handed over or pilfered, to support
DPI-SSL, is reasonable, effective, and fits within the parameters of
what we've discovered. it could be part of the certificate renewal
process, an infrequent one-off.

#2 is not done, since this would be logistically ugly - every web
server somehow feeding back ephemeral keys or session secrets to the
spooks.  not going to happen.

#2 does raise an interesting proposition - if forward secrecy becomes
common this collection mechanism is crippled.  watch for push back
against wide deployment of PFS suites on large web properties.
(spoiler alert: i'll bet you money this won't happen, for all sorts of
stated reasons except the real one.)

the live dip is PRISM, the passive snarf is UPSTREAM, of which BULLRUN
is a part?
remember, "You should use both."
