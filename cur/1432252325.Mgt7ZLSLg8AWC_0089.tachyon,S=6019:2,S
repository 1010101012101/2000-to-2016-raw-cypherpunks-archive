IANAL, but the use of a semi-colon rather than a comma would seem to =
suggest that the except for treason, felony, etc. doesn=92t apply to the =
speech or debate clause, so all matters of speech or debate can only be =
tried by that house (although what court-like powers the house would =
have would be an interesting legal problem - I=92d say that the framers =
intended it to be reasonably extensive, since that was (and is) the case =
in Britain, but one could also argue that it only applies to enforcing =
the standing orders as written).

Gravell suggests that publishing an excerpt from the official records =
isn=92t protected by the speech or debate clause, so although reading =
documents into the public record would be useful (since it would give us =
all legitimate access), it wouldn=92t help subsequent publishers.
