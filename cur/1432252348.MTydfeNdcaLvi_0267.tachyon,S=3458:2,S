Slightly condensed to savor Gregory S. Smith's terroristic threats:

It recently has come to Blackboard's attention that Billy Hoffman and
Virgil Griffith are intending to speak as co-panelists in
your upcoming InterzOne II conference on April 11, 2003. The website
located at www.yak.net/acidus, Mr. Hoffman's
website, states that ..... "This will show not only did we hack the
system, but we hacked it so
far we could build functional readers from scratch."

    Please be advised that the actions described on Mr. Hoffman's
website, including the hacking of Blackboard's system, are
illegal, and that any effort by either Mr. Hoffman or Mr. Griffith to
convey to others at your Conference any information gleaned
in whole or in part from such actions, particularly in an effort to
cause Blackboard economic harm, would be improper. Please
be advised of our view that it would be actionable for you or your
conference to facilitate Mr. Hoffman's and Mr. Griffith's
announced plans for, among other things, the disclosure of signals
captured, the releasing of code, the description of
development of functional readers, and the hardware specs to wire the
readers and/or control circuits.

....
We are also examining whether
the actions of Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Griffin may have violated other
federal laws, including (among others) the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act, the Economic Espionage Act, the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, the Wiretap Act, and the
Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as Georgia's Computer Systems
Protection Act.

Blackboard is filing a motion for preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief against Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Griffith, to prevent
the anticipated actions their website has announced. Blackboard is
actively seeking a temporary restraining order and other
injunctive relief in this matter. Failure to comply with these requests
may expose you or your organization to an action for
injunctive relief or monetary damages, and any other relief permitted
under state and federal law, including court costs and
attorneys' fees. You may also wish to consider and examine the potential
criminal consequences, under theories of aiding and
abetting and conspiracy, if you facilitate Mr. Hoffman's and Mr.
Griffith's efforts despite their known and admitted hacking.
