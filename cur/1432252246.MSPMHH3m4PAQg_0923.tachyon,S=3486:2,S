Subject: [liberationtech] Finnish police stepping up internet monitoring
	after Norway attacks

Dear colleagues,

This was on Finnish TV last night:

"Police stepping up internet monitoring after Norway attacks"
http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2011/07/police_stepping_up_internet_monitoring_after_norway_attacks_2746316.html

And that got me wondering. Has anyone seen any examples of other
countries (especially in Europe) talking about or actually doing this
in the wake of the Oslo attack? Trying to see if there's a story here.

Best,

-C
