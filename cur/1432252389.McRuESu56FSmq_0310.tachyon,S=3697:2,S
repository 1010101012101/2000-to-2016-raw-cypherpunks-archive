Oh really?  Try that experiment on your own car.  Side windows shatter into
a thousand pieces at the touch of a center punch.  A fire extinguisher is
decidedly overkill for the job.

In any event, the test--at least in the US--for the use of deadly force
includes the concepts of reasonable fear of death OR GREAT BODILY INJURY.
Believe it or not, being blinded by a swarm of glass shards is considered
great bodily injury.

Please, Jimbo, take the LSAT so we can see how much smarter you are than
your posts otherwise indicate.

P.S.  Any Austin Cypherpunks have a fire extinguisher and know where
Inchoate parks his car?
