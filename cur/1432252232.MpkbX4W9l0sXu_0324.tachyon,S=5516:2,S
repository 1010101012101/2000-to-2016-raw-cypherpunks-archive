The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|| Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi||ion barrels of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you wi|| sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wi|| real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
