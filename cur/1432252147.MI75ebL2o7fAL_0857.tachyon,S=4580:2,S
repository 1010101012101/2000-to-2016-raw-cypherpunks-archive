My current new toy is a CerfCube.

(http://www.intrinsyc.com/products/referencedesigns/cerfcube.html)

The specs say max 1A @ 5VDC.  I know that running a Compact 
Flash card makes it draw toward the upper limit, but the built in 
32MB RAM + 16MB Flash should be enough to run a remailer.  
Maybe not quite disposable at $379, but it would be interesting to 
see what I can do in that area.  With an adapter, I can run a 802.11 
card from the CF socket, I think.  (drivers might be tricky)

Having fallen a little out of touch, what are the popular remailers in 
use?  Can't seem to find my Mixmaster link anymore.

That sounds like the CerfCube (maybe without the stylish Al cube 
case).

Hmmm.... maybe an inductive parasite power tap?
