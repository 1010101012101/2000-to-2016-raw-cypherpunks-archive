It's amusing to watch issues brought up on Cypherpunks 8 or 9 years 
ago surfacing in recent weeks. Morphed images, stego for dead drops, 
cyber-stalking, etc.

Reminds me of the opening months of the first Clinton term, when 
"trial balloons" to ban crypto were being floated by Administration 
lackeys masquerading as disinterested parties. The CIA Director is 
out there scaring the congresscritters, giving them the public scare 
story and, presumably, the "if you only knew what we know" secret 
briefing which is designed to turn even the staunchest free speechers 
into quivering police state apologists.

Somewhere this coming spring they probably need another Reichstag 
fire, though. A Sarin attack, or some really juicy cyber-snuff MPEGs 
cooked up by the spooks.

Journalistic sniffing around is increasing. I've had three calls for 
interviews in recent weeks. One I did, but the focus unfortunately 
shifted to the sensational and I expect the final result to be 
uninteresting. Another I declined, citing overexposure of these tired 
old issues. The third I mostly deflected, saying I'm not the best 
person to talk to. Whew.
