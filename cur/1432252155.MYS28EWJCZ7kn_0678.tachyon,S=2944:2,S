If you think you *are* being followed in a car, I'd suggest
you read Tomlinson's _The Big Breach_ (available online) 
or at least those sections on surveillance and counter surveillance.

Four left or right turns in succession should lose anyone,
and sudden reversals of signalled intent (signal right, go left)
can be useful, according to Mr. T.
