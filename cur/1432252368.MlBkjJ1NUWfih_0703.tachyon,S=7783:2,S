Nobody is saying that free expression includes inciting a riot or 
soliciting murder. But it does generally include the right to write a book 
(and read it) without being targeted by the government. What you wrote that 
raised eyebrows was this:

>I sure hope that the government is investigating and following each and every
>person who buys a copy of this book... I wonder if there's a way to force
>Tobiason to foot the bill for that security?

There are plenty of books I can think of -- almost all of the Loompanics 
catalog -- that would fret some government official. David Burnham's books 
on the IRS and DOJ abuses of power are another. But I hardly think it's 
consistent with the First Amendment to investigate the people who buy them, 
or make the authors pay "protection money" for the privilege of publishing.

Then you wrote in the message below:
>How many sets of these "terrorism cookbooks" do you let fall
>into the hands of psychotics?  We already don't sell guns to convicted 
>felons...
>  gee, that sounds to me like "prior restraint"... or do you think THAT's

My translation of that is "we must require background checks on people who 
buy books, newspapers, or magazines" that some FBI officials dislike. (I 
look forward to seeing how you'll extend this to the Internet. AdultCheck, 
anyone? How about posts on the cypherpunks list or other fora that include 
more scientific or technical information than you feel comfortable with?) 
My translation of your last sentence is "we must criminalize the 
publication of certain technical or scientific information just because 
some bad people may get their hands on it." Comparing background checks for 
gun purchasers (in an approving way) to background checks to books is just 
nutty.

Now do you see why your post is so at odds with the principles of a free 
society? If not, I'm not sure you're educable on this issue.
