Using masks with HEPA filters will keep the bulk of anthrax spores out 
of your airway. Probably below the 4,000-12,000 reputedly needed for 
infection, Lot better than nothing, and buys you some options.

If you have newer model vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter you could 
positively pressurize a reasonably well sealed room with filtered 
outside air for a while, or fabricate a dust hood/mask, with some poly 
and good old duct tape.

Still don't feel the need.
