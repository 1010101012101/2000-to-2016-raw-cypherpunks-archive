I designed something along these lines some years ago as a way of building a
fault-tolerant key management system.  The idea is that you create a pile of
keys, and these vote on key updates.  If a key is compromised, you sign its
replacement with a quorum of non-compromised keys, and replace the bad key.
You also periodically roll over keys as a preventive measure, limiting
exposure due to compromises.  No need for a PKI or anything else complex like
that, it's all automatic and transparent.

There can be slight problems if a device stays offline long enough that enough
keys have been rolled over to make reaching a quorum impossible, which was an
issue when I designed the thing but rather unlikely now.  I can dig up the
exact details in case anyone's interested.

Peter.
