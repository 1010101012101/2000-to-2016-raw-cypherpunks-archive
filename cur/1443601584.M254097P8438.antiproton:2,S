Since you're in contact with the webadmins already, submit the absolute refs as bugs, suggedt making them relative so the onion site loads them correctly.

Which is ok but some of the objects loaded by the onion come from freedom.press and not the onion.<br />
<br />
We have become so used to free or cheap web services that we now allow third parties to view or intercept our traffic as an acceptable business practice.<br />
<br />
Hosting providers, CDN, Web App Firewalls - all of them can see what you&#39;re doing and the bigger ones can collate all that and form a better picture of you.<br />

Better hope they&#39;re all really nice, trustworthy people :D<br /><br /><div class="gmail_quote">On 30 September 2015 08:45:53 BST, coderman &lt;coderman@gmail.com&gt; wrote:<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">
