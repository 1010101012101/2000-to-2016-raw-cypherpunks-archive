That's pretty much what I understood you to say. The problem is that
somewhere in the bookdealers' and jobbers' archives, the sales record
will have to be accessible by title and by customer or customer
category. In the case of a cash sale, of course, there's no problem, but
if a credit card was involved the dealer has to be able to retrieve the
record by name in case there's a chargeback or complaint. So the
vulnerability to a police razzia still exists.
