Spoofed source-addresses can be (and often are) blocked at the
access ISP. RFC 2267, Ingress filtering.

DDOS trojans on ISDN/xDSL/Cable home user boxes will have to use
their real (or at least same subnet) source addresses on datagrams,
or run the risk of having the traffic dropped silently at the first
router.


There is also work being done on tagging and tracing datagrams.

This won't stop DDOS attacks, but it will make it a lot harder to
mount an attack without exposing many of the DDOS trojans
participating.
