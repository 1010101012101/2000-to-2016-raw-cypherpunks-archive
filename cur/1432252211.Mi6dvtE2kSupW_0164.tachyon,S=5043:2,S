Listen carefully. I will say this only once.  All you say is true.
Moderated and closed lists are good ideas. Such good ideas that nearly
every mailing list in the world is closed and moderated. But maybe, just
maybe, there is some reason for an open, unmoderated list. Just one in
the whole world. Or maybe there are some loonies who for motives of
their own (that you might or might not approve of, as if they cared),
wish to read such a list.  This is that list. These are those loonies.
If you don't like it, or them,  you can join another list. No-ones
stopping you. You can even make your own list if you want. 

It's like someone visits a farm and complains that the place is full of
animals... or a farmer visits the city and moans about all those
houses...

Another good suggestion. So good I think someone made it back in about
1995 (or was it 1997?). Feel free to create such a list yourself, if you
want another one.
