                              CALL FOR PAPERS

              WORKSHOP ON PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES 2002

                             Apr 14-15, 2002
                         San Francisco, CA, USA

                Workshop web site: http://www.pet2002.org/


Privacy and anonymity are increasingly important in the online world.
Corporations and governments are starting to realize their power to
track users and their behavior, and restrict the ability to publish
or retrieve documents. Approaches to protecting individuals, groups,
and even companies and governments from such profiling and censorship
have included decentralization, encryption, and distributed trust.

Building on the success of the first anonymity and unobservability
workshop (LNCS 2009, held in Berkeley in July 2000), this second workshop
addresses the design and realization of such anonymity and anti-censorship
services for the Internet and other communication networks. We are holding
this workshop adjacent to the Twelfth Conference on Computers, Freedom,
and Privacy (CFP2002) for convenience, but we are not affiliated with
that conference.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of privacy
technologies, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems.
We encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business
that present these communities' perspectives on technological issues. We
will publish accepted papers in proceedings in the Springer Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:

* Efficient realization of privacy services
* Techniques for and against traffic analysis
* Attacks on anonymity systems
* New concepts for anonymity systems
* Novel relations of payment mechanisms and anonymity
* Models for anonymity and unobservability
* Models for threats to privacy
* Techniques for censorship resistance
* Resource management in anonymous systems
* Pseudonyms, linkability, and trust
* Policy and human rights -- anonymous systems in practice
* Fielded systems and privacy enhancement techniques for existing systems
* Frameworks for new systems developers


                           IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline                                 December 10, 2001

Adam Shostack, Zero Knowledge Systems (adam@zeroknowledge.com)

                          PROGRAM COMMITTEE

John Borking, Dutch Data Protection Authority
Lance Cottrell, Anonymizer.com
Roger Dingledine, Reputation Technologies (co-chair, arma@mit.edu)
Hannes Federrath, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany
Markus Jakobsson, RSA Laboratories
Marit Koehntopp, Independent Centre for Privacy Protection, SH, Germany

Michael Waidner, IBM Zurich Research Lab

                          PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal
or a conference with proceedings.  Papers should be at most 15
pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using
11-point font and reasonable margins), and at most 20 pages total.
Authors are encouraged to follow Springer LNCS format in preparing their
submissions. <http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html> Committee
members are not required to read the appendices and the paper should
be intelligible without them.  The paper should start with the title,
names of authors and an abstract.  The introduction should give some
background and summarize the contributions of the paper at a level
appropriate for a non-specialist reader.  We will publish accepted
papers in proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series after the workshop.  During the workshop preproceedings
will be made available.  Final versions are not due until after the
workshop, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their papers
based on discussions during the meeting.

Submissions can be made in Postscript or PDF format.  To submit a paper,
send a plain ASCII text email to the program chairs (emails: arma@mit.edu,
syverson@itd.nrl.navy.mil) containing the title and abstract of the
paper, the authors' names, email and postal addresses, phone and fax
numbers, and identification of the contact author.  To the same message,
attach your submission (as a MIME attachment). Papers must be received by
December 10, 2001.  Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent
to authors no later than February 11, 2002, and authors will have the
opportunity to revise for the preproceedings version by March 11, 2002.
Submission implies that, if accepted, the author(s) agree to publish
in the proceedings and to sign a standard Springer copyright release,
and also that an author of the paper will present it at the workshop.
Final versions (due after the workshop) need to comply with the
instructions for authors made available by Springer.
