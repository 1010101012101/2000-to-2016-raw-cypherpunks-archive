Apparently they work on the principle that if decisions are made using a lo=
t of input (many members of the public). =C2=A0 The PAM (Policy Analysis Ma=
rket =C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Analysis_Market =C2=A0) pro=

If that was indeed what a crowdsourced prediction market was attempting to =
do, it would fail. =C2=A0But that is not the case. =C2=A0

Since augur mentions "market", likely the lovely NSA can put a lot of
bots on it, possibly just burning inflated virtual money.
I'm not sure I understand what may be your objection, but my understanding =
is that the Ethereum system is intended to be supported by means of some mi=
cropayment system, called 'ether'. =C2=A0. =C2=A0A DOS (denial of service) =

Presumably Augur will be doing that, too. =C2=A0Naturally, I can think of b=
etter things for a prediction market to be doing!!!=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
