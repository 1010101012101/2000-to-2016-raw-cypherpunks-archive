Where is that boundary condition in the amendment? Saying "felons may not
own firearms" is certainly an infringment. Rights don't come from the
state after all (see 1st two para's of the DoI).

                                Amendment II

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
