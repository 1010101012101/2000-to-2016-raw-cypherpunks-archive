I have to day that I strongly disagree with the above.  There are 
several current offline ecash systems which do not require expensive
(or even require at all) systems on checking double spent value.

Specifically I am referring to Mondex.  While there are several 
disadvantages to Mondex, and the fact that it is not truly anonymous,
it does currently allow secure offline transactions.
