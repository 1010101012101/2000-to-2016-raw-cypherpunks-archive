This just in from CNN:

 [FBI agents have arrested a North Carolina man on suspicion of soliciting 
  offers over the Internet to kill Michael Schiavo and Judge Greer. 
  Richard Alan Meywes of Fairview is accused of offering $250,000 for the 
  killing of Schiavo and another $50,000 for the "the elimination of the 
  judge who ruled against Terri."]
   
Given that the real problem in this case is one stubborn judge, and all 
the other judges sticking with him, I'm not really sure the bounty 
allocation cited is the best possible one.

Michael Schiavo doesn't, by himself, have the power to completely thwart 
the wishes of the President of the United States, the Governor of the 
State of Florida, and an overwhelming majority of both houses of Congress.

He is an insignificant pipsqueak, and were he not being backed by the 
judiciary, the more equal of the three equal branches of government, he 
would have been marginalized and ignored years ago.

I wonder how much it is going to cost the taxpayers for the round the 
clock army this judge is going to need to protect his sorry life for the 
remainder of it.
