Do you mean the terrorists who raised their funding in
bars in Boston and San Francisco?  They haven't been
doing much active terror lately, though they still
try to raise funds in the bars on Geary Street.

The Bush Administration says that they'll go bomb any country
that harbors anti-US terrorists, but if the UK felt the
same way and bombed Boston I bet they'd be a bit upset.
(Bombing San Francisco wouldn't bother the Bush League as much.)
