Insurance rates are established according to many criteria. In many 
cases, higher-risk customers are sold insurance, but at higher rates. 
In some cases, they are denied insurance. (As when the costs are 
open-ended...)

In any case, whether Alice sells insurance to Bob is not a matter for 
the state to interfere with.

You, Nathan, may set up your own insurance company if you wish. Or 
you may offer to pay for the health care of those you think are not 
getting a fair deal.

But you may NOT tell me I must sell insurance if I choose not to.
