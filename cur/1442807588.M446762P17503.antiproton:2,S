Does it not strike you as odd that whenever their is a protest in favor 
of US domination and the overthrow of a supposedly oppressive regimes, 
the protestors are generally carrying signs in English?

Is it not strange that the website of the movement that overthrew the 
Ukrainian government was written in English in the dialect of the 
Harvard educated American upper class?

At least those supposedly persecuted by McCarthy took the trouble to 
translate (badly) their Soviet written slogans.
