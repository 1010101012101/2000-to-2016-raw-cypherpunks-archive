There's a _lot_ of work being done in this area. Some key words:

computational economics, multi-agent systems, Swarm, evolutionary 
game theory, etc.


It may be true that these are not the simple, econometric models 
which textbooks present with nice, neat graphs showing supply and 
demand and computing elasticity, but this is hardly surprising.

In any case, the theory of free markets is a lot more than about 
proving theorems in continuous, steady-state models.

Saying that there is a "free market theory" is itself pretty 
misleading. There are economic models, there are viewpoints about the 
role of regulation and the advantages of non-interventionist 
policies, and so on.

Those who believe that nominally free markets have certain practical 
and ideological benefits (vis-a-vis price discovery, signalling 
mechanisms, risk/reward, etc.) may adopt the short-hand of saying 
they are "free market theory" advocates. This doesn't mean there is 
some "theory of free markets" which is distinct from economics in 
general.

In a nutshell, treat economic theory as just a common language for 
certain types of analysis. "Elasticity" has its place, but it is only 
a part of the bigger picture. Folks like Hayek and von Mises, and 
entrepreneurs taking advantage of free markets, don't need to solve 
differential equations!

A Korean stall vendor deciding to offer pomegranates for sale doesn't 
need a "theory" of mathematical economics to practice free market 
strategies.
