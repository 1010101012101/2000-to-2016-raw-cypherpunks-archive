This is what Ubuntu does, and I was under the impression that they
learned it from their Debian experiences with the same process.

Also I'm not entirely sure what you meant by "a CA-like model" but if
you're only talking about identity verification, you're missing a few
things.  Most important is keeping the real secrets in a master key that
can authorise or revoke functional signing keys as needed.  There are
other steps that the security experts all worked out when they first
realised that crypto wasn't magic and needed human processes to keep it
relevant.  It's all In The Literature.

I'm not sure how you audit something that's meant to happen in a sealed
bunker with a select few trusted shardholders.
