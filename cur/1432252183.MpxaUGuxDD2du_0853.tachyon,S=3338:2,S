Nice misdirection, but:

Those are both terms of art in 50 USC. They're not "US Persons".

Note the phrase "Congressional Authorization".

And, even if Clinton suggested the law could be broken or broke it,
that does not mean that Bush has not broken the law.

Again and again, Bob seems to be forwarding us chaff -- the smoke
thrown up by the President's spin doctors who do not want you paying
attention to the fact that the President broke a criminal law. Do not
be deceived. Do not be misdirected. Keep your eye on what matters, and
not on what the magicians want you to watch.

Most importantly, call your senators and congressional representative
NOW.
