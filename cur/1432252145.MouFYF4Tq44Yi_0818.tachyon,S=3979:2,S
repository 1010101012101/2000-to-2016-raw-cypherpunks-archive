We are not a democracy, but a repubic (pun intended). The primary responsibility of our elected officials is to protect the minorities from the majority and to preserve protect and defend the constitution.  Many representatives clearly show they have at best a poor understanding of the Constitution, the words and intentions of the framers.  Some even show disdain for it.  How many Congressmen do you think ever read Thomas Paine's works?

>You are welcome to "refuse to give up on our way of life." Many others over the centuries have similarly refused to give up on royalism...I hear there are even clubs where people pretend to be various archdukes and viscounts, and even fan clubs for the grandchildren of royals deposed 75 years ago.

>Maybe there will be fan clubs for "democracy supporters." Maybe they will even launch little wars agains the royalists.

I hope representative government is not.
