It was a combo bill - the Spammers have to restrict themselves to
Opt-In, but the Governments get to demand ISPs keep records of who does
what where on demand. Of course, none of this has legal force until
ratified in the countries own legislation - anyone want to guess how
many countries rush in the ISP record bits, and conveniently forget the
spam bits?
