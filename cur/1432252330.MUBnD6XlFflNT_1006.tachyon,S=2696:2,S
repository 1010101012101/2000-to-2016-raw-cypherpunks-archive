While I'm not aware of many companies doing anything about it,
it's not really that tough - all of the algorithms had
relatively similar parameters and sizes and calling requirements, 
and they were required to provide reference editions.
So you should be able to write a couple of routines like
	aes_keyschedule(parm1, parm2...)
	aes_encrypt(*key, data)
	aes_decrypt(*key, data)
and plug in the reference editions with some format-munger glue.
Tuning the algorithms for your hardware and software environment 
is more work, and maybe you want to wait till there's a winner,
but you get to claim you were way ahead of the curve by
announcing support the day of the announcement...


				Thanks!
