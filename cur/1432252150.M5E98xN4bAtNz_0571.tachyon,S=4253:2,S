What do you mean? By a physical fiber switch? That's certainly possible, 
though you'd need a very good condition switch to be able to do it. I'd bet 
if that switch switched a lot, the QCrypto channel would eventually be 
unusable.

If you're talking about a WDM element or passive splitter or other purely 
optical component, then you'd need some kind of error correction (in the 
digital domain) in order to overcome the fact that many of the photons will 
not choose to go in the direction you want.

In the long run I think we'll see some small proliferation, but given the 
level of integration and how well current coding schemes work, I'd guess 
this will remain a niche unless there's a major breakthrough in factoring.
