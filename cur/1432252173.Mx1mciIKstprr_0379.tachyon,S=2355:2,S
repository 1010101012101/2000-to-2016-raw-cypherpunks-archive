Every once in a while even cpunks need a little respite from ranting,
and some refreshing topic which hasn't been beaten to a painful
ad-hominem-death a thousand times already... so here's the topic.

What methods are there for doing non-verbal, cross-cultural IQ tests?
Some obvious things come to mind, like geomtric analogy questions, but
that would seem to favor people who have strong spatial or visual
reasoning, which is only one aspect of overall intelligence.  Any
other options?
