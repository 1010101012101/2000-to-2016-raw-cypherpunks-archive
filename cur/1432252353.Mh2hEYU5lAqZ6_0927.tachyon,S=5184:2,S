Near top-CNN on remailers-

a remop into legal problems. We have two different problems, with mutually

First I've heard that. Frankly, I'm suprised. One solution, which I've long 
advocated, is for the remailer to drop mail
which has an unencrypted body after it's applied it's decryption key. 
Provided this is an announced policy, substantially increases the
protection of the mail and the remop. It does mean that only people
capable of using encryption can receive mail via the remailer, but
that's probably a *good* thing. Peter Trei<<

So,peter's here,he's contributing and not concealing corporate vested 
interests,so far so good.

Peter Trei may be "anonymouse" or Pseudynomous in this thread...or he slept 
through it,doesnt care,domestic/business emergency,other distraction,any 
number of excuses.Nowt wrong with that but then next week...

 >>If there's anything more annoying than a boring nut who takes

persecuted list member- work, as published on Declan's
Politech list. Peter Trei<<

The mask slips,30% of the list appears to be one spam,(20/20) Did Trei 
complain about that? He absolutely endangered a comrades peace and security 
with his inattention/carelessnes/maliciousness.Take your pick in the 
absence of an explanation.He has ducked questions on this while bragging 
about his rapacious capitalist connections and now has the gall to try and 
sell conference tickets here like the lowest cheap spam.Fuck the rsa 
company and double fuck its low running dog,Peter Trei.
