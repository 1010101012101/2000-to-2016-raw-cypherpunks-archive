This seems to be related to the "Stego Watch" program sold by Wetstone
Technologies. Does anyone have more information about it? I've found
citations for a few papers on it, but none are online. I'll go to the
library later, but in the meantime has anyone read these papers or had
experience with the system in action?

How does it compare to Provos' stegdetect?
