Antennas Enhance WLAN Security
By Trevor Marshall

October 1, 2001

Antennas are most often used to increase the range of WLAN (wireless
LAN) systems, but proper antenna selection can also enhance the
security of your WLAN. A properly chosen and positioned antenna can
reduce the signal leaking out of your workspace, and make interception
extremely difficult.

In this article, I analyze the signal of different antenna designs,
and how the positioning of the user's antenna makes a difference in
signal reception.
