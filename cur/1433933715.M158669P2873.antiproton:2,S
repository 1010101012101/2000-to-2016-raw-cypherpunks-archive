Thanks for the comments Adrian.

What concerns me is that from what I've seen, it only talks about
Australian academics publishing novel ideas. What is completely missing
is how these ammendments may affect Australian open source developers,
who are also non-academics, working on cryptosystems. If they publish a
novel cipher on GitHub without getting approval by DECO, is that
a GOTO Jail card?
