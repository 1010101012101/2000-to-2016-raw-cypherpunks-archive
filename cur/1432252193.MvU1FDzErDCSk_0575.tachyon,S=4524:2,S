Minar Sinan ; chief architect in the Ottoman court from 1539 until his 
death in 1588. He constructed or designed most of Sulayman I's buildings, 
the most noted of which is his mosque (c.1557) in Istanbul, where he is 
buried. It has four minarets and stained-glass windows flanking the mihrab. 
The mosque (1614) of Sultan Ahmed I is similarly distinguished by its dome 
lit by numerous windows, and wall surfaces covered with green and blue 
tiles. Fine ornate buildings were erected in Turkey until the middle of the 
17th cent.

It was Shah Jahan (1628–58) who perfected Mughal architecture and erected 
at Agra its most noble and famous building, the tomb of his favorite wife, 
which is known as the Taj Mahal. A huge white marble building of simple, 
symmetrical plan, it is inlaid with colorful semiprecious materials and is 
set in an equally beautiful and symmetrical garden. The Taj Mahal continues 
the tradition of Mughal garden tombs, of which Humayun's tomb was the 
first. Shah Jahan established (1638) Delhi as his capital and built there 
the famous Red Fort, which contained the imperial Mughal palace. Painting 
also flourished during Shah Jahan's reign. Portraiture was most highly 
developed at his sophisticated court, and ink drawings were of high quality.
