So are you now admitting that Chomsky used to continually make fraudulent 
citations, but claiming he has since reformed?

My reason for using Chomsky's twenty year old lies, lies from the time that 
the Soviet Union was at its greatest power, appeared to be winning, and 
appeared to be on the path to world domination, rather than his current 
lies, is that my purpose is to show that the most famous "anarcho" 
socialist intended not anarchy, but world domination by the Soviet Union, 
intended not some new and wonderful form of socialism, but socialism as we 
came to know it during twentieth century.
