On the larger purchases, the costs drop down to the forty-cents-a-minute 
range.  Totally worth it if you really *need* anonymity on the phone.  

Of course, anonymity is relative; these phones have built-in GPS chips 
for 911 calls, and these are activated from the central office, not by 
a 911-sensing circuit in the handset.  IOW, it is not impossible for 
someone with the right gear and knowhow to query the phone for its 
exact latitude and longitude at any moment when it's in use.  (I don't 
know whether it can be queried when it's switched off, nor if so whether 
removing the main batteries will stop it).  So if you're into hard 
anonymity, keep it inside a faraday cage when you're not using it and 
don't use it from inside your own dwelling. 

Faraday cages don't have to be fancy; a fruitcake tin will usually do.
