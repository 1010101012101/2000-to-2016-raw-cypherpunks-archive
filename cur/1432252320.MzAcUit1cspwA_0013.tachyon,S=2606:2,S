Tyler:

A rational person has to admit that many parasitic folks of all albedos
are able to exist
because they occupy a govt-funded niche.

Without a welfare govt, those people would either 1. subsist on private
(ie voluntary) charity, 2. become useful by necessity 3. die of
starvation
4. die during attempts to coerce others with violence.

Depending on your beliefs about human demographics/nature, you will
assign variable percentages to these outcomes.

It *is* racist to think that genotypes in each bin will differ *IFF* you

*don't* ascribe this outcome to culture associated with genotypes.

But culturism is not racism, its recognition of how behavior and
evolution work.  I subscribe to and will defend culturism.

(I speak for myself, not TM (tm), though I may or may not be a duly
appointed pope of the church of strong cryptography; though recently
I've been trending towards being an Earthquaker,
who believes in tectonics, esp. during seismic events.  Our vatican
is in Parkfield BTW :-)
