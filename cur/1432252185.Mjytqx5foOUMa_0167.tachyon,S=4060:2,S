control people by force simultaneously after sufficiently strong and error
resilient anonymity has arrived) and most of all, the wording suggests that
Jim, very wisely, was trying to cover his butt. Not surprisingly, and
precisely as you say, the Men with Guns do not seem to care.

Yep. That's probably one side of the whole argument: if you try to control
people by force when they have strong anonymity available, they'll have very
efficient means of resisting the control. Short of really dumping every
civil right there is and putting up a Big Brother effort Orwell himself
couldn't envision there is very little that can be done. Hence, the only way
to reconsile anonymity with a fair state monopoly on violence is to
minimize the state and the violence it exerts.  This neatly sums up both AP
and most cypherpunkish ideas on cryptoanarchy and libertarianism.
