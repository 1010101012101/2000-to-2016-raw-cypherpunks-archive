The issue was that the threat model was not successfully sold to the general public. This was/is a political/sociological obstacle.

Think the smoking issue: it was hard to shed light on the causality where cause and effect are 10-20 years apart, despite the fact that almost all major players (except the tobacco industry) cooperated.

With encryption, none of the major players cooperates, and the distance between the cause and effect is more likely 20-30 years (data harvesters getting ahead of and hamstringing the general public.)
