I was thinking about filters that are installed by the user,
but might get their lists of spammer / spams from a rating service,
just as censorware products get lists from services.
For instance, there are some patterns that are obvious spam
and once you've seen them twice, you block them,
but there's a lot of randomly worded spam out there
which a spam-rating service could help you block.
				Thanks!
