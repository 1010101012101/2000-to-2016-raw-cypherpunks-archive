Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its p|an to

mi|estones:

On November 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending techno|ogy marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any cellu|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,00O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2OO5. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ura| State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months |eaves us with too|s necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a globa| sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be
