Domain names are supposed to have at least one primary DNS server
and at least one secondary DNS server, and some names
will arrange to have more than one secondary.
It wouldn't be at all surprising if Verio uses
one server as the primary for both names and one as the secondary for both.
It's probably worthwhile for you to arrange another secondary -
there are crypto-friendly sites that will probably be happy to do so
(e.g. toad.com, havenco.com, thebunker.net, etc.)
