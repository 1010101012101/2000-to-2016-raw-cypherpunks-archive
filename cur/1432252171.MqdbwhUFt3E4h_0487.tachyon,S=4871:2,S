Indeed, and this is a very good use for company attorneys! Or other 
company officers.

If one is concerned that the company lawyer will use the key 
improperly, split the key. Or place it in a fireproof safe with 
dual-key access, then distribute the physical keys suitably.

Or, more simply, drop the disks with the spare keys in an envelope, 
seal it, and place it in the safe of the company officers or 
attorneys. Off site, split, whatever.

This is an old problem, solved long ago.

I'm sure there is some role for privately-arranged (that is, not 
government-required) holding of critical keys, just as there is for 
critical documents stored in old mercury mines (as Intel did at the 
old New Almaden Mine in the Santa Cruz Mountains). As I said, 
well-solved.

I've never said there is *no* role for safe alternate storage of 
keys. See above, and se my past comments on legitimate use of backup 
options. Most of us likely use some form of key backup.

Building in transparent key escrow with "trusted third parties" is 
dangerous, however. Remember that the British model for "trusted 
third parties" did not include free choice of who those third parties 
were, but, rather, were limited to Officially Approved TTPs.

The whole approach of the Authorities has been to mandate access to 
encrypted data. The ZKS plan speaks of regulatory conformance...this 
is what is inimical to our goals.

Sounds fair to me. See above. What companies or individuals do is 
their concern, not mine, and not government's.
