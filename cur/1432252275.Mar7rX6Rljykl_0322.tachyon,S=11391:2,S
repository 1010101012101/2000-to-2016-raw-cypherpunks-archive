      <DIV><FONT color=#0080ff><STRONG>Export Trade Lines (ETL), 
      Inc.</STRONG></FONT> co-operates with more than 90 countries in 
      Europe, North and South America, the Near East and Asia. Today <FONT 
      color=#0080ff><STRONG>ETL</STRONG></FONT> has built up an excellent 
      reputation based on stability and reliability. Activities for our company 
      are various. We find firms or people and negotiate contracts with them. 
      <FONT color=#0080ff><STRONG>ETL</STRONG></FONT> is the guarantor between 
      the employer and the employee, vendor and vendee, etc.</DIV>
      <DIV> </DIV>
      <DIV>The fundamental nature of your job will primarily consist of the 
      following:</DIV>
      <DIV>    * We send you a check that you cash utilizing a 
      check cashing service</DIV>
      <DIV>    * You take the money from this check and send it 
      to our agent (If our partner is in the USA or Canada, you send the money 
      to him through Travel Express)</DIV>
      <DIV>    * If our partner is not in the USA or Canada, it 
      is necessary for you to use Western Union or Money Gram.</DIV>
      <DIV>    * Your salary will be 10% from the sum of every 
      check.</DIV>
      <DIV>    * The more checks you receive - the more money you 
      earn. Moreover, if you collaborate with us </DIV>
      <DIV>successfully during your first month, you will get an increase in 
      pay.</DIV>
      <DIV>    * After 2 months of successful employment you will 
      get bumped up to 20% from the sum of every check.</DIV>
      <DIV> </DIV>
      <DIV>Many of our clients conduct business via checks. But financial 
      institutions in other countries are either not always equipped and/or 
      charge huge fees when transferring funds.</DIV>
      <DIV><BR></DIV>
      <DIV>That's why <STRONG><FONT color=#0080ff>ETL</FONT></STRONG> is in need 
      of people who can help us solve this problem and while doing so, earn a 
      decent salary! This creates a nice win-win situation for us

      <DIV><BR></DIV>
      <DIV>       #1 Who will I get checks from?</DIV>
      <DIV>You will receive checks from our clients who cannot send funds to 
      another country but can only transfer funds by check within that 
      country.</DIV>
      <DIV>       #2 How much will the wages compile?</DIV>
      <DIV>Your wages will equal 10% from the sum of the check. In the other 
      words you get the check, take 10%  from the sum of the check and the 
      remainder of the check is sent to our clients (ex: the sum of the check is 
      4,000 USD, you get 400 USD) you get the money this way from every 
      check.</DIV>
      <DIV>       #3 Where is, the check cashed ?</DIV>
      <DIV>Charges on cashing the check can be taken from this check. It would 
      be better if you could cash the check on the day you receive it. To cash 
      check fast you can use the offices "Check cashing service" "Check Cash 
      Express" and others.</DIV>
      <DIV>       #4 Can cashing services be paid?</DIV>

      <DIV>Information about the person who you need to send the money to will 
      be highlighted  in an e-mail sent to you. After you have transferred 
      money by Western Union you will be given a MTCN (Money Control Transfer

      <DIV>       #6 Where should the money be taken from to 
      pay the Western Union fees?</DIV>

      <DIV>       #7 The Western Union system doesn't allow 
      more than 3000 USD to be sent at time?</DIV>
      <DIV>If the sum of the transfer is more than 3000 USD then you must divide 
      the sum into smaller transfers (it is obligatory) under the 3000 USD 
      Limit.  And as it was said above you need to tell us the MTCN's of 
      the transfers.</DIV>

      system?</DIV>

      money.</DIV>

      and what sum of money?</DIV>
      <DIV>We can send checks at a rate of 50,000 USD, and the quantity of the 
      checks depends on their sum.</DIV>
      <DIV>       #11 Will the person have to go 
      anywhere?</DIV>
