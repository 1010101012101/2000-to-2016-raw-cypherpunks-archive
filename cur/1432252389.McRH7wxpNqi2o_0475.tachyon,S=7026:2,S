           SEEKING A TRUSTWHORTHY FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER

I  WILL LIKE TO BEGIN BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION; I  AM DR. ANTHONY

THE SOUTH AFRICA DEPARTMENT OF MINING AND NATURAL RESOURCES CURRENTLY
HERE IN AMSTERDAM ON A ( 3) MONTH TRADE MISSION.And please do not be
embarrassed as to how we gotten your contact;This was achieved through
the chamber of commerce here in HOLLAND without the purposes being
disclosed.So make this business highly confidential as well.

I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO SOLICIT YOUR CO-OPERATION IN ORDER TO
REDEEM AN INVESTMENT INTEREST CURRENTLY BEING HELD UNDER TRUST WITH
THE SOUTH AFRICA MINISTRY OF MINING AND NATURAL RESOURCES. THE SAID
INVESTMENT  NOW VALUED AT  ( U.S.$22,500,000.00 ) MILLION DOLLARS  WAS
ORIGINALLY PURCHASED BY ONE MR. LUCIO MANFRED AND LEASED TO THE
TRANSVAAL ORANGE MINNING CORPORATION IN 1979.

SINCE THE MATURITY OF THE CONTRACT IN SEPTEMBER 1989 SEVERAL  ATTEMPTS
HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT SUCCESS TO CONTACT MR LUCIO MANFRED OR ANY OF
HIS RELATIVES IN WHOSE FAVOUR THE INVESTMENT CASH VALUE CAN BE PAID.

MY PARTNER  WHO IS THE ACCOUNTS DIRECTOR AT  THE MINISTRY OF MINNING
AND SOME OF OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO BOTH SOUTH
AFRICA  CENTRAL  BANK  AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE RESPECTIVELY  HAVE
INITIATED THE PROCESS OF FILLING A CLAIM FOR  THIS MONEY WITH THE HOPE
OF HAVING THE FUNDS TRANSFERED  ABROAD FOR SECURITY REASONS. WE
REQUEST THAT YOU LET ME AND MY PARTNERS FILE A CLAIM FOR  THIS MONEY
FROM SOUTH AFRICA MINISTRY OF MINNING AND NATURAL RESOURCES INDICATING
THAT YOU ARE AND  WERE  APPOINTED BY MR LUCIO MANFRED TO BE THE
BENEFICIARY OF THIS FUNDS. THE APPROVAL / CLEARANCE OF THIS FUND FROM
SOUTH AFRICA CENTRAL BANK WILL COST US ($150,953,45)DOLLARS ONLY, BUT
ME AND MY SOUTH AFRICA PARTNERS HAVE ALREADY RAISED THE MONEY AND SET
IT ASIDE WAITING FOR ANY RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER LIKE YOU WHO
WE CAN TRANSFER THE WHOLE MONEY INTO HIS OR HER ACCOUNT RELIABLY.

THE BASIC THINGS WE ARE REQUESTING FROM YOU AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER, TO

ARE;

WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ANY EXPENSES DURING THE TRANSFER. PLEASE WE URGE
YOU TO KEEP THIS MATTER VERY CONFIDENTIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE STILL IN
ACTIVE  PUBLIC  SERVICES IN SOUTH AFRICA.

I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT MY PARTNERS ARE  IN  A POSITION TO MAKE  THE
PAYMENT OF THIS CLAIM POSSIBLE  PROVIDED YOU CAN GIVE US A STRONG
GUARANTEE THAT OUR SHARE  WILL BE WELL SECURED AND THAT YOU WILL NOT
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR POSITION SINCE THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED
DIRECTLY TO A BANK YOU WILL NOMINATE.

BE ASSURED THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IN VIEW OF
THIS CLAIM.IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE  WITH NO RISK INVOLVED AND IT IS NOT
SUBJECT TO ANY ENQUIRY SINCE MY PERTNERS  WILL BE  HANDLING IT
DIRECTLY IN SOUTH AFRICA ON YOUR BEHALF.

I DO HOPE MY PROPOSAL IS ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. AND  PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE
THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER SO THAT I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH  MORE
CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE CLAIM AND NOW WE  INTEND TO MAKE THIS DEAL
BENEFICIAL TO EVERYONE.

done the transfer ourselves  without seeking the assistance of foreign
partner.PLEASE TREAT THIS BUSINESS WITH HIGH CONFIDENTIALITY.
