There are a number of languages normally called Chinese that use the
same characters.  They are more or less mutually comprehensible when
written but not when spoken.  (Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Fukien, 
etc)  It takes some self-discipline to write Chinese that can be
understood by speakers of other dialects.

Vietnamese used to fall into this category before the French took over;
they now use a phonetic alphabet, the usual alphabet used by 
European languages with additional marks that make it phonetic.

Japanese, Korean, and possibly others use a mixture of the Chinese
characters and phonetic symbols.  In Japanese at least the phonetic
symbols form two syllabaries.  A syllabary is like an alphabet, but
instead of representing sounds a symbol represents a syllable.  So 
the Japanese syllabaries begin "kah, kee, koo, kay, koh, ..."
