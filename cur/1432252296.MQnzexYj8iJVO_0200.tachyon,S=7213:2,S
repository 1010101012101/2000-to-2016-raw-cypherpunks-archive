Underfunded, understaffed, but also the only reason why Facebook's 
facial recognition database was rolled back in Europe. Well, we're told 
it was rolled back, which I don't believe for an instant. Point being, 
the DPC has done a fantastic job with the shoestring our government 
gives it.

All of which is beside my point: I wasn't saying the Irish government's 
great and that Ireland's a safe-haven from spying; it's not. We have 
GCHQ sitting on all of our fibres, and we *do* host some of the world's 
biggest NSA assets: Facebook, Google, Amazon, etcetera.

My point was that our *government* does not engage, as far as we know, 
in mass surveillance, and that receiving government funding in Ireland 
to study and deploy privacy projects would therefore be less worrisome 
than receiving the same funding from the UK or US, which presents the 
well-trodden paradox of being "funded by the adversary".
