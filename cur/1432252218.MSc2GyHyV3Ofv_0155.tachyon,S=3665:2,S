I think that this cannot be used in evidence. The plain fact is that the
German government will pay only a fraction of what a company would pay.
 As an example (even though not one that could be applied to a job with
the federal government as a civil servant, but which I nevertheless
believe to be comparable), a PhD being paid according to the pay grade
known as TVöD 14 Step 1 will take home a base salary of roughly 1700
Euros, after taxes.  Also, prospects for promotion are slim and the
bureaucracy is terrible and cannot be evaded.

Best,

Stephan
