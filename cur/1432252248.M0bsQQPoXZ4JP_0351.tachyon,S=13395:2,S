here is his argument : i bought a gun i shot someone killed them got
arrested and convicted of the murder my trial in which i blamed the
manufacturer of the gun for the whole ordeal was overturned after i sued
the gun manufacturer and they in fact were then convicted of my murderous
rampage and i was let out of jail and everything was reversed and oh yay i
am a good person its just the gun manufacturer > they are bad - very bad
white men

and all those people in history that have been convicted of committing war
crimes they didnt do it really as they were just following orders

wonder what geoff would have said had he been purchased a steak dinner -
doesnt matter he lets clouds enter his logic like all the other good
americans do FTS
