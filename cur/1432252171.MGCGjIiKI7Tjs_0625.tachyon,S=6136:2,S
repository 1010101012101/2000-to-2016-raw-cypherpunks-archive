What you said is correct, that is what needs to happen (society and law
needs to move out of the dark ages), and the only way for that to happen
is brave canaries with squeaky clean reps, and sharp lawyers to blaze the
path.

My version was just to say be aware of the risks, that you would take by
even putting your name to a hack, with any disclosure at all.  If you dont
want to be a canary.

Possibly would be advisable to use a laywer for some anonmyity insulation to
even sell a hack to one of the disclosure service pimping sites.  (They
probably are selling them to the NSA/Orwell 2.0 crew so taking their money is
probably dirty money.)

Independent security researcher can be risky.  Get a legal signed doc from
the people you audit people say (yeah like they're gonna give you one for an
unsolicited investigation).

Weev was an independent security researcher after all, in a team even. 
Goatse security http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse_Security.  They did find
some interesting and news worthy hacking stuff, even won awards from Tech
Crunch seemingly.
