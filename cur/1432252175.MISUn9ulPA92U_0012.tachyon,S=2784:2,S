e-golb.com resolves to 66.175.11.248.  arin.net shows this as being in
the netblk 66.175.0.0 - 66.175.63.255, belonging to Cedant Web Hosting,
www.cedant.com, in Davis, CA, which is near Sacramento.  At a minimum
Cedant could be informed about this fraud, which is clearly outside
of its AUP.  You might even be able to get law enforcement involved,
or perhaps contact the admin at Cedant and find out who has the address
in question.
