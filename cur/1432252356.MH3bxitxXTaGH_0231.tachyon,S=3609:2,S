He's right about the "19,000 spoiled ballots." Four years ago there 
were 16,000 spoiled ballots in the same district, and that was with 
lower overall turnout.

Fact is, voting is serious business. Those who show up dazed and 
confused and punch too many holes in their ballot are an example of 
social Darwinism.

I have no sympathy for stupid people.

Unless he was bugging the voting booths and had ways of knowing the 
true thoughts of those voting, he had no way of knowing this.

And me, too. We all want a race war.

(I'm sort of hoping Gore manages to get his shysters to get the 
election thrown his way...then the shooting war can start in earnest.)
