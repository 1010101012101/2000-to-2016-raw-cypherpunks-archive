Subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] Wi-fi range extension with phased pherical array antennae?
Reply-To: byzantium@hacdc.org

Perhaps wi-fi range could be extended without increased power with spherical 
phased arrays of antennae, which can be used to directionally amplify sent 
and received signals. Maybe a physics or engineering student could put into 
the public domain hardware designs to control signal directionality of such 
an icosahedral array, and open source software could be devised to discover 
other signal's direction, and transpond 'in' that right direction with that 
signal's transponder. Here's some related papers:
