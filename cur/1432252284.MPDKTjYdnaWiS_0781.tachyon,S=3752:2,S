'Because Sorrel has this irritating habit of waking people up by p lling th=
eir eyelids open with her claws.' He giggles, and I wonder whether he is se=
rious. The last time we saw each other in this house he was emerging from a=
 period of more than a year during which he'd done nothing but sleep. He sh=
owed me a text he'd written, an account of his dreams that had gradually st=
arted to make narrative sense. Characters had reappeared, episodes weaving =
together to form a story in which he was either marginal, or a feeble accom=
plice to disaster. When it began to seem that his moments of waking were th=
ere solely to feed the world of the dream and its inhabitants he'd abandone=
d the project. 
Later he takes me upstairs to show me a painting he has done of Sorrel. The=
 stairs run round three walls of the hall, and at each of the two landings =
there is a window. On the sill of the first window someone has put a pincus=
hion in the form of a cat. I pick it up and feel it rustle between my finge=
rs. It seems to be filled with dried herbs; it has a musty smell. 
'By the way, Simon,' Joey says, turning to look down at me from the upper l=
anding, 'be careful to close the door when you go to bed tonight.' 
'They're for this evening really,' she says with a doubtful tone, almost of=
 reproach. 'We've asked some people round.' She shifts the biscuits onto a =
rack to cool, then breaks one into two with a little sigh and offers me hal=
f. It crumbles as I eat. 'You'll like them,' she says, and I wonder for a m=
oment what she means. 
Shortly after, he fell in love with Susan, whom he'd known since childhood =
- as though he'd opened his eyes and discovered her there, he said - and th=
e honeymoon began. Now he is laughing, his hair lit up from behind like a d=
andelion clock by the light from the landing window, and I still don't know=
 if he's joking. 
'Look,' he said. He pushed his hand through the glass. I waited to see the =
surface ripple like water, but nothing happened. Tentatively, I reached out=
 My hand went into the shop
