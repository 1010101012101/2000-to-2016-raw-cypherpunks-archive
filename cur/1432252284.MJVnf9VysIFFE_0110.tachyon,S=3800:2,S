This used to be a self flattering delusion, is now a lie. US
records have been opened, we know that the overthrow came as a
complete surprise to the US, and that initially the US did not
know whose side Lon Nol was on.

What happened was that Sihanouk's allies, the North Vietnamese,
attacked him.   This discredited Sihanouk's foreign policy, and
Sihanouk himself, and led to those who sought to save Cambodia
from Vietnamese domination, sought to avoid the installation of
the (then seemingly puppet) Khmer Rouge, overthrowing Sihanouk.
Shawcross, no friend of the US, reluctantly conceded this after
doing a big freedom of information thing.

You live in a world of delusion.  Your dates are all wrong,
your events are all fiction.

The Khmer Rouge were primarily backed by the Soviet Union at
first.  When it became apparent that they were not the puppets
that those who organized them and initially armed them intended
them to be, they subsequently received more backing from China,
and less from the Soviet Union, but they were brought to power
by support from both China and the Soviet Union.

The US never followed an aggressive policy towards the PRC.

Sihanouk was friendly, indeed abjectly servile, to the North
Vietnamese and the Soviet Union, yet the North Vietnamese
created the Khmer Rouge and attacked Cambodia.

Same thing happened with Laos, where the Americans never got
involved at all to any significant extent.
