Sorta depends on your definition of fun, doesn't it?   B^)

True:  These days most or all  industrial uses are banned.

I beg to differ.  Check the material I downloaded below.  Acquiring PCB's
requires little more than the will to do it.  Believe me, I _know_.


The following comes from the site:
http://www.ohb.org/pcbs.htm#Why_did_the_EPA_ban

(found by using altavista, searching for     "polychlorinated biph*" AND
"capacitor*"


-----------------------------------------------

Where are PCBs found?

PCBs were used mainly in electrical transformers and capacitors, heat
transfer systems, and hydraulic systems. They were also used in inks and
carbonless copy paper and for a variety of other purposes, but the EPA ban
now prohibits almost all of these other uses. Nowadays, PCBs are found
mostly in transformers and capacitors. These may be contained in industrial
equipment (such as welding equipment), medical equipment (such as X-ray
machines), and household appliances (such as refrigerators and microwave
ovens).
The ballasts of some fluorescent light fixtures contain PCBs. During normal
operation of a fluorescent light, the PCBs are entirely enclosed, and you
cannot be exposed to them. However, when the capacitor wears out, sometimes
it may burn or break and leak PCBs.


How can I tell whether a piece of equipment contains PCBs?
Check for a manufacturer's label, which may give the date of manufacture and
the trade name of the fluid. Some trade names that may refer to PCBs include
Aroclor, Askarel, Eucarel, Pyranol, Dykanol, Clorphen, Clorinol, Chlorextol,
Diaclor, Hyvol, Asbestol, Inerteen, Elemex, Saf-T-Kuhl, No-Flanol, Nepolin,
EEC-18, and others. Equipment manufactured after 1979 usually does not
contain PCBs. Most pre-1979 capacitors do contain PCBs, while many pre-1979
transformers do not. Transformers within buildings or vaults are more likely
to contain PCBs. New equipment should be labeled "No PCBs." PCBs are clear,
amber-colored, or dark oily liquids. They may have a faint smell like motor
oil, and some contain chlorobenzenes which make them smell like mothballs.
Fluorescent light ballasts may contain about an ounce of PCBs; a utility
pole capacitor or transformer may contain much more. Usually what leaks from
a burned-out light ballast is not PCBs but a black tarry material that is
used to muffle noise from the capacitor. However, it is safest to assume
that anything that leaks from a transformer, capacitor, or light ballast
contains PCBs, unless there is a "No PCBs" label on the equipment.
