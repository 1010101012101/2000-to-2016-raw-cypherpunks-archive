Not kidding; No one looked to google services for their privacy and protections, no? They subscribe to email, knowing they are read for ‘ads’, and knowing that no doubt, everything is logged and available at whatever ‘official’ request’. They look towards TOR for… almost the opposite. They *are* ‘selling’ protection.

Not meaningless at all; however, for *myself* the notion that TOR is screwing people over carries far more weight (and no surprise) than the notion of google screwing people over who were not explicitly seeking said ‘protections’.

*shrug*. Like you said, technology aside on the Micro level, the Macro level design of TOR provides ‘them’ all the protections with none of the liability. How others do not understand this is beyond my ‘scope’, if you will.
