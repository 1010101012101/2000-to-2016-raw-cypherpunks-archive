Corporations act as "legal persons" - they can enter into contracts, own 
assetts, sue people, etc.  

The problem emerges when a corporation enters into battle with an 
individual - it's pretty hard to fight a lawsuit when the "person" on the 
other side of the table has billions of dollars, thousands of lawyers, and 
is willing and able to protract the battle over dozens of years.  It's 
even worse when your opponent has the resources to lobby to change laws.

Can you say RIAA?
