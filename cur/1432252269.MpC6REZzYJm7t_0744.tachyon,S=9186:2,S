The best thing to do at this stage would be to convince Kevin friendly
but firmly that it is in his best interest to step down. This really
creates an unhealthy environment, drawing away many others from
contributing, something that really should not happen at an open forum
like IETF.

So, please voice your opinions on the respective IETF lists.
