The sword is rattling the scabbard.

Silicon Valley Mercury News (Apr 16) - "Homeland Security chief  
contemplating proactive cyber attacks" by Steve Johnson
http://www.mercurynews.com/rss/ci_20410915

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Monday she would  
consider having tech companies participate with the government in  
"proactive" efforts to combat hackers based in foreign countries.

Napolitano, who made the comments during a meeting at the San Jose Mercury 
News with the editorial board and reporters, declined to say what steps 
corporations and federal agencies might take against foreign cybercrooks, 
who have been blamed for numerous computerized incursions against the 
United States. She made the remarks in response to a question, and 
emphasized the idea is merely one she would consider and that no decisions 
have been made.

In discussing the private partnerships she is promoting to combat  
cyberattacks, Napolitano was asked if instead of just taking defensive  
measures, the government and companies should be launching proactive  
counterattacks against foreign-based culprits. "Should there be some  
aspect that is in a way proactive instead of reactive?" she responded, and 
then answered her own question with "yes." She added, "it is not something 
that we haven't been thinking about," noting someone else had raised the 
subject with her earlier Monday.

However, Napolitano said some restrictions might have to be placed on  
businesses participating in such cyber activities because "what you are  
doing is authorizing a private entity to do what might otherwise be  
construed as an attack on another entity."
