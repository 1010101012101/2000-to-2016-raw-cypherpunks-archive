The capacity of most humans to see in visible light wavelengths is 
well-documented, and this capacity forms part of our expectation of 
what is and is not private.  

People erect privacy fences *BECAUSE* those fences cannot be seen 
through in the visible-light spectrum.  In so doing, they express 
an intent for the stuff behind those fences to be private.  

*sigh.*  I suppose it would freak their cookies, and might even 
prompt a search-warrant, if someone installed steel plates in 
his walls so that the impulse-radar was baffled.
