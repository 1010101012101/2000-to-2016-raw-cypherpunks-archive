A brief review of: Reading between the lines: the Great War of
Continents, information wars, and multipolarity

This article's title foreshadows its content:  Many complex words
that say nearly nothing.

Orwell's 'duckspeak' condenses language into short bursts of
stereotyped, reflexive utterances, meaningless outside the context
of simplistic, indoctrinated verities supplied by the State.  The
bizarre cant the present document was written in looks like an
equal and opposite version of Duckspeak:  In overblown hyperbolic
prose, the author piles high level abstractions one atop the other
until any possible meaning disappears, in an apparent attempt to
impress and confuse the reader.  I had to re-read several
paragraphs in the article to unravel their structure and assign
possible meanings to them.  On the whole it looks to me like a
verbal Rorschach inkblot; devoid of content, but the reader might
see his or her own latent beliefs peeking out here and there to
create an illusion of deeper meaning.

The whole semantic content of the article does appear in two
sentences buried near the middle of the text:  "Fort Russ provides
cutting-edge reports and analyses which lay bare realities which
mainstream Western media actively distorts, obscures, or flat out
conceals. This is absolutely crucial."  Here the author lays bare
his own apparent intentions and method, attributing them to The
Enemy like a good little propagandist should.

And that's all I have to say about that.
