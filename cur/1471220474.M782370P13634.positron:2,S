It's even worse - that last sentence above could easily be read as
follows (thanks for the mindset, Juan :) - "In rare cases, open
development does undermine the security of our users (those who actually
need Tor against TLAs, and all our open development lulling those lusers
into a belief in safety which does not exist) and in these rare cases
(which are the only ones we should be worrying about) we will be
especially vigilant in our open development and peer review to work
extra hard at bamboozling folks and fulling all our masters requirements
for next version, and thereby avoiding those things which may actually
help those who actually need Tor to actually do something effective with
it besides sharing our Hollowood propaganda".

(This one time, I had a weird moment of having read the (Tor propaganda)
paragraph above as though it was your (Steve) 'response to Tor
propaganda' - then, this one time, I read your next para below and said
"what?!!"  Then, I shoved a light bulb up my brain, twigged really hard
and explained it to myself slow enough that I could understand it.)

"Especially the rights of Jacob Applebaum whom we have a monstrous hard
on for at the moment - his rights are like, you know, really important
all of us here at Tor Inc.  We believe in a better, warmer, caring
world full of justice, transparence and truth."

"And we absolutely believe in the right for those with a rigid anger
against another, to take a firm hold of a vigilante community and
thrust some righteous and vigorously anonymous arguments at the wall of
innuendo, slurs and outright lies and coverups.

Because, what's life without some serious and unethical backstabbing
process thrown into the mix?"

(like those tools on our vigilante justice committee, the CIA guys who
failed to cover their trackes well enough when apply to work with Tor
Inc, and those CIA guys who did get through the gaping cracks we
lubricate with TLA dollars - as we always say, "once you've had black
(money), you'll never go back!")

(like the use of our vigilante justice system, which nearly got out of
Public Relations control, but was saved at the 11th hour by our
knight-ess in smoking black garter belts, Shari Steele)

vigorously, relentlessly and cruelly - we call it:

   The Shari-ahh law way.

Only thing we have not yet figured out is how to include more, how do we
say this, physical consequences, as part of our detailed, torturous and
dare we say, religious ways.

As well we do this and are up front about it when we say "we need more
users to fill enough of the bandwidth to provide enough cover traffic
for our special ops in Syria, Lybia, Iraq, Afghanistan, China and
Russia, and disabling No-script by default would cause according to our
estimations, quite a few millions of those useful naieve users to not
stay.

Yes I agree, that would be a fine ending to their propaganda - I'm just
not sure they would include it - too much truth.
