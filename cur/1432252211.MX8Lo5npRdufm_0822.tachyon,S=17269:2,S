***VC QUESTION OF THE WEEK***
----------------------------------------
Answered by Bruce Brumberg, Esq.

QUESTION: Are all stock options taxed the same?

ANSWER: No. The taxation of your stock options will depend upon
whether they are incentive stock options (ISOs) or nonqualified
stock options (NQSOs). ISOs are free from regular tax at the date
of grant and the date of exercise (when a non-qualified option
would become taxable). NQSOs do not meet the IRS criteria for ISOs
and therefore trigger a tax upon exercise. This type of option
requires withholding of state and federal income tax, Medicare and
FICA/FUTA on the excess of the fair market value over the exercise
price on the exercise date.

**VENTURE CAPITAL COMPANY PROFILE**
----------------------------------------
By Udayan Gupta, Venture Capital Contributor

Tandoori and Noodles: EthnicGrocer.com Delivers

Immigrants are hot. Asian and Hispanic populations are booming.
Asian and Pacific Islanders populations have grown 43% percent.
Hispanics have increased nearly 40%. EthnicGrocer
(www.ethnicgrocer.com) has figured that the best way to these
populations is through their stomachs. Food!

"If you're Chinese and you live in Alabama, the chances of your
finding a Chinese store are almost none," says EthnicGrocer.com CEO
and president Parry Singh. Outside of the major urban centers,
immigrants have a hard time finding cultural-specific foods. The
ethnic food market in the U.S. is fragmented. Most retailers are
small and carry a limited amount of merchandise. "Seven out of ten
times you go to the distributor, he doesn't have what you want,"
says Singh. In response, Singh and his colleagues founded
EthnicGrocer.com and its sister sites, Namaste.com for the
Asian-Indian market, GongShee.com for the Chinese market, and
QueRico.com for the Latin American market. Consumers can shop online
and have their favorite foods - including perishables - delivered
right to their door. A godsend for newly immigrated Chinese in Alabama.

In August, EthnicGrocer.com announced the closing of its $41 million
C round of financing. Investors in the company include Integral
Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Amerindo
Investment Advisors, Merrill Lynch, Benchmark Capital and KB
Partners, LLC.

Singh says his company's strengths are its scalable supply chain
platform and its expertise in ethnic marketing. As the company grows,
it continues to add hard-to-find products, and to offer other product
lines. "We start with food to build a bond with the consumer," says
Singh. Based in Chicago with a distribution centers in Hebron,
Kentucky and Northbrook, Illinois, the company currently employs 150.
By the end of the year, EthnicGrocer plans to launch sites for the
Korean, Filippino and Kosher markets.

EthnicGrocer was far from the first in the online grocery shopping
space, however. Companies like California-based Webvan Group, Inc.
(WBVN), New Jersey-based NetGrocer.com, Inc., Massachusetts-based
Streamline.com, Inc. (SLNE), Washington-based HomeGrocer.com, Inc.
(HOMG) and Peapod, Inc. (PPOD) all deliver grocery products straight
to consumers' doors. Moreover, what's there to prevent brands such
as New Jersey-based Goya Foods, Inc., California-based Authentic
Specialty Foods, Inc., and Minnesota-based Hormel Foods Corporation
(HRL), or even Houston-based retail chain Fiesta Mart Inc., from
launching their own Web sites? And it can only be a matter of time
before established chains like Cincinnati-based The Kroger Co. (KR),
Boise-based Albertson's, Inc. (ABS), and California-based
Safeway Inc. (SWY) jump on the net.

*** NOTE: On Tuesday, Peapod (PPOD) announced its acquisition of
Streamline.com (SLNE)
http://www.edgar-online.com/secrets.asp?d=A-1036992-0000950131-00-005301

*** NOTE:  A number of Webvan Group(WBVN) insiders have registered
to sell stock recently

Broadband Companies: Unclogging the Pipe

Ensemble Communications Inc.
WildBlue Communications, Inc.
@Link Networks, Inc.
Jump. Net
As the world - or increasing numbers in it - go online, the limits
of the systems that deliver Internet services are being stretched.
The protocol "WWW", for many, now signifies World Wide Wait. Critics
say AOL stands for "America On Late." Telephone dial-ups are
excruciatingly slow, severely limiting downloads and new product
development. But the dangling carrot of land-based cable and DSL and
wireless broadband keeps consumers going, holding out the promise of
relief from slow modem madness.

A report released by the Clinton Administration in the spring of 2000
says that while broadband is available to those in densely populated
centers, the same cannot be said for those in rural areas. The study,
published by the Department of Commerce, says that while broadband
via cable is available in 65% of U.S. cities with a population over
250,000, and via telephone in 56% of cities over 100,000, fewer than
5% of towns with populations under 10,000 have any broadband access
whatsoever.

Even in the urban markets where broadband is available, delivery is
spotty. Providers are backed up and many users have been waiting
months, even years, for broadband installation.

Wireless broadband could change all that, with satellites providing
next-generation Internet access to those in far-flung regions, such
as parts of Alaska, North Dakota and, yes, Guam. For many, however,
cable and DSL are still preferable for its land-based infrastructure.

The broadband space already has many contenders. For wireless
broadband, Sunnyvale, CA-based Adaptive Broadband Corporation (ADAP),
Tel Aviv-based BreezeCOM Ltd. (BRZE), Santa Clara, CA-based
Wireless, Inc., and Plano, TX-based Nucentrix Broadband Networks, Inc.
(NCNX) are already competing for customers in the U.S. and abroad.
For cable and DSL service, individuals and businesses look to
Redwood City, CA-based At Home Corporation (ATHM), Englewood, CO-based
Rhythms NetConnections Inc. (RTHM), and New Haven, CT-based DSL.net, Inc.
(DSLN).

Given the ever-widening reach of the Internet, there is plenty of
room in the space to grow. The following companies are worth adding
to your radar:

Ensemble Communications Inc.

The San Diego-based company, with its Adaptix module and Fiberless
delivery system, manufactures point-to-multipoint systems for use
