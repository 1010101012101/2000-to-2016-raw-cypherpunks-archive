I think we need to look first at the threat model you are trying to =
address. Is the concern that the photo's creator would fake the location =
of the photo?
Is it that you want to make the location of the photo self-verifying if =
it is re-used?
Do you want to simply be able to spot re-use and prove where the photo =
was actually taken?
Something else?

I think that a clearer definition of the problem will help identify the =
most appropriate solutions.
