Passive adversaries see only encrypted traffic, not internal
wheat/chaff ratios.

(If considering active adversaries, which this is not meant to
defend against, to be involved in ratios they would have to run
enough nodes to be over half the full path, no worse than basic
entry to exit correlation today.)

Internet access is generally provisioned and billed as... choose
the max bandwidth you want, pay for it whether you use it or not.
Therefore if you have idle capacity within your max at some moment,
you have the bandwidth to dynamically fill it with padding at no
additional cost. It's not a question of buying more to use as fill,
it's about intelligently filling what you've already comfortably paid for.

The problem of observing when endpoints are sitting idle, or rx/tx,
and how much, often, etc... applies to any network today, not just tor.

It doesn't take a supercomputer to calculate this
regarding your logical link to your next hop node...
100Mbps cap - 63Mbps used = 37Mbps fill

That's head in sand talk, of course nothing is free.
Mostly bookkeeping autonomously on and by the local node.
Maybe some circuit signaling / publishing to DHT.

Seems to get more complex if you try to scope
it across the net instead of just to your next hops.


There were threads on the subject of fill traffic
a few months back that might be worth reading...
"high latency hidden services"
"traffic analysis"
"traffic analysis -> let's write an RFC?"
