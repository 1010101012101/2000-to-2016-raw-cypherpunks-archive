Thank you ever so much for causing me to spray a perfectly good mouthful
of Chilean Merlot all over my keyboard. Took me about half an hour to make
the piece of crap work again.

Even if it isn't such a pivotal point when the Rule of Law is concerned,
I'm wondering what kind of insolent, stupid, heartless bastrards these
people are? Even if there was no immediate medical reason for cannabis
use, it shouldn't be such a big deal if people with AIDS or cancer have a
little bit of fun once in a while. I mean fer-crying-out-loud, who on
God's green Earth is going to follow through with it if you set
AIDS/cancer as a precondition to legally getting high?
