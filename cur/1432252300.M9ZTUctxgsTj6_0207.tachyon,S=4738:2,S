>As with "A. Melon," you apparently don't bother to read the news.

true, sadly i'm not as up-to-date as i could be, as i have little free time
and (blah blah excuse, blah, yeah, you get the idea) but that's SORTOF one
of the reasons i've subscribed to this list (btw, i appoligize to everyone
for being less than constructive or conversational in this email)

>Jacobson was giving a talk, using his laptop for the talk, and 
>stepped away for a few moments to talk to some journalists.

i caught this, and i think this is foolish.
the "wtf was he doing that" thing was sortof a figure of speech, sorry.



>One can learn from his mistake, but the thrust of your comments, 
>"walking around with secrets of that severity..." is way off-base.


one can learn from ones mistakes indeed (his or mine??), however wether or
not my statement is "off-base" is debatable... and though i guess the
importance of the secrets is as well. so is the guy out "trade secrets" (and
what not) or is he just out a nice little laptop? so with that in mind i
came to the conclusion that they felt that they suffered a larger loss than
4000$ (i don't really know the price of the laptop)... simply put, i guess,
if i had trade secrets that could potentialy cause as much damage to worry
people like that , i wouldn't leave it alone, not for 15-20, not for 5, and
not to talk to some journalists.

honestly, though, i'm not really one to judge, as i've never been in his
position before. (though i still maintain his action foolish, much as you
probably view my emails now ! :)  )and i'll try and hold back the urge to
join in conversation and add opinion and potential new views on various
situations that arise on this list. perhaps i'll learn more about that way.

As with "A. Melon," you apparently don't bother to read the news.

Jacobson was giving a talk, using his laptop for the talk, and 
stepped away for a few moments to talk to some journalists.

One can learn from his mistake, but the thrust of your comments, 
"walking around with secrets of that severity..." is way off-base.

Folks, if you don't read the news, or watch it on CNN and CNBC and 
the like, please don't feel compelled to add foolish remarks.
