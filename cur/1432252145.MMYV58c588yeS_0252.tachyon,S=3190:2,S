Heh, some of Mann's work involves pseudo-cameras (or dark acrylic plates 
on your shirt, or leds under domes on your backback), so can we look forward
to laws against *fake* recording?  

On the other hand, perhaps its time to write "you may be recorded" on
your driver's license, registration/insurance, or drivers's side door frame.
A bumper sticker would serve two purposes, hmm...
