Er, you might want to have a look at my old posts to get my thoughts on 
thar sort of thing.

You probably have a point if you're talking about the "capital L" fanatic 
types. Nevertheless, I don't think anyone should be so intellectually lazy 
and mentally impoverished that they need to rely on labels--self-imposed or 
otherwise--to have a "coherent" conversation. 

Maybe the people who do deserve to talk at each other.

Oh? I fully reserve the right to remain unimpresssed. LOL

I'm guessing this has more to do with the caliber and temperament of people 
who post to message boards than as something representative of any 
particular body of academic works, such as it is. Face it: if all you knew 
about any group of ideas was what you could deduce from Usenet posts, it 
would be a pretty sorry spectacle indeed. What passes for fascinating 
debate on message boards is more often than not uninformed bush-league 
armchair philosophizing, it's that simple. In fact, that's part of the 
problem right there: people are too busy throwing labels around to really 
get to the meat of the issues.

>applicable to the other.

But when is a global critique truly useful and relevant at all? The point 
I'm trying to make is a little clearer if you substitute a more familiar 
concept: "What is liberalism?" "What has liberalism meant, 
historically?" "What does it mean to be 'a liberal' in the United Stated 
today?" See, not so easy, is it. You can start talking about certain 
aspects of the term and its usage, but it's certainly not the type of thing 
you can completely cover and come to terms with in a few posts! No need to 
try to force something rich, complex and evolving into a brittle "all or 
nothing" proposition. 

It's as ridiculous to assume that any one person can "speak for" 
libertarianism as it is to have a "representative of liberalism". The 
people who try generally aren't with the time it takes to read them.

Sure-- as is the case with other general terms like "liberalism" 
and "conservatism".

This might be an issue for partisans and ideologues, otherwise it's 100% 
irrelevant. As far as I'm concerned, the real enemy is a mindset which 
allows you to let a label do your thinking for you.

It's not "a philosophy" any more than liberalism is, and you're confusing 
the supporters with the ideas themselves again. You want to talk Hayek? 
Let's talk Hayek. You want to debate Stirner? Jim Bell and AP? Go for it. 
The fact that there isn't much overlap in no way keeps me from having a 
meaningful and "coherent" conversation about libertarian ideas with people 
who happen to agree with parts of them. It's when the discussion 
degenerates into partisans throwing dogma and generalities at each other 
that it gets really, really tiresome. 

I'm certainly no purist, but the fact remains that I'm far more likely to 
pay attention to critiques of the free market by real economists who 
actually have a clue as to what they're talking about--like Brad Delong at 
Berkeley(http://www.j-bradford-delong.net). People on all sides can foam at 
the mouth all they please, but it won't affect policy and scholarship one 
way or the other. Which in the long run, is all that matters anyway.


~Faustine.


BTW, no hard feelings Jim, I think it's great you're bringing this sort of 
thing up here. Shaking people out of their complacency is always a good 
thing.
