modern security analysis requires ever increasing skills and
knowledge, driving the pool of practitioners ever smaller.  combined
with demand from government and private industry for private research,
paying researchers to work in the light rather than [REDACTED] a hard
sell.

this is one aspect of Project Zero i am keen to monitor, as the
initial recruiting is top talent and top dollar.  research to harden
software against advanced threats and analyze advanced attacks
encountered almost always locked behind non-disclosure,
confidentiality, classification constraints.

independent security research and state-of-the-art security research
at odds, increasingly so, day by day.

an industry in sorry shape[0] and much volatility, for sure.
Google's "Announcing Project Zero" post itself only accessible via
plain-text, attempts to https redirected back to plainly observable
and trivially tamper-able.

that mathematicians are having an introspective moment to consider
their role in mass privacy violations, and in turn advocating for
employment outside such private industries is a telling contrast to
the relative silence in infosec where developing weaponized exploits,
not just precursors or components, has yet to generate an honest and
open discussion.
