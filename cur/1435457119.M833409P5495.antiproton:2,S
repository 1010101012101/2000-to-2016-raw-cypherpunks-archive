And to you, in turn.  You are, of course, correct that only humans
can tame human impulses.  Keying to what, to me, is the centroid:

Are not Greek and Norse mythology (at least) fairly predictive of
what happens when human nature is merged with godlike power?  ("I'll
turn you into a frog!" ... "Not if I turn you into an eel first!")
Or is the more likely prediction that of Steve Wozniak, that humans
will be the house pets of robots in due course?

I am no more kidding than you are, your closing

being most well taken.  I, for one, would gladly paraphrase John
Perry Barlow's declaration of independence of cyberspace and say
that the "weary giants of flesh and steel" should leave me alone
but only if the "technology [that] is being imposed on a global
scale without restraint" will do likewise.  A pox on both; may
they fight to a standstill somewhere other than my front room
or my backyard.
