These are candidates only, they are intended to foster focused discussion.

Fundamental Theorem of Cliology

	-	Who get's to make the choices?
	-	What are the permissible choices?
	-	The first two are auto-catalytic

Definition of Society

	-	The cornerstones of any society are
		-	toleration
		-	self-defence
	-	A set of rules, codified or not, and expectations,
		expressed or not, which regulate both the individual
		and inter-personal activities of same
	-	Societies may be radically different in content and
		yet share the same geography
	-	The statics and dynamics of a society are governed by
		the physics of reality and the psychology of the
		individual (and it's absolute range)
	-	The expectations of societies can be in direct opposition
	-	Violence does not ensue from opposition but from lack
		of toleration of opposition
	-	This applies to all levels of societies and seems to be
		psychology independent (in other words, all life
		seems to follow it)
	-	As a result, stability can be looked upon as a measure
		of tolerance

Definition of 'crime'

	-	Any act which harms a person, their property, or breaks
		a public trust without consent
	-	What is a 'public trust'?
	-	A contract entered voluntarily (at the point one
		questions the compliance but complies they have
		consented - no expectation of continued consent
		is implied) to provide service to the community or
		use a public resource
	-	What is a 'public resource'?
	-	A resource which is common to all and is required for
		basic individual survival or social operations

Fundamental Axiom of Law

	-	The codification of social rules, commonly called
		'rule of law', is an extension of the right to
		self-defence
	-	A defining characteristic of any society is to whom the
		'right' falls to (ie some mix of individual or
		group)
	-	A fundamental defining character is whether the rights
		of society extend from the individual, or rather
		the rights of the individual stem from the population

Definition of Civil Liberty

	-	The ability to make 'a choice' with respect to individual
		or classes of decisions
	-	This is the primary defining character of any human
		society or relationship
