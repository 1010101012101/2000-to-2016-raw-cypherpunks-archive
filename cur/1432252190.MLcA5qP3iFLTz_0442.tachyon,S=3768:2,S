business, home and spousal contact information for _all_
of his fellow TU Lawschool Class of '79 reunion mateys
at:

<http://www.tilly.com/tulawclassof79>

>The name of the prosecuting attorney is on the plea bargain
>sent to Brian, copy below.

...and TU Law '79.

Now here a conundrum for Mr. Sperling, Esquire:  If your
classmate's web homepage <www.tilly.com> doesn't directly
link to the page with your home address, home phone, wife's
name, etc. then does the fact that Google's spiders and bots
finked you out (probably because your dearly beloved classmates
linked to the page from their own vanity home pages)
constitute intentional unauthorized access to a  protected
computer system under 18 USC 1030a2C?
