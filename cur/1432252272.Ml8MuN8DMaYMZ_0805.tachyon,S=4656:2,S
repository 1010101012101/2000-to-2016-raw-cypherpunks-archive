There are also existantial forgeries.

Ie choose random x, compute y = x^e mod n, now x looks like a
signature on y because y^d = x mod n; and when he verifies the
verifier will just do x^e and see that it is equal to y.

These may also look like valid coins to this code!

It's missing a step: the coin should have some structure.  So it can't
be a hash of a message chosen by the user but hashed by the signer
(the normal practical RSA signature) because the server can't see that
it or it would be linkable.

What digicash did I think is something like c = [x||h(x)].  Then you
can reject existential forgeries and unblinded coins because they
won't have the right form.

(If you look back to the post where I gave a summary of the math,
you'll see I included that step.)
