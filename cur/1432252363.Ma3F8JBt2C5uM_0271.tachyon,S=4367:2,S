Suspect? Gee, what gave me away? The A team. UNMASKED!

The B team. Slides in behind the A team....

Think they sent us to come put a stop to all the subversive code being
written in here?

Yes, it's true, we waited until 2001 to infiltrate your "email list" with
Jezebel Women and compromise your leaders. Our mission? To secure positions
of power and influence to prepare for the coming of "crypto-anarchy." Ah,
but we didn't count on the highly-developed counterintelligence skillset of
cypherpunk list members, much less the CPUNKOPSEC team led by An Metat. That
blew us up. You win. We give up.

If you let us go, we'll give you back your biometrics (we've got them all,
including keystroke dynamics - no, we don't need a keylogger), language
identifiers and friendship trees. We'll also release our hostages, and give
you the antidotes to our love potions -- but only in exchange for Choate.

We want to express our appreciation for the intelligence, and the ideas,
that you have provided the U.S. Government with over the years. This list
has been one of our most successful ops.

However, we discovered the list is no longer an asset. You stopped writing
code and turned into a bitch-tank full of bomb-talk and bimbo-bashing.
(We're da guvmint, we know how to make bombs, bitch and bimbo better than
you do.) You're not giving us good ideas. It's all "well-trod ground," you
see? Everything we need is in the archives. So, sadly, we must part ways,
pending certain "administrative paperwork."

PS: Listen to the remailer guy. He's here to help.
