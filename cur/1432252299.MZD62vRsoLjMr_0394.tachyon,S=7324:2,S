 That article is bullshit, Rob. Yes, Clinton's NSA spied on US
 citizens, but they got FISA approval when they did it. I would agree
 that FISC would approve spying on a dead goat on the basis of a white
 house lawyer claiming the goat was a foreign agent, but that's beside
 the point -- to my knowledge, they obeyed the law, as odious as the
 law was. Therefore, I'm not forwarding.
