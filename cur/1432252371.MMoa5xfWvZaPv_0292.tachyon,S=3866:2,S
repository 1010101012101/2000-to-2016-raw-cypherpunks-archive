Not a problem -- as long as what you're making available to the 
public at DefCon is not a program that script kiddies can download 
and use to break stuff.

Oh, yeah, feature them suing you for libel, and then watching aghast 
as you enter "exhibit A" -- the source code -- into the trial and the 
public record.  If it successfully decrypts their stuff, it proves that 
what you said is true.  It also goes all over the internet within 
about twenty minutes.  

Bear in mind that these people are not dealing from a position of 
strength, as long as their crypto is actually broken.  The only 
evidence you need is precisely the evidence they don't want on the 
public record.  And if it's produced for the first time in your 
own defense, in a court of law, I don't think they can press 
criminal charges on you for producing it.
