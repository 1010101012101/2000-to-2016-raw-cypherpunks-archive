I choose my words for my own amusement. You got the other neophytes riled
up - they're not sure how to respond to chaotic disclosure, they want to
know; "what does it all mean". The old guard grumbles, SSDD.

I don't think you're COINTELPRO/JTRIG Mike. It does amuse me, however, how
quick everyone is to defend/attack on a non-event, spitting someone out of
this community would be pretty easy, should the powers be deem it important
enough.

&gt;<br>

&gt; found those logs?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I almost can&#39;t imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewh=
ere,<br>
&gt; and I can&#39;t imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can&#39;=
t<br>
&gt; imagine how Cryptome archives would have included anything from<br>
&gt; /var/log/, even after system restore from backups.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &lt;--SNIP--&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Should access logs be kept for that long? Absolutely not. From wh=
at<br>
&gt; &gt; I&gt; have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log fi=
les<br>
&gt; &gt; were&gt; included in a NetSol total restore. My guess is that<br>
&gt; &gt; John/Cryptome did&gt; not intentionally keep these files, and did=
 not<br>
&gt; &gt; realize these files were&gt; included in the archive.<br>
&gt; But that&#39;s the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how<=
br>
&gt; would the &quot;NetSol total restore&quot; have changed that?<br>
<br>
Not necessarily...<br>
<br>
Logs in /var/log is where they should be by default, but if the box is<br>
on a shared hosting account, then things are completely different. For<br>
instance, Bluehost charges $3.95/month, which gets you a home directory<br>
on a box shared with hundreds of other users. In your home directory,<br>
you get something like (from memory, which was a long, long time ago):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 ~/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/html/<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/access_log<br>
=C2=A0 ~/public_www/error_log<br>
<br>
So as you can see, the user does have permissions to access logs, but<br>
are kept in the user&#39;s _home_ directory. Now you can see why this could=
<br>
have mistakenly been distributed:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 tar zcf cryptome-backup.tar.gz ~/<br>
<br>
The backup would have also slurped in all the logs. There was no malice,<br=

just an easy mistake that everyone here could have make given the same<br>
circumstances.<br>

It&#39;s simple.<br>
Someone made a mistake. Best was initially assumed full of shit by JYA, as<=
br>
he&#39;s a neophyte - and is consistently &#39;off-message&#39; for this li=
st.<br>
<br>
Others, wishing to read more into it, other than face value of hubris, see<=
br>
plans within plans.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, Bests&#39; disclosures amount to nothing of conseque=
nce.<br>
At best he overhyped them, being a neophyte. At worst he&#39;s JTRIGd the l=
ist,<br>
hilariously easily. The technical cognoscenti on the list stay quiet, &quot=
;code<br>
compiling&quot; as the good doctor says.<br>
<br>
In general, this oversight is valuable because it demonstrates one thing:<b=
r>
Even if you try to delete it.<br>
If there&#39;s a signal it will leak. Purposefully or not.<br>
<br>
When the protocol you use doesn&#39;t provide metadata anonymity, don&#39;t=
 expect<br>
it because you won&#39;t get it. If you don&#39;t understand this - keep st=
udying.<br>
<br>
Why guess at &#39;motivation&#39;? Do we need to FUD yet another leaker sit=
e? Put<br>
your money where your mouth is - improve it, donate, write your own, fix<br=

the bug &amp; plug the hole.<br>

s that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; John/Cryptome did&gt; not intentionally keep these file=
s, and did not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize these files were&gt; included in the archive.<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But that&#39;s the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/=
. And how<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would the &quot;NetSol total restore&quot; have changed that=
?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Not necessarily...<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Logs in /var/log is where they should be by default, but if the b=
ox is<br>
&gt; &gt; on a shared hosting account, then things are completely different=
. For<br>
&gt; &gt; instance, Bluehost charges $3.95/month, which gets you a home dir=
ectory<br>
&gt; &gt; on a box shared with hundreds of other users. In your home direct=
ory,<br>
&gt; &gt; you get something like (from memory, which was a long, long time =
ago):<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0~/<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0~/public_www/<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0~/public_www/html/<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0~/public_www/access_log<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0~/public_www/error_log<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; So as you can see, the user does have permissions to access logs,=
 but<br>
&gt; &gt; are kept in the user&#39;s _home_ directory. Now you can see why =
this could<br>
&gt; &gt; have mistakenly been distributed:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0tar zcf cryptome-backup.tar.gz ~/<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The backup would have also slurped in all the logs. There was no =
malice,<br>
&gt; &gt; just an easy mistake that everyone here could have make given the=
 same<br>
&gt; &gt; circumstances.<br>
