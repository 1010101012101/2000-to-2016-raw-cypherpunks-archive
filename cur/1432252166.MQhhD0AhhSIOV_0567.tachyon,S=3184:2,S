Cynically, I'm not the slightest bit suprised that the police
are exempted: 'safety for the government, not for the people'.

A 1% false negative rate is too high. A 50% false positive rate is
*much* too high.

If it's combined with a rule to ban the transfer and/or
ownership of 'dumb' (ie, reliable) guns, then it's also
a backdoor gun confiscation policy.

I'm afraid that they may get away with it. Here in MA, the
only handguns which can legally be bought new are those on a
fairly short list compiled by the State Attorney General which
meet his arbitrary 'safety standards'. If I wanted, say, a
Pardini (a very expensive special purpose .22short target
pistol) I'm SOL. In fact, it's almost impossible for MA
residents to participate in some of the shooting sports
competitively, due to the AG's list.
