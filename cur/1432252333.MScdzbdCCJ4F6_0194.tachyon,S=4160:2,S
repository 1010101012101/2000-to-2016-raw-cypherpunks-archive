On what grounds? What arguments would you lodge against the eavesdropping
and wiretap sections? Fourth Amendment?

This is not an idle question; I'd actually be interested in pointers to
analysis on the subject. But just as the Supremes have failed to strike
down many unconstitutional laws, I suspect they can find a way to avoid
having to do that (so much jurisprudence is devoted to how striking down
laws by the judiciary should be a measure of last resort).
