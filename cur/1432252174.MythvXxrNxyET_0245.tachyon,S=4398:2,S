Just heard on CNN that the "found" ballot box in the black section of 
Miami, guarded by black cops, may be offset by a "found" box from 
West Palm Beach.

Probable events: Other ethnic interests are scrambling to find their 
own extra votes. And postmasters at military bases in Europe are 
scrambling to postmark some special votes with the magic "November 
7th" date.

Whichever side wins, they will be accused of stealing the election. Hilarious.

I'd laugh, except my life may depend on the outcome. (As much as I 
dislike Bush and most Republicans, it's the Democrats in D.C. and 
Sacramento who are forcing me into either surrenduring my rights or 
shooting it out with them. The Dems are populist fascists and should 
be rounded up and gassed.)
