There are always unusual weather events of some form somewhere.

In the 1950s the North pole melted in summer.  Has not happened in 
recent times.

There are four thousand year old sand dunes on the shores of the arctic 
ocean, indicating that four thousand years ago the arctic regularly 
melted completely for a large part of the summer.

Similarly, the antarctic ice sheet is substantially larger than it was 
when the first explorers mapped it.

When people get excited about unusual melting of artic ice, they ignore 
unusual freezing of antarctic ice.

Cherry picking.

There have been colder years and colder decades before, and warmer years 
and warmer decades before.

There will be colder years and colder decades in future, and warmer 
years and warmer decades in future.

We are no where near as warm as things were during the height of the 
Roman Empire, and nowhere near as cold as things were during the little 
ice age.

Yes, the glaciers in Iceland are retreating - to reveal the ruins of 
farmhouses.
