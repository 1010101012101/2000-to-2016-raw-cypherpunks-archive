One of the reasons for mask laws is *specifically* veiled terrorists -
wearing white spook outfits.  The KKK is fortunately past its heyday,
and the more common police problems when they hold marches are
keeping the crowds from beating them up and unmasking them.
Another reason for such laws may be bank robbers and highwaymen,
but it's mostly the Klan.

I did hear there was a case in Detroit or somewhere about mask laws
being applied to veiled women, but the loophole to go for is the
First Amendment protections on religious freedom.
France, on the other hand, has had public schools ban girls from
wearing head coverings, primarily because they emphasize the
cultural differences.

I read an article a while back about how the black dress outfit
was becoming very common among Egyptian businesswomen.
Not because they were traditionalists, but because the alternative,
at least in Cairo, was that they were expected to dress
fashionably and expensively, even though Egyption salaries
for women haven't caught up with salaries for men,
and the black dress is cheap, often more comfortable, 
and has enough traditional support that nobody can argue.



				Thanks!
