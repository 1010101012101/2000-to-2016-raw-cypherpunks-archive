Hi Declan,

It appears that there is a growing group of "geeks" who are being singled
out as "terrorists".  Although suspected or charged with terror-related
crimes, these folks in many cases were simply in the wrong place at the
wrong time, have quirky hobbies, or showed poor judgement.  Attached is a
list of articles about these individuals and their alledged crimes.
