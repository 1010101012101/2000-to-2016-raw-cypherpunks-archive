Given that a GPS receiver gets ephemeris data, almanach data and
pseudorandom code from each currently visible sat it has probably to do
with the latter. Consider S/A (which may or may not be switched off now, I
haven't checked): if you've got a secret part of the key you can refine
your position despite deliberate degradation (selective availability) than
the party without the key.
