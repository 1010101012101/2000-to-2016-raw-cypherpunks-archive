I realize you big city types (yes, Tim, Corralitos is big compared to my
little burg) have full scale voting booths with curtains (I used the big
mechanical machines when I lived in Manhatten), but out here in the sticks,
the 'voting booth' is a little standing desk affair with 18 inch privacy 
shields on 3 sides. If someone tried to take a photo of their ballot in one
of those it would be instantly obvious. 

All I want is a system which is not more easily screwed around with then
paper ballots. Have some imagination - you could, for example, set things
up so the voter, and only the voter, can see the screen and/or paper receipt
while voting, but still make it impossible to use a camera without being
detected.
