This is from a bill that both the House and Senate passed (yesterday):

Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a 
person...by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process,
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

I can imagine some abuses of this, in workplace situations or divorce cases...
