Lawyers are merely implementing what the *legislators* let them.
The legislators are the ones deserving of the jumpercables on the
genitals,
though perhaps though the lawyers could be required to do the honors.
Since lawyers decay into legislators, this would have beneficial
prophylactic educational effects.

No Thomas, a market will find better uses for them if your arguments
have merit.  (Which they do, but it takes time.)  It is, after all,
the right of any individual (or group thereof) to keep secrets.
(And Thomas, I wouldn't argue against that *here* :-)
Or bind others with consensual contracts like NDAs.
Much as it is the right of anyone to diddle with anything they own,
and talk about it freely.

The nice thing about jumpercables is the longer you use them,
the lesser the ohmic resistance of the legislator, until you
get charring, at which point you can move on to the next deserving
most honorable sir.
