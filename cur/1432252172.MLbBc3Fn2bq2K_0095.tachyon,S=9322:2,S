fuck them dead > thats a good one @mtaibbi said the press pools he has been
in taught him one major thing journalists are bred to be stupid - he was
astonished at their stupidity level but now he is at the intercept crap
so.. stupidity rules and all hail to capitalistic fuck alls

but i have to disagree with you re the story in terms of the personal
analysis re content - they do get into the tech not perfectly but... trying
to figure out why someone would want to remain anonymous in this society of
star fuckers into infinity is part of the story of bitcoin and there were
forensic analysts working on the story

the cia connection is interesting when cia mentioned > he is gone - out
totally out
