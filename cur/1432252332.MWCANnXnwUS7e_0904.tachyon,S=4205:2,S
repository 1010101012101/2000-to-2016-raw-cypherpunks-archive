Had Condit been an unemployed chemist living with his parents in 
Vancouver, Washington, his house would have been raided by ninjas and 
his house tossed.


But Condit is not that shlub. Instead, 10 weeks after being the 
obvious suspect in a missing person case (*), Condit has had plenty 
of time to sanitize his place. And to let time cause the trail to go 
cold.

(* Most missing persons cases involving adults are cases where the 
adult has vanished because he or she does not want to be found. Or 
because they took off to Atlantic City without telling others. This 
case is quite different. Chandra Levy is almost certainly rotting in 
a grave out past Winchester. Whether Condit did it, or his angry wife 
did it, or he hired a hitter to do it is unclear at this time, but 
the "hands off" treatment he has gotten is in shocking contrast to 
the dawn raids delivered to Bell. And so it goes.)
