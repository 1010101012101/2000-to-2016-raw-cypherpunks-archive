When the government announced last month that a top-secret spy satellite 
would, in the next few months, come falling out of the sky, American 
officials said there was little risk to people because satellites fall 
out of orbit fairly frequently and much of the planet is covered by oceans.

But they said precious little about the satellite itself.

Such information came instead from Ted Molczan, a hobbyist who tracks 
satellites from his apartment balcony in Toronto, and fellow satellite 
spotters around the world. They have grudgingly become accustomed to 
being seen as bpropeller-headed geeksb who bpoke their finger in the 
eyeb of the governmentbs satellite spymasters, Mr. Molczan said, taking 
no offense. bI have a sense of humor,b he said.

Mr. Molczan, a private energy conservation consultant, is the best known 
of the satellite spotters who, needing little more than a pair of 
binoculars, a stop watch and star charts, uncover some of the deepest of 
the governmentbs expensive secrets and share them on the Internet.
