  CALL FOR PAPERS: WCAN '07 (3rd Workshop on Cryptography for Ad hoc Networks)

  A Satellite Workshop of the 34th International Colloquium on Automata,
  Languages and Programming (ICALP 2007)

  Date: July 8th, 2007
  Location: Wroclaw, Poland


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Workshop Theme and Motivations:
  Wireless ad hoc networks are today receiving much attention for military,
  commercial
  and civilian applications, thus becoming a challenging area in security
  research.
  The security research community has mainly focused on securing routing and
  is only
  recently widening its scope of analysis. The cryptography research
  community has mainly
  focused on abstract models of networks like the Internet; however,
  cryptographic protocols
  for the Internet face serious challenges to be adapted to the ad-hoc,
  partial-connectivity,
  mobile, resource-constrained and infrastructureless nature of ad-hoc
networks.
  The aim of this workshop is to help bridging this gap, towards a more
  comprehensive
  investigation of security and cryptographic tools, analysis and modeling
  methodologies
  over ad hoc networks, by bringing together the cryptography, network
security,
  and wireless networking communities.

  We seek submissions containing original research on all aspects of
  cryptology that
  are motivated by their applicability to ad hoc networks, including
  wireless, cellular,
  sensor, mesh, peer-to-peer, vehicular and RFID-based networks. Short
  surveys of related
  sub-areas are also encouraged. The following is a non-exhaustive list of
  topics that are
  of interest to this workshop, when clearly motivated by and clearly
  focusing on ad hoc networks
  (cryptology papers not focusing on or not describing applications to ad hoc
  networks
  do not fit in the workshop interest area):

  Modeling of cryptographic tasks
  Solutions to cryptographic tasks under party mobility
  Solutions to cryptographic tasks under resource constraints
  Secure routing
  Bootstrapping of security associations
  Distributed public-key infrastructures
  Key-agreement, key-management and key-(pre)distribution
  Entity authentication
  Trust establishment
  Privacy-enhancing technologies
  Threshold cryptography
  Identity-Based cryptography
  Policy-based cryptography
  Secure multi-party protocols
  Security in distributed algorithms and protocols

  Author Instructions

  Instructions to prepare your submission.

  Submissions can belong to two Paper Categories: Regular papers and Surveys.
  (Please explicitly specify the survey category in the title, for example
  "Survey Paper:
   All Cryptographic Schemes for Ad Hoc Networks".)
  Submissions need to be at most 8-page long in a standard one-column format
  (suggested format: LaTeX, in article style), excluding appendices.
  Submitted papers must be original work that is authorized to be released
  and does not
  substantially duplicate work that has been previously published or is
  currently being refereed
  for publication in another workshop, conference or journal.
  Submission Instructions: go to

https://wcan2007.research.telcordia.com/myreview/index.php?authorsInstructions=1
  and follow the simple instructions in there
  Instructions to prepare your final version:
  Papers accepted to this workshop will be published on the
  Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).
  Authors of accepted papers will need to write their final version in LaTeX,
  using ENTCS style files, and send their latex file as well as all
  necessary files
  for compiling the latex file (including the .pdf file).
  The required length of final versions is at least 10 pages and at most 16
  pages, in ENTCS style.
  For a final version to be included in the workshop proceedings,
  at least one of the authors of the paper must register to the workshop.
