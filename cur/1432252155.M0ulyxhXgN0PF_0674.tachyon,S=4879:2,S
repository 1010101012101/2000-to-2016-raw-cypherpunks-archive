Right. And if the bookstore owner had to pay a few $K for the court
costs and the other store's legal costs, in addition to his own legal
expenses he'd be unlikely to file the claim in the first place unless he
really felt he had a good case.

The current American system is abused because there's almost no
incentive _not_ to file frivolous claims. You get a lawyer to work on
spec, pony up a small filing fee, and you can tie up the court for a few
hours and cost your opponent a few thousand dollars.

No argument there.

You ignored the question I asked: If one party to a contract breaks it,
what is the other party to do? Breaking a contract is not normally a
crime, so it sounds like you would have the second party have to simply
put up with the broken contract.
