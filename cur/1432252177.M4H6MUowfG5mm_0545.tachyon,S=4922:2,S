  Accommodations

  IFCA has made arrangements for discounted rooms for conference and workshop
  attendees. The discounted rates are valid until the cutoff date of January
  8, 2007, and attendees are strongly encouraged to reserve a room by this
  date. On the cutoff date any rooms in the block that have not been booked
  definitively will be be released for sale to other customers, and the group
  rates will no longer be available.

  To reserve a room, contact the hotel directly and specify that you are
  attending the "Financial Cryptography" or "FC07" or "IFCA" conference to
  get the special rates. Reservations by email are preferred (to reduce the
  chance of spelling errors), but you may want to follow up an initial email
  reservation by phone or fax rather than send your credit card information
  by email. Please do not assume that your reservation has been accepted
  until you receive a confirmation from the hotel!

  All rates listed are inclusive tax and service charges and are for single
  or double occupancy.

  	*	Hilton Tobago Resort

  	*	rate: $222/night (superior), $249 (deluxe)

  	*	advance purchase rate: $175/night (run of house)

  	*	tel: +1 (868) 660-8500

  	*	fax: +1 (868) 660-8503

  	*	email: reservations.tobago@hilton.com

  	*	http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=TABHIHI

  The superior and deluxe rooms at the Hilton differ in location/view but are
  otherwise the same. The advance purchase rate also includes broadband
  internet in the room (normally an extra $15/night). To get the advance
  purchase rate, the entire stay must be paid by the cutoff date and the
  payment is non-refundable, so for attendees who make use of this option
  travel insurance with cancellation coverage is recommended.

  	*	Tobago Plantations

  	*	rate: $150/night (condominium style)

  	*	tel: +1 (868) 631-1054

  	*	fax: +1 (868) 639-9801

  	*	email: rentals@tobagoplantations.com

  	*	http://www.tobagoplantations.com/

  On the same grounds as the Hilton, the Tobago Plantations rooms are about a
  15 minute walk away. This is not a hotel but a collection of individually
  owned units whose owners have placed them in a rental program. The rooms
  blocked for the conference resemble (nice) hotel rooms, and each small
  group of rooms shares a swimming pool, but many hotel services are not
  available. Reservations are made through the sales/rentals office, which is
  open only during business hours (M-F 8:00-16:30, GMT-4); email is
  preferred. Note that these rooms are not available for very short-term
  (one- or two-night) stays and are thus probably not suitable for persons
  attending only the workshop.
