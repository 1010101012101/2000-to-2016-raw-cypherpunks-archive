Yes, this was my assertion.  However, my assertion was accompanied by
my stating that I really don't feel too sorry for the rich-ass
Insurance Co. CEO.  If his losing a small percentage of his millions
causes him to be as unhappy as a poor person dying slowly of cancer,
than I guess you have an argument.  Yes, you could say that "happiness
is subjective," and you would be right.  However, I was stating "right
to be happy" as a generalization, not as something concrete.
