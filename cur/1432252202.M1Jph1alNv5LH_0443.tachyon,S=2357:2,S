Sigh,

 seems every crop of new cypherpunks has to learn this lesson.


Folks,
     Please DONT FEED the trolls here on cypherpunks.. dont repeat their subject lines
dont respond to them, ignore them and killfile them if possible so you are not tempted 
to respond to them. 

Trust me its like wrestling with a pig in shit. after a while you 
notice the pig is enjoying him/herself.

Anything you tell a troll will be used as more fuel for the fire.. trust me I have seen
this many times!
