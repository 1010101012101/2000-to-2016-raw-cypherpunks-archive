White House, spy agencies deny NSA exploited 'Heartbleed' bug=A0=0AphotoSec=

ve\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. intelligence agencies sa=
id on Friday neither the National Security Agency nor any other part of the=
 government were aware before this month of the "Heartbleed" bug, denying a=
 report that the spy agency exploited the glitch in widely used Web encrypt=
ion technology to gather intelligence.=0AThe White House, the NSA and the O=
ffice of the Director of National Intelligence issued statements after Bloo=
mberg reported that the NSA was aware of the bug for at least two years and=
 exploited it in order to obtain passwords and other basic information used=
 in hacking operations. The Bloomberg report cited two unnamed sources it s=
aid were familiar with the matter.=0AThe Heartbleed bug is considered one o=
f the most serious Internet security flaws to be uncovered in recent years.=

so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong," White Hous=
e National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.=

 an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet," Hayden added.=0ABlo=
omberg was not immediately available to comment.=0AThe discovery of Heartbl=
eed by researchers with Google Inc and a small security firm, Codenomicon, =
prompted the U.S. Homeland Security Department to advise businesses on Tues=
day to review their servers to see if they were using vulnerable versions o=

nies, including Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. The bug, disclosed =
Monday, allows hackers to steal data without a trace.=0ANSA spokeswoman Van=

dentified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability,=
 until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report."=0AHayd=
en said the federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of =
users of government websites and other online services. "If the federal gov=
ernment, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerab=
ility prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community res=
ponsible for OpenSSL," Hayden added.=0AHayden said that when U.S. agencies =
discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open-source software, "it is=
 in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather =
than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose." Such vulnera=
bilities are known as "zero-day" flaws because the software developers have=
 had zero days to fix them.=0AIn December, a five-member advisory panel con=

crutiny since former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked numerous docum=
ents exposing expansive U.S. surveillance efforts.=0AEven before Snowden's =
emergence, former officials, including Clarke, told Reuters that offensive =
and spying considerations had dominated inside the NSA, causing it to withh=
old information instead of warning the public about new flaws.=0AClarke tol=
