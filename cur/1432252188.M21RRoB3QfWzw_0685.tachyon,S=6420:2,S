Thank you for contacting me via electronic mail.  I welcome the thoughts,
comments and feedback from the concerned citizens of Michigan's 16th
Congressional District.  If you reside in my Congressional District, you
will receive a written response from me shortly.  If you live outside the
16th District, I will do my best to forward your concern to your
Congressional Representative.

********Important System Upgrade Notice*********

As of November 30, 2001, this e-mail address (Public.Dingell@mail.house.gov)

comments on a timelier basis.  Of course, you may always contact me through
the mail at:
