I would have thought it obvious that I was talking about laptops,
where people (even Fox Muldur per a recent X Files episode) actually
do that tape thing.  Everyone knows that a phone has a built in
microphone, nobody forgets that.  Portable workstation computers?  Not
so much, except those who do use them routinely for teleconferencing.
 Hence the comic aspect of tape over the lens with a live microphone
ignored.

If one is concerned about being tracked during a specific time frame
via a "smart" phone, the solutions include:  Leave it home, ask a
friend to take it on a trip with them, or pull the battery.  Which to
use depends on the cause of that concern and other unique parameters.

Since user surveillance, tracking and profiling is commercially
valuable to the vendors of IOT gadgetry, software solutions will be
placebos, or at best an arms race with the vast majority of end users
on the loser's bench for the duration.

Fact of the matter is, the most practical and reliable means of
addressing privacy concerns related to the "internet of things" is at
the gross hardware level DIY level, by disabling sensor and/or comms
components where and as the user deems this a good trade off.
