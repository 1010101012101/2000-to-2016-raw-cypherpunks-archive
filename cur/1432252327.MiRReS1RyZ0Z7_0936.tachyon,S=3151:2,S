On the other hand, the technology of disguise and the public taste for
radical body modification and active clothing all suggest that many of us
will soon be denying a useful image to the opposition.  Then we won't have

Genetic sniffers, however can probably be defeated by devices that give
off clouds of genetically random human biological material.

Offense and defense back and forth forever.
