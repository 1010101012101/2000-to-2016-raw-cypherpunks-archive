If you haven't read it before, someone kindly posted Stealing The Network
series of novels online as a PDF.

"Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box is a unique book in the fiction
department. It combines stories that are false, with technology that is
real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they
could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but
I say it does something else; it provides a glimpse into the creative minds
of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you
that the game is a mental one." - from the foreword by Jeff Moss, President
& CEO, BlackHat, Inc.

*Stealing the Network* is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short
stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and
information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to
have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are
not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the
black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures
arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always
lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every
pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature
film.

One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well
short of cyberpunk classics like *Burning Chrome
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060539828/$%7B0%7D>* and *Snow
Crash <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380958/$%7B0%7D>*. Its
value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers,
OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes
and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps).
The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems
(or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network).
Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to
these stories of packetized adventure. *--David Wall*


The stories of the Stealing the Network series entertain in the same way
that "war stories" from fellow hackers and security professionals often
keeps a more intimate audience's interest: by mixing intriguing situations
with juicy technical detail that can serve as a useful take-away. No one
will accuse these books of containing fine literature, but that's not
really the point. The stories are well written enough to keep you wanting
to know what will happen next, while the technical information is as
accurate as you're likely to see in fiction. Segments involving hacking are
written and illustrated with enough attention to detail and length to serve
as introductory educational tutorials for the topics (including web
application hacking, reverse engineering, and wireless security). Most of
these scenarios are believable as parts of larger-scale operations. --McGrew
