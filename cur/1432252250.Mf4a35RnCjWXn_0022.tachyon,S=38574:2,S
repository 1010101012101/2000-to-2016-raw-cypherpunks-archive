When architecting a system, it is critical that the operator of the =
system should not have access to the keys at all. You can't be compelled =
to produce something that you don't have. It is not hard to do if it is =
part of your initial design.

Backup providers like SpiderOak seem to be doing this right. I have =
designed a number of systems with this type of security design.=20
Rule #1 don't store clear text.
Rule #2 don't store decryption keys
Rule #3 don't do decryption on the server
Rule #4 treat all communications with people not implementing security =
on THEIR computers as insecure

Email security for systems designed to work with outsiders who don't use =
the tool are particularly problematic. The operator can use public keys =
to encrypt traffic as it arrives, but can easily be compelled to reveal =
the arriving clear text messages before encryption.

Is it the SSL certificate for the SMTP TLS that was being requested? It =
appears so from the transcripts. If that is the case, they are asking to =
access content that was stored in the clear on the previous mail =
server(s). This is hardly highly secured content. The HTTPS sessions =
might reasonably be considered more sensitive and secure.
