This is a generic email to a list of relatives, friends and people whose
names I found at Martin's house or on his computer.  I am Martin's brother,
Bob.  Martin died suddenly Thursday from arteriosclerotic heart disease.  The
family has decided to have Martin buried close to other family members in LA.
 Funeral services will be Thursday at 12:00 PM at Hillside Memorial Park and
Mortuary, 6001 Centinela Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90045, (310) 641-0707 (near the
405 Freeway and Sepulveda Blvd., 10 minutes from LA Airport).  Immediately
following services, there will be a a gathering in my home, in Martin's
memory. My home is approximately an hour from the cemetery.  Directions will
be provided.  Please feel free to contact me for any reason at (714) 281-0403
or by email at robtminow@aol.com.  Also, many of Martin's San Francisco area
friends have expressed a desire to have a memorial service in the Bay area.
This is expected to be planned sometime in the future.  In lieu of flowers,
donations may be sent to the American Heart Association, the American Cancer
Society, any Hospice Foundation of your choice (I am involved with the Cancer
Support Foundation of Los Alamitos, California), Toys for Tots or any other
group of your choice.  I look forward to meeting many of you.  I'm sending
this out email as this is how my brother would have liked it.  Thanks to all
who have communicated their thoughts via the phone or email.
With kind thoughts,
Bob Minow
1071 S. Taylor Court
Anaheim, CA 9808
