Everyone knows, but no one is allowed to publicly say, that these 
shutdowns are not in anticipation of a warrant demanding all information 
about all their users regardless of probable cause, but that they 
received a warrant demanding all information about all their users 
regardless of probable cause, and are forbidden to say that they 
received such a warrant, and forbidden to contest such a warrant in court.

(yes, it is unconstitutional, but so is the "voluntary" income tax. 
Just try not volunteering.)

The government, aware of this, does not demand their records, but a live 
connection transmitting everything they do to the government as it happens.

And if they don't supply the live connection they go to jail, and if 
they say out loud under their own identities in public that this was the 
deal they go to jail - one of the ever broader exceptions to freedom of 
speech that the supreme court is just fine with.
