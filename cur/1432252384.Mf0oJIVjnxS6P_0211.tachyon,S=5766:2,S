The solution to European worries over Echelon is
(wait for it!) more spies!

This would be another step down the road towards
a new bipolar world, with UKUSA vs the Continentals
(the UK, for the moment, has an uncomfortable
foot in both camps).

Note that one of this article's base assumptions
is that Echelon is primarily used for economic
espionage. It would be interesting to
find European takes on this issue.

EU-Spy     /WRD/
  MP announces plans for a European intelligence service
Berlin, July 5, IRNA -- The European Union plans to create a European
intelligence service, in an effort to counter the American economic
espionage program 'Echelon', a deputy of the European Parliament was
quoted saying Thursday in the German daily junge Welt.
   The German member of the European Parliament, Ilka Schroeder of
the Green Party, referred to the latest report by the espionage
committee, calling for the formation of a European intelligence
service to protect European industries against US espionage.
   "It's hypocritical for the parliament to criticize the US Echelon
surveillance techniques, while there are plans in work to promote
a European secret service," Schroeder blasted the latest initiative.
   A recent report by a European parliamentary committee confirmed the
existence of a controversial worldwide espionage network 'Echelon'
which has caused between Dlrs 13 and 145 billion in financial
damages to European companies.
   The study, presenting evidence that intelligence services from
the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain are part
of 'Echelon', called on European firms to guard themselves from this
ultra-modern form of economic espionage.
   The United States had in the past repeatedly denied the existence
of 'Echelon' which is reportedly capable of eavesdropping on every
single telephone call, radio transmission, fax or e-mail message
around the world.
   US officials had refused to meet with a visiting European
parliamentary delegation a few weeks ago, wanting information on
'Echelon'.
   A member of the EU parliamentary committee, Gerhard Schmid said the
evidence, consisting of photos, statements by intelligence officials
working on the project and the results of internet research-proved
conclusively and without a doubt that this was in fact the case.
   "Companies outside Europe getting hold of this information might
gain huge advantages," Schmid added.
   The study suggested advanced coding techniques for companies when
transmitting confidential messages.
    Schmid also referred to the close cooperation between the
intelligence services of the US and EU member Great Britain, saying it
might have serious repercussions for the EU's common foreign and
security policies if the issue was not discussed.
   The worldwide espionage installations of 'Echelon', were created
in 1947 and initially used for military purposes.
