Well,

Depending on your particular bent options range from:
Subversion, Evasion, Opposition, Resistance or Appeal to Authorities, such
as teachers, law enforcement and so on.

Arguments abound, and are largely the fodder of flame-bait and trollery.
[Which is the source of my earlier comment, "accepting paternalism during
youth is the slippery slope to paternalism from the state" - this is a
popular opinion on this list, I'm sure, as are the gamut of opposing
viewpoints.]

This topic is ridiculous, there is no difference between hiding from 'your
parents' and hiding from a nation-state attacker, in both scenarios you
assume all of your equipment is untrustworthy, you have the advantage with
'your parents' because you know who they are, where they live, where they
sleep and have physical access to all their devices.

Unfortunately it is not trivial to hide from either attacker, depending on
their abilities. Some degree of technical savvy is still required.

Any constructive exercise might want to start with Threat Intelligence,
thankfully this is fairly easy if you live in the same abode as your
attacker, no?

If your attacker has no goals or motivations, and carries out no attacks
then there is very little you need to do, except, perhaps, clear your
browser history.

-Travis
