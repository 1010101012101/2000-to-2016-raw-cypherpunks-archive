Currently BGP is "secured" by
1. accepting BGP info only from known router IPs
2. ISPs not propogating BGP from the edge inwards

Its a serious vulnerability (as in, take down the net),
equivalent to the ability to confuse the post office
machinery that sorts postcards.  All you need to
do is subvert some trusted routers.
