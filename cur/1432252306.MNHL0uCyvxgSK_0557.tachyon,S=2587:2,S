I have a few friends like this....anyone have suggestions for ways to change
their minds?

Basically they say things like "If you think the government can't break all
the encryption schemes that we have, you're nuts."  This guy was a math major
too, so he understands the principles of crypto.

I feel pretty confident that 2048 bit encryption is reasonably safe for now,
but how can I convince others, and how safe should I really feel in that
opinion anyway?
