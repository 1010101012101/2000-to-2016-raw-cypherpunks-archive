There are amazing technical things you can do *if* you can get
every node to cooperate (and spend power and compute time).

You could drop military sensors that talked to each other and route
info back to the closer edge of the area you monitor.

You could probably do neat things, in some circumstances, with cell phones
if your cell phone
could route or relay others' calls.

In the old Fidonet/uucp world this is just adding an RF i/f.  Or
packet-switched radio? In today's world you'd have to have ISPs that let
you do this if you routed others' packets 
through them.

And of course, Gnutella/Process Tree/etc...
