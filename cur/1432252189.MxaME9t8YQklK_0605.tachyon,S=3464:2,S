What law?

Actually if you go look at the bottem of that news piece you'll find a
direct reference to CALEA (which I might add says nothing about log
retention for 'commen carrier' or otherwise).

I'd still like somebody to explain what law was in reference with respect
to requiring log retention for any period, irrespective of how old the law
is.

Note, this has NOTHING to do with a court order or request from a LEA and
at no point in that article was that claimed.
