sounds great :) well, about frameworks I've tried really a lot of them over
years and I was satisfied only with FuelPHP <http://fuelphp.com/> which I
think is the best one IMO, but I haven't heard about Laravel, seems to be
really new. About FuelPHP I really like idea of HMVC and it's very useful.
But as I said I haven't done anything with PHP for few years now. But
generally you've to choose framework when starting a project as it's
usually not easy to change it later. Yeah I forgot to mention that it's
really good that you're using Composer and have good object orientated code
structure.

About internationalization it depends which parts you want to cover. If
translated strings then look at transifex.com <http://www.transifex.com>
and crowdin.net they both offer free solutions to open source projects and
are quite good. If you want localized date and time formats then use CLDR
<http://cldr.unicode.org/> you can either write a script to directly get
data from them or use some already made libraries for PHP, I don't know for
PHP, but for Ruby there's ruby-cldr <https://github.com/svenfuchs/ruby-cldr=
>
and twitter-cldr-rb <https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-rb>, for
example ruby-cldr can export CLDR data to yaml files and then you could
parse and use those in PHP. (twitter-cldr also uses that same exported data
from ruby-cldr)

<div>Hi everyone,</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m working on the Movim pro=
ject since 2008, our aim is to create a full social network on top of the X=
MPP protocol. As I see again, the guys of the Tox project are trying to rei=
nvent the wheel=E2=80=A6 again. Now, to do IM, we have Skype, BBM, Line, Wh=
atsApp, MSN, QQ, AIM, ICQ, IRC, XMPP, Facebook Messenger=E2=80=A6</div>

<div><br></div><div>Same for the social networks as Davis said (PumpIO, Ten=
tIO=E2=80=A6)</div><div><br></div><div>I really think that we need to focus=
 on an existent standard and improve it, and for me XMPP seem to be the per=
fect protocol for all theses things :</div>

<div>- Standard IM + chatroom</div><div>- Video/Audio conferencing (with Ji=
ngle, we are using it with WebRTC on Movim)</div><div>- Pubsub (for newsfee=
ds, blogging)</div><div>- Geolocation</div><div>- Vcard4 support</div>
<div>
- SASL2 authentication</div><div>- OTR support</div><div>- Full encryption =
between the servers (<a href=3D"https://xmpp.net/list.php" target=3D"_blank=
">https://xmpp.net/list.php</a>)</div><div>- and so on=E2=80=A6</div><div><=
br></div>

<div>XMPP can do a lot more than just IM, it&#39;s a full social-communicat=
ion protocol it just need to be implemented, tested and debugged :)</div><d=

<div>&gt; hmm, I wonder are there any such open protocol specification crea=
ted? I<br>
&gt; know about XMPP, but nothing more...<br>
<br>
</div>Well, there&#39;s the Diaspora protocol:<br>
<a href=3D"https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol_overview=
" target=3D"_blank">https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol=
_overview</a><br>
<br>
And... StatusNet/OStatus, PumpIO, TentIO, ActivityStreams, BuddyCloud (XMPP=
-<br>
based, I guess), and quite a few others I don&#39;t really remember. Some o=
f them<br>
are related, all are incompatible. And all the devs are showing strong<br>
symptoms of the NIH syndrome.<br>
<br>
Which is absurd.<br>
<span><font color=3D"#888888"><br>

one have solved it yet... for social=20
network or basically any IM/chat/etc to be usable it must have majority=20
of people (eg. your friends) users there, otherwise without people they=20
are totally useless so currently we&#39;re stuck with no-so-great=20
applications/protocols only because everyone already are on them like=20
Facebook and Skype. On that mailing list there were discussion about a<span=

 could support all networks so users wouldn&#39;t be forced to migrate whic=

 I think is essential because a lot of people won&#39;t bother. There was=

mention to</span> <a href=3D"http://sockethub.org/" target=3D"_blank">Socke=
thub </a>which seems quite cool, only for a bit different use case I would =
say.<br>Another thing I would like to mention is <a href=3D"http://bitlbee.=
org" target=3D"_blank">BitlBee</a>
 it is a gateway between various IM/chat networks and IRC so you can=20
chat with friends on Facebook using your favorite IRC client, or post a=20
tweet on your Twitter and use various other protocols. It even supports=20
OTR.</span><br><br></div></div></div>
</blockquote></div></div></blockquote></div>okay so I&#39;ve quickly review=
ed Movim, idea is really good and it seems to
 be nice, but I haven&#39;t yet tried to run it, will do that someday. It=
=20
looks like you haven&#39;t really marketed it good enough because this is=
=20
first time I hear about it despite it being an somewhat old project. For
 example Tox is pretty new but it&#39;s already quite popular and I keep=20
hearing about it every few months. I would suggest to post more on=20
various social sites, forums and just let people know it exists (eg. post t=
o Reddit) Another thing I would suggest is add a video to=20
website of example usage so people could see how it is actually used, expla=
in various features and such as users might not immediately discover some f=
eatures.<br><br>Now I&#39;ll tell a few things, but that&#39;s only my pers=
onal opinion and=20
most likely a lot of people won&#39;t agree with it. So anyway firstly I&#3=
9;m=20
not a fan of PHP, it&#39;s just generally awful language (see <a href=3D"ht=
tp://phpsadness.com/" target=3D"_blank">http://phpsadness.com/</a>
 and look at PHP src :D), I know it because I&#39;ve been writing it for=20
like 7+ years but now 2-3 years I&#39;m PHP-less and happy about it :)=20
Next it looks like you aren&#39;t using any PHP framework but self-develope=
d
 one which gives you more work than is needed and obviously it&#39;s less b=
attletested. But overall code itself is nice and pretty, correctly uses MVC=
 pattern. Bad things are that you don&#39;t have separate public directory =
for frontend and anyone can access PHP files directly, view templates for e=
xample (<a href=3D"https://pod.movim.eu/app/views/admin.tpl" target=3D"_bla=
nk">https://pod.movim.eu/app/views/admin.tpl</a>) it&#39;s not a big deal, =
but still not good idea (running version <a href=3D"https://pod.movim.eu/VE=
RSION" target=3D"_blank">https://pod.movim.eu/VERSION</a>). Then in some pl=
aces HTML tags and entities are used directly rather than proper Unicode wh=
ich isn&#39;t a good idea and it means that string isn&#39;t later escaped =
and if it gets mixed together with user-input or translation strings there&=
#39;s a place for XSS. The worse thing probably is that sanitization is bas=
ed on regexp blacklists/filters, I&#39;m talking about <span><span>StringHe=
lper.php, I didn&#39;t look how it&#39;s actually used, but still even w</s=
pan></span>ithout trying I&#39;m pretty sure it would be possible to find X=
SS there, why? because Rails framework over 5 years have had ~20 XSS vulner=
abilities and it&#39;s extremely good framework used by dozens of projects =
and reviewed regularly, and it&#39;s even based on whitelists, but still us=
es regexps for that which isn&#39;t good and I wonder why no one does prope=
r SGML parsing which they should. Just take a look at <a href=3D"https://gi=
thub.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionview/lib/action_view/vendor/html-sca=
nner/html/sanitizer.rb#L72" target=3D"_blank">sanitizer.rb</a> to see how n=
on-trivial it is. Anyway the whole idea of sanitization is wrong, you shoul=
d just escape all text and don&#39;t try to guess which tags you should ren=
der. I suggest any web developer to read <a href=3D"https://www.owasp.org" =
target=3D"_blank">OWASP</a> from A to Z it&#39;s a must for any web develop=
er. Then there&#39;s `?&gt;` PHP end tags used at end of various files whic=
h are useless and can introduce problems like famous &quot;headers already =
sent&quot; warning. So seems that&#39;s about it with my quick look, but I =
might have forgotten to mention some things. Another thing I don&#39;t like=
 is that AGPL is used, I really dislike all GPL family, but that&#39;s just=
 me and I rather prefer <a href=3D"http://copyfree.org" target=3D"_blank">c=
opyfree</a> so if there&#39;s similar projects then I&#39;ll rather contrib=
ute to MIT than any GPL variant :P And I&#39;m not a fan of Bazaar nor Laun=
chPad but that&#39;s not the worst thing (someone should ban CVS and SVN :D=
)<br>
