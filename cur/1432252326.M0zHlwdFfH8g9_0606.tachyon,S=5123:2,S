That sounds fast to the non-computer-literate public.  But I expect it was
nothing compared to the (business) market penetration of fax machines in
1985 and 86. That, and the thousands (tens of thousands?) of computer
bulletin-boards during that timeframe showed clearly that people wanted to
communicate using computers, in whatever ways were made available.

Well, I didn't say that it would look as beautiful as it does today, with
fancy graphics and all that,  but a lot of what the internet does today
(email, program transfer, some buying and selling) could still have been
done then, albeit a bit slower.   And it was; the problem is that 99+% of
the population couldn't get it, and certainly not for a reasonable price.
Imagine how many cars Detroit would sell if only 1% of the population had
access to the roads.

Other people have answered, and it sounds to me like the NSF (Insufficient
Funds?) simply kept the Internet bottled up by limiting access to it to
universities and government contractors.  Only when they let go of the
controls did things really take off.   Typical government bureaucracy.
