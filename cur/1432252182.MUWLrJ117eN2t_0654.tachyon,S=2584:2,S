The US made a bundle from WW1 and WW2 warfare, in both
cases being rescued from an economic slump, and some have
argued the US delayed sending troops as long as possible to
extend the demand for supplies, supplies which appeared to
always be insufficient but enough to keep the warring parties
going at it.

To be sure, the US Civil War provided the same beneficence
to its overseas exploiters, not to say domestic entrpreneurs,
not to say hordes of today's reenactors.

Historians have noted that Northern generals in particular 
worked hard to avoid battle while begging for more troops and 
supplies. Shrewd commentators write there could have been 
Southern-general complicity in this paradic churning before it 
got out of hand due to Lincoln demanding action to keep his
comfy future -- kapow! went the prez to his virgins.

It is a truism that power in leaders is enlarged during wartime,
no matter their ideology, so it is a surefire way to boost flagging
support (60 million can be that DUMB). And the more humans 
slaughtered the greater the support as each homeland, praise 
Allah's cloven hooves, and seeks revenge for the loss of its 
prime beef, and if all goes well, the fighting never comes home 
to roost in hilltop mansions, damn those paraplegics who 
won't parade their grotesqueries: axe their meds.

Red poppies, how do they bloom in November, remember Fallujah.
Halls of Montezuma, Shores of Tripoli, yadda.
