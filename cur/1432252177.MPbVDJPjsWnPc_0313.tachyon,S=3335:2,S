In a society that far gone this only raises the stakes of armed
resistance. Fight or flight are both perfectly preferable to 
playing sitting duck, waiting for black vans to pick you up.

As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,
     I've got a little list--I've got a little list
Of society offenders who might well be underground,
     And who never would be missed--who never would be missed!
