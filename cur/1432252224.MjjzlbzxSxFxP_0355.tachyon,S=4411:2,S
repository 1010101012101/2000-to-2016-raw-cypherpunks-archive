All the whining about NSA is just that, whining, by comparison to
where COTS is going.  The COTS folks are surpassing national labs
in the reach of their traffic analysis, they just don't yet have
the command structure.  (They'll get one when they're deputized by
the national labs of whatever country matters.)

Consider AAPL's iBeacon.
