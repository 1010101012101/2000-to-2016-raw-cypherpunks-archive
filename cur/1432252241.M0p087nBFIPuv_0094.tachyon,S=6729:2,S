Other speculation was that it might have been inside a vinyl bumper.

Gordon's testimony was that it was a continuously-transmitting bug.  Which 
of course brought up the question of the power supply.

The bug transmitted on an RF frequency.  Bell had mentioned to friends that 
he believed that he had been bugged, but lacking an RF frequency analyzer,
 he had been unable to find the bug.  He apparently was concerned that both 
his house and car were bugged.  Although why he didn't hire the services 
of a "bug-sweeper" is beyond me.

The power supply was a considerable source of speculation.  If the bug had 
been attached to the battery, then it would have been much more detectable. 
 Stories had it that Bell had checked under the hood; it would not take 
more than a VOM to detect a discharge.

There was no discussion of military bits vs. civilian bits, rather military 
grade vs. civilian grade.

And some degree of skepticism has to be attached to the court testimony. 
 It was painfully clear that the prosecutor had little handle on technical 
issues, and that even the agent who bugged Bell's car had limited knowledge 
of how the device worked.  Some of the descriptions given in court about 
how GPS works were clearly wrong.

If you weren't on the radar before, you are now.

So are you planning on rooming with Jim or C.J.?
