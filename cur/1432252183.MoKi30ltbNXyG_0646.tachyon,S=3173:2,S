There is a book that this is written in about called "Deep Time" which is
a damned good read IMHO.  (It's about how to make things last for millenia.)

The best quote from the guy that thought up the idea of feeding plankton
FeO2 was "Give me a frigate full of rust, and I'll give you your next
ice age." (from wetware RAM, #include <stdwarn.h>)

The current issue of Wired wrote up on this also.
