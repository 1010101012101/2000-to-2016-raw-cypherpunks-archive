Lots of murderous terrorists have been released from Guatanamo, 
and in the nearly all cases the most serious of their 
complaints make it sound like a beach resort, except for the 
fact that they could not leave.

A few have more serious complaints.  Either they are lying or, 
those who say they were well treated apart from being held 
captive are lying. It is hard to believe that people like 
Slimane Hadj Abderrahmane (who after release announced his 
intention to resume terrorist activities and that he would
attempt to murder his hosts who lobbied to get him release) are
lying to cover up torture by the US army.
