To get around the CD-RW serial-number issue should be easy.

Buy a CD-RW with cash at a computer-fest or ham (amateur-radio) swap meet.

DON'T burn anything on the CD-RW that could be traced back to you.

At the last  ham swap meet I attended there was a guy selling loads of 
complete DSS systems off a pallet for $35 cash (It was a reputable swap-meet, 
so I don't think they "fell-off " a truck).

2 rows over was another guy selling smart cards.

Another row over was a guy selling smart card programmers.

Inside a building was a guy selling "technical information" on how DSS smart 
cards work, including source code for "example" smartcard programs  to "test" 
various "features" of the DSS system.  

He had big  disclaimers saying "Don't use this info for illegal purposes".

Yeah right. 

I wonder how many morons bought all this stuff AND STILL plugged the DSS 
receiver into the phone line.

Attention MPAA/RIAA: I didn't purchase anything. There's enough crap on TV as 
it is, and I don't need an extra 500 channels of it.
