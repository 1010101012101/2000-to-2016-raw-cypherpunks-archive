The 419 scam is a bit different from most "Can you help me get my money"
scams that need the mark to contribute some up-front money,
or too-good-to-be-true investments, or house-repair jobs that never get done.

In this one, the cons are pretty much admitting that the money
was stolen by some corrupt official who's their relative,
and they're asking the mark to help them get the loot.
So the mark isn't an innocent dupe, but a guilty dupe,
and has no business complaining about the lack of honor among thieves,
and if anything, the mark who complains to the cops about being ripped off
would deserve to be busted if there were in fact any stolen money in Nigeria.
