Sounds much like the fictional setting for the "Newark Incident" in 
John Gilstrap's "At Any Cost." In that novel, a very large former 
weapons plant in Arkansas is the site of some old weapons bunkers 
leaking nerve gases and whatnot. Rail lines, "mounds" covering the 
bunkers are covered with trees which have grown up over the years 
since the plant was decommissioned, etc.

I don't know if there was such a plan in Arkansas as well as in Iowa, 
or whether Gilstrap simply changed a few names and sites to protect 
the guilty. A good read, though, as was his earlier thriller, 
"Nathan's Run."
