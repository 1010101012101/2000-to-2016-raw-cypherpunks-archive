      Oh shit, speak for yourself, dude. I'm 57 and I love techno, trance, etc.
I even like to go to sleep at night listening to it. And I'd love to go raving,
if I was ever near one. Probably wouldn't turn down any enlightening chemicals
either.  8-)
      Grow old and senile if you want to -- I ain't interested in that rocking
chair. I may be slower and have less endurance, but at least my spirit is
willing and young.
