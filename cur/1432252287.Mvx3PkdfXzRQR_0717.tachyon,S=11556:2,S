Pretty much. Except that a nym may hold more than one asset, and
might be easier to transfer than all the other stuff is. Take a look
at the arguments for unification of currencies that preceded the
creation of the Euro, and, more properly, something from the early
1980's called "New Monetary Economics", advocated by people like
Eugene Fama (efficient market hypothesis) and Fisher Black
(Black-Scholes option pricing calculations) which argued the
opposite, that as computation increased, "numeraires", like the pound
or the dollar, could be de-coupled from the assets that they were
barter-proxies for.

You may be right, though. Only when we do it will we actually find
out.

Maybe, but even immature markets have to make money or they're killed
in their cribs. My favorite analogy is how bugs learned to fly,
which, if you remember your PBS science shows, evolved from
skittering across the surfaces of ponds...

I don't think so. The ones who fail, like the Taliban, keep getting
shot to encourage the others, right? Again, immature markets,
including monopolies for force have to make money or they're killed
in their cribs. Three orders of magnitude, and all that? :-).

I'm not so sure. If you create a nym as a unique entity which has
control of keys which control assets, the word "unique" points to
bearer-instrument protocol of some kind. A stock-exchange seat comes
to mind. You don't want to sell multiple copies of a key, for
instance, at least for lots of interesting uses.

Which brings to mind the idea of a contingent claim, a derivative,
for those of you in Palm Beach County. That points to protocols like
Juels and Jakobssons's  XCash, in which an executable itself, paying
attention to signed inputs and capable of exercising control of an
asset, is blinded and transferred around in a unique fashion, but I'm
not sure how something would used exactly in the case of a nym.

Clearly, once you have control of the nym, the nym can do anything it
wants, but, I expect that most behavior involving other assets will
be monitored by others in some fashion. I'm not saying government, of
course, because they aren't efficient enough. But markets happen when
people agree on certain kinds of behavior between themselves, and
someone ends up ejudicating that behavior. The crypto-anarchic escrow
agent comes to mind, for instance.

Which means, you need a different protocol for selling them. I think
you walked away too soon from the idea of a nym as a financial
instrument, a contingent claim of some kind. Title to assets, at the
very least, plus or minus "goodwill", for lack of a better word. I
*think* it's part of the definition of a firm, in the Coasean sense
of a collection of assets that are worth more together because they
can transfer the value of those assets for more competitive advantage
internally than the firm gets if those assets are sold into the
market directly.

See, you're talking about finance already :-). Insurance is a
contingent claim on assets based on external events. Remember how
they called program trading of various derivatives "portfolio
insurance" once apon a market crash?

Say 'amen', somebody...

First of all, I think that music shouldn't be copy controlled,
because it's "software", in the pure Beckerian sense of something
that can be copied, and, on the net it can be copied for almost
nothing, something that probably makes Coase smile, somewhere, which
was my point about commodity markets for information.

The part about selling something once is what Chaum did already with
DigiCash. The mint keeps a copy of the first "note", and, if another
one crosses the transom, the key of the counterfeiter is revealed.
Anyone who takes the cash offline, without the participation of the
underwriter, deserves what he gets if the cash is double-spent,
right?

I think the apparatus for selling nyms is there already. Like I said
before, all we need is an exchange protocol, something, like price
discovery, has already been solved by lots of people (Micali has one,
for instance, though I'm not sure how good it is because I'm not
qualified to examine it), so we just have to find the best one.

Cheers,
RAH
