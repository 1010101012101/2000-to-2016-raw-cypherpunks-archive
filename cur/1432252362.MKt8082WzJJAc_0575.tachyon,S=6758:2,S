Except that packets will be dropped if they look like they're coming
from somewhere they shouldn't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCP_38

I would, instead of taking the IP spoofing approach, I would have
designed the network with the intention of making it appear that a
message could be destined for anyone using public key encryption: if A
sends a message to B and B can't decrypt it, it wasn't intended for B,
so it gets forwarded to other nodes in the network. Traffic analysis is
defeated by layering encryption and constantly sending lots of flak:
nonsense messages. If you can maintain the throughput at each node as a
constant and make one message look different between entering and
exiting a node, I believe it would be theoretically impossible to
conduct traffic analysis.
