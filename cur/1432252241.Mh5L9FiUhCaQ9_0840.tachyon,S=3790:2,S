>"Anyone who would use the Internet to commit a crime should understand 
one thing -- do not count on the anonymity of the Internet to serve as a 
shield for your illegal conduct. As technology advances, so do our investigative 
techniques and our abilities to protect the public."

Quite true.  However, any well informed LE-type will tell you only amateurs 
are likely to be caught.  I dare say if we select one of this list's more 
informed members, say Black Unicorn, and assume he intended to engage in 
a similar exploit as this fellow from Bloomberg.  I would find it highly 
unlikely that BU would ever be apprehended for the deed (assuming he didn't 
brag).
