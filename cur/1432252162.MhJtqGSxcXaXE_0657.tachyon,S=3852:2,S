To blame COINTELPRO for radical leftist internal violence is as silly
as blaming Pol Pot and the Ukraine famine on the CIA.

If those radicals were being murdered by the feds, the radical left
would have been eager to have them investigated, instead of closing
their eyes and looking the other way, and suddenly dropping vanished
radicals down the memory hatch.

The way we all reacted shows that we all knew full well who was doing
it.
