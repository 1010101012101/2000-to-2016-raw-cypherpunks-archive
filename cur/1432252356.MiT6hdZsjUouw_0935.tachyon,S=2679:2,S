"Its a sign of John's early Alzheimers, when he lets his wealthwrath

Well, I don't know Variola...I don't actually see much in that post that 
violates that. In fact, kinda sheds some light on what might have triggered 
this particular violation. If she's going to start rubbing elbows with the 
Old Money like she always wanted then she can't be attracting a lot of 
attention. I would not be suprised one bit to find out some suggestions were 
made...toss the public a token psuedo-WASP so they won't think the Sandy 
Weils and Dennis Kozlowskis are being unfairly targeted...

At least it's food for thought, even if you puke it up.
