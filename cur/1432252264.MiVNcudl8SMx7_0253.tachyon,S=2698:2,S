This is trite nonsense that is not really interesting or responsive to
Tim's claims.

Obviously voluntary trade and other forms of economic cooperation in a large

Corporations like Tim's former employer Intel could not exist otherwise.
But the emphasis, which you missed, is on the phrase "voluntary."
