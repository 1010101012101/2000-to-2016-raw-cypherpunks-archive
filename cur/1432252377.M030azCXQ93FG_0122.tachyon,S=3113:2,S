"TrueCrypt
Free open-source disk encryption software for Windows XP/2000/2003 and Linux
Main Features:

* It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mount it as a real
disk.
* It can encrypt an entire hard disk partition or a device, such as USB memory
stick, floppy disk, etc.
* Provides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces
you to reveal the password:
  1) Hidden volume (more information may be found here).
  2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (TrueCrypt volumes cannot be
distinguished from random data).
* Encryption algorithms: AES-256, Blowfish (448-bit key), CAST5, Serpent
(256-bit key), Triple DES, and
Twofish (256-bit key). Supports cascading (e.g., AES-Twofish-Serpent).
* Based on Encryption for the Masses (E4M) 2.02a, which was conceived in
1997.
Further information regarding the features of the software may be found in the
documentation."

"Complete source code (in C) of the latest stable version of TrueCrypt for all
supported operating
systems and all supported hardware platforms" are available from
http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads.php
