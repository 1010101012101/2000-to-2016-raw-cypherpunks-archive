Before anyone else starts, don't take my hypothesis that patents 
will survive in a crypto-abundant world as endorsement for the
USP&TO lunacy we've all seen.  You can limit the context to 
physical-object or manufacturing patents.  It is has been pretty
well argued that bits will be very hard to regulate in any sense
of that word; and also that USPTO has been doing too much PCP during
work hours.
