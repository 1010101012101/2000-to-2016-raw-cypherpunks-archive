I like to think of the issue in terms of "coercement."

Though some folks claim they are in some sense "coerced" to buy 
certain products, or shop at certain stores, or pay "high rents," 
this sense of coercion is not at all the same as having someone say 
"Do this or we shoot you."

(The gifted writer P.J. O'Rourke has cast this in the form of "Would 
you have your grandmother shot for this?")

I know of two general classes of agents who do this:

-- the Mafia

-- the government

"Pay us 20% or have your store burned down."

"Pay us 40% or face seizure of your store and 30 years at Terminal Island."

"If you read this book, we will toss you in prison and throw away the key."

"You are not allowed to eat that type of plant. It is forbidden. Do 
it and we'll seize your house, fine you a quarter of a million 
dollars, and send you to prison for 20 years."

"Move along."

"The President is passing through. We'll need to look inside your 
bag. No, smart ass, the Fourth Amendment does not apply in this case."

"COINTELPRO has identified 50 political agents we will deal with. We 
have some guys from MAC-SOG trained to deal with traitors."

"The Company is flying in 20 tons. Pickup at Travis. Make sure the 
local cops are clued-in.  After eliminating the French Connection, 
Khun Sa will be supplying all of our needs."

"It is illegal to speak out against the draft, Mr. Debs. No, smart 
ass, the First Amendment does not apply."

"Mr. Suzuki, you and your family are being ordered to a concentration 
camp in Nevada. No, Mr. Suzuki, neither the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth 
Amendments apply."

"You are not allowed to make that transaction without approval from 
the appropriate agency."

And so on.

Government quickly evolves in nearly all cultures to a thugocracy. 
Sometimes the mailed glove is covered with a fine glove, sometimes it 
is more obvious.

The move away from "coerced transactions" is what characterizes a 
free society. A classically liberal society.

We are, of course, moving ever more quickly to a society in which 
permission must be sought for many classes of actions and 
transactions.

Saying corporations are the main problem is, as Declan says, naive.

Neither Intel or Microsoft can imprison people for not buying their 
products. Neither can threaten to kill those who use Macs. Neither 
can force tax slaves to pay for their new factories.

(There are complications, via tax rebates. But these are generally 
deals whereby the local government promises to give a "tax holiday," 
that is, to agree not to steal from the company, for some number of 
years. Purists like me don't like such deals, but these deals are 
still a far cry from governmnt threatening to enter homes with 
black-clad Ninja assassins.)
