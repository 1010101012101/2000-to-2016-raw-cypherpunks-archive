Are you sure that works?  I would think the SSL client would do a
connection to the URL the user typed, www.amazon.com, and check the
name in the cert to see if it (approximately) matches.  If some DNS
redirection is done in the background so that amazon.com gets mapped
to amazon.hackeddomain.com, the client will not be aware of this (will
it?) and so it will still throw up a warning when it sees a cert for
hackeddomain.com on a connection to amazon.com.
