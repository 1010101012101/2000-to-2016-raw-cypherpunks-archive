To quote a famous flying squirrel, that trick never works. Tried it myself
a few times over the years, and one usually misses too much of what this
list is for, as you noted yourself, above.

Unfortunately, if you want to read Tim, you have to read his evil twin
Skippy, too.

Living in *his* killfile, on the other hand, and if he actually uses it,
can be useful. Try it, you'll like it.

Cheers,
RAH
