Retailiation, like legislation seems pointless to me, though since our 
troops are now in Afghanistan, Saudi, Iraq, Cuba, Korea, Germany and so on, 
I see no reason we can't eventually send a local delegation of this defacto 
worldwide government to crack down on Nigerian spammers, who will soon 
probably be declared terrorists.

What I wonder is why this isn't solved in a cyber-streetfight. If people get 
sick enough with spam I figure a good big batch of hackers could make some 
serious trouble for a few of the bigger spammers.
