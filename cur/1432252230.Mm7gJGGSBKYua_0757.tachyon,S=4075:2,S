  Travel

  Getting to Tobago

  There are some international flights to Tobago's Crown Point International
  Airport (TAB), notably from London Gatwick and from Bardados, but most
  attendees will probably fly to Piarco International Airport in Port of
  Spain, Trinidad (POS) and connect to Tobago from there. Tobago Express
  operates 40 flights daily between Trinidad and Tobago (20 each way) at a
  cost of about $25 each way.

  Group discounts have been arranged for flights with airlines in the SkyTeam
  alliance (including Continental and Delta, which fly to POS) and for
  American Airlines. The American Airlines discount is also valid for other
  airlines in the oneworld alliance, but at least one leg must be flown with
  American. To get the SkyTeam discount, visit
  http://globalmeetings.skyteam.com/ and enter Event ID 0049S. To get the
  American Airlines discount, mention Discount Code A3927AX when booking your
  flight.

  The SkyTeam discount is valid for travel in the period February 7-21, 2007
  for 5% off discounted fares and 10% off full fares. The American Airlines
  discount is valid for travel in the period February 9-19, 2007 for 5% off
  the lowest applicable published fare (with some fare classes excepted).

  Local Transportation

  To get to the Hilton from the airport, simplest is to take a taxi. Please
  let the FC07 General Chair know when you are scheduled to arrive; if a
  number of attendees are arriving together on the same flight we will try to
  meet the group and travel together to the hotel.

  Visa Information

  Conference attendees are advised to check with the nearest Trinidad and
  Tobago Embassy for entry requirements (visa and travel documents). Much
  information is also available online. Nationals of EU countries, the USA,
  and Canada generally do not need visas for stays of up to 3 months.
