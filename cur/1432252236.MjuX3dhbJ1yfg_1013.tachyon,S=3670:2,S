While I'm certainly not saying "I don't buy it", how does this  
reconcile with the reality of The Silk Road still being in existance.  
One would think that governments would use these techniques against  
the site if for nothing more than to catch/punish them for all the tax  
evasion going on.

If this paper is true, the only reason I could think of why TSR is  
still alive is because it is some kind of government front, though  
there is no evidence of that at all.
