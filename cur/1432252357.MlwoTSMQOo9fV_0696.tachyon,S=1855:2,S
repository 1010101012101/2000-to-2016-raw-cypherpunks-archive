Well, is it reasonable to expect a creature to evolve to an environment that 
doesn't exist yet?

On the other hand, I don't think the number of Tor IP addresses is anywhere 
near its hockeystick yet, and when it comes it will be changing far too fast 
for them to block.

So they will ultimately have to change their model, methinks.
