Hmmm cypherpunks write code patrick.. ??


James has actually contributed more(code) than simply hot air and
criticism. And continues to contribute in ways you cant even begin to
perceive simply by continuing to show up.....

Doesn't matter what age he is.. racist maybe.. doesn't matter(I am
melungeon myself and tolerate purebloods and racists well..they ALL like
to have sex and within a very few generation pure bloods WONT exist )


And TC May loves to spoof the gullible and journalists(hmm equivalent?)



     gh - who was the person standing behind the photog at the wired
cypherpunk cover photo shoot.

ps what the fuck have you or Carl contributed youngster?
