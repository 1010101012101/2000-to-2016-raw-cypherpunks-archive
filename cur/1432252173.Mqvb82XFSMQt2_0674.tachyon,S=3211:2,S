        Yea gods, what ignorant lamer garbage! "saint" patrick was some
asshole Catholic, who cares where he came from, he had nothing to do
with Gaelic civilization, just another bumfuck intruding papist sent
over to help destroy the glorius Celtic culture, and I'm glad you
mentioned the similarity to Native Americans becuase that's exactly what
transpired with the Beast of Rome imposed upon the Fair Isles by
successive waves of faggot frogs and dagos back 2000 years. What needs
be done is a Druidic rising of the clans, not just in Eirie, but on all
the Isles, with all the Celts, kicking the goddamened french-blooded
brits back to the continent once and for all, thus to bring about the
new Golden Dawn when Arthur will reign again with Meglin at his side.
