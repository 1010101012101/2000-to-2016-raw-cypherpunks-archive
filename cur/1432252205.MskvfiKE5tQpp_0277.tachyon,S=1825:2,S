Good call.  I wonder if folks getting PET scans will have to kick back
longer in the waiting areas lest they be snatched by delta teams...
hopefully the .mils can distinguish Tc99 et al from other 'topes..
similarly with mobile industrial inspection rigs --except that they have
the
good stuff a RD gadget-maker would want.  Maybe GPS + IFF beacons will
be
added to those.
