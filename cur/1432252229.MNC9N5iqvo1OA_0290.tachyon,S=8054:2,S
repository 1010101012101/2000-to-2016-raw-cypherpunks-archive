I couldn't agree more, and the sad state of Pirate Party here in Poland=
:
http://rys.io/en/119

...only amplifies that. I mean, when I hear them saying things like "fi=
rst we=20
need to get to the Parliament to be able to do anything", I feel like I=
'm=20
going to throw up.

Same shit is going on in Germany and Sweden, AFAIK. Pirate Party moveme=
nt is=20
in deep crisis in Europe.


So that got me thinking about parties as a system hack:
http://rys.io/en/80
http://rys.io/en/78

I think it's worth a try.
