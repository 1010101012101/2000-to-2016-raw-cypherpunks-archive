As stated in the github on ImmortalCode, I'm totally down for
contributors,

https://github.com/abisprotocol/ImmortalCode

And, I haven't set up a mechanism to fund this, but I know from
memory, an OpenROV to ensconce it in costs not much ~ though the
polymerase chain reaction stuff, DNA work, crypto, seed and genome
bank you want to pack in, would certainly cost more than jut the
OpenROV machinery, but actually the overall project is low cost by the
time you are done with the thing. Greater difficulty would be to
determine how to ensure it would reproduce itself at depth, tougher
than just producing a wandering rover sort of thing, for sure (partly
due to that we don't know what happens in most parts of the deep), and
also due to the complexity of merging Turritopsis dohrnii DNA with
Open Worm DNA (in biological form, a Caenorhabditis Elegans, which has
302 neurons and 959 cells), as well as inserting a "human signal" in
the form of a tiny segment of human DNA into the modified T. dohrnii
as well before protecting the creature within a modified OpenROV to
help protect it and ensure its safe return to land. A significant
amount of initial design would be necessary to determine what
equipment and sensors it would have so that it would run with in
tandem with knowledge nodes that would enable it to share knowledge
between species across vast areas of the ocean without human
intervention.  That's the general idea, anyway.

I'm open to it.  I'll set up a donation address soon and put it on the
readme page.
