Maybe CPU Jitter RNG provided on www.chronox.de helps here? The test 
results are prepared on a plethora of different CPUs, operating systems 
and compilers and thus should cover 95% of all users (I am trying to get 
test results for iOS to cover 99% of all users).

(disclaimer: I wrote the code and I may be biased in the judgment)

Ciao
