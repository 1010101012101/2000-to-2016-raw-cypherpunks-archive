Interesting the way terms like give hints about etymology and cognates.

Hood is to bonnet, in terms of clothing as well as cars, as trunk is to 
boot, as in booty.

(Booty being a black slang term for ass; no doubt related to "trunk" as 
body part, as in "swim trunks.")

The morphism between British English and American English gives rise to 
many interesting structures.

Someone said something earlier about tube/valve amps giving a boost to 
the high end, for older, hearing-damaged rockers. I don't think the 
frequency response has evern been an issue...tube amps are said to have 
a "warmer" sound, and to have more odd harmonic distortion than 
transistor amps, but the frequency response of _any_ transistor or tube 
amp is vastly beyond what even high-end speakers and headphones can 
typically deliver.

A modern solid state amp is essentially "flat" from 20 Hz to 20 KHz.

(I haven't tested my hearing in a while, with my Test CDs, but when I do 
I use my Stax electrostatics or my Etymotics instead of my Mirage 
speakers. Last I checked, my hearing was rolling off at around 16-17 
KHz.)
