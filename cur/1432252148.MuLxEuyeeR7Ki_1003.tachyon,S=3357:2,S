I didn't send a message to Robb, and have not initiated any contact
with or responded to any contact from the prosecution.

I sent a message to the cypherpunks list that quoted from DOJ 
regulations. Robb, apparently a cypherpunk subscriber, replied
to that message but removed the Subject: line.

I wonder if John Young is a journalist, and needs to have his 
subponea approved by John Ashcroft too...
