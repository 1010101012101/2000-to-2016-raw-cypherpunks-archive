>Cypherpunks,


This is certainly a point that many people are coming to believe. But 
I think you have to be careful with taking it to extremes. Are there 
problems with changing the character of noise? Yes, but as you 
pointed out it may be possible to sculpt the inserted information to 
conform to the statistical character of the overall file. One of the 
simplest tricks is just to insert a relatively small message in a 
relatively large file. Any statistical changes will be lost in the 
noise. This is a pretty practical solution because there are plenty 
of images that take hundreds of thousands if not millions of bytes. A 
thousand bytes of text gets lost pretty quickly.

It's also important to remember that there are many tricks that avoid 
making changes in the usual way. I'm currently very intrigued with 
the potential to rearrange lists of items. (You can try out an applet 
here: http://www.wayner.org/books/discrypt2/sorted.php)

I guess it's important not to let an obsessive attention to 
mathematical perfection  prevent you from accomplishing something 
cool. After all, every RSA key can be factored eventually, but we 
still use the system because it's practically secure.
