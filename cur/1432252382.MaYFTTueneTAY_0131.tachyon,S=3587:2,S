Just in case anyone is as ill informed as me, I was delighted to read 
at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7094881.stm that the rebuilt 
Colossus is or is about to be used on a message enciphered on a Lorenz 
machine and transmitted from Germany.

Following the links from that page I see that the message will be 
"intercepted" using the radio equipment of the time before the Colossus 
tries to work out the settings. There will be  parallel effort with 
modern radio equipment and computers. It should be an interesting race.

I admire those who had the enthusiasm to rebuild the machine and who 
had the contacts to get hold of the plans and notes that remained. The 
last time I took a particular interest in the project, some years ago, 
they were trying to find the right sort of valve and had just completed 
the framework for hurtling paper tape round and round.

We visited a couple of weeks ago and I took some snaps of the rebuild
project http://flickr.com/photos/tug/sets/72157602953115982/

BP has improved markedly since we last visited (about three years
ago). However the guided tours are even worse than ever (our guide
remonstrated with passers by for taking whilst he was droning on).
Take one of the excellent electronic guides and do your own tour.
