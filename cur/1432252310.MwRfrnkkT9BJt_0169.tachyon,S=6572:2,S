Developed nations pushing to get rid of tax havens

Wealthy countries aiming to recover billions of dollars lost to offshore 
tax havens are trying to convince small countries to give up the banking 
secrecy that has helped their fragile economies survive.

Officials from about 40 countries and territories were to reconvene Tuesday 
in Barbados for a second and final day of discussion about what the 
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development terms 
``harmful tax practices.''

The organization's 30 member nations, which include the world's wealthiest 
nations, have set up international standards that they want all nations to 
abide by. Countries that have no taxes or low taxes are being pushed to 
change their laws
