A thought, however, requiring people to handle PCB's -- which 
are no fun whatsoever, heavily regulated, hard to acquire (albeit 
relatively easy to synthesize), and all-around poisonous.  That's 
damaging more than just the criminals in this case.  That's damaging 
the planet.

Instead, consider the possibilities of putrescine -- it's easier
to synthesize, totally harmless ecologically speaking, legal to 
own (and legal to spill on your *own* property prior to seizure)
and while it doesn't actually make the car into a 100K liability,
it does make it so that nobody except a scrap metal dealer would 
ever pay any money for it.

Don't inhale anywhere nearby after you open the vial though;  If 
you do, you *will* puke.

The stuff *NEVER* comes out, either.
