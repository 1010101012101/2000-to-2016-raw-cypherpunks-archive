Sometimes I keep asking myself if the author of statements like these is 
really pretending Guru-like to be clueless just to elicit a response.
But it's obvious here that whoever "Tim May" is he's just about clueless.

In the discussions about the meaning of the suffix "-punk" I don't remember 
seeing any suggestion that "Cypherpunks" had any connection politically or 
music-wise to punk music. The posts were meant to explore what 
quintessentially punk flavorings might be implied by the name or that may be 
reflected in the overall makeup of the list.

And yes, I was aware of where the term originated from, and it was clear to 
me that the intent of the naming was to imply a sort of anti-establishment 
"don't give a crap we're going to code and unload crypto apps" attitude.

And to some extent, the list (no, not a group, but a set of lists with the 
name cypherpunks) has aspects of that character. But it always pisses me off 
when I see the local jocks or other thoughtpolice come on out and enforce 
whatever ideology it is desired we bow down to.

Hmmm...a song lyric comes to mind...

"If you've come to fight, get outa here
You ain't no better than the bouncers
We ain't trying to be police
When you ape the cops it ain't anarchy"

(From "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" by the Dead Kennedys)
