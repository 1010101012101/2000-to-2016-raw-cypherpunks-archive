The Jurassic Park and Lost World DVD's play an ad for Universal DVD
titles when you start the movie, and while it is playing, you can't
chapter skip, fast forward, or rewind. I have some DVD's that do
similar things when the disc is first put in the player. Fortunately,
most DVD's don't have this annoying "feature".

Commercial VHS tapes have had trailers (and occasionally ads) at the
start
for several years, but they can be zapped with FF.

Over 20-30 DVDs I've seen none *forced* you to watch the
trailers - they have always been part of the 'extra features' stuff
off
the main menu.

OTOH, they all *do* force you to sit through the FBI and Interpol
warnings for about 15 seconds.

BTW: my VCR has a feature that allows it to automatically
FF through ads. It works about 90% of the time, and is a very nice
thing to have.
