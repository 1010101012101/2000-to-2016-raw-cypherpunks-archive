This is a minor, but illustrative, example of why the problem is best 
fixed by property rights, not collectivism.

(Funny, the word "collectivism" rarely pops up here. We ought to use it 
more, as it better describes a bunch of things we often call socialism.)

On your own property, in your own garden, one doesn't have to argue 
with committees and government officials and city councils about 
spraying or when one can start working the soil.

This is the commons problem cropping up again in this common garden.

Me, I have my own garden plot on my own land. And even if I didn't own 
land, working out a deal with someone who _did_ have land would be 
preferable to working in a so-called "community garden."

(We have a few here in Santa Cruz. Bums and winos make a token effort 
to stand around and rake. Mostly it's an excuse for community money to 
be handed out to the "farmers." I've also walked past the weed-choked 
community garden in Berkeley, on the site of "People's Park," IIRC. 
Skanks and bums. New slogan for these urban community gardens: "Hoes fo 
da hoes!
