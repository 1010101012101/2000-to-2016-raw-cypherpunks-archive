Actually the only passports that are significantly more 
convenient than US or UK ones (i.e. are more likely to get you 
in to more places with less fuss from locals in dark glasses) 
are from the  northern European states without a reputation as 
colonialists - in particular Scandinavian countries & Ireland. 
Everyone likes them.

I know plenty of people who used to keep both an Irish and a 
British passport. Unlike you picky Americans our governments 
don't have any objection to people being citizens of as many 
places as they an get away with. And in the days of emigration 
(all has changed now) you could get an Irish passport if your 
granny had once spent a wet weekend in Downpatrick.

All our passports are being assimilated into EU ones at the 
moment so I don't know if this has changed.

We used to do the Israel/everywhere else thing as well and also 
would issue spare passports for other places that were 
unpopular. IIRC Pakistan at one time looked askance at passports 
that had been to India. South African visitors weren't popular 
in many countries.  And I'm pretty sure that Britain sometimes 
issued spares to people who wanted to go to the USA after 
visiting Cuba or Iran (both increasingly popular holiday 
destinations from here)  I strongly suspect that this has 
changed now that UK pass laws are taken as dictation from the USA.
