To quote from the text:
"In 2008, Swedenbs parliament narrowly passed a law that lets its
signals intelligence agency (FRA) monitor the content of all
cross-border cable-based internet traffic to combat bexternal threatsb
such as terrorism and organized crime b but only after obtaining court
permission, and upon the explicit request of government or defense
agencies."

In other words, Sweden does monitor all traffic.

Best,
