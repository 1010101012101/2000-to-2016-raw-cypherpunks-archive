I want to tell you what An Metet <cypherpunks@openpgp.net> said
about "Ruling Says Parents Have Right to S" on 11 Nov 2000, at 0:41

And so I wonder if this applies equally well to the "blocked site" 
lists used by blocking software that a school might use -- as a 
parent I want to know exactly from which sites the school is 
protecting my child... (and not merely the sites my child has 
attempted to access and been blocked from)

Perhaps the blocking software companies who sell to schools and 
libraries may need to disclose their lists based on this decision!
