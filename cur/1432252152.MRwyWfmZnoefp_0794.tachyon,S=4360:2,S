So I covered President Bush's inauguration today, though from the streets 
instead of the bleachers. You can see the photos here:
http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/2001-bush-inauguration-highlights.html

On Thursday, I walked from the Capitol building to the White House via 
Pennsylvania Avenue and took some shots of the inaugural parade preparations:

Note the high security and planned police checkpoints earlier in the week:

On Thursday, when I was standing on a sidewalk in front of the federal 
courthouse on Pennsylvania Ave (of Monicagate and Microsoft trial fame), a 
deputy U.S. Marshal told me I could not take a photo of the courthouse. It 
was a wide-angle shot of the front, and no people or security preparations 
appared to be visible. Here's him walking back to his van, which appears to 
have -- from another photo -- U.S. Government plate 60163:

I covered the Microsoft trial in that courthouse, took photos of the 
exterior, and never had any problems from the marshals. Here's a photo I 
took from that same sidewalk last year when the atmosphere was much less 
tense:

Photos from even earlier in the week:

I've allowed the Independent Media Center to run my photos from Saturday; 
you can see some highlights here:

Here's one of the Capitol building setup that Wired News ran, though they 
apparently compressed the JPG image too much with hardly optimal results:
