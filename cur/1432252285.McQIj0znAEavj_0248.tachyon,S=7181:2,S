	The paper states that traffic analysis is feasible. I mean, that isn't
exactly news. The paper seems to admit that traffic analysis is (a lot?)
easier that previously supposed. 

	So, yes, that shows that tor can't protect people from the US government.
Which actually shouldn't be surprising since tor is a tool of the US
government. 

	As to your 'efforts being futile' - that's not my wording. Depending on
what your ends are, your efforts are certainly not futile...

	Oh, come on. Again "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".

	I've already seen a few of them. No, I obviously don't think that those
prove anything. Did I mention that "absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence"? 


	And while we're it, did I miss any leaked documents discussing traffic
analysis of tor? There should be some no?

	I really can't believe you wrote that. You think I'm that stupid? 

	The way to 'break' tor, that is, find things like the location of, say,
freedom hosting and silk road, is to monitor traffic. I obviously can't do
that. Your government can obviously do that. 

	Please.

	What's hilarious is your attempt at twisting what I said.

	Oh really. I need to be spoon fed by computer illiterate greenwald? That's
cool...

	And how do these superior people gauge the rate at which the inferior
people they spoon fed are able to consume what they are given? Just
curious...
