Dear Tracey,

How about buying yourself a two Omega watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks

Take advantage of our winter specials and get yourself Omega watch that you've always wanted!

Our Omega watches have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Santos
