A similar parking lot about the same distance north of the runway
of Washington Reagan National (and very close to the Pentagon) along
the Potomac River off the parkway is sitll open.

It's also used for a boat launch by politically influential
Washingtonians, which might explain why it hasn't been closed. No
double standards here, of course...
