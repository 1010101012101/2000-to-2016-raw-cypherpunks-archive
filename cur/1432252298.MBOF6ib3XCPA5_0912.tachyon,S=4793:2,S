Dear Joe,

When you registered on the EDGAR Online Web site recently, you
also requested a free membership on Powerize, the ultimate source 
for business and investment research on the Internet. Powerize is 
a subsidiary of Hoover's, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOOV), operator of Hoover's 
Online, the businessperson's portal (http://www.hoovers.com).

We want to take this opportunity to welcome you as a new Member and to 
tell you that very soon you will receive another email message from us 
that contains your Powerize User ID and Password. (Your EDGAR Online
User ID and Password will not work on Powerize).

Please keep a lookout for this email message.  It will be titled:

	Your Powerize User ID and Password Are Enclosed

When you receive this message, be sure to login on the Powerize homepage 
with your User ID and Password so that you can enjoy all the benefits of 
membership. 

If you'd prefer to create your own User ID and Password on Powerize, 
you can do so right now, in about a minute, on our Web site. Click here 
to begin:

	https://www.powerize.com/pubbin/register.cgi

Powerize offers more FREE business and financial research than any 
other site on the Internet, plus the Internet's best free alert 
service, free subscriptions to daily Industry News Digests, and much 
more. There's no better way to research stocks, competitors, customers, 
prospects, industries...whatever you need to know.

Note that Powerize content, alerts, and newsletters will become part 
of the Hoover's site in the near future, and that your free Powerize 
membership will automatically convert to a free Hoover's membership 
at that time.  More on this exciting development at a later date!

Again, welcome!

If you wish to unsubscribe from this email list please reply to this 
message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.
