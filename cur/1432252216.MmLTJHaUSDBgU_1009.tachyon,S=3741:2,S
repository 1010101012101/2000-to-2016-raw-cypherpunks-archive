Somebody does something. As a consequence another party is considered to
have contributed to the first persons act, without actually participating
in the act.

So, if the first person is not fully responsible, why is the second
party fully responsible? How do you test this?

If a party whose actions contribute is responsible for the consequences
then isn't the censor themselves, since they take an active role, also
responsible?

Doesn't this put a party in the defence in the role of presecutor and
judge? That seems to be a considerable conflict of interest.
