Which shows? When/

I'm a frequent watcher of CNN (though not CNN-FN or Lou Dobbs), and yet 
the only time I have seen you on t.v. was on an episode of Geraldo a 
year or two ago.

Yes, I'd say you fit the profile.

About right. Four hours of your time for 7 seconds of commentary.

No wonder the networks are gradually going broke.

"Typing dummy entries." Typical. Faking the news.

(I had a sort of similar experience in '95 when the BBC wanted to 
interview me. I had to get up at 5 am for an 8 am flight to LA (I live 
an hour away from the airport), take a series of buses and shuttles to a 
hoity toity hotel in Hollywood, wait for 3 hours for Alvin and Heidi 
Toffler to be interviewed, then submit to their "let's have you do some 
fake stuff!" producer directions. I resisted doing the fake stuff, but 
they insisted. I pretended to be doing something crypto-like. They ended 
up using about a second of this elaborately-faked session. And they 
lifted my comments in such a way as to misrepresent what I said. I 
finally  made my way back to LAX around 6, caught a late flight to SJO, 
and arrived back at my home around midnight. All for a meaningless 
snippet on a meaningless t.v. show seen by a few thousands Brits. Of 
course, were I a journalist or other such person, I would prominently 
list this in my resume. What a joke.)
