The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri|led 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The field is estab|ished with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barre|s of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ightly, you wil| sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wil| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
