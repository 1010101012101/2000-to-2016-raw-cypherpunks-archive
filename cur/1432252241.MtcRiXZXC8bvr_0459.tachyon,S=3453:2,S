 >>the very
idea of a "libertarian socialist" is an oxymoron.
It doesn't compute.
Sure, we are "libertarian socialists" in a sense within our families or
circles of friends, in a manner of speaking, but we are not coerced by
external agents to be nice, or socialist, to our family and friends.
 >>Therein lies the reason why "libertarian socialist" is such an oxymoron."
Tim.
"but we are not coerced by
external agents to be nice, or socialist, to our family and friends."

What if the coercing external agent were operation soft drill? It cant be 
the anarchist
police can it? Under libertarian socialism (anarchism)the only external 
coercive agents
possible would be distributed,available to all and anonymous.External 
coercive agents
are a distinguishing feature of authoritarian socialism and corporate 
capitalism.Anarchy
(libertarian socialism)is the best way forward to minimize external 
coercion (violence)
Operation soft drill while it allows for inevitable violence,it should keep 
it to an absolute
minimum once it takes off.A computer in every village is as important as a 
well.This AP idea
is the justice system for the whole wired world. Crypto-anarchy needs 
justice or it will fail.
