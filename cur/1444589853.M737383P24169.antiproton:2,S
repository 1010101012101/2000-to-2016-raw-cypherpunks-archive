bbrewer has made a good point, actually.  If someone is served a NSL, they 
are gagged - prohibited by law from saying anything about it.  Look at Nick 
from Calyx: after a decade, his gag order has finally been lifted but there 
is still a 90-day period during which the gag remains intact to give the 
feds time to appeal.  It's crazy stuff.

Even if JY did it to "make a point" about all security being illusory BS, 
the log files dropped are old enough that they probably wouldn't cause much 
harm.  The same basic argument used by Wikileaks when they dropped the 
State Dept cables.
