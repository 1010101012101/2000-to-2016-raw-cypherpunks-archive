then generate one.
it won't be accepted as legitimate by the majority of clients though - you
would have to get each one to approve you manually (like you would with a
pgp key, but without the WoT to help you)
keys can be generated using OpenSSL, or if you aren't a fan of command
line tools, EBCrypt can generate them from VB; there is a mini-ca script
here: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WSH-CA/files/Current/ if you want to
play with it :)
