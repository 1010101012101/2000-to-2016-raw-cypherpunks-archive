 >>...the real fun part is that Nature is publishing a pro-AP article,

(agent Gordon pay attention now !) 9 out of 10 cpunk list subscribers ("The 
Movement") would contribute, if assured of anonymity, up to $100 to have 
baby bush's brain aerosoled. 7 out of 10 would pay the same amount to have 
it done to any TV personality. Show me the working double-blind bit-cash 
and I'll show you the world full of extremely polite people.<<

As you seem to feel safe in your anonymity why don't you join my pledge

2 soft drill dollars and you double the prize pool.Some bottomless 
transvestite stripper might do it,next time he spills his
drink; for 4 whole dollars Id might do it myself,he's like ariel "wide 
target"Sharon.Dum Dums will do ya.
Thinning out the scientologist celebrity pool would be fun and generate 
mucho PR.10$ toward revolting cruise missile!
Ill renew my offer on AG,even double it! Forget exactly but its about 125$ 
US or barter units of money.
Hawala payments only now but Quantum/satellite/ e-BUMs are close,so close.
Mass actions possible on USAma,surely! (my 2c)
