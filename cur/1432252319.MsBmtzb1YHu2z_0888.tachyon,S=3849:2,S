Two that are in app-admin/ under gentoo are pwgen and ranpwd.  pwgen is
neat.  It prints out a bunch of passwords and you pick one, so that
shoulder surfing doesn't work (unless it's with a camera).

It also has an option to generate a password given a seed value (which
could be your basic password you might use for PwdHash) and an input
file, using sha-1.

I recall a similar program that printed out skey-style many-word
passwords.  I wish I could remember what it was called.  I like those
kinds of passwords.

I don't understand why some people are fixated on 8-character passwords,
and why they insist on using every character on the keyboard.  Compare
[:alnum:]{8} -- 47.6 bits of entropy with :alnum: plus punctuation --
52.5 bits.

What kind of threat model might there be where the former is
unacceptable while the latter is sufficient?  Both provide more than
enough security against a casual snoop, particularly when authentication
methods go through processes that implement wrong-password delays and/or
eventual lock-outs, and when the risk of another attack that provides
access to the password file for an offline brute-force attack is
minimal.  Neither 47 nor 52 bits is nearly enough security to resist
serious attacks by serious people with lots of hardware, TLAs, etc.
