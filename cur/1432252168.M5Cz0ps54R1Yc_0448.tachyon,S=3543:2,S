	Let us also be honest and admit that the very people Adobe products 
target are also the least likely to understand this whole thing, and often 
even less likely to care--or if they do, they might even agree with Adobe. 

	After all, they are (mostly) content producers (Illustrator, 
Photoshop etc) who have intellectual property interests themselves. 
	
	Let's face it, many if not most of the Free Software types are 
going to use The Gimp over Photoshop. kIllustrator over Illustrator, and 
well, I don't know what they'll use in place of Pagemaker, but I'd be 
happy to find out.
