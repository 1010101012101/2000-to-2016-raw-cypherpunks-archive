Subject: FYI: EU parliament strongly condemns EU/DHS treaty on PNR

Dave,

Transatlantic news again on passenger name records.

Less than four hours ago [UTC 10:30] a sweeping majority of European
members of parliament strongly condemned the new transatlantic treaty
the EU council is to sign with the DHS.

Originally there were two resolutions: A joint resolution of the
liberal, socialdemocrat, green and leftist fractions in the EU
parliament, highly critical of the treaty. The conservatives had a
resolution of their own, a pretty weak one, supported only by the
fraction UEN [right wing catholics, populists, ex-faschists etc. ]

Shortly before the vote the conservatives withdrew their resolution and
decided to vote with the majority. Even the "vote by name" procedure was
dropped, close to 90 percent of the MEPs raised their hands in consent -
to thrash EU Commissioner Franco Frattini who is to close that deal with
the DHS.

According to EU rules the parliament is in this case only being
consulted because the Council of [national] Ministers decides on foreign
and security policy.

Such a large majority in parliament - a pretty rare case - against an
undertaking of the EU Commission/Council usually _never_ goes unnoticed
by the latter.

MEPs of all major parties - from right to left - I talked to all
expressed more or less the same: "enough is enough."

Enough from what?

"Unilateralism"
