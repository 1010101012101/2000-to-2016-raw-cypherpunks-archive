The reason why FireGPG no longer ships with tails is that the DOM of a web
app is not a safe place for plaintext
https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/FireGPG_susceptible_to_devastating_attacks/
Any architecture where plaintext is stored inside a web app's DOM is
dangerous. Especially a webmail app that can be expected to save drafts,
but not only. Web apps can be MITMed, XSSed, etc. If it came via the web,
it's a suspect.

I'd expect a crypto add-on to only accept plaintext (and other sensitive)
information via separate GUI that can only be launched manually (not via
javascript in an app's DOM) and has a hard-to-imitate look-and-feel (to
discourage phishing). The only communication between this add-on and the
rest of the browser should be via the clipboard. Users who can't handle
copy/paste shouldn't be trusted with a key pair :)

>From what I see at the http://www.mailvelope.com/ slide-show, it seems to
provide even more shooting-yourself-in-the-leg firepower than FireGPG.
