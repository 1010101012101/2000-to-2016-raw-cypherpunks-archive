Red H0t News:<br>
<br>
Hollywood Intermediate, Inc. (<htni>HY</ht>WI - News), a provider of digital intermediate film mastering services, announced that High Definition preview masters as part of its normal digital intermediate service offerings and workflow.<br>
<br>
"Typically, in current post-production workflow, HD dailies masters are edited into high quality preview masters including color timing, dirt removal, opticals and visual effects," said David Waters, Hollywood Intermediate president. "Unfortunately, none of these processes translate to the theatrical release of the film as they must all be duplicated or repeated in either a higher resolution digital format, or photo chemical process."<br>
<br>
Hollywood Intermediate gives Motion Picture producers the ability to scan their selected original camera negative at 2k or 4k film resolution, conform a high resolution digital master for theatrical and broadcast release including dirt removal, opticals and visual effects, and output a High Definition preview master to be used for preview screenings and focus groups that can be deployed in any worldwide theater location.<br>
<br>
"The challenge for completing the final editorial decisions on a motion picture are balanced between the ability to display the highest resolution picture for a test audience, and the costs and time in having to re-master your film based on a test audience response," said Jim Delany, Hollywood Intermediate COO.<br>
<br>
"Hollywood Intermediate offers a flexible alternative to traditional photochemical and video post-production processes for film mastering and preview screenings eliminating cost and time redundancies," said Waters. "We expect our HD preview screening master services to provide crucial workflow efficiencies helping Hollywood Intermediate achieve market growth in the current digital intermediate and high definition marketplace."<br>
