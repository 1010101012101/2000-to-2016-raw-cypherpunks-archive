They did no such thing. In order for 'reputation' to happen in the
context of human society one would have to prove that squirrels have a
sense of 'I'. I'll leave the current research and a few minutes of
personal time with a rodent speak for that aspect.

Further, correlation <> reputation.

For example, how long after a given squirrel dedides to ignore a
particular alarm cry does the alarm cry still work? One day, two? A week?

More importantly, how many squirrels on average does a squirrel ask before
it ignores the cry?

Crap study, crap interpretation.
