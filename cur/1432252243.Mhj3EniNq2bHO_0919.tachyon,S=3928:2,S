Up until then I thought I did too...I"m not so sure any more.

It's not a clone of the HK G3 as it was explained to me, it was apparently
used as an interim weapon when the German Army dropped the HK G3 as a
standard issue weapon a few years ago (ala G11). Maybe FAL, they're
selling a 'G1' rifle that uses caseless ammo? Though I can't find a
reference to any such rifle. Maybe it was CETME you do see their gun
pushed as the 'G3' (the HK is a 'clone' or derived weapon from the Spanish
gun).

Honestly, I never could figure out exactly what was going on there. That's
why I finally dropped it. I just did some searches on google and didn't
find anything helpful.

Hope that helps.
