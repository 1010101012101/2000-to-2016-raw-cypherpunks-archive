Yeah, but this is a metadata search, correct? Seems to me Our Protectors(TM) 
are probably able to search a vast database of images themselves. In other 
words, go look for details they hadn't previously thought of as being 
important (and hence were not available in metadata). Given high-density 
CCDs and real cheap storage, these details may be very minute, or perhaps 
small+far away.
