John has yet to post a notice on his site alerting users to the log's
leaking and the possible compromise, but he has added a warning about a
"growing censor-tamper-implant-bowdlerize-redact-tag-track of archives,
torrents, drops, shares, wikis, disclosure sites." So that's something?

I guess John was right before. "Compromise should be publicized but seldom
is: *hide, deny, ignore, delude*."
