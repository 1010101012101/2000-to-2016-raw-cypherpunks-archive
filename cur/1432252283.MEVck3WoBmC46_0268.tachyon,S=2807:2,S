The specific heat of Cu is <blah> heat of vaporization is <blah> and the

melting point is <blah> and the metal is already liquid.  The metal is
<blah> grams of liquid Cu so how many joules does it take to vaporize
it?

And, where does the momentum of <blah> grams x <blah-thousand> m/sec go?

Also, just out of curiousity, what are the health effects of finely
dispersed Cu oxide ?
Does anyone make liners out of DU?  Yummy.
