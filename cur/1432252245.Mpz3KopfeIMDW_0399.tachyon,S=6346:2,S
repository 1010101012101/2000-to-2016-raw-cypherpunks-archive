No, _you_ miss the point: that I was not "incriminating" myself in any 
way.

You and your kind need to read up on Burroughs' "The Policeman Inside."

"If we do not censor ourselves, others will do it for us."

"Cypherpunks should voluntarily restrict the topics they discuss."

"We should impose voluntary self-labeling of all posts, so that Congress 
will not."

"I must not think certain thoughts, and I must report others who do."

Ah, weapons training by me and my friends is somehow counterproductive 
and dangerous? The fact that the First and Second Amendments protect 
such activities is counterproductive and dangerous to you?

Please explain how my one paragraph summary of my weekend activities 
provided "dangerous" people with knowledge they didn't already have.

Your "policeman inside" has been getting way too loud. Stop listening to 
her or him.

Your concern for me is touching, but it is inappropropriate. Some kind 
of chick thing, I guess.

Butt out.

Also, your comments were a lot more than concerns about me. You also 
implied that my exercise of my fundamental rights of free speech, free 
association, Second Amendment rights, etc. was somehow putting the list 
and its members at risk.

Why do you continue to waste our time, then? And since you have 
repeatedly urged that I simply filter you out, I say, "Physician, heal 
thyself."

Meanwhile, I'll continue to talk about what I think is important.

All of you who are calling for restraint, for self-labeling, for 
installing new moderators...I suggest you either start a new mailing 
list or set up a CDR node implementing your policies on restraint, 
labeling, and niceness.
