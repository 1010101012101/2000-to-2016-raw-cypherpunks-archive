None of the above. As rate of population, resource consumption and
toxification is faster than restoration, and war is still easier in DNA
than cooperation... humanity will burn the ecosystems humanity
depends on, or burn itself. And likely far sooner than the Earth
gets around to the next of any of its own human belching cycles [1].

All mere delay tactics without fixing this and other things to

The only clock that matters is the time till you're off the rock.
