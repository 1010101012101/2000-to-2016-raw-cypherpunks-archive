I wonder why they bother with such polls.  At this time, there is enough
legislation and political will to mandate `more government' involvement in
people's lives without the need for unscientific study.

Not only is there a need for a war to boost the flagging economy, but
obviously the future security of the human race _depends_ on omnipresent
government intrusion in the affairs of man.  

What, exactly, is gained by these silly pretences at polling the people for
their opinions when the unassailable logic of military necessity is sufficient
unto itself?  I suggest that journalists explain, in simple terms, the facts
of national security to the public.  Properly presented, the majority will
easily accept the inevitable without complaint since the only other option
will be to abandon facts and logick for chaos and uncertainty.


Regards,

Steve
