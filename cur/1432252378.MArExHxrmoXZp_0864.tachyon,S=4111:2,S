Another citation whose irrelevance demonstrates the absence of relevant cites.

The basis of the spolation charge was not that the dealer should have kept records, but that the car was disposed of when it was supposedly material evidence.

This cite, and the other cites you give, supposedly "open the door" to charging people for spolation for failing to keep records in the ordinary course of business.

Yet no one has actually gone through that door, despite the very large number of of people who do not keep records in the ordinary course of business, and the very large number of lawsuits obstructed by that failure.

Perhaps it is not a large stretch.  Yet it is a good deal bigger stretch than hitting Microsoft with a spolation suit for its new policy of routine and regularly scheduled destruction of records, and Microsoft has not yet been hit.
