I think there is a distinction between truth as an absolute, the twisted wording required to
avoid libel in the uk, and deliberately lieing to people who believe you are a source of
truth about the world they can't see.
The UK has some pretty strong rules in this area - for instance, a newsreader can't be seen
to promote (advertise) a product, as a viewer could confuse marketing (which is always a bit
suspect) with "news" (which is supposed to be unbiassed and as accurate as the broadcaster
can make it) and in libel/slander cases, the burden of proof is on the defendant - not fun
at all.

> 'Truth in media' is a sword that cuts both ways.
Indeed - but (at least in a free press) there is supposed to be a distinction between
"marketing" "news" and "propaganda". Of course, freedom of the presses has only ever been
available to those who own presses....
