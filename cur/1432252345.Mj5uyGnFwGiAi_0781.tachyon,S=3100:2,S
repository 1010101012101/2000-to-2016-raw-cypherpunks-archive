I saw a presentation from these guys at a network "dog-and-pony" show.  Based 
on their vague comments on its development, it sounds like they originally 
developed this technology for the Navy, but now are trying to commercialize 
it.

Their big claim to fame is that the electronics (including the laser) are 
connected to an optical "antenna" by fiber so that the electronics don't have
to be exposed to the elements. 

They claim that their technology can cut through all but  100% fog,  when the 
rain is falling at 6in/hr etc. etc (This is where the vague comments about 
being able to communicate between ships in a storm without being detected by 
DF equipment were made).

The stuff is pretty expensive, however ($ 10K).
