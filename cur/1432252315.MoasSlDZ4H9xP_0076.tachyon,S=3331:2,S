StarBand (http://starband.com/) is expanding internationally.  It will soon
be available in Latin America, for example.  Plus, broadband is available in
many countries already.

Amazon.com, plus massive bookstores are fairly common outside the US.  Even
Singapore has its MPH chain of bookstores.

...high paying tech jobs...
