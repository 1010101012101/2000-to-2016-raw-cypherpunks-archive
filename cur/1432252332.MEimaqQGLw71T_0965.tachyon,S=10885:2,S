represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.
