Yes but the tabloids are not examples of serious news sources; they
are titilation and shit-stirring.  They're continuously being sued for
slander, fabrication of titilating though coincidentally untrue
stories etc.

I agree news is biased also.  It just pisses me off to see major
network news who you might (or at least the average person
uninformedly does) consider to retain some level of integrity
dismissing and supressing most balanced discussion on with put-downs
involving "unpatriotic" and "unamerican".  WTF is that?  Can't they
engage in discourse where evidence and logical argument are used?

Similar vein is the apparent overnight animosity towards the French
who happened to take a different view.  It all comes down to this same
blind following of leaders, and Bush's inane statements such as "if
you're not for us you're against us".  So now France should be
boycotted because they expressed opinions not precisely aligned with
US views.  People are entitled to their opinion.  In fact if it were
not for Blair and whoever else was behind it in the UK government
over-riding public sentiment, Britain would not have been involved
either as public opinion in the UK was reportedly 80% against
involvement prior to the invasion.  In that case I suppose British
exports would now also be targets for calls for boycott.

I suppose I am just suprised and dismayed at the level of childish
behavior but on an international policy scale.
