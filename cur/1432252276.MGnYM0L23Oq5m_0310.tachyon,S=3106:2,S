The Register's front page only shows the most recent N stories,
constantly changing.  You'll need to point to the article itself,
which looks like
	http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/5/15679.html
an article Kevin Poulsen did for securityfocus.com.
It looks quite similar to the stuff John Gilmore wrote about recently,
except sleazier due to FCC involvement.
