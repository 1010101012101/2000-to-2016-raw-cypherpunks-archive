This is exactly what you asked- just read the quote.

I answered this several times already.  Listen up.  Getting people to
sign a contract excusing illegal activity does not make that activity
legal.  If it did, you would see drug dealers asking their customers
to sign contracts stating that they're not to be held accountable.
People cannot agree via contract to violate a law, then expect to be
able to enforce such a contract.  This is a concept you need to
acquire.  Contracts are not enforceable simply because there was an
agreement.  There is other criteria that must be adhered to, one of
which is law.

And?  It certainly doesn't matter to me whether we define these bozos
as a "common carrier."  What does matter is that they have a large
piece of the market share, and their illegal practices have a
significant impact on the internet community.

This is just a restatement.  I already explained that this is a
predatory and misleading contract.  If you don't accept this, then you
must make an argument to the contrary.  You would have a difficult
time arguing that AOL users are aware of the TOS.  Not a single AOLer
who I convinced to leave AOL was aware of the AOL TOS.

> Your claim that Bob was coerced is exteremely dubious.

Care to support that statement with anything?

This is because Bob isn't a real person.  Bob is a hypothetical
character used to analyze security threats and activities, and Bob
lives in a hypothetical world.  So to summons Bob to this forum is
quite a silly idea.  You'll have for find a better way of making your
point.

Why would Bob be motivated to check these pages, when Bob doesn't even
know there's a problem?  Remember, Bob is ignorant here; as Bob is not
informed that legitimate mail with his name on it is being trashed.

These quotes only prove my point that the contract is predatory.
Again, you made my point for me.

Predatory- my point exactly.  Again, you have made my case.

Bob did not give his *informed* consent to these terms, only his
consent.

Again, this is just a restatement of what you already said, and it
does not address my statement.  Companies do not exist in an isolated
vacuum with their customers.  They affect others- people who have
absolutely no contract with them.  Does this lack of contract make the
company immune to legal liabilities?  Not at all.  I sue telemarketers
on a regular basis, and I win, and collect.  I have absolutely no
contract or business relationship with these companies, but they still
manage to cause me damage, and they must deal with me when I serve
them with court papers.  In fact, if I did have a business
relationship with these companies, it would weaken my case, because
the law allows companies to telemarket their own customers.  So this
argument that I must be paying them money in order for them to be able
to damage me is absurd.

This isn't necessary.

Correct, Bob's contract with AOL does not involve me.  What I'm
talking about is AOL committing a DoS attack on me, which is
actionable regardless of Bob's contract.

The Internet doesn't have to be a "legal entity" for it to be
attacked, and have an impact on society.  Take the Slammer worm, for
example.  This thing attacked the Internet and had a huge impact on
Internet users.  If you try to explain to these users that they don't
have a claim against the attacker because the Internet is not a "legal
entity" by your terms, you'll have a very unconvincing point.  The
internet can be attacked, we've seen this.

Again, no one is arguing that AOL isn't playing by these rules that
they created.  However, AOL must still abide by the law.  And yes, I
see your restatement that I don't have a contract with AOL.  This
statement isn't effective.  It doesn't matter that I don't have a
contract with AOL.

Again, there's this constant ineffective restatement that you make.  I
don't need to have a contract with AOL to press charges against them.

This argument suffers from the Straw Man fallacy.  You're
misrepresenting my argument, then attacking the misrepresentation.

Again, I agree with the fact that I cannot sabotage the city water
line.  But here inlies a flaw in the way you approach these problems.
You then state that I can't sabotage the water line because I have
some kind of contract with the city or water company.  This is not the
reason.  This idea that you can only make a claim against someone you
have a contract with is bogus.  What if someone who has no contract
with anyone in my state enters my property and destroys the water
main- they can still be held accountable, even without a contract.
This is the concept you are missing.

Denial of service crime, located where the servers are.

Straw man fallacy.  Attack my statements, not your distorted
re-presented versions of them.

The state must protect my freedom of speech.  So when I make a claim
against AOL for conducting a DoS attack against me, the state must
rule in my favor, or else they are failing to protect my free speech
rights.

There's your repeated ineffictive argument we keep seeing.  I've shown
that I do have a valid claim against AOL, and it seems you can't argue
this without the restatement fallacy.

They can only do this if they can show libel.  However, showing AOL
users the very contract they agreed to can't really be considered libel.

I did not know AOL would destroy my packets.  I sent them fully
expecting them to arrive in the recipients inbox, and found that AOL
took an action against it.  This is how I discovered the problem to
begin with.

My ISPs contract does not state that they would blacklist my IP
address, so I have a claim there as well, but that wasn't the point of
this thread.

What I suggest to you is that you take a class in your local
university on argumentation theory 101.  Most of what you say has no
effect because it has one logical fallacy or another.  Study these
fallacies before posting; you'll find that you have to scrap most of
what you say before hitting send.
