If you are  confused about the difference between war and peace, you must 
be seriously confused about a lot of things.

Those who claim to that killing people in warfare is no different from 
killing people in peace, are more likely to exterminate subjects during 
peacetime, than they are likely to refrain from killing enemies in wartime.

Remembering that both german and non german deaths were caused by germans, 
we should use body count as a measure of evil.

Friendly fire is an accident, an error.  The murder of commies by commies 
and nazis by nazis was planned from the very beginning.
