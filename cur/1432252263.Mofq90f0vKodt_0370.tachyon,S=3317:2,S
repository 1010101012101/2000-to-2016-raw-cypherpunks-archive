Trusted time is a useful concept. I presume the time is set by the 
manufacturer. Given current clock accuracy and limited lifetime of backup 
power I presume it is possible to adjust the time via trusted timeservers.
Do they mention anything like this in the specs?

Is there any reason to believe the implementers are telling us everything,
and will implement the specs as advertised? I mean, consider the source. 
Sometimes it makes sense to look a gift horse in the mouth, especially if 
it's made from wood.
