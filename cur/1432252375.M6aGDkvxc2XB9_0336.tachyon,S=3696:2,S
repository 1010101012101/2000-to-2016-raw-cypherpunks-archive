Yes it does, it says that any time you measure a system it WILL be in an
unknown state after the measurement. No if's, no but's. It effects photons
(which I challenge you to demonstrate has 'charge') as well as electrons
and protons. It's universal. It's about measuring, not about what is being
measured.

The 2nd also comes into play because any mechanism you use to 'manipulate'
that internal state must also effect that state in a negative way.

You're screwed two ways from Sunday.
