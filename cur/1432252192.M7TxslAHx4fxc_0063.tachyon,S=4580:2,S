Iraq Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC  20520




August 22, 2003

This Travel Warning provides updated information on the security situation
in Iraq and advises Americans of the bombing at the UN headquarters that
resulted in deaths and injuries of American citizens.  The security threat
to all American citizens in Iraq remains high.  This replaces the Travel
Warning of July 15, 2003.

On August 19, 2003, an explosion occurred at the UN headquarters located at
the Canal Hotel in Baghdad.  An explosion also occurred at the Jordanian
Embassy in Baghdad on August 7, 2003.  The Department of State continues to
strongly warn U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq.  Although the
restrictions on the use of U.S. passport travel to, in or through Iraq has
been lifted, travel to Iraq remains dangerous.  Remnants of the former Baath
regime, transnational terrorists, and criminal elements remain active.
Coalition led military operations continue, and there are daily attacks
against Coalition forces throughout the country.  Attacks have occurred in
Baghdad, Faluja, Ramadi, Tikrit, Bayji, Baqubah, Mosul, Kirkuk and other
areas, but the security environment in all of Iraq remains volatile and
unpredictable.  Attacks on coalition forces as well as civilian targets
usually occur during the late evening and early morning hours.  Travel at
night is extremely dangerous.

There have been attacks on civilian as well as military convoys.  Travelers
are strongly urged to travel in convoys of at least four vehicles in
daylight hours only.  There has been an increase in the use of Improvised
Explosive Devices (IED) and/or mines on roads, particularly in plastic bags,
soda cans, and dead animals.  Grenades and explosives have been thrown into
vehicles from overpasses, particularly in crowded areas.

There is a U.S. consular officer in Baghdad who can provide limited
emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq and is located at the Iraq Forum
(Convention Center) across from the al-Rashid Hotel.  The consular officer
cannot provide visa service.  American citizens who choose to visit or
remain in Iraq despite the warning contained herein are urged to pay close
attention to their personal security, should avoid rallies and
demonstrations, and should inform the U.S. consular officer of their
presence in Iraq.

American citizens may obtain the latest security information or other
information about Iraq by phone: 1-914-360-1025, or by e-mail:
payneba@orha.centcom.mil. Detailed security information is also available at
http://www.centcom.mil.

Updated information on travel and security in Iraq may be obtained from the
Department of State by calling 1-888-407-4747 within the United States, and
from overseas, 1-317-472-2328.  U.S. citizens who plan to travel to or
remain in Iraq despite this Travel Warning should consult the Department of
State's latest Consular Information sheets and the current Worldwide Caution
Public Announcement, which are available on the Department's Internet site
at http://travel.state.gov.
