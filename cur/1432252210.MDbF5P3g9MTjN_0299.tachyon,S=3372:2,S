spielbergs 'Jurassic Park'.(the 'educational movie in movie)

http://www.badmovies.org/movies/barbarella Things to learn from this 
classic[]Orange shag carpet is the ultimate in spaceship decor. Stingrays 
are used as draft horses on other worlds. Sadistic children scream like a 
flock of seagulls. In the future sexual gratification is achieved by taking 
a pill and holding hands. (My thoughts exactly...) Orchids are not very 
filling. Angels make nests. Public suicide chambers need to be clearly 
marked. Parakeets are carnivorous. Having some woman smoke me in a bong is 
the stuff dreams are made of. The world will be swallowed by an evil lava 
lamp monster.

W.R. Mysteries of the Organism (Dusan Makavejev, 1971) Satirical 
documentary on the relationship between sex and politics. The funniest 
anti-Communist film ever made.From...http://members.aol.com/MG4273/best100.htm
