Brings to mind something my 10-year old pointed out to me soon after
9/11.  He likes to play computer war games in the Command and Conquer
/ Red Alert series.  Apparently, when you're playing the bad guys
in one of the games and attacking the US, one of your first
assignments is to wipe out the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Wonder if UBL is getting royalties from the game manufacturer?
