Note that to compile FreeS/WAN on Red Hat using the Red Hat
kernel-source RPM you need to:
	rm include/linux/modules/*.ver
before you 'make dep'.  Otherwise you get module version
brokenness.

> Some highlights:
> 
> * Diffie-Hellman group 5 is now the first group proposed.
> * Two cases where fragmentation is needed will be handled better, thanks
>    to these two changes
> 
>         The code that decides whether to send an ICMP complaint back

>         smart enough that we now feel comfortable enabling it by
> default.
>    and
> 
>         IKE (UDP/500) packets which were large enough to be fragmented
> used
>         to be mishandled, with some of the fragments failing to bypass
> IPsec
>         tunnels properly.  This has been fixed; our thanks to Hans
> Schultz.
> 
> * If Pluto gets more than one RSA key from DNS, it will now try each
> key.
>    This will help when a system administrator replaces a key.
> * There is preliminary support for building RPMs.
> * SMP support is better.
> * The team has eliminated a vulnerability that might permit a denial of 
> service
>    attack.
