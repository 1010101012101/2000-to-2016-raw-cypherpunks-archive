The CIA is the principal customer of NSA products outside
the military. When global cyber spying Cybercom was proposed
NSA did not want to do it, claiming it exceeded NSA's military
mission. However, the pols, and CIA, wanted that very excess,
in particular for spying inside the US, ostensibly banned for the
CIA but now needed for terrorists inside.

CIA (long FBI opponents) thought FBI could not cope with inside
terrorists, using 9/11 as an example, and advocated NSA involvement
with its much greater technical capability, but more importantly, its
military-privileged secrecy not susceptible to full congressional
oversight, courts and FOIA.

The joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service (SCS) has
been doing for decades what NSA is now alone accused of doing:
CIA provided the targets, NSA did the technical collection from
those global stations identified by xKeyscore (most in embassies
or nearby).

What is bizarre is how little CIA is mentioned in news furor about
NSA, as if NSA did its work in isolation from the IC and without
oversight of the 3 branches.

SCS also does burglaries, code snatches, decrypts, doc drops,
stings, ploys, blackmail, the panoply of CIA operations. The increased
civilian target panoply bestowed upon NSA came from CIA demands
channeled through ODNI.

Reviewing what little has been released of the Snowden documents
they are quite similar to what SCS has been doing with the addition
of the US as target. FISA had to be rejiggered for the US domain.

Most national leaders, like POTUS, are considered to be military
commanders thus fair game for NSA along with CIA. Nothing
exceptional about the recent revelations of spying on chiefs of
state.

NSA technical collection capability was developed for the
military, not civilian use. Now expanded to CIA full dominance
territory. FISA had to be rejiggered for using it against civilians.
And is still being rejiggered these days.

NSA's recent attempt to slough off Cybercom and return to
its military mission, has been rejected by the civilian overseers
following CIA guidance and fear-mongering of civilians, especially
those inside the US. The last thing CIA and its supporters want
is a revelation of its manipulation of civilian leaders institutionalized
by the 1947 National Security Act (also opposed by the military).
