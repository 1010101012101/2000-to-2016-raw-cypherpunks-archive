The question has nothing to do with the Constitution of the United
States--it has to do with whether or not an individual is justified in
acting in the name of "just doing my job" or "just following orders". I
would suggest that LEAs are definitely at fault for executing and
enforcing laws that are unjust.

(I in no way intend to imply that the blame should be steered away from
the originators, who are, as you point out, the legislature and executive
branch. Nor am I making a recommendation as to what determines the fabric
of "justice", although that would be an interesting topic for dicsussion.)

Your assumption that the U.S. Constitution and system of Elections have
anything to do with granting a mandate of rule to the law enforcement
community is flawed. They don't even, for what it matters, grant a true
mandate to the rest of the U.S. government anymore, with occasional
exception.
