You should say '...we "willingly" place...' all those things through one
service provider on one wire. I tried to get separate, real-copper-wire
telephone service but there's no such animal in the town where I live.
It is only available bundled together with tv and internet service and
comes via coax, fiber optic, satellite service or some combination of
the above. Which basically means the copper that was used years ago is
now unused and growing verdigris where it hasn't been ripped out already.

Consequently, I had to do something I hadn't wanted to otherwise, get
a cellphone. Which was rooted in short order, fuck Carrier IQ and all
the other third parties, there's a lot of improvement needed on that
Android front.
