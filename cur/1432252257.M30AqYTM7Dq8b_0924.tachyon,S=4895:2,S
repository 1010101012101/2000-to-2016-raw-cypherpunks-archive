Job cut out for school cops
Some 300 cardboard policemen reported for duty Monday morning on the 
streets of the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, as part of a ploy by city 
authorities to get drivers to slow down as children return to school.
The life-size cutouts painted in the cucumber green of Lithuanian police 
uniforms guarded street crossings near 90 Vilnius schools.
"We strive to ensure drivers and schoolchildren pay attention to the 
intensive traffic in Vilnius streets," Vilnius's mayor, Arturas Zuokas, 
said in a statement.
The children also guard the cops, however, taking them inside after school 
hours.
