I had previously signed to play your games. My computer was down for =
about two wks. After going back on line I  signed with you again. The =
problem is I forgot my account name and password, so I entered another =
one thinking when my computer was down I had lost everything including =
my points. I only learned my first  account name and password when I =
recieved your E-mail. So I now have 43930 points under Calliewalley =
Calico and 1556 points under Calleywalley Cat. What do I do? I would =
like to keep the name Calliewalley Calico. Do I loose my points on the =
other account name?  Thank you, Myrna Connelly
