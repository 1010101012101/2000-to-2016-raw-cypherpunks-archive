UA flight 1669 from Chicago landed safely about 3:00 pm.  Initial reports 
were of a white powdery substance being released into the air ducts by a 
man of middle eastern decent.  The plane has been surrounded by hazmat 
crews.  The 80+ passengers are still aboard.  The air conditioning had been 
turned off (its in the 90s on the tarmac right now).

I local LE spokesman just got on to say there was no powdery substance 
released, but rather some confetti from a greeting card.  So why are the 
passengers still aboard?
