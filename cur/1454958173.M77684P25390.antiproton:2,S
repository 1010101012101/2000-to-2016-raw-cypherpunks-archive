Yeah, it was still a somewhat half-formed set of thoughts I was trying to
get out there for feedback and expansion by the lazywebs. The community
idea hadn't been planted in my head yet.

Exactly. The NSA might be able to recruit the best "pure mathematicians"
who know about nothing but, while the more well-rounded folks who are good
at coming up with practical applications of their knowledge, and who are
thoughtful about the ethics of it, are left out here with us.

As long as the Powers That Be can keep us focused on "destroying the
system," they have nothing to fear from us. We remove ourselves from the
battle by isolating ourselves. This is part of why I have lost interest in
Seasteading and never really got interested in charter cities, particularly
that ridiculous "Galt's Gulch Chile". Ayn Rand imagined society resting on
the shoulders of a few very productive people, who could hurt it just by
opting out. But in fact the Powers That Be would like nothing more than for
people who aren't willing to play ball to remove themselves from society in
that way. They don't care if society at large is poorer for it. They still
control the allocation of land and mineral/fossil fuel/nuclear resources.
As long as they control those and society depends on those, the only thing
the Reardons of the world create is surplus wealth and new technology,
which only matters to the Powers That Be in a relative sense. So they just
have to make sure those who don't opt out work on their behalf and not some
enemy Power's behalf.
