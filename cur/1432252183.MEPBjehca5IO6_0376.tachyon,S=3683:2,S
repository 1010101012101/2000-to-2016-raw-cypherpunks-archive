 >>Note that there is nothing in nature which implies that force and desire 
will be mitigated in and of themselves (so much for CACL philosophy).

Not even APster? The mount everest of CALC philosophy?

 >>In fact, if one looks at game theory it becomes abundently clear, even 
given the utility of game theoretic concepts, that the best strategy is not 
to play by the rules given a choice (this helps explain why non-sentient 
biological activity conforms to game theory in many cases).<<

Evolution in a nutshell,brilliant jim,now as you live near millions of 
people who don't believe in evolution,would you please stop preaching to 
the choir and take your show on the road.

  >>This of course destroys any concept of 'utopia' where everyone plays by 
the same rules all the time without exception.<<

  These concepts are hereby outlawed.No one will speak of the lifestyles of 
pre-european polynesia,Arawak,aboriginal and west coast tribespeoples ever 
again.Should they do so they will be fed to vicious shoats.To begin to 
think is to begin to be undermined.Im worried about you jim,If the above," 
What is a 'right'?,"screed was your work,I suggest you read some of RD 
Laings "Knots".You seem trapped in a bind of some kind.Try challomile and 
even valerian teas as you read.Go up a hightower somewhere with a 
highpowered book or two.Thinking of you.
