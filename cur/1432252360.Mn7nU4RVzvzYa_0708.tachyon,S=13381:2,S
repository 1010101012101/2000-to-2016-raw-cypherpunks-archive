Freedom Insurance
by Warren Tilson
Recently in the almost hallowed pages of the not yet venerable web site=20
Anti-State.com, two articles have appeared that may point the way to gain a=
=20
free society now.
Robert Vroman's Assassination Politics and Andy Stow's defense agency=20
articles are both influences for what I am about to describe. I should=20
point out that I am unalterably opposed, on moral grounds, to Assassination=
=20
Politics. This opposition is beyond the scope of this article so I will not=
=20
go into it here. There is however an aspect of AP that appeals to me and=20
that is the naming of a freedom offending individual and asking other=20
individuals to act in a certain way towards that individual.
Stow's article describes a decentralized defense agency/society that will=20
get you out of statist caused trouble provided you are a member. Even to=20
the point of using combat troops to enable your escape from a prison if it=
=20
should come to that. This is a great idea and I think it holds some promise=
=20
even if there are some technical issues that have to be worked out.
What I am proposing is a system of insurance that if you are arrested on=20
some political crime (gun law, drug law, sex law, tax law, immigration law,=
=20
or commercial law etc. violation) lawyers will be dispatched as well as=20
activists and propagandists.
The lawyers are there to use whatever legal tactics they can to keep your=20
life from getting worse, i.e. they would get you out of jail and act as a=20
shield between you and the state's employees. This is no different than=20
what lawyers are supposed to do now, however our lawyers will have an=20
ideological bond with the person they are defending so there will be more=20
agreement on tactics and a vision of the ultimate goal which many=20
lawyer-client relationships lack now.
Civil Rights lawyers will also be sent to make sure it becomes a Civil=20
Rights issue by suing the arresting agency, its employees and all sundry=20
agencies, and their employees that are involved.
The activists and propagandists are there simply to stir up non-violent=20
trouble. Their purpose is to organize protests, run ads in the local media,=
=20
appear on local talk shows, hand out fliers, discuss jury nullification,=20
hold workshops and engage in civil disobedience. These things sometimes=20
happen in a controversial case but it is usually an ad hoc arrangement that=
=20
may lack focus, strong leadership and the resources to stay committed.
If you own Freedom Insurance and you are arrested for something your policy=
=20
covers you are guaranteed that allies and sympathizers will be on the=20
scene, coming to your aid within 24 hours. It does not matter how small the=
=20
issue, you call =96 they come.
One of the first things that the activist will do is find out all they can=
=20
about the arresting officer(s) and the prosecutor. They will then organize=
=20
peaceful protests at the residences of these people, the ads will mention=20
these people by name and ask if they know anything about freedom or the=20
Constitution or their oaths to the Constitution. In addition their families=
=20
will be sought out and asked questions such as: "Do you support your=20
husband when he violates the rights of others?" "Did you know your daughter=
=20
was acting illegally and in violation of the Constitution she has sworn to=
=20
uphold?"
The idea here is to get it in to the heads of the people who enforce these=
=20
laws that it just is too much trouble to bother with. Arrest someone with=20
an FI card and he is looking at months of living hell for him and his=20
family and friends. After awhile, if this idea is successful the mere=20
presence of a FI bumper sticker will get the driver of that vehicle a pass=
=20
or the owner of that store a pass or that prostitute a pass and so on. The=
=20
more that cops lay off FI policy holders will ensure that more and more=20
people will join and in this way the state will be undercut.
As people realize that the police have no will to enforce evil laws those=20
laws will be disobeyed by millions. If what usually happens when a people=20
are free to go about their business we will see a massive increase in the=20
standard of living with all the usual happiness that follows from that.
After awhile this might very well evolve into Stow's Defense Agency and=20
from there the state will be halfway into the grave.
Of course (another nod to AP) it should be pointed out that all the main=20
offices and computer servers will be located outside of the USA and all=20
communication will take place with the aid of encryption.
Let's give it a push: become a Freedom Insurance owner today. Call the home=
=20
office for a representative near you.
