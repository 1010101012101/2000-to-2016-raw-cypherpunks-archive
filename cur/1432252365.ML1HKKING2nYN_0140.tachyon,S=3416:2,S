Say hi to Jim for me, and even though I did not know him very well I
remember his AP paper and read it with great interest.  Sometimes I
chuckle when I happen upon one of his posts in the cypherpunks list
archives from the 1990s.  Things aren't so much different today from
those days in relation to global hegemony of big business and
irresponsible government.  Tell Jim that I wish him well and that I
support his right to express his opinions to whomever wants to hear
them.  He's an ideas man and should be able to contribute whatever he
can to the store of human knowledge, as much as anyone else can.


Regards,

Steve
