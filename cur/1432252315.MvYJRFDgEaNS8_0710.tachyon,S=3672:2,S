"...In general, the insurance scheme is expected to operate along similar 
lines to that of Pool Re, which was set up by the British Government at the 
height of the IRA's terror campaign. Under that scheme, premiums cover 
bombings and, if reserves are exhausted, member companies contribute 
another 10 per cent, with any remaining liabilities idemnified by the 
British Government."

How many of these free market capitalists love the Govt tit?
