In ATM the cost was unfilled buckets... here, filling them
even with junk (if not useful protocol)... is beneficial to you.

Tradeoffs may also have sweet spots and asymmetric scales.

The other meaning of "fast load" vs "$cost" is of bandwidth / bytes
choices of the user to their ISP which is another topic and never "free".

Hiding participants to a communication from each other, negotiating
their own encryption over the path, and confounding vanilla hop by hop
backtracing by police level jurisdiction based authorities. That's mostly it.

This is more a function of TCP's natural performance over WAN
than anything else. Also some OS's like FreeBSD now have
quite improved bandwidth x delay product handling in their stacks.

(tor-relays should really evaluate this when considering which
OS's to deploy as relays.)

s/competition/nature/ , which may end up being achievable
with other designs as well.

Well, then go find funding from an enemy of your enemy who also has
no issue with what you're building. Or just don't accept strange money.
How many of you donated or bought anything? Oh noes!, the influence.
Next!

They've said as much. At least users can turn it on.

This is a head-in-sand mindset problem. They are useless to you
and will only hold you back. Go find other development partners.

Yes. ie: All of the current strong anonymity overlay networks successfully
fend off and are immune to the copyright MAFIAA, and all manner of other
civil, police and non-state adversaries. (Note that's real world in practice
now, vs current academic research attacks that may be deployed in
production by them in the future. And that's at the protocol of the network
level, not the age-old application layer exploit level.)

Yes. Physical location separation plus non pattern generation.

Yes. Though it still supplies profiling database and parallel
construction in that mode.

Tor is fundamentally a tunneled circuit based encrypted network.
It was designed roughly 15 years before Snowden's confirmations
and before 911 in a time when networks were still mostly trusted
and GPA's effectively spying at scale much less attacking were only
in the minds of crackpot cypherpunks.

Tor's circuit design probably doesn't lend itself to fill traffic / management,
and bolting it on the side may be non ideal. (Those are open questions.)
Yet "Tor" without its original design model could hardly longer be called
Tor (or TOR) at that point.

If you want fill traffic, you're probably better off forking and gutting
it, or starting something completely new that incorporates ideas
from knowledge both inclusive and post Tor's design.

Tor is great at what it does well, which is a lot.
You just have to know what that is, and find (or make
in it or elsewhere) what it isn't good at.

You'll be dead by then. It's more fun to risk dying now ;)


Tor is looking at some forms of network fill traffic, which may
or may not be integrated to the entire network wide sense, or
useful in your own designs...
