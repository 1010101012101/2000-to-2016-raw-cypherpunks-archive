According to the New World Order, no.
 
In other news, the Germans now have an ID with
biometrics in it (my old one is not due to expire for many years,
and I'm not sure whether I should not just let it lapse). 
And police now can obtain fingerprints via mobile online
scanners from people without IDs, at least in Hessen.

The sheep do not seem to be bothered, so far.
