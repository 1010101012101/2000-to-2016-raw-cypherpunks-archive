CY's article ( the crypto portion ) :

The world is changing, new technologies sometimes have nasty
applications.

So let's embrace the illusion that governments can actually control
everything and protect us from what scares us.

In short, let's stick our collective heads in the sand and avoid
evolving because the outcome is uncertain. 

That makes the outcome certain and not in our favor.

Definitely not welcome in my foxhole. What a dipshit.
