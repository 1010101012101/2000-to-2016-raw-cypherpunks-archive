So you're American, and some rogue trainers, agency guys and atheletes
have been doping, like say your cyclists, sprinters and the odd swimmer.

Since this doping scandal is "systemic" in North Amerika, it is
evidently appropriate to ban all American's from participating at the
games, unless they can prove their innocence.

Oh, and just to teach a lesson, those atheletes that have never been
involved in doping, if and only if they can prove they never doped their
bodies, well they can participate in the upcoming Olympics, but they are
not allowed to represent North America, and if the get a gold medal, the
American national anthem will NOT be played - since Russia is hosting
the Olympics, the Russian national anthem will be played instead.

That is definitely fair and appropriate to the North American athletes
who have always done the right thing - a little bit of healthy
national and personal punishment before any trial and before any
conviction.

Yep, that's how a democratic world should definitely work. Just the way
I thought of it too there Sean.


Not!


Western schooled persons (no point calling them humans) have lost touch
with empathy, justice, don't even comprehend the rule of law and checks
and balances, innocence until proven guilty and all that democratic
"rubbish".
