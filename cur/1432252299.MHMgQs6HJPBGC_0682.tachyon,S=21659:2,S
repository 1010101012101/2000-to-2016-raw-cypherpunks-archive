   Once again, StockNight has been presented with the opportunity to
   provide to our members a press release issued AFTER market,
   meaning that unlike the majority of corporate news the average

   been acted on by the investing community. Whenever possible, we
   strongly encourage companies to put the news we feature out after
   the bell to level the playing field and give OUR subscribers a
   chance to react FIRST.

   Like the rest of you, we have been barraged with news about the
   "Energy Crisis" and the urgent measures being discussed to remedy
   the problem. To gauge the magnitude of this issue in the media
   simply look at the coverage CNN is giving it. <Read Energy Crisis
   News>

   As you read further in today's StockNight  you'll also find that
   the issue is now quite global.

   Today's breaking news comes from  a company whose business is in
   the heart of this electric issue. TechLite (OTCBB: THLT) can help
   clients take their first step towards  energy conservation. They
   provide state-of-the-art energy efficient lighting retrofit
   components which can provide more and better lighting while

   THLT BREAKING NEWS

   Tuesday's News
   TechLite Announces International Expansion. Brazil office to Open.

   J.D. Arvidson, President of TechLite, Inc. announced that TechLite
   is in the process of opening a TechLite branch in Sao Paulo,
   Brazil.

   Arvidson points out that Brazil, which is currently beginning six
   months of obligatory electricity rationing, is faced with an
   energy crisis that is rapidly getting worse and threatens to
   cripple Latin America's largest economy. This obligatory
   electricity rationing is in response to what increasingly
   resembles a California-style energy crisis.

   Three quarters of the 170 million Brazilians have been told that
   they must immediately cut consumption by 20% or face rolling
   black-outs and unscheduled power interruptions. Few Brazilians had
   any inkling of the seriousness of the crisis until the government
   announced the conservation measures in mid-May, sparing only the
   Amazon districts and the far South. As the harsh reality of the
   situation sinks in, the initial shock and anger are giving way to
   a grim realization that nearly every aspect of life will be
   curtailed.
