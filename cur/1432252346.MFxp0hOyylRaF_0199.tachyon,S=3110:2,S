Where does this "citizen in good standing" stuff come from? I see it a 
lot from what I will call "weak Second Amendment" supporters. They talk 
about "good citizens" and "law-abiding citizens" as having Second 
Amendment rights.

If someone has been apprehended and convicted and imprisoned for a real 
crime, then of course various of their normal rights are no longer in 
forced. If, however, they are out of prison then all of their rights, 
including speech, religion, assembly, firearms, due process, security 
of their possessions and property, speedy trial, blah blah blah are of 
course in force.

As a felon, which I am, do I not have First Amendment rights? As a 
felon, and certainly not a citizen in good standing, have I lost my 
other rights?

To all who say "Yes," including most of the Eurotrash collectivists 
here, I say your legacy shall be smoke. Tens of millions, perhaps 
billions, need to be sent up the chimneys.
