First, Bob should cut back on his massive cross-posting to his several 
self-centered groups (including new ones to me: "Philodex Clips" and 
"dgcchat").

Second, those from other lists who give their hero his "props" (a negro 
term now being used by many negro wannabees) should do so on lists 
other than Cypherpunks.

Third, I wonder when Bob will stop proliferating "digibucks" and 
"bearer settlement" and "e$" and "Philodex Clips" and all of his other 
lists and instead actually _work on_ his "fractally geodesic 
multi-centered emergent global clearing" b.s. Unless his real career 
is, as many suspect, just endless self-promotion using  the latest 
snake oil buzzwords.
