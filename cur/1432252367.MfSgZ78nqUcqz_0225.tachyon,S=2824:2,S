Assume that you could nearly guarantee a profit of $5mil or more by
shorting your stocks before a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.

Would you perpetrate such a crime, and frame the "sand-niggers"?

How much potential profit would be necessary for a crime like this to
occur with profit as the only motive?
