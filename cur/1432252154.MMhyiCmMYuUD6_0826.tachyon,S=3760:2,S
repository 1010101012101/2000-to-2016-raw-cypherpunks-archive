My husband and I volunteer with the Red Cross, our local volunteer fire 
department and emergency management in Hardin and Tyler counties of Texas.
We are on the planning committee of the Lamar Institute of Technology's 
homeland security crisis management team, which is a regional endeavor to 
coordinate emergency management programs, as well as bring computer 
emergency response training and other aspects of our president's homeland 
security/defense programs into our locales.
We are, and will continue to be, honored to be a part of these efforts as 
volunteers.
Sunnie and Richard Baldwin
