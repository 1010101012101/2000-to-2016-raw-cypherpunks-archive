Declan brought this up in a "sky-is-falling" article about remailers and 
anti-spam legislation. I do not believe this is a valid threat.

Mail from "juicy@melontraffickers.com" does come from the 
melontraffickers.com server. It is not forged.

(Such legistion would protect against unfortunate instances like the 
flowers.com case.)

This *would* require some remailers, like frog2, to stop allowing "From:" 
line specification. But that's hardly a big issue.

Unless the next Tim McVeigh ever uses a remailer in his life.

Mark my words: The next major act of domestic terrorism will somehow
involve either crypto or remailers, *according to the government 
investigators' reports.*

Insert appropriate fnords where necessary.
