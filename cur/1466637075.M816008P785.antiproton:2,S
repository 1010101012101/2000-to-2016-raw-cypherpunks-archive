I don't know Boyce, Juan.  He certainly doesn't know me too.  Also you, my
dear.

I have no much pride.  I don't care about "begging", if the reasons are
important for me and other persons.

I want to learn more about Tor Project and I want to do it using my real
name and this personal account, because I use it for mailing and discussion
lists.  I have lots of accounts, but this is the public one, the less
important account.

I hate moderation, but I was and I am moderator in several lists, because I
am considered transparent and everybody can contact me easily, Juan.

My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent
past, had a really negative impact in one of the lists that I used to
moderate.  A poisounous guy made a real chaos in the discuss list.

It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person
that I put under moderation until now.

After being advertised about the moderation, he left a much more than 2.000
persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.

After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration
and respect, not censure.

A moderator can be an injust person and I already was victim of it several
times, but the moderator role in all the lists is protecting them and their
members.  I am a moderator and already was under moderation.  I know both
positions.

If you want, I can send all the references in private.  You will discover
that I know censure and harassment in a very intimate way, Juan.  Lots of
lovely traums to haunt me all the nights, my dear...

Cecilia
