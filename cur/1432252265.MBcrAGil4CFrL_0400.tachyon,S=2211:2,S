They claim to be releasing code for PCs for free.

Since they use GSM *data* services, and since quality affects *delay* in
their
setup, they may be hindered by users acceptance.  However, it might also

be a reminder to the users of why they payed the kiloEuros.

Read their FAQ. They have total clue.  No one should think less of them
for trying to make a Euro at first, paid by users well able to pay the
price,
endure the problems, and Metcalfe's law inconveniences.
That's techonomics -CD players cost a kilobuck at first, and not every
content was available.
