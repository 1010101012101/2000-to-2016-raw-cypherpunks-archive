Sunder raises a good point about Netscape (and potentially other software
as well) amd forwarding URL's with attached content.

Why is the page attached? Because Netscape attaches the page and doesn't
offer a way to send only the URL from right click -> send page. There
isn't a switch to set default behaviour (and there should be).

So, if you got a bitch about your copyright being infringed, take it to
Netscape since they wrote the program without a mechanism that prevents
users from committing copyright infringement. Of course this opens a
perfect opportunity for LEA's to justify setting at least some basic
programming guidelines that we'd all have to comply with...

As to using HTML, this is 2000 (soon to be 2001). Get used to it. Hell, I
might start embedding ANSI VT100 color codes and the occassional ^g.
Animated ANSI would be pretty cool too. If I get the time I might even
install TurBoard and MGE under an emulation and start including NAPLPS
graphics while I'm at it. I don't have words to express the frustration I
have with straight ASCII text and doing technical work at times (but
that's another issue).
