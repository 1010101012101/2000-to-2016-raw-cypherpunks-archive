FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Jan. 28, 2001

Libertarian Futurist Society announces first national conference
(Reply to mikegrossb@aol.com)

     The Libertarian Futurist Society will celebrate its 20th anniversary by
sponsoring its first national conference May 25-27 at Marcon 36 at the Hyatt
Regency hotel and Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio.

      LFScon will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear Prometheus Award
winners and LFS leaders explore the future of freedom and the potential of
libertarian science fiction to shape a more rational, diverse, tolerant and
optimistic vision of what is possible in the 21st and coming centuries.

     The Libertarian Futurist Society will present its 2001 Prometheus Hall of
Fame awards ceremony before an audience of more than 1,500 people during the
intermission of Marcon's Saturday night masquerade-- its most popular event.

     LFScon will feature more Prometheus Awardwinning novelists than any other
sf convention or libertarian conference in history.  So far, the LFS has
confirmed eight Prometheus Awardwinners, who collectively have won 11 Best
Novel awards and five Hall of Fame awards: special LFScon Guest of Honor L.
Neil Smith (The Probability Broach, Pallas), Poul Anderson (Trader to the
Stars, The Stars are Also Fire, The Star Fox), F. Paul Wilson (Healer, Wheels
within Wheels, An Enemy of the State), James Hogan (Voyage From Yesteryear,
The Multiplex Man), Vernor Vinge (Marooned in Realtime, A Deepness in the
Sky), J. Neil Schulman (Alongside Night, The Rainbow Cadenza), Brad
Linaweaver (Moon of Ice) and Victor Milan (The Cybernetic Samurai.)

      Marcon and LFScon are jointly planning a major LFScon program track,
with a dozen major panels on libertarian themes, including:
* Heinlein's Children: The Libertarian Writers of Science Fiction.’ with a
full panel of our Prometheus Awardwinners;
* Will the Future Be More or Less Free?
* Who Wants to Be a Zillionaire in Space?- A Free Market Approach to
Exploring, Industrializing and Colonizing the Solar System
* Intelligent Self-Defense, the 2nd Amendment and the Hi-Tech Weaponry of the
Future
* The Internet & the First Amendment’ Electronic Frontiers
* Illuminati! -- Conspiracies, Real and Imagined
* Cloning & Artificial intelligence: The Freedom Issues
* Freedom Filk:  A Filk (sf folksinging) Concert in Honor of Liberty, with
filking pioneer Karen Anderson, Poul Anderson's wife.

    As Ohio's oldest and largest sf/fantasy convention, Marcon annually
attracts more than 3,000 people (3,400 last year), including authors,
artists, editors, scientists, costumers, gamers and fans from more than 30
states and Canada.  There's something for everyone, including autographing
sessions (with all  Prometheus Awardwinners); author readings; dances;
parties (including an LFS Friday night bash in a Hyatt Hotel suite); art show
& auction; charity auction; panel discussions on separate program tracks
about literature, science, animation, art, children's programming and more;
and a large dealer's room (with 120 tables, including a large Libertarian
Futurist Society exhibit/book-sale.)

     Besides freedom, Marcon's other 2001 program themes will be intelligence
(in honor of  2001: A Space Odyssey's and "2001" guest star Gary
Lockwood) and heroic fantasy (in honor of Marcon fantasy guest Robert
Jordan.)  Other featured Marcon/LFScon guests include ’ Babylon 5's actor
Peter Woodward,  libertarian sf authors Steven Burgauer ("The Grandfather
Paradox,’The Last American) and Joseph Martino (author of  "Science
Funding: Politics & Porkbarrel" and  "Analog" short stories); First
Amendment/Internet advocate Matt Gaylor; and LFS leaders Victoria Varga, Amy
Rule, Chris Hibbert and Lynn Maners.

      Deadline is March 10 for advance-discount LFScon/Marcon
registrations--with a special offer of $75/person for non-members, including
a trial-year Basic LFS membership, and $60/person for new LFS members's
guests. Mail your name, address, email, phone number and guest names along
