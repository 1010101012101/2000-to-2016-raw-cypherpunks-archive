No org headed by a lawyer will break the law, on the contrary will
enforce it stringently, above and below the table. Nor will a journalist
working for a commercial outlet. The perks of privilege for both
industries are just too beneficial. (WikiLeaks was taken over by
lawyers and journalists precursing Snowden's takeover.)

Oh, and they shop clients and sources through confabs in chambers
and consultation with officials, and, really nasty, by access to
classified and secret information. Does that sound like dual-use
comsec, yes, that is what it is.

Far too many lawyers are in government. Push some techs. Go
crazy, push a bunch of cryptographer. Not those under control of
in thrall to lawyers. Any of those charismatics untethered?

Coda: IANAL is never to be flashed as a sign of cowardice, brain-washing,
intimidation, ignorance. It's other side of the king's coin of Godwin's Law.
