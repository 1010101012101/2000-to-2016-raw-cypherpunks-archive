MH17.

Here, conventional fool-proof armchair analyses of Russia's sad attempt 
to to cover it up. Anyway, forensic analyses is still under way. We'll 
know what happened eventually.

https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/31/mh17-forensic-analysis-of-satellite-images-released-by-the-russian-ministry-of-defence/

Full report  proving without reasonable doubt that the Russian version 
of the story is made up. The image verification narrowed it down to 
Photoshop version they used to cook the evidence with.

https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_EN.pdf

There are over a million supporting images, video and documents that 
support the claim that it was in fact  a Russian BUK SAM-launcher system.

The supporting evidence is so thorough, complete with the identity of 
the supporting logistics brigade. Complete with selfies from Vkontakte, 
the Russian facebook. So yea, even the Russians are apparently very much 
aware of what they did. The service men are obviously dumb enough to 
blog about it.

So, yea, there's that.
