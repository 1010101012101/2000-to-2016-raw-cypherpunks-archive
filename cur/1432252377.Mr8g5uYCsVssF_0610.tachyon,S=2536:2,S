that, of course, depends mostly on what you consider the "original". for
the current FAQ thread, the original problem description given does read
very much like using one specific software IS an acceptable option.

nobody's discussing that point, jim. not now or in the past. we are all
very well aware of the fact that you can easily define the problem in a
way that is unsolvable. fortunately, most real-world problems do have
constraints on them that redefine the problem to one that CAN be solved,
often trivially.
