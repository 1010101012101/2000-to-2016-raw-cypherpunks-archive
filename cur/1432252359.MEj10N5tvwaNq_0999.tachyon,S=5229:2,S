i feel your pain...

sort of; there are some interesting attacks using a force-pushed
silent PRL update (see DC19/DC20 cell attacks threads) which would be
observable by tower ID oddities, not to mention decremented or zero
PRL version.  however, you'd have to be paying attention (who checks
their PRL regularly? :).

if you simply check if a tower is in
http://www.opencellid.org/cell/list for example, you're open to
attacks spoofing a legitimate but remote (out of range) tower.

using direction finding techniques to cross reference the transmitter
location against the expected GPS coordinates in a tower database
relative to your position would also detect these tower impersonators,
but requires more hardware than a mobile baseband...

the expensive, limited distribution kit will be hard to distinguish
without a high performance software defined radio.  if you're able to
detect an identically spoofed tower using OsmocomBB with high
confidence i'd love to know how you did it!

truth.  also, an inversion of observed data link capacity (suddenly
seeing receive bandwidth drop in half or more while transmit rate
doubles) is no bueno.
