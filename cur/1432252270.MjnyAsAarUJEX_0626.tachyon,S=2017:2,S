If you look at http://cnews.tribune.com/news/image/0,1119,oso-nation-82373,00.html
you see the gripe about the Palm Beach
ballots.  

What they dont mention is that, by
the same visual-illiteracy that
lets Gore votes go to Buchanan, 
votes for Browne go to Gore.

There is far more difference between
Browne  Gore than between Gore 
Buchanan.  The libs ought to be
furious.
