Another article on the same topic. Although I like the phrase
"complete sovereignty of information" I think it is vague - seems they
mean "Russian government sovereignty over all domestic information
processing" or something, which of course will have positive flow on
effects, at least in the medium to longer term, for the domestic
Russian software industry. Way to go Russia! More countries should act
in such a protectionist way. What's the point of a country if it
doesn't look after its own citizens and national interests?

Russia Restricts Use of Foreign Software in Battle for ‘Information Sovereignty’

VedomostiUnder Friday's order, authorities will draw up a register of
Russian computer programs that will verify the Russianness of software
and promote its use.

Russian officials will be barred from using foreign software from next
year if a Russian version exists. The move, which is aimed at boosting
Russia's national security and the country's tech industry, could cost
foreign firms hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues.

The rules apply to local and national government entities and come
into force on Jan. 1, 2016, according to an order signed by Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the government's website on
Friday.

The order is part of a drive to wean Russia off imports in key areas
of industry that was accelerated after Moscow's falling out with the
West over Ukraine last year.

It is also linked to fears of spying and sabotage by foreign
intelligence services, who are feared to have access to software and
equipment developed in their countries. This anxiety has led to calls
to boycott iPhones, build a Russian operating system to rival
Microsoft's Windows, and tighten control of the Internet.

As Communications and Mass Media Minister Nikolai Nikiforov put it a
year ago: "We stand for complete sovereignty of information."

Under Friday's order, authorities will draw up a register of Russian
computer programs that will verify the Russianness of software and
promote its use.

Foreign software giants such as SAP, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft
recorded sales in Russia worth around $1.4 billion last year,
accounting for some three-quarters of the market, according to news
agency RBC. This included sales worth 20 billion rubles ($300 million)
to government entities, the Kommersant newspaper reported.

It is not clear how much foreign-made software has no analogue in
Russia, but the government is promoting local production. It also
seeks to train more programmers, though the most talented often end up
in the tech hubs of California.

Earlier this month Kommersant obtained a letter from the Association
of European Businesses, a Moscow lobby group, warning that the planned
law restricting use of non-Russian software would likely see foreign
companies freeze investment or pull out of Russia.
