Thank you for writing!  Because of the massive volume of e-mail messages I
receive -- many of which are from people outside my district -- I must ask
that you use the "Write Your Representative" service.  This service ensures
that your message will go to the correct member of Congress.

To send a message, visit http://www.house.gov/writerep/.  Please be sure
your name and address are entered correctly, as I cannot respond to e-mails
from constituents that do not contain a return address.

This is the only response you will receive to your message addressed to
dennis.moore@mail.house.gov, so please use the Write Your Representative
service by clicking the above link or by visiting my website at
http://www.house.gov/moore.

Thank you!

Very truly yours,

Dennis Moore
Member of Congress
