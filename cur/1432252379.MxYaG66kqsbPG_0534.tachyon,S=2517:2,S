Which Apple drives? Is there such a thing as an Apple firewire drive, and
if so does it use the Oxford 922 bridge chipset? This is the closest product
I am aware of:
http://www.apple.com/ipod/

It's firewire 400 and most assuredly does not use a 922 chip.

If software companies were responsible for bugs in hardware that they do not
manufacture, MS would be in much more trouble than it is already.
