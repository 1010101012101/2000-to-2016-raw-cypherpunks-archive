That standard is used increasingly often. I've had it used against me, 
more than a decade ago. Just fit this in with "conspiracy" and 
"attempt" and other fuzzy crimes; they're good for prosecutors because 
they don't demand hard evidence and juries in practice tend to side 
with the prosecution. ("If he didn't commit the crime, they wouldn't 
have arrested him.")

Welcome to the new thought crime, where you don't even have to have 
thought the forbidden, thought; it's enough that someone thinks you 
thought it.

Many of the nodes filter out mattd/proffr's posts. I think Jim Choate's 
node (see http://einstein.ssz.com/cdr) delivers his posts, along with 
viagra ads and other garbage.
