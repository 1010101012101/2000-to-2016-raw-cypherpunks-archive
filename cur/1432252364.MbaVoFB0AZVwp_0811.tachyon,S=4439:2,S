    JERUSALEM (September 16) - About 1,500
               Palestinians, many supporters of Hamas, marched in a
               Gaza Strip refugee camp Friday, burning Israeli flags and

               carrying a large poster of Osama bin Laden, an exiled
               Saudi millionaire who US Secretary of State Colin
               Powell has named a key suspect in last week's terror
               attacks in the United States.

               After the rally, plainclothes Palestinian policemen
               questioned several journalists, including members of
               foreign news agencies, and confiscated videotape, film,
               and other camera equipment. An Associated Press
               Television News video was among the materials taken,
               and an AP photographer was warned by officials not to
               publish pictures of the bin Laden poster.

               AP protested and demanded the return of the video and
               other material.

               The journalists were told police would review the
               material before deciding whether or not to release it.

               Palestinian Authority officials refused to comment on the

               record and did not respond immediately to AP's protest.

               The Palestinian Police said in a statement that the rally
in
               the Nusseirat refugee camp took place without a permit.

               "The Palestinian Police confiscated media material which
               documented illegal acts," the statement said.

               Earlier last week, Palestinian Police stopped camera
               teams and photographers from covering a rally in Nablus
               in which several thousand Palestinians celebrated the
               attacks in the US. Palestinian officials said the
               demonstration did not represent widespread Palestinian
               opinion.

               According to one source, the Reuters correspondent in
               Nablus not only agreed to the PA demand not to
               document the rally, but attempted to press his AP
               counterpart to follow suit. He was unable to reach him in

               time. The AP cameraman later received death threats.
