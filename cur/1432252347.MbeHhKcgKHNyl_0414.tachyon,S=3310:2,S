The various CDRs should deal with this-- they keep track of
which Message-IDs they have posted, and don't post messages
that they have already posted.  They do pass those messages
on to the other CDRs that they peer with though, so by posting
two messages you're adding to the number of messages
that get sent on the "backbone"...

I also noticed some duplicate messages, but I haven't had
time to check out why they occured.  If you sent them as two
seperate messages to two different CDRs instead of putting both
CDRs in the To: or Cc: line, that'd cause duplicates.

I don't know how you'd get messages from two nodes unless you're
subscribed to two nodes.
