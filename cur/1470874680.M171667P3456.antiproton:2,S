Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.

I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".

So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their
gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.
