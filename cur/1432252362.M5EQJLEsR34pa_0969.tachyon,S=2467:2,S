   jangobongo writes "Researchers at the [1]VTT Technical Research Centre
   of Finland have come up with a unique way to secure your cell phone if
   it should get lost or stolen: 'Gait code'. Motion sensors in the phone
   would [2]monitor the walking pattern (or gait) of whoever is in
   possession of the phone, and if the 'gait' doesn't match a
   pre-established biometric the phone would require a password to
   operate. The prototype cell phone correctly identified when it was
   being carried by someone other than its owner 98% of the time. The
   research team [3]points out (powerpoint document) that this method
   could also work for PDAs, laptops, USB tokens, smart cards, wallets,
   suitcases, and guns."
