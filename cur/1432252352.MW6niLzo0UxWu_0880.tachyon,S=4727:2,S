Speaking of physics, your physics is out of whack.

For the recoilless rifle described above, there is no need to 
"dissipate the KE" of the flakes or anything else! Once the flakes 
(or whatever) are propelled backward, it doesn't matter whether they 
flutter in the wind or fly to China. (This is all very similar to the 
common misconception that rockets "push" on the atmosphere as they 
expel exhaust particles. They don't.)

And KE (kinetic energy, for anyone just joining in and wondering) is 
not what matters for recoil calculations. Momentum, MV, is what 
matters.

How this Irish makeshift recoilless rifle actually works is unknown 
to me, but the dissipation of KE by the chaff is not germane. The 
expulsions of some mass (M) at some velocity (V) is germane, as 
above, but not the way the mass behaves once it has been propelled 
backward.
