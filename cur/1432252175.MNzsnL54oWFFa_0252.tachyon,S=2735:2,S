A question for those who've built NAT traversal for their apps in the
past: If you were starting from scratch today, how would you do it? Is
there a library you think has everything you need (libjingle, pjnath,
amicima, socialvpn, etc)? Or would you roll your own, perhaps
implementing ANTS
(http://nattest.net.in.tum.de/pubs/globecom09-draft.pdf) instead of
ICE? What if you need super-high success rates for direct connectivity
(+95%)?

Would you use libutp (https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp) or
libjingle's psuedo-tcp classes, or some other, or just use plain UDP
and manage segmentation/retransmit/reordering yourself?

I know this is a well trodden topic in p2p-hackers, but things change
quickly, and although most of the above have been mentioned in passing
in the past year here, I haven't seen a good drag-down, knock-out,
"Here's the Best Way To Do It" discussion in a while. Any takers?

Alen
