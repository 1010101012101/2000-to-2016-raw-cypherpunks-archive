Thanks for proving my point. (For the intellectually impaired: the
Constitution never DOES anything. Your magical belief in its virtues is
equivalent to pagan's beliefs in idols: they accomplish nothing. A law must
be backed by force - and it's the FORCE that does this or that, not the
law.)

Yes, I am sure that imagining the Constitution standing will make it much
easier. Delusions are known to do that.

Great. Try rephrasing it without using metaphors, idioms, or whatever.

I'm not objecting to the language; English is fine. I'm objecting to
delusions. Laws don't ACT, no matter what language you're using.

You should rely more on your guns and less on your papers.
