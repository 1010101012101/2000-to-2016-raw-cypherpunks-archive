Chomsky lies. You repeat the sentiments of Chomsky and thus you are 
support Chomsky and are thus a liar and a supporter of the KGB High 
Command and a lap dog of the running dogs of the Kremlin.

You obviously endorse the views of George McGovern and other pinko(e)s

Chomsky lies. and you are obviously a sock puppet for the Trilateralist 
Bilderbergers.


--Tim May, who has noticed for a long time that the cadence and even 
the phrasing that James Donald uses is remarkably like the cadence of 
those who used to talk about "the running dogs of capitalism." But he 
uses replacement phrases like "sock puppets of the KGB" instead. Which 
I guess shows that his indoctrination ran deep, though he is now 
ostensibly infiltrating the libertarian fringe.
