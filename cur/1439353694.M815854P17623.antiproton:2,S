I was commenting more on your aggregate output. But who am I to judge?

If they do, they're not sharing ;)

Spying on traffic, sure. But end-to-end encryption can provide some
privacy. And it's possible to anonymize the metadata. If I care to, I
can work through chains of proxies, using anonymously leased VPS with
minimal desktops, and remote X via ssh from one to the next, routed
through nested chains of VPNs and/or Tor. Latency gets huge, but it's
usable.

How do you imagine that users would have power? Even if you and your
friends built your own private Internet, I can't imagine that you've
give too much power to other random users. You'd be hosed all too soon.

True. But the Internet is far less manageable than that.

I was talking about publishing results of surveillance. Have you checked
out any of the Sony or Hacking Team data dumps?

Manning's dump was huge, Juan!

Yes, but it does help us improve our OPSEC.

I've followed this stuff for 20 years, and I'm a fairly technical guy,
so broadly speaking, there weren't many surprises. Indeed, although the
NSA has immense resources, Google is far more technical. According to
Silicon Jungle, the NSA hired Google to build the search component of
XKeyscore ;)

Maybe the nature hasn't changed, but the effectiveness has. For example,
Google encrypted its data center interlinks. I'm sure that others are
locking down their shit too.

Well, the NSA certainly can. And China is coming up fast.

But individuals lack structures for cooperation. That's a hard problem.
