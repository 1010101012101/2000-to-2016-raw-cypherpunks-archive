A Michigan congressman is looking into launching a federal investigation of 
the problem of toxic mold in the United States,
         Michigan Lawyers Weekly has learned.
Meanwhile, a number of state legislators are about to introduce a bill in 
Lansing to address toxic mold in this state, a problem that was first 
reported in a recent issue of
           Michigan Lawyers
         Weekly. ("Toxic Mold Litigation Takes Hold In Michigan," July 30.)
So-called "toxic molds" infest porous building materials like wood and 
drywall inside homes and other buildings. The molds release poisonous 
mycotoxins that can have grave health effects, especially on children, the 
elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Experts say that 
remediation is often difficult, hazardous and expensive. Health effects can 
be permanent.
