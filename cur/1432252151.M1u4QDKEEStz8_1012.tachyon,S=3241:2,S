No problem if I also have a kitchen knife.

TCPA and Palladium give someone else super root privileges on my
machine, and TAKE THOSE PRIVILEGES AWAY FROM ME.  All claims that
they will not do this are not claims that they will not do this,
but are merely claims that the possessor of super root privilege
on my machine is going to be a very very nice guy, unlike my
wickedly piratical and incompetently trojan horse running self.
