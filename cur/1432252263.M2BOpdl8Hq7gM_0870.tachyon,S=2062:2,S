Since forever. Since before either of us joined the list (and I first 
started reading a decade ago).

It's a matter of politeness and degree. A pointer to a discussion archived 
on the web is more useful than dozens of forwarded messages.

Hey, I have an idea! Why don't I write a script crossposting everything 
from sci.crypt to cypherpunks! How about a few dozen other "on-topic" 
newsgroups and mailing lists too?
