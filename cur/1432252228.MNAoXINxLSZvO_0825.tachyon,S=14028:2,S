OK...does anyone know why the NSA has such a facility out there? Not a lot 
of the most useful information these days is natively not of fiber plant.

I know that the area is famous for maintaining radio silence for large 
swathes of spectrum (I remember a radio astronomer from the area telling a 
story of how a large blast of radio noise was messing with one of his 
measurements. He drove something like 20 miles to a farm and found that a 
toaster or something was on the fritz.)

What I'm wondering then is whether large quantities of telephone calls are 
actually transmitted via satellite rather than through fiber. This would 
have a number of advantages over the use of standard fiber-optic 
transmission. It might also explain a few things too.

The first thing it could explain is why they need such a facility. Of 
course, such a facility might mere be an artifact from the old 
Soviet/Satellite days. But if they had moved over to very fiber-intensive 
methods, that would not be an ideal place to perform such activities.

But it seems to me that radio silence might be useful if they are receiving 
huge amounts of signal via  satellite. In order to support the badwidth, 
they'd need to use as much available spectrum as they can (probably even 
spread-spectrum techniques in already-occupied bands). They'd also be 
pushing things to the absolute maximum bitrate-wise, meaning they need as 
much sensitivity and highest possible SNRs as they can get.

What this also means, however, is that there must be a network of uplink 
stations around. Local telecom traffic is probably backhauled to such 
stations for literal upload to satellite (ie, rather than NSA building out 
it's own conspicuous fiber network).

Such stations must be easily observable, so they are disguised as something 
else. Actually, Cable TV uses a distribution network that might serve quite 
well in reverse, with the proper modifications.

>A hundred miles or so north of Sugar Grove, in Washington, the N.S.A. has

>According to John E. McLaughlin, who as the deputy director of the Central

>Jokingly referred to as "No Such Agency," the N.S.A. was created in
>absolute secrecy in 1952 by President Harry S. Truman. Today, it is the
>largest intelligence agency. It is also the most important, providing far
>more insight on foreign countries than the C.I.A. and other spy

>But the agency is still struggling to adjust to the war on terror, in
>which its job is not to monitor states, but individuals or small cells
>hidden all over the world. To accomplish this, the N.S.A. has developed
>ever more sophisticated technology that mines vast amounts of data. But
>this technology may be of limited use abroad. And at home, it increases
>pressure on the agency to bypass civil liberties and skirt formal legal
>channels of criminal investigation. Originally created to spy on foreign
>adversaries, the N.S.A. was never supposed to be turned inward. Thirty

>"That capability at any time could be turned around on the American
>people," he said in 1975, "and no American would have any privacy left,
>such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations,
>telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide."
>
>He added that if a dictator ever took over, the N.S.A. "could enable it to
>impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back."
>
>At the time, the agency had the ability to listen to only what people said
>over the telephone or wrote in an occasional telegram; they had no access
>to private letters. But today, with people expressing their innermost
>thoughts in e-mail messages, exposing their medical and financial records
>to the Internet, and chatting constantly on cellphones, the agency
>virtually has the ability to get inside a person's mind.
>
>The N.S.A.'s original target had been the Communist bloc. The agency
>wrapped the Soviet Union and its satellite nations in an electronic
>cocoon. Anytime an aircraft, ship or military unit moved, the N.S.A. would
>know. And from 22,300 miles in orbit, satellites with super-thin,
>football-field-sized antennas eavesdropped on Soviet communications and
>weapons signals.
>
>Today, instead of eavesdropping on an enormous country that was always
>chattering and never moved, the N.S.A. is trying to find small numbers of
>individuals who operate in closed cells, seldom communicate electronically
>(and when they do, use untraceable calling cards or disposable cellphones)
>and are constantly traveling from country to country.
>
>During the cold war, the agency could depend on a constant flow of
>American-born Russian linguists from the many universities around the
>country with Soviet studies programs. Now the government is forced to
>search ethnic communities to find people who can speak Dari, Urdu or

>According to an interview last year with Gen. Michael V. Hayden, then the
>N.S.A.'s director, intercepting calls during the war on terrorism has
>become a much more complex endeavor. On Sept. 10, 2001, for example, the
>N.S.A. intercepted two messages. The first warned, "The match begins
>tomorrow," and the second said, "Tomorrow is zero hour." But even though
>they came from suspected Al Qaeda locations in Afghanistan, the messages
>were never translated until after the attack on Sept. 11, and not
>distributed until Sept. 12.
>
>What made the intercepts particularly difficult, General Hayden said, was
>that they were not "targeted" but intercepted randomly from Afghan pay
>phones.
>
>This makes identification of the caller extremely difficult and slow.
>"Know how many international calls are made out of Afghanistan on a given
>day? Thousands," General Hayden said.

>Still, the N.S.A. doesn't have to go to the courts to use its electronic
>monitoring to snare Al Qaeda members in Afghanistan. For the agency to
>snoop domestically on American citizens suspected of having terrorist
>ties, it first must to go to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,
>or FISA, make a showing of probable cause that the target is linked to a
>terrorist group, and obtain a warrant.

>The court rarely turns the government down. Since it was established in

>Those deemed innocent would quickly be eliminated from the watch list,
