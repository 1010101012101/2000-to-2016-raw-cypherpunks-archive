That has yet to be proven. Simply tumping a vehicle over is not in and of
itself 'intent to do physical harm'. You assume, without evidence, that
the protestors even knew the van was occupied. Further, you assume that
the protestor shot was actually involved. Further, you assume that the
store the police stated is accurate.

A lot of assumptions for somebody who is supposed to be unbiased as a
journalist.

(Of course we know you're neither)
