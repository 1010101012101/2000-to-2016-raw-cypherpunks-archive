No, it means it's not meant to alter people's pre-existing status vis-a-vis 
detentions or trials; if they didn't include a clause like that, then 
people would argue that the executive order didn't just add to existing 
law, but replaced it, such that previously possible prosecutions would no 
longer be possible since they weren't explicitly permitted in the EO.

The crucial language is "limit the lawful authority", where the scope of 
the pre-existing "lawful authority" may be tiny or nonexistent. It's not 
correct to assume that there's (necessarily) any such lawful authority, 
absent other facts (like a declaration of martial law, or a person's status 
as a member of the military, etc.)

5000 dead in NYC? National tragedy.
1000 detained incommunicado without trial, expanded surveillance? National 
disgrace.
