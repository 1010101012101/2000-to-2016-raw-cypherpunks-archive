In a survival situation, nobody gives a crap about "human society", it's either
a matter of conscience or it isn't. 

Actually if I were in that situation, I'd probably try to steal some of the
water for him. But I wouldn't try to pretty up my stealing with some
sanctimonious sermon about needs and obligations to the guy I have at the other
end of my gun. Which what it all comes down to in the end. But if he blows me
away with his twelve gauge? Well, it's his water. Should have been a little
smarter. 

All the laws in the world will never be able to legislate away the basic fact
that the strong and smart disregard and/or prey on the weak and stupid. Read 
the front page of any newspaper for ample proof of what people are like without
the comfortable fiction of societal order. 

If you had ever lived on the street you would understand this firsthand.

Preach on...
