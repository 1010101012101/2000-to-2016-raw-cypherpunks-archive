I agree that making them mandatory requirements for new machines will do

Plenty. Most are so old as to be virtually useless by modern standards, but
hey.

> How many made today will be around 10 years from now?

Even more. And I think it likely that they will be more useful than
currently 10 year old machines, as well.

Why do I think that? Mostly because Intel/AMD/Dell/co are having such an
awful time trying to sell the latest and greatest whiz-bang stuff. Back 'in
the day', virtually _any_ speed increase was worth buying. But at this
point, unless you've got something really special in mind, you can often
stay a generation or two (or three) back without any problems at all. Also,
pretty much any machine made in the last couple of years is fast enough to
do real time audio capture and compression. Real time video still requires
something fairly high end, but give it a year.

Not to say that having DRM hardware will not be a total pain the ass. Just
that mass-scale piracy will still be very much possible. But I suppose they
already know that.
