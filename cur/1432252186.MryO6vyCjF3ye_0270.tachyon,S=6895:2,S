Agreed, but who wants to gamble with the next 20-35 years of their life  
being thrown away in some hellish sensory deprivation solitary confinement  
torture chamber to prove the point?

Let the gubmint further undermine whatever legitimacy they have left by  
inventing tortured legal arguments as to why people must be compelled  
under threat of violence to speak lies (ironically by not speaking)

If we go by the Tacitus metric of “The more corrupt the state, the more  
numerous the laws.”, then the United States is well and goodly f*ck'd.

I like Richard J. Maybury's 'The Two Laws' concept; Two laws are necessary  
for civilizations to develop and advance:

1) Do all you have agreed to do.

2) Do not encroach on other persons or their property

It's dead simple and all we really need IMHO.
