No shit. Survey says most doctors and clinics are incapable of
diagnosing Anthrax infection. How long the buggers have been
around cannot be determined. But diagnoses will surely rise
as medical staff gear up for the threat, along with false positives,
alarms, backtracks, and all the learning curve stuff.

Did DefSec Bill Cohen survive his innoculation against Anthrax?
Was it a real shot or a specially protected plane ride to show the
American people courage of their leaders.

If you think you've never been infected with Anthrax take the
high profile test, soon to be available on the street corner.
MSNBC fercrhissakes competing with the supermarket
tabloids, as if hoaxing a Declone.

But don't expect more peephole toilets for lesbos or 
Ricans to stop pissing on your 5th Avenue rosebeds.
