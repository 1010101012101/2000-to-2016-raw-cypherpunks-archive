You're right on this, I admit.  Its clear that things like smart dust
and gait recognition and
autonomous cruising across the desert are not things the Beast has yet.

I'm not one to dispute physics.  However most professional skeptics
(eg cryptographers) grant the adversary anything from 2 to 10 x the
COTS tech.  Do you *really* think the NSA's DesCrack was built
with old Sun chassis like Gilmore, Kocher, et als???

Remember that the spookfabs don't have to contend with *economics and
yield*.
They can use *radioisotopes*.  Subs can lay independant cable.
Not a lot of folks walk along the undersea cables,
to say nothing of how bribable telecom folks are.

Conservativism sometimes means being liberal in modelling others'
capabilities.
