Well Kids,

    the RSA Conference is coming to the Bay area yet again,

So far F-secure is worthy of Honor they have chosen to boycott the
conference, as EVERY HONEST security and crypto firm/personnel should
 do.. the next few months will tell both us and the public who we can
start to put on the naughty or nice lists..

Bravo to F-Secure and  Mikko Hypponen, the beginning of Honest security
consulting firms..

 his reason quoted below

“I don’t really expect your multibillion dollar company or your
multimillion dollar conference to suffer as a result of your deals with
the NSA. In fact, I'm not expecting other conference speakers to cancel.
Most of your speakers are american anyway – why would they care about
surveillance that’s not targeted at them but at non-americans.
Surveillance operations from the US intelligence agencies are targeted
at foreigners. However I’m a foreigner. And I’m withdrawing my support
from your event.”
