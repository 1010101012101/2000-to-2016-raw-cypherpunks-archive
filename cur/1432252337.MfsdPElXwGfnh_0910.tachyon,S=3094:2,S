Ain't that the truth.
Even the militia and white-supremist groups seem completely useless, as 
usual (every now and then I wonder if such groups aren't a deliberate 
creation to divert dissaffected white people's attention).

ON THE OTHER HAND, one does't need huge numbers of people wielding baseball 
bats...there're probably a small number of paper-pushers that file or serve 
certain papers or otherwise interact with the outside world. All one would 
need is a few dozen incidents applied at the correct interface to greatly 
inhibit things...
