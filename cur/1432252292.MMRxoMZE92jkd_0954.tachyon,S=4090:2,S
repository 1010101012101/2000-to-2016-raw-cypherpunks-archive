                Website Says Virus Leaked Ukrainian Secret
                Documents

                KIEV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A Ukrainian Web site said on
Thursday it had
                received secret documents from the administration of
President Leonid
                Kuchma due to a computer virus that infected government
computers and
                e-mailed it the files.

                ``The Sircam virus, having infected the computers in the
presidential
                administration, is bombarding our editorial department
with their
                documents,'' said the ForUm news Web site
(www.for-ua.com).

                Administration officials declined to say whether their
security had been
                breached, but told Reuters they had started an
investigation into whether
                any of their computers were infected with viruses.

                ForUm printed one of the documents it said it had
received -- a timetable
                for Kuchma's movements on Ukraine's 10th anniversary of
independence
                later this month. Kuchma's exact movements are usually a
tightly guarded
                secret.

                The Sircam virus, which first emerged in July, is a
so-called e-mail worm
                which arrives as an e-mail attachment and sends copies
of itself to names
                and addresses in the infected computer's address book.
