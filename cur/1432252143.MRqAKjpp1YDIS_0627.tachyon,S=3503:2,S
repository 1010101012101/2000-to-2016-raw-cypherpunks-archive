there are some good replies, just need more moderation from the clue-full :)

indeed.  there was one insightful response to the unlinkability
aspect, and that is the inevitable venality of the credential
authorities.  perhaps i'm just overly cynical, but without a
trustworthy and secure CA the privacy assurances provided by such
credentials are fairly limited.  (and as detailed elsewhere, for most
uses the CA's won't issue to anonymous entities)

still, much better than what we've got now...

p.s. the lending protection aspect of credentials is dark comedy.
encode something into a credential that alice would never want to
share, credit card #, bank access details, etc.  lol
