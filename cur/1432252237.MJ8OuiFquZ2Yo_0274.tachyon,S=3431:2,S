Hmm.  Corporations are the equivalent of wealthy individuals.  Nothing
special about 'corps' as synthetics.  So equivalent
to, say, criticising a Mafia Don.  In a Gibsonian future where
governments aren't strong enough to defend everyone's rights, you'd
have strong anonymity so the ability of wealthy entities to sue for
slander would be gone.

Corporations that make products would remain succeptible to 
tampering as well as bad press, though the tampering would
be in a tamperer vs. tamper-resistant fox & rabbit technological 
arms race.  ("I'll see your watermark and raise you two reverse engineers" :-)

But yeah, everyone would have their own police if there were no common
one.  Hmm, That's an irony of anarchy, that it turns into a tessellation
of police(d) microstates real quickly.
