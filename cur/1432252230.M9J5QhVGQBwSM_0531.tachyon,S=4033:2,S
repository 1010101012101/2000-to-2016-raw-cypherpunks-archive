Bush family values -- He's the best man for the job
DCF leader: It's OK to spank by Carol Marbin Miller, Lesley Clark and Peter 
Wallsten
The man named Thursday by Gov. Jeb Bush to head Florida's notoriously inept 
child welfare agency is an evangelical Christian who views spanking that 
causes ''bruises or welts'' as acceptable punishment.
The revelation did not come to Bush's attention until hours after the 
governor introduced Jerry Regier, a former Oklahoma Cabinet secretary and 
aide to Bush's father, as the new chief of the state's Department of 
Children and Families.
Regier, 57, was named less than 48 hours after the resignation of DCF 
Secretary Kathleen A. Kearney. He takes over an agency that has been 
embroiled in scandal since 5-year-old Rilya Wilson disappeared.
