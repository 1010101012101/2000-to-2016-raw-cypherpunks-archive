Jim, why are you trying so hard to make a complete fool out of yourself,
in a public forum?

A chemical laser needs active optics to track your remote target. What do
you think that optics is made from, unobtainium? Do you understand basic
laws of optics? I recommend purchasing a 15 W laser (and a pair of
matching protection goggles), and then use it to ignite a match from a
close distance, and then over a few km, preferably during summer in your
native Texas. You could target the beam towards a projection wall, and
watch it with a pair of binoculars. It will be quite instructive.

High albedo coating of the missile is *cheap*. Powerful lasers are that
not, especially if you need to have several of them online in an area.
