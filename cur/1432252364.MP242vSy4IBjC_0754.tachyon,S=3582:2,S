I think it even goes further than that.

I was giving one of my DMCA-vs-Security talks while l'affaire Sklyarov was
roiling, and noted that while that was going on, the US was being testy with
China over alleged espionage by US nationals while in China. At a high
level, each of infringement and espionage can be described as:

Alice gives Bob some information. Bob is careless with it, disclosing it to
someone that Alice would rather not see it. Alice has a non-linear response.

You can call it infringement or you can call it espionage, but at the bottom
of it, Alice believes that a private communication has been inappropriately
disclosed. She thinks her privacy has been compromised and she's stomping
angry about it.

At the risk of creating a derivative work, you say pr-eye-vacy, I say
pr-ih-vacy. Infringement, espionage, let's call the whole thing off.
