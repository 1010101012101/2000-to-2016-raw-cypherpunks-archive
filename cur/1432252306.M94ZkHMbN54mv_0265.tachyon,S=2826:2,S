Your china in OZ writes,(china plate=mate=bud,pal)
Not content with selling huge amounts of american flags (made in chinese 
gulags)China recently tested
dong feng missiles capable of dropping nuclear payload on US assets .They 
reversed engineered
cruise missiles too so dont worry if one goes up your street and turns 
left.They have got a 'knock off'spy
plane with pilot wangs brother watching.The balloons full of biowar agents 
and fresh avian flu strains will
be floating over soon also.Watch the skies! ITs not gone unnoticed that 
tidal patterns also favour WMDs
launched your way.The chinese govt's realised you wanted a wag the dog war 
with it all along and will ,sooner or later
so 'first in best dressed' or 'operation king hit' is the order of the 
day.(You didnt hear this from me)Luv,mattd.
