This "War" is being sold to the American public with all the hype of a
Professional Wrestling storyline.  Believe nothing uttered by the Four
Network AnchorWhores.

I just switched to CBS, and there was Dan Rather crying on "Late Night"
with Letterman holding his hand, as he explained to the public that we
could expect a 5-10 year campaign to rid the world of evil, and we had to
make sure this generation wasn't too "spoiled" to stay on board for the
whole performance.

He also tossed in a few comments about how we should have gotten rid of
Saddam Hussein when we had the chance, and meddled in various other things
that were none of our business.

Funny, I don't notice Dan Rather crying about the Iraqi kids who can't get
their cancer medicine because of sanctions, or the fact that the Zionist
Entity is presently shelling Palestinian Kindergartens and shooting
unarmed mentally handicapped people.

Washington DC, New York, and Tel Aviv all need thermonuclear disinfecting.
