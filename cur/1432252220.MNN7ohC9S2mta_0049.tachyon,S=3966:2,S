"As for finance itself, there's a reason that I say that financial
cryptography is the only cryptography that matters. Since the time of
Mesopotamian bullae and grain banks, cryptography has been essential to
finance. You can't do one without the other. The more cryptography you do,
the more finance you can do, the better off everyone is. It's a virtuous
circle."

I don't agree, though I'm tempted to. What have nominally been called 
religious and/or race wars throughout history have almost always had at 
their core economics, or at least in the western world. It's easy to see how 
finance might be the underlying reason for lots of nominally non-crypto 
communications.

Your statement is arguably true as t-->infinity.

However, I'd bet there are short-term applications for crypto that really 
matter and yet have no real relationship to $$$ (for instance, what if there 
was widespread communications and crypto in Nazi Germany...would the 
holocaust have happened?)
