>Dear Colleague,
>
>As an industry professional, you may be interested to know about an 
>upcoming online event being presented by Unstrung (www.unstrung.com), the 
>worldwide source for analysis of the wireless economy. This free Web 
>seminar - "Securing Wireless Applications in Vertical Markets" - will 
>evaluate recent progress in a critical sector. The benefits of deploying 
>wireless technology in vertical markets are well documented, but security 
>issues continue to be the main concern holding back widespread wireless 
>adoption in these environments. Keeping information out of the hands of 
>interlopers has become a critical task for any net manager.
>
>During this presentation we'll focus on:
>
>- The critical role of security in vertical markets - why does it matter?
>- The diverse security demands of different vertical markets
>- Potential effects of wireless network attacks in different markets
>- Case studies of deployments in vertical markets and lessons learned
>- Securing today's wireless networks and emerging future technologies
>
