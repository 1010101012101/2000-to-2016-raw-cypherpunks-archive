This was a big deal when I was a little rascal.We lived in the bush and the 
bonfires were enormous.
It got turned into bunger night with massive sales of fireworks.The 2penny 
bunger was a miniature stick of dynamite.
With the inevitable mayhem and the rise of the nanny staters and safety 
nazis its all gone now yet some still praise
Guy Fawkes as 'the only person to enter parliment with honest intentions.'
