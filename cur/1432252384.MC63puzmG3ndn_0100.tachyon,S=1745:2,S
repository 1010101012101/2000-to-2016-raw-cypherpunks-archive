The World Trade Organization, in its first decision on an
Internet-related dispute, has ignited a political, cultural and legal
tinderbox by ruling that the United States policy prohibiting online
gambling violates international trade law.

The ruling, issued by a W.T.O. panel on Wednesday, is being hailed by
operators of online casinos based overseas as a major victory that could
force America to liberalize laws outlawing their business.

But the Bush administration vowed to appeal the decision, and several
members of Congress said they would rather have an international trade
war or withdraw from future rounds of the World Trade Organization than
have American social policy dictated from abroad.
