james, this is EXACTLY what I'm getting at. your line works perfectly,
provided that the fact that the nazis are either evil or wrong is
already established beforehand.

see:

...for nazis are a threat only to evil people, while jews are a threat
to everyone, including their own race.

could almost be straight from Mein Kampf.

(duh, do I have to add a disclaimer here that I don't mean this, but
simply use it as an example of how these fuckers might argue/have
argued?)
