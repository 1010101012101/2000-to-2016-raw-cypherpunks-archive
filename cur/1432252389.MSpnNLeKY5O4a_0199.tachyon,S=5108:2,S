Or who ever steals the master key.

The difference is fundamental: I can change every bit of flash in my BIOS.
I can not change *anything* in the TPM.  *I* control my BIOS.  IF, and
only IF, I can control the TPM will I trust it to extend my trust to
others.  The purpose of TCPA as spec'ed is to remove my control and
make the platform "trusted" to one entity.  That entity has the master
key to the TPM.

Now, if the spec says I can install my own key into the TPM, then yes,
it is a very useful tool.  It would be fantastic in all the portables
that have been stolen from the FBI for example.  Assuming they use a
password at turn on, and the TPM is used to send data over the net,
then they'd know where all their units are and know they weren't
compromised (or how badly compromised anyway).

But as spec'ed, it is very seriously flawed.

The untouchable code zone.  That's fine for an embedded application,
but for a general purpose computing platform it's great for dictators.

Yes, dictatorships are stable governments for the short run.  Most people
are willing to put up with slavery as long as they get food and sleep.
But there are enough people who read history (and who have escaped
dictatorships) to prevent really bad things from being forced down
everyone's throats.  TCPM seems like clipper and it also seems like
it'd be pretty easy to sell as evil (whether it is or not).  I don't
think it's going to be an easy fight for the RIAA folks.

What makes you think TCPA isn't being designed with the Chinese in mind?
They don't believe in copyright to begin with, and they are a huge market.
As it's been described so far, it sure seems useful to the master key
holder.

Patience, persistence, truth,
