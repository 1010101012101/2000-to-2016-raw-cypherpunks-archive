That statement is not correct.  Mix networks require more effort to
trace than normal packets or Onion Routing, but are not even close to
"theoretically completely untraceable".  I'll point to Syverson's
papers (Why I'm not an entropist, and Sleeping dogs lie in a bed of
onions) and Serjantov's "From a Trickle to a Flood."

I had not seen that paper, that's cool thanks.  However, it seems
they're observing data (EFF Observatory and Market Prices) and drawing
conclusions about why companies make decisions.  It would be easier
and more reliable to just... ask the companies why they do what they
do.  They seem to omit that somewhat important step to support their
conclusions.
