The correct URL is:
	
http://www.bis.doc.gov/Encryption/PubAvailEncSourceCodeNofify.html
This site contains the full process "to export encryption source code
that would be considered publicly available"

The site has you e-mail to three addresses:
	crypt@bis.doc.gov, enc@ncsc.mil, web_site@bis.doc.gov
You can also send a disk to both to 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue
and Fort Meade....

I've submitted twice and never gotten an acknowledgement ... can't
imagine that they are that busy.

Paul
