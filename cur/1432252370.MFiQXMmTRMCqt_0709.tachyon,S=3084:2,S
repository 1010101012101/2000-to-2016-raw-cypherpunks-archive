  News of the weird


  Salt Lake Tribune

  "Intelligence": An exhaustive report in December on CIA operatives who
  staffed the so-called ''rendition'' program, secretly transferring
  suspected terrorists from U.S. custody to foreign governments, revealed
  sometimes-sloppy undercover work of the agents. In one rendition, in Milan,
  Italy, covert agents failed to remove their cell phones' batteries, thus
  enabling them to be electronically tracked even though the phones were off.
  Also, one clandestine operative left a clear trail of her whereabouts
  because, even though she booked herself at foreign hotels under aliases,
  she insisted that frequent-flier miles earned at the hotels be credited to
  her personal, non-secret frequent-flier account.
