When they're not given special privileges, they are a useful tool for
market awareness and employee side organization. Corporations can be seen
as the employer side one -- if there's no need to organize, why should
corporations exceed a single employee in size?

In a free market, they would be an employee side monopoly at best. We all
know how stable monopolies are.

The precise same argument can be used in an argument for monopoly control.
Or the coerced breakup of any sufficient large corporation. You for that?

Me neither. Not going to, either. That does not mean that unions couldn't
be good for other people.

>From what I have seen, labor unions are a collectivist evil.

Well, in a state where they're not hiding behind the government, that's
something you'll just have to get used to. They've earned killing? Unions
can play that game too, I hear.
