I think that the intersection of usability and security is of
tremendous import, and wanted to share an under-advertised sort of
workshop announcement:

http://www.acm.org/sigchi/

The conference home page is

http://www.chi2003.org/

The workshop page is

http://www.iit.nrc.ca/~patricka/CHI_2003/HCISEC/workshop.html

I thought that the workshop info would be accessible from the
conference site, but that appears not to be the case (at least not
yet).

Feel free to forward the URL to anyone else you think might be
interested.  Since it's at CHI, I expect we'll get plenty of people
from that community, but we also really want attendees from the
security community as well.
