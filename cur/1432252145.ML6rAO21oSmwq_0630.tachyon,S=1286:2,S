Ave, my dear friend

Now I am half the man, may be that is because you are the other half of me?
You know, I have a dream that I can follow through – I am looking for you , 
my only one, in the long corridors of this life!! Will you give me your hand
and lead me to the corner of the earth where happieness is born?? 
Just write to me at http://flirtwithmedirect.com/alone and I will show you my heart, that is oh, 
so true!!


Do svidaniya

Olechka
