Also don't leave out the privacy right-wingers : 

AKA privacy fascists.

Why not implement a object-oriented mission-critical dynamic
cross-platform inflammatory e-synergistic extensible convergence of
next-generation schemas leveraging of out-of-the-box religious,
political and civil rights plug-and-play back-end technologies?

If we throw in some more categorical chaff we can make a set :

 Privacy Athiests - think privacy doesn't exist ( that guy at Sun )
 Privacy Agnostics* - don't care about privacy ( 99% of population )
 Privacy Fundamentalists - a very religious group fer sure.
 Privacy Iconoclasts - destroyers of privacy, politicians and marketeers
   Subclass Leftist-Commies
   Subclass Right-Wing-Fascists
   Subclass Opportunists

 Privacy Activist - any non-tuberous member of one of the above
 Privacy Criminal - any Privacy Fundamentalist with the Activist bit
set.
 Privacy JackbootThug - any Privacy Iconoclast with the Activist bit
set.

*Privacy Agnostics have no Activist bit.
