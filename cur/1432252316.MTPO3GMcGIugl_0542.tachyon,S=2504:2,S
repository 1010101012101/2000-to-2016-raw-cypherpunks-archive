--shrug-- It's better than directly contributing to most "causes". At

(I've done a lot of IT consulting for a lot of not-for-profits in the
US, most notably on their accounting systems. I haven't expressly
pried into the numbers, but I kept my eyes open and couldn't help but
notice that the overhead consumption was uniformly really high. And in
the case of the charities and the PACs, the overhead numbers reported
by the accounting system were generally much higher than those given
in the annual disclosures.)
