Do you mean you have an independent channel confirming this 
"legitimate license," or do you mean the rice paper version has 
carefully reproduced an approval page?

Did you check with the copyright holders?

(And independent channel would be a letter or even an electronic 
statement from the copyright holders saying the version was valid. A 
digitally signed statement would do.)

I don't doubt that differential marketing plans will evolve. Selling 
a CD-ROM of Microsoft Office for $300 US in Bangalore is just not 
going to fly, not with the back-alley version selling for the rupee 
equivalent of $5.

"The street will find its own uses for technology."

And once Mojo gets running, I'm hoping to buy Microsoft Office for 10 
Mojobucks.

(So I can then resell it to 50 others....)
