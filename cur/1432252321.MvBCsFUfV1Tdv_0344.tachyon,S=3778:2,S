"Where are you going to buy your hardware from, that it can't be
shut down?   How are you going to hide your TX from the DXing
white vans?"

Well, you made some interesting points. Actually, it would seem that some of 
the Islamic regimes as well as mainland China have been at least partially 
successful in blocking 'objectionable' content. So in a state where the 
forces that be have made a fairly complete victory, it just might be 
possible I guess to close down objectionable physical bits.

So I guess that still has to be weighed against the value of human life. My 
point was that "Needs Killing" is something that should be considered fairly 
carefully...acted upon only when there's really no alternative. (But then 
again, you may have only been talking. You ever kill anyone Variola?)
