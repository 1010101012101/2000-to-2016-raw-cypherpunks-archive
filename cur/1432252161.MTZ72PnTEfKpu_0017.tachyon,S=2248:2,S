If you include "PDA & Cellphone" as computer;
or include "flash eeprom" as a "hard drive", then we agree.

Most Persons of Interest will have secrets on their mobile gizmos (which
use flash memory) as well as their PC's spinning disks.     Sync'ing the
PDA + PC means the security
boundary includes them both.

The important lesson is that all your gizmos will be seized and
analyzed.  And that
the world needs good Linux-based-PDA & flash-mem-compatible security
tools.
And don't forget the epoxy...
