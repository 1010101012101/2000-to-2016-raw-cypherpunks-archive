John Young's sudden squeamishness about What Needs to be Done 
is...typical.

He rants about CIA plots, he lists USG atrocities on his Cryptome site 
(kudos), he talks about the need for justice, but then he pulls back 
when someone points out the obvious implications of recent events. Kind 
of like a steak lover realizing belatedly that his food comes from the 
killing of cattle.
