I'm considering developing an asm prototype of a braid group-based
encryption/decryption pki engine.  The basic story behind braid group
mathematics seems to imply much faster encryption/decryption engines.
Before I spend the next month working through this, does anyone know of a
braid group-based encryption/decryption engine?  Did it work?  Any
cryptanalysis on this?

Also, does anyone have any stats on the performance of popular pki systems?
I'm specifically looking for #s regarding number of keys which can be
generated by one vendor vs. another vendor's products (on similar hw
platforms.) Any clue where I might find this info (other than by paying Giga
or Meta $3K for a research report)?

Cheers-
Phillip
