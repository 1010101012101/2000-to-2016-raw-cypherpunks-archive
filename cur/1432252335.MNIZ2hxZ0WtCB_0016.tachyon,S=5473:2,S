Much of this is a result of too much Federal authority, almost all of it 
based on "creative" interpretations of the Commerce Clause.  Has the FAA's 
constitutional authority ever been challenged?  Those that oppose these 
travel restrictions need an effective alternative to airlines.  Something 
along the lines of a VTOL air taxi could replace some short haul airport 
traffic.  Ideally these taxis would be entirely automated, accept cash and 
keep no record on customers.  Its too bad companies like SoloTrek 
http://www.solotrek.com/mjet/index1.html and Moller http://www.moller.com/ 
haven't been able to "get off the ground" ;-)
