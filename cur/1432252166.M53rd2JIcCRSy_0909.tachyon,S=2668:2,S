Why would Bob be unable to strip off all signatures, process the sound
file to whiten off any watermarking and re-sell it without authentication
signatures under another nym with it's own reputation?  

What would stop Bob from turning the sound file into a plain .ogg or .mp3
with no signatures and reselling millions of copies for 1/1000th the cost,
or even for free.  Or have Bob be the front of a pool of purchasers who
couldn't pay Alice her fees on their own, so they each chip in 1/100th of
the cost?

Why would Bob's "clients" care if the cost was low enough, or just
casually traded?


Perhaps using music as a model isn't so wise.
