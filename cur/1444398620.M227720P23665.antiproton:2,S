Have you ever thought who profits from JYA selling already sniffed logs
and someone fabricating a GCHQ slide?

If Snowden is just fabricater/photoshoper why wikipedia claims:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Snowden&oldid=684683260

---
Criminal charge 	Theft of government property, unauthorized
communication of national defense information, and willful communication
of classified intelligence to an unauthorized person (June 2013).

Why they don't charge Snowden for fabricating/photoshoping?
