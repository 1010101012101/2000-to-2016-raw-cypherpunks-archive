Just off the top of my head:

O'Reilly P2P Conference, Standard Conference Fee: $1595
http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/p2pweb2001/pub/w/16/register.html

RSA 2002 Conference:  $995 to $1795, depending on when you register
		    (Special $595 for "Academics", scholarships for
		    students)

Overheard at a conference business meeting:

"What about special rates for attendees who are neither business nor
academia?"
"ARE there any such people?"
<silence>

Hey, at least DEF CON is still $50 ! although Black Hat is $1195 + $700
per training course.

By the way, in case anyone knows Neal Stephenson, I know a science fiction
conference which would love to invite him.  (Yes, I've read his web page,

There was that workshop on "Privacy by Design" at the 99 or 00 CFP, wasn't
there? The one report I had from that was not favorable, but it's not a
*bad* idea.

This year, there's a workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies being held
immediately prior to CFP in the same building. Maybe this will lead to
more interaction.

(Disclaimer: one of the co-chairs is a co-author of mine. So yeah, this is
thinly disguised plugging for the workshop. No, I don't know how much
it will cost.)

Well, come a few days earlier and sit in comfy chairs for PET, while
you're at it...
