         WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. John Cooksey, R-Monroe,
         told a network of Louisiana radio stations Monday that
         someone "wearing a diaper on his head" should expect to be
         interrogated in the investigation of terrorist attacks on the
         Pentagon and New York City.

and he jingoes on from there.  Cooksey doesn't say whether he was
including the KKK in the category of people with diapers on their head,
or what to do about politicians who need to change their own diapers.

He does acknowledge that some turban-wearers are Americans,
and some aren't Muslims or Arabs, but he still thinks they
need to be pulled over, because bin Laden and many of his followers
wear turbans.

Bin Laden has also been rumored to wear pants.

Cooksey won't be running for House again in 2002 - he's planning
to run for Senate instead.  I hope the Democrat's better,
though this is the part of the country that put out
"vote for the crook" bumper stickers when the crook's
opponent was (ostensibly ex-) Klansman David Duke.
