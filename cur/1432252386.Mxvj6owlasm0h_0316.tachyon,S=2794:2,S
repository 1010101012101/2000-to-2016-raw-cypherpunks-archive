 Food for thought.  The mathematical space is astronomically large.  The
 physical disk space is very large.

 What are the costs?  It's a mixed bag.  Disk drives are cheap, but
 power, bandwidth, and human energy are not so cheap.  I personally have
 spent countless hours on various prototypes, approaches, and
 philosophies, and so have my colleagues.

 Of course, the value of a thing is utterly unrelated to the cost of
 producing it.  The value is determined solely by its appeal and utility
 to customers.

 So that's our job:  to raise the market value of our product beyond the
 cost to ourselves.  On that point, I think that the next turn of the
 screw will be the most important one yet:  the addition of new asset
 types into a folder.
