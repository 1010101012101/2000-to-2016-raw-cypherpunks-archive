I guess I have to laugh at this, below. =C2=A0Does Hillary Clinton or her c=
orrupt cronies really think that Americans care who, exactly, who obtained =
and leaked the DNC emails? =C2=A0And why should we believe that ONLY ONE in=
dividual (or group) had them? =C2=A0There are probably plenty of DNC inside=
rs who are disgusted with how bad a choice Clinton is, this year. =C2=A0Mig=
ht at least one of them leak a master-key (quite anonymously, we suppose) t=
o people they figure would go ahead and use it? =C2=A0No doubt Russia has t=
he talent, and certainly the motivation, but so do many other people. =C2=
=A0

I'm waiting, hoping, that they also release a few tens of thousands of "pri=
vate" Hillary emails, the ones they've been rumoring on the media over the =
last few days. =C2=A0
We'll learn a lot. =C2=A0We first heard of her private server over a year a=
go, as I recall. =C2=A0About that time, I first heard that the deleted emai=
ls had been chosen through a process of negative-elimination: =C2=A0The ema=
ils that were saved were those that contained one or more of a number of ke=
ywords. =C2=A0Lack those keywords, and the message wasn't saved. =C2=A0It s=
ounds like a system that her buddies designed to be able to eliminate every=
thing they wanted to erase: =C2=A0"Just remember not to enter any relevant =
keyword, and you know the message won't survive." =C2=A0What were those key=
words? =C2=A0There should have been plenty of emails that were so short the=
y didn't make the cut, even if they were indeed government business. =C2=A0=
It is virtually certain, therefore, that this system was designed and known=
 to Hillary Clinton virtually from the moment it was first used.
It's way to dangerous to elect a person, Hillary Clinton, who may have fool=
ishly depended on having a system to delete messages, when it's possible th=
ose same messages were copied, and eventually found their way to unknown ot=
hers. =C2=A0The blackmail possibilities would be endless.
I would have thought that by now, somebody would have performed experiments=
 on a mock-up of her server, perhaps the same hardware and software they us=
ed, to try to determine if somebody would have been able to break in. =C2=
=A0Offer a $100,000 reward, or something like it. =C2=A0
