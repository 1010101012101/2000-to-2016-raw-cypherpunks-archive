Right, but that was what was being discussed--regulation of smoking on 
public property.  (Which raises all kinds of interesting definitional 
issues, since that includes the county courthouse, the street in front of 
the courthouse, the river running through the middle of town, and the ocean 
several miles away.  Nobody bans smoking in all those places, but I think 
almost everyone bans smoking in government buildings, and I've seen at 
least one city park (here in North Carolina!) where smoking is banned once 
you get off the parking lot.)

Yep.  When only consenting adults are involved on private property, the 
state ought not to be involved.  For some non-obvious dangerous activities, 
the state might legitimately require a warning of some kind (e.g., 
"DANGER--POISON"),  though in practice this usually seems to devolve to 
attaching a warning label to everything, with the effect that you don't 
always know an ass-covering warning label from an honest-to-God, drink a 
teaspoon of this and you're a corpse, sort of warning label.  And for some 
dangerous activities the state might legitimately restrict children from 
the activity, though second-hand smoke is a couple orders of magnitude too 
low of a risk for this to make sense.  (And the other Schelling point is to 
let parents make decisions for their kids until the kids are being 
obviously abused or subjected to horrifying risks.)

My point was that it's not obvious where the line gets drawn for (say) 
offensive smells or dangerous fumes, but it is obvious that there needs to 
be a line there somewhere.  Sarin, tear gas, or skunk smell are pretty 
obvious examples of fumes that, if I give them off in a public place or 
waft them over to your property, ought to be actionable somehow.  Fumes 
from various inhaled/smoked drugs are somewhere in a gray area.

These gray areas exist in every area of life, and a lot of libertarians 
seem to miss them, because they don't fit cleanly into the 
list-of-rights-granted-by-God/Rand/TheConstitution model.  (For some 
discussion by a libertarian who understands them very well, see David 
Friedman's wonderful book _Law's Order_.)
