The first time I ever tried to install Linux was on a 286 in I think 1995 (I lagged on quality computers as a kid).
I downloaded the kernel source from a BBS at 9600 baud and got totally fucking confused with what to do with the resulting tgz file.... Eventually I was able to extract it in DOS, but of course it was still unusable... Linux needs 32bit and you can't install from a kernel source archive...

Anyway I got a Pentium 120 a year or two later and figured it out. Never really looked back. Used a lot of Solaris in late 90s as well - netras were reasonably cheap (are dirt cheap now)
