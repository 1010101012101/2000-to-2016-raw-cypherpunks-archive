On Israel's decision to deport families of martyrs:

A Palestinian legislator, Salah Tamari, called deporting families "an
illegal,
unlawful and inhuman measure. Why should somebody be accountable for
someone elses actions?
http://www.news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=685972002

Someone needs to clue Tamari into the US court-approved practices
in welfare cages: families are tossed for the indiscretions of
familymembers,
if the indiscretions involve pharmaceuticals.

Pharms, nitrates, whatever.

But then, the US is becoming Israel, why not a bit of the reverse?

And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that Osama was still there.
