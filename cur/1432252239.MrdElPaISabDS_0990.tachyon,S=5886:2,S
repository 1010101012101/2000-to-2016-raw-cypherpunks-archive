This is exactly the model of the mind that I believed in when I was in
college. These days I believe that consciousness consists of information
but that information, far from being static, is actually the connections
among potential events. It's like a complex machine: pull lever A here
and gear B over there moves. The complex set of (abstract, not concrete)
connections that makes up the "model" of our reactions to various sets
of stimuli *is* our consciousness, versus there being some component in
there that produces the illusion of consciousness.

I'm sure that sounds sort of crazy; condensing such a large set of
varyingly intuitive leaps into a single paragraph is probably not such a
great idea. Happy to provide more background on the list or privately
for anyone who's interested.
