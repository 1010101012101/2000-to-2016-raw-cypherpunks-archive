Many posts have talked about a both a 'fixed level' of money, and a
commission.  I find this odd, especially as there will be no way to
add funds to the system.  If you have a commission on every exchange,
the money essentially deflates (there will be less of it tomorow than
there is today, making it more scarce, and thus more valuable.)  Thus it makes
sense to hold onto it, making it illiquid, which is a bad thing for a
currency.  Since this is magic money, why not issue more of it now and 
again?

| Here's a thought experiment: Issue a fixed amount of blinded tokens, for 
| free, and see what happens. How they would be distributed is another 
| topic. But the issuer would promise to exchange them (or make change) in 
| some specified way, e.g., a 1% commission. This would result in 
| fractional tokens, perhaps in the 1-5-10-25-50-100 denominations common 
| with ordinary coins.
| 
| (Chaum tried something similar in 1995. I'm not suggesting precisely the 
| same thing. Chaum's experiment did not generate much interest, as this 
| experiment might not, either.)
| 
| The thought experiment is that it is possible that the "thing of value" 
| is the utility of the token, not some underlying store of value. How 
| others might bid for these tokens, possibly bidding with "real money," 
| would be of no concern to the mint.
| 
| Depends on confidence that the number of tokens is in fact fixed, and 
| that forging of new tokens is not easy.
| 
| This is what I hoped Mojo would demonstrate.
| 
| More discussion:
| 
| 1. Must money be tied to intrinsic stores of value? I think the answer 
| is clearly "No." The U.S. dollar is not in any direct way tied to 
| anything except _other dollars_. Obviously. True, there are already many 
| things already valued in dollars--land, things, houses, loans, taxes, 
| salaries--so there is a somewhat circular argument that echoes what 
| Danny DeVito said in the recent movie "Heist": "Money is money, that's 
| why they call it "money"!" (paraphrased)
| 
| 2. How much would need to be issued? Depends on a lot of factors. 
| Numbers of users, interest in the experiment, evolution of markets.
| 
| 3. Isn't it "unfair" to randomly issue money and then see what happens?
| 
| 4. Are there better ways to issue the money? There could be a 
| preliminary auction, denominated in dollars and with no concern for 
| anonymity/untraceability. (Since the act of moneychanging generates 
| blinded new tokens, it matters not that the original purchasers are 
| traceable. All they need to do is change their money.)
| 
| 5. Who might use it? Let the market(s) decide. Remailers, warez....
| 
| Comment: I'm not trying to trivialize the issues. There are issues with 
| dealing with double-spending ("first to redeem" is a good fix), transfer 
| deadlock (when Alice and Bob exchange something for some token...what if 
| one walks away? A deadlock issue with real money, as with exchanging 
| suitcases of cocaine for suitcases of dollars), and other issues.
| 
| And it is quite possible that such an experiment would produce little 
| interest.
| 
| But the cost of trying such an experiment is not especially great. Many 
| such experiments/releases later, we may have learned some interesting 
| things. And possibly one such release will be robust enough (issues 
| about numbers of moneychangers, robustness of mints, etc.) that it 
| nucleates a functioning money system for at least some interesting 
| cypherspace uses.
