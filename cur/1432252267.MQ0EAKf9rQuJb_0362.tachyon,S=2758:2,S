This is a bogus statement. As long as I can't use a single keyword to make
Google's news alerts topical, and _full text_ a search engine is rather
useless.

The point is that you don't have to subscribe to 20-odd email lists, which
have about 5% relevance each. Life's too short for that. People are the best
filters, and with a handful of sustained contributors the list becomes a
valuable resource.

Case in point: most of IP list traffic is garbage from a cypherpunk point of
view. Let one list subscriber read it, and filter relevant bits to the
newsticker.

If it's a steaming pile of crap for Tim May it doesn't mean it's useless for
everybody else.
