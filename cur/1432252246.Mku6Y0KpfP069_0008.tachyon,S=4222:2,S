This is not so simple, when the person/entity destroying the records is a 
government agency - they have a statutory duty to maintain records 
according to sometimes complicated schedules. Government officials, when 
conducting government (er, the people's) business, can't just delete things 
they find inconvenient or embarrassing the same way that individuals can. 
Corporate or organizational actors may also be limited in their ability to 
destroy records by statute or by organizational rules designed to create 
and maintain accountability.
