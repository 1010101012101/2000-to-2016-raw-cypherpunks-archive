Well, since you personally did this, would you care to explain the
very strange design decision to whiten the numbers on chip, and not
provide direct access to the raw unwhitened output.

A decision that even assuming the utmost virtue on the part of the
designers, leaves open the possibility of malfunctions going
undetected.

That is a question a great many people have asked, and we have not
received any answers.

Access to the raw output would have made it possible to determine that
the random numbers were in fact generated by the physical process
described, since it is hard and would cost a lot of silicon to
simulate the various subtle offwhite characteristics of a well
described actual physical process.
