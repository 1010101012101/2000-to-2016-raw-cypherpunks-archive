Can't speak to the 2nd part, but to the first: in the US, for example, the number of active Tor users is in the hundreds of thousands, so you stand out but not much.

On the other hand, even at the height of the protests in Egypt there were at most 1500 Tor users in the whole country. That's a lot of doors to knock on but not prohibitively many.
