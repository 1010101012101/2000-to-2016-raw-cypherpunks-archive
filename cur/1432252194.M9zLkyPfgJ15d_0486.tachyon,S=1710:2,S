The Blue-Ray is a clever spoof. Another may be: that IDs and biographies
of soldiers killed in Iraq are being used to produce false identification
papers for sale along the US border and overseas. 

A variation includes as well the IDs of those killed on 9/11. Lots of 
information on the 6,000 or so on the Internet: head shots, hometowns, 
relatives, biographies, exactly what is needed to turn out fakes that
would have good chance of clearing watch lists. 

Each ID could be duplicated, say, thousands of to provide the 6 million 
and up demanded by the thriving market promoted by counterterrorism.
