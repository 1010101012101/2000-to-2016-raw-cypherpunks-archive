Presumably "their cultures" and "their planet" are the "property" they are 
defending according to your prior post.  I thought they didn't really 
believe in property?

In any case, culture is something that exists in the minds of people and in 
the choices those people make every day.  One can only claim to "own" a 
culture if one claims to own the minds and choices of others.  A bit 
totalitarian and impossible for commie thugs to do these days since even 
governments with nukes are having trouble controlling the minds and choices 
of others.

As for the planet, a bit big to be owned at this point though people will 
be able to own them later when we're richer and have access to more of 
them.  Though why one would want to own a gravity well is beyond me.
