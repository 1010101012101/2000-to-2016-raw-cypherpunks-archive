Attorneys to Argue Palestinian Activist Suffers From Mental Problems
The Associated Press

CHICAGO (AP) - Attorneys for a Palestinian activist jailed for refusing
to testify before a grand jury investigating the militant group Hamas
said Wednesday they intend to argue the man suffers from mental problems
that prevent him from understanding court orders.
Abdelhaleem Hasan Abdelraziq Ashqar, a former college professor from
Alexandria, Va., was indicted on charges of criminal contempt after he
refused to testify before a grand jury investigating fund-raising
activities on behalf of Hamas.
