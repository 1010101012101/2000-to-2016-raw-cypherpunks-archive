Not aware of any services that perform this in an automated fashion. Might  
be a entrepreneurial opportunity.

Are you talking about converting BTC back into fiat cash? I don't know of  
a way to do that either.

You want to consider signing up for an account at Purse.io. That will  
allow you to buy products on Amazon using BTC (at a significant discount I  
might add) where the products can then be shipped to a location of your  
choosing.

Having other people buy items for you via Purse.io might throw another of  
obfuscation into the mix, but you still have to have any physical goods  
shipped to an address, which doesn't really help if you want to perform  
untraceable transactions.
