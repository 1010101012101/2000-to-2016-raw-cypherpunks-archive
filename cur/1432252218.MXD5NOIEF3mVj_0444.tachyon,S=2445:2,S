I don't remember if I replied (my personal email system was hosed for a while),
but there are some Usual Suspects who'll be in town soon,
and we'll probably do some kind of get-together.
It may get called a Cypherpunks meeting or it may just be an expedition.

Of course, if you or anybody else would like to volunteer,
announce a meeting and see what happens, and I'll be happy to help
find the pieces of the mail system that the meetingpunks list lives on.
