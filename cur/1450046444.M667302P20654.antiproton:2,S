	I assume you guys are well aware that a number of hams/RF hackers
successfully received the downlinks from the Apollo missions at the moon.

	This includes one well documented case of a guy who built a
big enough VHF array to intercept the actual VHF voice link between the LEM
and the Command module... and several folks who saw both LEM and Command
module S band downlinks and recovered voice.

	Doing so was well within the capabilities of individual techy
hams of the era, at least those who had access to a decent sized dish
(not uncommon for EME "moonbounce" back then) ... and some RF
engineering background.
