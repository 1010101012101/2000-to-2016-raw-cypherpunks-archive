Farm the work out.  Or pass on the job.  Or take a plane.  Or drive - the
are *all* options.  None of them are *requirements*.

Scale of distance is the only difference.  Either you support the system
or you don't.  I don't: I either drive to jobs (charging for mileage) or I
pass on them, rather than take part in the police state that is todays air
system.  You have the very same choices.  The argument eveyone is making
here is that it is too much of an inconvenience (financial or otherwise),
*not* to fly.  Sorry, but that's just pure self-serving BS.

You either work against the problem, or you live with the problem you have
(a) helped to create and (b) actively work to maintain (with your ticket
dollars).  If you choose to maintain the system, then you have no business
bitching when it turns it's jaundiced eyes towards you.

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
