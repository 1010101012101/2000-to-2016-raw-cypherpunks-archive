All technologies have pros and cons which are exaggerated and lied about.
That is what "ologies" means, the artful science of, the artifice, 
the hyperbole,
the debunk, the abuse, the braggardy, the pissing contests, the assassination
politics, the racking up of profits by baiting and switching, the 
social engineering,
the social mediation, the inflation of subscribers, followers, adherents and
believers, the Googling of, the Facebooking of, the fantastic successes of,
the obvious failures everyone overlooked except yours truly gone bonkers
with jealous rage then crumpled into a whimpering pile begging for coins,
for online donations, for socialist handouts, for god's sake people listen up,
armageddon is nigh, nobody listened to the real Year 2000 disaster and
looked what happened, the earth got hotter, flatter and Rubics cubical,
woe, woe, motherfucking Luddites, high-tech mass killing machines are
the answer.

What the fuck you talking about. Let's go pig.
