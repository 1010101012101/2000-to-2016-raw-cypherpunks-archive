 U.S. Senate Approves Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism

 Convention called important tool in war on terror, organized crime
 12 October 2005
 By Eric Green
 Washington File Staff Writer

 Washington -- The U.S. Senate approved October 7 the Inter-American
 Convention Against Terrorism, which has received the strong support of the
 Bush administration. The administration had reaffirmed its firm support for
 the counterterrorism convention in a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney
 General for Legislative Affairs William Moschella urging the Senate to
 approve the measure. Moschella wrote that the Bush administration
 "strongly" supported the convention.


 U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (Republican of Alabama) said on the Senate floor
 before the agreement was approved that the convention would provide an
 important tool "in our war against terrorism and organized crime." Sessions
 is a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and
 Homeland Security.

 The United States signed the convention in June 2002, but Senate approval
 was needed before the United States could ratify the Western Hemisphere
 counterterrorism measure. For the anti-terrorism convention to become
 officially approved by the United States, the Senate's ratification must be
 subsequently signed and registered ("deposited") by President Bush at the
 Organization of American States (OAS).

 The OAS General Assembly adopted the pact in June 2002 in Bridgetown,
Barbados.

 The organization said the convention is the first international measure
 against terrorism negotiated after the September 11, 2001, attacks against
 the United States. The convention provides the legal framework for
 cooperation among the 34 OAS member states in the fight against terrorism.

 The U.S. State Department pledged an additional $1.6 million in February to
 strengthen and expand counterterrorism coordination in the Western
 Hemisphere, bringing the total U.S. contribution to $5 million on this
 issue since the September 11 terrorist attacks.

 According to the State Department report, Country Reports on Terrorism
 2004, terrorists in the Western Hemisphere becoming increasingly active in
 illicit transnational activities, including the drug trade, arms
 trafficking, money laundering, contraband smuggling and document and
 currency fraud.

 The report said the threat of international terrorism in the Western
 Hemisphere remained relatively low during 2004, compared to other world
 regions but added that terrorists might seek safe haven, financing,
 recruiting, illegal travel documentation, or access to the United States
 from the hemisphere.

 Terrorism was also the subject of a September 2004 State Department
 electronic journal, The Global War on Terrorist Finance, available on the
 State Department Web site.

 The text of Inter-American Convention Against Terrorismon from the OAS Web
 site is available below.
