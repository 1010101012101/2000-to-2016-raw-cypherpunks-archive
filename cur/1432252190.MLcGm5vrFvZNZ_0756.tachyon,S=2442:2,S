Have you ever done penetration testing? It would be harder at a small
airport because the people all know each other. It's the larger
organizations in which you're able to cloak yourself in anonymity.

You are correct, however, in your characterization of the screeners.
Sheesh, what a bunch of mouth-breathing imbeciles and petty thieves. I
haven't flown since 2001, but I bring people to NYC airports frequently,
and am always impressed with TSA's level of professionalism. Not
favorably impressed, mind you, but impressed.
