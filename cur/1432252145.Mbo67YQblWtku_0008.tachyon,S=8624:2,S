 Certicom Earns FIPS 140-2 Validation on Palm OS

    Security Builder GSE enables developers to quickly add a FIPS 140-2
    validated cryptographic module to their government solutions

    MISSISSAUGA, ON, Nov. 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Certicom Corp.
(TSX: CIC), a leading provider of wireless security solutions, today announced
that Security Builder(R) GSE(TM), Certicom's core developer toolkit for
government, has earned the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
140-2 certification for the Palm OS 4.1 platform (certificate No. 351). This
makes Security Builder GSE the first developer toolkit to provide a FIPS 140-2
validated module for multiple handheld operating systems. In June, Certicom
announced FIPS 140-2 validation on Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows CE
operating systems.
    By supporting multiple platforms, Security Builder GSE allows system
integrators and original equipment manufacturers to use a common API to
quickly and easily embed FIPS validated security into their devices and
applications.
    Security Builder GSE is the core cryptographic module for all Certicom
security applications which means movianVPN(TM) GSE for Palm and
movianCrypt(TM) GSE for Palm also meet government security requirements. These
products are particularly important to government agencies that need to
securely extend their networks to wireless handhelds but are required to use
only FIPS 140-2 validated applications.
    FIPS is considered a benchmark for security within U.S. and Canadian
government departments and agencies and is becoming a de facto standard
internationally. Products must undergo rigorous testing by an accredited
independent lab to satisfy the governments' standards. FIPS 140-2 is awarded
through the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) and the
Canadian Communication Security Establishment (CSE).
    "We're extremely pleased Certicom has received FIPS 140-2 validation on
the Palm platform. This will now make it easier for government workers to
better integrate their Palm-powered handhelds into their secure networks,"
said John Inkley, director of federal sales for palmOne. "Mobile workers want
more than just secure access to email. They want access to corporate
information and applications too. This validation provides not one, but many
alternative solutions for everything from secure push e-mail to backend
database access and updates. Now users can do it with the confidence that
their security meets the government's most stringent guidelines." Since 1997,
Certicom and Palm have worked together to enable mobile workers to protect
sensitive information with a high level of security, without compromising the
speed and flexibility of wireless devices.
    "Certicom makes it easy for agencies to adhere to the strict security
guidelines mandated by the government while still using the platform of their
choice," said Tony Rosati, Certicom's vice-president, marketing and product
management. "This certification extends our relationship with Palm and
underscores our commitment to provide strong security solutions for multiple
platforms without impacting performance."
    Along with standard cryptography algorithms such as DES, 3DES, AES, SHA-1
and the RSA public key algorithm, Security Builder GSE also includes Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (ECC), a public-key cryptography technique approved by the
U.S. government and many standards organizations including ANSI, IETF, IEEE
and NIST. Last month, the National Security Agency purchased licensing rights
to some of Certicom's ECC intellectual property to protect mission critical
national security information.
    Security Builder GSE is available immediately and is priced with a
license fee and royalties based on the number of devices. For more
