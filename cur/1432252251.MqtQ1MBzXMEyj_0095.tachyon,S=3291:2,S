I agree, but I think it's highlighting an underlying issue that we've
been letting the wrong sort of people on the internet for a long time.
I tend to think that if this type of people ends up sticking to the
world of twitter and facebook and co, then we can safely caution them
off and just ignore them at large, so for that purpose it works well

------

Multiple, discrete internets are coming into play, perhaps have always
existed.

First, the known internets, utilizing ubiquitious access logging which
under guise of administration allows universal spying:

1. The internet run by operators of the overall background system
which most users know little about or care.

2 The open policing apparatus of the overall system run by governments
and their contractors and cooperating non-profits.

3. The commercial internet providing services or products for pay.

4. The non-profit, open-source, volunteer internet providing services
or products at no cost or for donations.

5. The closed sub-internets, mil-gov classified, SCADA, restricted
and special purpose networks used by operators and administrators of
backbones, nodes, satellite, cable, wired and wireless systems,

Second, the unknown internets, with or without evident access logging:

6. The covert policing and spying internet which watches, logs,
mucks around, runs stings, causes accidents and shut-downs, cuts
cables, runs surprise tests and attacks, and keeps alive the demand
for covert oversight of all the known others.

7. The covert internets which hide among all the others, or try to
subject to discovery by 6.

8. The evanescent internets which are set up, used and disappear
quickly, openly or covertly, subject to 6.

9. The wayward and waylaid internets which cannot be identified:
rogues, experiments, mistakes, erratic systems, unexpected
glitches and consequences, acts of nature, forgotten protocols,
inept code, destructive code, lost access techniques, death
of the perpetrators.

10. Internets of combinations, hybrids, deceptions, ploys and
warfare among 1-9.
