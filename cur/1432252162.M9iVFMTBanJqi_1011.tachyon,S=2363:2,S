  Why is everyone pussyfooting around the bomb plan thing
all the time? Why doesn't one of the lawyers on the list,
or somebody like Tim, who can afford a good lawyer, just
start a daily posting of pages from one of those CIA

the explosive and incendiary formulas? What possible 
charge could the trolling LEO's make?
