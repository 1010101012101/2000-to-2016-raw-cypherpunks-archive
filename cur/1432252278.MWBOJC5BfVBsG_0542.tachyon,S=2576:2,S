Perhaps on Choate Prime, a parallel planet similar to ours in many
respects, but differing in certain fundamental physical and mathematical
laws, Fermat never wrote his famous comment in the margin of the book.

Unlikely, you may say, but no more unlikely than having the fundamental
structure of complexity itself illuminated for us by a civil servant
working for the Social Security Administration, in his spare time.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.  Spam.

Speaking of Spam, I created a Yahoo mail account, and subscribed it to
minder.  Yahoo's SpamGuard(tm) does a pretty good job of filtering most of
the drek into the bulk mail folder, with no false positives.  Nigerian
banking letters, and occasional other legitimate-at-first-glance things
still make into regular mail, but the spew of Viagra/Penis
Enlargement/You're PRe-Approved!/Watch me massage my twat on the Web/Hot
teens with farm animals!! posts is largely abated.  Posts from Choate
Prime can also be filtered into a separate folder for later enjoyment.
