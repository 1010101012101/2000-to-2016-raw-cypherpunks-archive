Well I'm flattered :-) and impressed.   I would be more impressed if
e.g., you actually used such an entropic phrase, in real life.  Of course,
we don't
expect you reveal the actual length of your 'phrase.

I think you have convinced me, reinforcing something I've learned and
propogated: convenience over security.  You have also reinforced something
that fits with what I know of cog sci, and which gets to the limits of H.
sapiens: you can only remember large things if they're structured
'meaningfully'.  Kasparov can't remember *random* chessboards better than
you, only real ones.
