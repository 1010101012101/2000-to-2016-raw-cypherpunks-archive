Are you suggesting they pull external resources to scan them too? This'd be
quite proactive.

It remains quite unusual.

Some variations of the experiment with:

* non suspicious/interesting documents - should trigger well-intended
automation as well as interesting documents
* boring file formats (like txt) and URLs - do all URLs get pulled or only
automatically requested ones?
* files that won't load for rendering but would load for a crawler that
tries to find malware
* you own server so that you may examine all the data send along with the
request, like the headers!
