There will always be some set of benefits to crypto-currencies that =
won=92t exist elsewhere.  So their growth will just happen, no matter =
what.

The question is just if =93centralizers=94 throw their entrepreneurial =
citizens in jail, when they build these benefits for fellow citizens.

But even when they do that, it will still grow in other countries and by =
other entrepreneurs.

Soon it will be illegal to publish open source software in some cases.  =
That would be the only way to stop a future Satoshi from releasing a =
next generation of bitcoin.  That is where =93centralizers saying no=94 =
or =93centralizers stopping it=94 means they must throw people who =
publish open source software in jail.


Best,
