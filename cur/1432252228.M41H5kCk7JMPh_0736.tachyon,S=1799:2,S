"HANOVER, Germany -- German police have arrested an 18-year-old man 
suspected of creating the Sasser computer worm, believed to be one of the 
Internet's most costly outbreaks of sabotage."

Note the language...an "18 year old MAN" and "sabotage"...

So a HS kid, living with his parents, is able to write a worm that takes out 
  millions and millions of computers throughout the world running the latest 
MS OS. Uh....shouldn't we arrest Bill Gates first?
