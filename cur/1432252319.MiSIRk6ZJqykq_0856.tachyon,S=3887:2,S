Two point. I did not know that about Mexico (I did say it was made about
the countries I knew about.) Switzerland and Brasil both allow student
visa holders to work, albeit with restrictions. Likewise for other EU
nations.

I would imagine that people with or without a work permit would be able
to find work at some mexican restaurants. That is the case the world
over, I don't see why Mexico would be different here.

I wholeheartedly agree with you, but then again, not too many countries
have an economy that has as large a population of illegal workers as
ours.

It may well be nonsense. But my opinions are expressed as based on my
personal experience in other countries and this one.
