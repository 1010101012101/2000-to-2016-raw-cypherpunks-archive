In principle, it should be possible to write a stego program that is 
undetectable, provided your enemy has no better models of noise 
sources in the medium than you have.   As far as I know, no one 
has done this.

It is probably easier to do this with sound than with video, as order 
and randomness in sound somewhat easier to specify.
