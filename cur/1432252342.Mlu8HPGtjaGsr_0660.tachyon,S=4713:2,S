The Nexus is like a mini-OS for the trusted side of the machine.  It acts
as a kernel to manage the "trusted applications", the Nexus Computing
Agents or NCAs.

So what this sentence is really saying is that only one (trusted) OS
will be able to run at a time on a machine.  That's not that surprising
or significant.  Most machines only run one OS at a time.  Sure, with
virtualization and similar techniques you can manage to run more than
one OS at once, but that's unusual.  Probably 99.9% of machines are only
running one OS at a time.

Virtualization is not an option with trusted computing because part of
the point is to be able to offer assurance to remote users about what
the machine will do (i.e. its behavior is predictable, hence trusted).
This implies that it only makes sense to run one trusted OS at a time.
That's probably all the "important" sentence above means.

Right, plus it schedules, loads them, etc, like an OS kernel.  Here is
a simplified form of a diagram they use.  The left hand side is the
legacy mode, with normal Windows applications and OS.  The right hand
side is the new trusted mode, with NCAs as the applications and Nexus
as the OS.

       Normal Mode                  Trusted Mode

Yes, it sounds like it will work exactly like that.  Plus, hopefully
it will be possible for Linux to create its own Nexus ("Linexus"?) that
uses the same hardware features to provide TC capabilities for that OS.
Recall that Linus Torvalds recently adopted the position that DRM was
an acceptable technology for Linux, even when it involved being built
into the kernel.  Since DRM is the main downside to TC for many people,
and TC has many more good aspects beyond DRM, it is a near certainty
that Linux will add support for Trusted Computing.

Right, he could watch all the Disney movies he wanted, without paying
for them!  Mwaa haa haa!  Foolish humans!

But seriously, these systems can only raise the cost of security.
Neither cypherpunks nor Sony should risk their collective lives that no
one will break Palladium, by hook or by crook.
