That does not mean that they were using only a primitive BIOS level
logger.  A GUI-interceptor would generate a huge log of activities;
you would just pipe it through grep TYPE: KEYBOARD-INPUT or something
and it would give you the same thing.  It doesn't really matter,
because GUI-interceptors are off-the-shelf things, so if they felt
they needed it, they would get it.  It's all pretty basic.

Bottom line: If your attacker gets access to your hardware without you
knowing it, and he has resources and a clue, he wins.  The threshold
for "clue" and "resources" in this case is very very low; maybe $100
to install your basic hardware keylogger.
