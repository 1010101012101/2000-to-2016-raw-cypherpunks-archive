> At least 5 dead, hundreds rescued from high water in Houston flooding

These horrific spring floods weren't common in the 90s when I was in Texas. Or maybe I was too stoned to notice.

We got 30 inches of snow just outside DC in MD this winter, something that hasn't happened in... well, since before I came up here. 

Greenland permafrost is fucking melting. But I've only born witness to that indirectly.

I think it's pretty obvious we are fucked here if we don't make some changes. Maybe this is fermi's great filter.
