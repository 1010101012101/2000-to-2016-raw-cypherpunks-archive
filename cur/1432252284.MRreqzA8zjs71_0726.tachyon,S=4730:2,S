So it wasn't a total spam after all, you're just upset by his commentary.

The same can be said about you or I, silly.

Bullshit. This is standard spin doctor bullshit. The differences between
'right' and 'left' are in your imagination. Both sides want to be THE
side, that's the ONLY factor worth focusing on. 'How' isn't that
important.

> they're doing far more than the Reaganites ever accomplished as far as

The 'Reaganites' accomplished nothing, other than taking credit (and
getting it) for things that would have generaly happened along the same
lines anyway. You, and most others, give 'them' way too much power over
what happens. Quit acting like a victim.

Condemnations equally applicable to Republican, Democratic, Green, or
Libertarian (and any others you generaly want to add to that list).
 
At least it got you off your ass.

Happy New Year.
