(Choate's various lists, like Inferno and Sci-Tech, removed. We got 
rid of Hettinga's massive list profusion, so adding Choate's seems 
ill-advised.)

Ah, but we wired golden staters have satellite, which gives us PBS 
East. However, I was enjoying the warm temps in Santa Cruz, though 
nippy after dark, so you are, it turns out, correct.

--Tim, reading about JYA's subpoena just after reading Levy's account 
of how we won the crypto war. Hmmmhhhh.

(and after having just caught the late afternoon matinee of 
"Traffic," the excellent film about the nonwinning of the War on Some 
Drugs)

BTW, no apparent subpoenas for moi, which is good. Ignoring both CJ 
Parker/Toto and Jim Bell, except for a couple of early responses, 
seems to have insulated me well.
