FROM: JEAN-PIERRE ONDEKANE ,

DEAR FRIEND,

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS LETTER MEETS YOU 
IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM  JEAN-PIERRE ONDEKANE  , AIDE TO THE LATE 
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC). I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SOUTH AFRICA.

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY 
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A WAR REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. 
FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT 
OF POWER, I WAS INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND LODGED IN MY NAME 
WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING DISCLOSED AS FAMILY 
VALUABLES, PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 
1997, PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS LED BY 
LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM KISINGANI  AND FLED TO TOGO 
FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 
1997 LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE WAS 
AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH MY SON PATRICE, AGED 
17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE 
CAPITAL CITY KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY WIFE, 
TWO CHILDREN, AND MY POSSESSIONS DURING THE REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE 
CAPITAL CITY.

THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE AMASSED A PERSONAL 
FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH HOUSES IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. 
HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS 
WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL 
HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW 
IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE 
NOW THAT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH KABILA 
HAS TAKEN OVER. 

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD WHERE THE MONEY 
IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO 
PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING THE MONEY 
ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE 
MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE 
THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND 
HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED 
IN YOU. 

IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE 
BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND 
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR 
SERVICES. I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE 
MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.

FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION, WHICH IS 
YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND 
ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

YOURS SINCERELY,

JEAN-PIERRE ONDEKANE
