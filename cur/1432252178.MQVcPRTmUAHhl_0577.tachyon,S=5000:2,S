True. So perhaps we can say it is "less likely" to have glaring bugs  
than it's proprietary counterparts. Sure, bugs will be overlooked or  
outright missed in any project of size. But with more eyes comes a  
better chance of bugs and backdiors being caught.

It depends on the RFC and how it's written. I've read many RFC's that  
were very informative and easy to understand. A well written book on  
the topic is always better, but you can almost always find what you  
need in the RFC. It may not be optimal but it's not horrible.
