Nice to see someone else out there believes in general semantics nC)e
Plato's Cave.

On the other hand, for someone who seems stuck on the belief that money
creates an objective reality, RAH certainly did a good job getting you
riled up.

I prefer to think of it as an exodus from an undesirable place.  It was
too cold, and the shadows were causing eyestrain.  I'm perfectly capable
of imagining such an exodus, at least.  In my place of exile, there are
no models.  Well...

A prince is also a magician.  Ask Fowles.

Too little coffee and milk in his morning window-pane acid.

Or if every 3rd person is on the government's payroll and gets
government toys with which to spy on their neighbors, or if they or TLA
agents can invade my house at will, or if I'm prohibited from owning
guns or knives or anything that might ouch in the slightest, like the
FINE FOLK of Britannia and its former penile colony.

*I* can't deal with those kinds of threat models, at least.  It's not
worth my effort.  I might just join the government corps and use that as
an excuse to spy on my neighbor's hot 13-year-old daughter.*

* No, you fascist pigfucker government e-tards, not really.  If you
check, you'll find that neither of my neighbors has an underage
daughter, so go fuck yourself.
