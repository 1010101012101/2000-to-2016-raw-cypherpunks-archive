Just a few hours ago Versign modified the Internet's root DNS servers to 
respond to ANY DNS lookup that doesn't resolve in a real hostname to return 
the IP address of one their servers where they claim to have a search engine.

For example, if you access http://www.thisisjunk55666.com , you will get a 
Verisign page, not a "Host can not be found error".

This means that many anti-spam checks will fail among other issues.

They will also intercept mail to mistyped email hosts (They claim to reject 
the mail, but not after having collected the From and To address).

This really bites.
