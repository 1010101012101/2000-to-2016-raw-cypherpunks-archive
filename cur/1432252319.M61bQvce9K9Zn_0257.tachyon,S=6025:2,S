This comparison is invalid.  You are correct that your private property is
... well ... your private property, but if you look closely you will find
that you have a contract (of some kind, be it an agreement, etc.) with
your city - most likely in the form of an easement.  So, by interrupting
their water line, you would be breaking your contract.

Make no mistake, if you hold a contract that AOL entered in with you that
stipulates that they must send your email that you place onto their
property to your friend, then by all means prosecute them to your fullest
ability.  Further, if the AUP/TOS ("contract") that your friend, as a
subscriber, has with AOL stipulates something similar, then again, go
forward with my best wishes.

We all know, however, that AOL has no such contract with you, and that
their contract with your friend most likely boils down to "we will do as
we see fit and you will like it", and further, that even the peering
agreements that AOL has with other service providers, common carrier laws,
etc. most likely do not come anywhere near to stipulating this.  As well
they shouldn't.

So once again, we are back to:

AOL can do whatever they want with the bits you place on their private
property.

This will be my last response to this thread.  Your comments boil down to:

a) You have forgotten that communication existed before the Internet, and
further, that Internet communication exists just fine without AOL.  The
obvious conclusion that using AOL is an act of terminal stupidity is left
as an exercise for the reader.

b) You invoke the tired, meaningless appeal to the big bad corporation
stomping on the little guy.  In reality, AOL can do whatever it pleases
with your bits when you place them on their property, barring any prior
contract to the contrary.  Any legislation that stipulates otherwise is
misguided.

And I think both of those are absurd.
