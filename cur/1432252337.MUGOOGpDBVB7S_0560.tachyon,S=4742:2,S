     That sounds like censorship to me.
     Way to restrictive, kinda like COPPA aka Children Loose 
their Right to Free Speech Online (CLRFSO), a voilation of the 
first ammendment and of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.
     As seen in my signature:

"He who gives up liberty for security gets neither."
 - Ben Franklin

     In other words, I'm 100% against any federal law restricting 
internet users.

PS: I am a 7th grader, and DO NOT have/have need of a license to 
read books. I was able to get a library card at the age of about 
four.
