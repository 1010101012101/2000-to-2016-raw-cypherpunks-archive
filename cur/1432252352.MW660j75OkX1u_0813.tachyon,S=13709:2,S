The DMCA was lobbied for by the large movie and music and book and magazine
lead to massive distribution of popular movies, recorded music, books, and
magazines without any payment to the copyright holders.  Under the old
pre-DMCA copyright law, buyers of books, albums, and movie tapes had many
rights:
