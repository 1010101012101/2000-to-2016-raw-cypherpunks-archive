Latest wave of protests
14jan02
FIVE nude protesters skinny dipped at Sandridge beach
yesterday, escaping arrest despite their illegal actions.
Nudity lobby group Freedom International staged the latest in a series of 
protests aimed at changing the state's nudity laws.
Keith Stodden, Tony Pitman, Rollan McCleary and Stuart Kingsford have told 
police before each protest and there have been no arrests, despite one 
protest last year being staged in the same park as a police rally.
Mr Pitman said the lack of arrests did not mean their message was unheard.
"I think there is a point. If we do it enough times we have kind of proven 
that the law is redundant," he said.
"What we need is for the law to be changed because it can be applied 
arbitrarily."
Mr Pitman pointed to a court decision last year concerning two women who 
were arrested for jogging nude outside the Crown casino during a protest.
While the court found they had not behaved offensively and therefore 
committed no crime, they still had to suffer the trauma of court 
appearances, he said.

You gotta fight  for your right  To PARTY!
