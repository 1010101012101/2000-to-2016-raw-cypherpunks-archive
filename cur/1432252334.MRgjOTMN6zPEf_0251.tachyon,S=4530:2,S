I read a few Burgess novels as a teenager - A Clockwork Orange, The Eve of St. 
Venus, One Hand Clapping, The Wanting Seed and I don't remember them that way. I 
remember them reading smoothly and clearly without a great struggle. Probably time to 
revisit one or two just to double-check my old brain.

I know the experience -  in the southern US, in Scotland - it's all English. Really? People 
are probably creating language constantly like a software evolutionary experiment. 
Much of it probably dies out. What remains appears to be "speciation". Write much 
Forth lately?
