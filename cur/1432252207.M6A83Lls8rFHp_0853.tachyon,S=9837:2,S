This is called "proof of stake" not weight of stake and is different from
Ripple's consensus process.

This doesn't really describe how Ripple works. Ripple relies on the
agreement of 80% or more of validator nodes per gateway to verify if a
transaction took place or not. I write more about this in
http://rippleinvestmentguide.com/

Only if 80% of the networks validator nodes do that which is in practice
not likely to happen on a large enough scale.

I'll ping David Schwartz one of the co-inventors about this question.
