	Last time I checked, the 'internet' is a bunch of servers
	controlled by google and the pentagon and I don't happen to have
	the password(s).

	Please, any hacker out there, post the password(s) so I we can
	watch the guards. Thank you very much.

	...yeah, 'better view'  is somewhat more accurate.

	Sorry, that's exponential bullshit.

	Sorry, that's not the point at all? The problem with people
	reading your 'private' mail or your mind is that it that it
	enables them to attack you way more efficiently. 

	We are not talking about your neighbor reading your mail or
	your mind(none of his business anyway), we are talking about the
	sickest nazis on the planet doing it. 

	Surely you realize that's a bit problematic?

	How old are you?

	You want more age-based 'analysis'? The old farts you mentioned
	have raised generations of clueless young retards.
