Not true. One example from the theory of computation: given a finite set of
3x3 matrices, determine whether some finite matrix product of them equals
zero (i.e. repetition and reordering is allowed). This is a noncomputable
problem, even when we know that all such series can be computer generated
and a given solution can be easily verified. Sort of cracked me when I first
found it.

Naturally this particular problem isn't suitable for human consumption, like
the original mail required.
