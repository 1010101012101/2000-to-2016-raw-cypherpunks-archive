theMembrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation, or MOIRE =E2=80=94 w=
ould be of great use in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the spot 22,000 miles (=
35,000 kilometers) up where most telecommunications satellites reside.=0A"M=
embrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telesc=
opes in smaller and lighter packages," Lt. Col. Larry Gunn, MOIRE program m=
anager, said in a statement. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infogra=

g=E2=80=99 that traditional materials impose on optics design," Gunn added.=
 "We=E2=80=99re hoping our research could also help greatly reduce overall =
costs and enable more timely deployment using smaller, less expensive launc=
h vehicles."=0AMOIRE is now in Phase 2 of development since work began in 2=
010. When this phase is completed, a 16-foot (5 meters) prototype of the te=
lescope's mirror should be completed for ground testing. No space missions =
have been set for MOIRE yet, DARPA officials said.=0AThere are both advanta=
ges and disadvantages to the MOIRE design. The membrane is not as efficient=
 as the usual glass, but it is lighter =E2=80=94 which allows prime contrac=
tor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. to make larger lenses to increase t=

 refract it (using lenses), but MOIRE's behaves differently. Each membrane =
will instead diffract light using a piece of equipment known as a Fresnel l=
ens.=0A"It is etched with circular concentric grooves like microscopically =
thin=C2=A0tree rings, with the grooves hundreds of microns across at the ce=
nter down to only 4 microns at the outside edge," DARPA officials said in a=
 statement. "The diffractive pattern focuses light on a sensor that the sat=
ellite translates into an image."=0AIf the design ever reaches orbit, DARPA=
 envisions the membrane stretching to 66 feet (20 meters) in diameter =E2=

=A0and more than three times bigger than the mirror for NASA's huge James W=
ebb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.=0AThe membranes =
would ride to space as "petals" packed into a tight package about 20 feet (=
6 m) wide, small enough to fit on a rocket. These petals would then unfurl =
in orbit, and provide an estimated resolution of 3.3 feet (1 m).=0AFollow E=
