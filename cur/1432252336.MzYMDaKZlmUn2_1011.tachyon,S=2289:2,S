Normal traffic goes in, encrypted traffic comes out.

Now it's easy to achieve communications integrity. Plug in a
CryptoRouter into your network, and all traffic passing through
it will be protected by XeroBank's Blacknet. CryptoRouters create
instant internet anonymity, and can be used to anonymously link
remote office environments through closed-group routing.

CryptoRouters are designed to be the ultimate network security
device. They extend the XeroBank network and it's protection to
wherever they are installed. All communications routed through
the CryptoRouter are transparently encrypted and anonymized. They
are equipped with the VIA Padlock encryption engine, allowing a
throughput of up to 20 Gbps of AES-256 encryption.
