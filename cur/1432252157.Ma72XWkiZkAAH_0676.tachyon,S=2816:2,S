what version are you on? ckt never does that - it checks it, and marks the
sig status as good or bad - but obviously marks the key status as invalid
(due to lack of signing) on anyone I don't trust enough to sign :)
oh - and some versions of pgp have trouble with that particular key - its a
4K RSA that V5.x would accept, but V6.x wouldn't
Try 6.5.8 CKT instead :)
