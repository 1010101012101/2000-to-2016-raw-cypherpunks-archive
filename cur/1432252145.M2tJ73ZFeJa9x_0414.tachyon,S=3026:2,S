Ah, return to the good old days pre-911 when domestic extremists
replaced domestic communists to assure internal security for
the internal security consortia. Hackers combined with hate
groups fit the bill for unwitting complicity with rogue states.

What is the symbiosis between WikiLeaks, the KKK, Communism,
Jihad and the Internet.

Insider informants, outsider watchers, coerced turncoats,
guilty pleaders, agents provocateurs, whisperers to media,
congressional testifiers, novel technology to generate and
penetrate devilish plots, covertly authorized unauthorized
disclosures by journo lunches with spy chiefs, beef up of black
budgets, moans about cut-backs to legacy money pits, more
secrecy coupled with proclamations of more openness to
protect democracy from hidden undemocratic enemies
exploiting US open society to manipulate gullible citizens.

Just when the tide appears to be turning in favor of Assange
and Manning, comes a recycled threat of extremism empowered
by new technology, social media and anonymity.
