I have been updating CanCrypt, a directory of Canadian cryptographic
resources. It is intended to be a clearing house of Canadian related
cryptographic resources.

Although the relaxing of US export regulations has reduced some of its
importance, Canada still has a more liberal cryptographic policy for
export and usage. Compared to both the USA (re: export) and UK (re: RIP)
it is very crypto-friendly.
