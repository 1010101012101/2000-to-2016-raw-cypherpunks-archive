I knew Feynman (*) and I knew the main survivor or the criticality 
accident at Los Alamos. (Klein, who survived "ticking the dragon's tail" 
and had annual tests done for the rest of his life, which just ended a 
couple of years ago.) You are overstating the "high risks of criticality 
incidents," I think strongly.

(* This should mean something to you: we had him over for dinner at our 
place on Camino del Sur, I.V.)

Feynman wasn't even involved in that end of the physics. A couple of 
deaths happened, which is hardly surprising given the speed and 
magnitude of the war effort. More Americans died when a particular truck 
hit a land mine. More Americans probably died in Los Alamos when their 
trucks ran off the roads into the ravines. Get some perspective.

Fuck your "Peace" bullshit.

You are spouting nonsense with your "glowing waste zone" idiocy.

I lived west of the Hanford plant for a few years and had occasion to 
measure the radioactivity levels of samples. The ash from the eruption 
of Mt. St. Helens was hotter than all but a very few small pockets of 
soil in the Tri-City Area.

You should cut down on the bullshitting.
