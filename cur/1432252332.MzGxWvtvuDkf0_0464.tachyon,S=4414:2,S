	The only things I can think of are:

	(1) Cost of pushing heavy shit up the gravity slope.

	(2) Danger of rocket "catastrophically" failing and blowing 
radioactive material all over hell and gone.

	(3) Not a chance in hell of selling it to the tree huggers 
and the ignorant.

	(1) Is the only one that makes sense, but we should be able 
to find a cheaper way of getting up there. We should be able to 
engineer around (2).

	(3) Is probably the toughest nut to crack.

	So, I am not asking for much elaboration, just a bit of a clue.
