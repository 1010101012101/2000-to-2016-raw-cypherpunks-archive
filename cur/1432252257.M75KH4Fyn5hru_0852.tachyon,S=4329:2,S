Back peddling on whistle blowers and now this...White House defends Bush's 
omission of Hinduism
WASHINGTON: White House press secretary Ari Fleischer had a tough time 
explaining why President George W Bush failed to mention Hinduism among the 
religions practised in the US, even as he asserted that in line with the 
country's pluralistic traditions, the President had equal regard for people 
from all faiths.Bush had reportedly failed to list Hinduism among the 
religions practised in America, though he took Christianity, Judaism and 
Islam in the reckoning.
Shrub has clearly earned ringbarking.
