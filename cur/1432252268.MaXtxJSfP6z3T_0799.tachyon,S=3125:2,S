US accidentally gave Moussaoui classified information on
  al-Qaeda: report

  September 07, 2002, 11:09 PM

                WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US government accidentally gave
                Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in
connection with the
                September 11 attacks, classified information about
al-Qaeda, ABC
                News reported.

                The documents and computer disks were mistakenly handed
over to
                Moussaoui along with materials the government is
required to
                furnish for his legal defense, several legal sources,
including one at
  the Justice Department, told the network Friday. Moussaoui is serving
as his own
  counsel.
