Nonsense.  You don't understand the marketplace of ideas.  Free expression
is "sacrificed" only if other outlet for expression are silenced.  I cannot
and would not shut down cypherpunks@einstein.ssz.com, cypherpunks@lne.com,
etc.  I will invite like-minder C'punks into my virtual living room and
encourage them to speak, but not to shouting.  You don't want to go there,
fine.  Stay with the crowd that makes you feel comfortable, but don't talk
nonsense about censorship.
