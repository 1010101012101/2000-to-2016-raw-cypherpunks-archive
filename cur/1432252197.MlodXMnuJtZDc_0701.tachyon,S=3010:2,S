Hey, I oppose *anything* which is forced upon others, even if *I*
deem it as "good".

Yeah, like raise armies, feed bureaucraps, etc.  Still, I don't
hold it against the farmers.  Besides, the dominant cultures
are descendants of farmers.  See the writings of Jared Diamond.

Well, if they *like* it, only violent coercion would cause reversion.
I was thinking something like, the diabetes-fix package causes premature

death or something bothersome like that.

Obviously the "service pack 6 nasal spray" needs to refuse to install
on folks without the proper prior install.  Also it needs to avoid
spurious installation on folks who don't want it ---maybe you have
to take a snort of some antibiotic combo at the same time to activate
it,
which is a current technique used for turning on inserted genes.
