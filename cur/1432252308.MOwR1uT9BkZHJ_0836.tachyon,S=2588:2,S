You have omitted a bit.  A better question might be: "how would you have
felt if you had looted an entire country for 30 years, invaded two others,
annihilated any who objected, butchered hundreds of thousands of people,
dispatched assasins after enemies abroad, laughed at anyone who objected
-- and then had been submitted to what appeared to be a polite and
conscientious public dental exam and haircut?"

Damn lucky, to be honest.
