	Oh come on Mirimir. As 'we' know, they did the only thing they
	could have done. 

	The only way for them to be able to exploit their users as
	cover is by making the system 'public' and 'free'. They didn't
	do it because of ANY altruistic and humanitarian motivation.
	They had no other choice, and it was good propaganda to boot!

	So, 

	1) They need human shields, their abused 'users'

	2) The system doesn't pose a threat to 'GPAs' - that is the
	system doesn't pose a threat to its owner, the US military.

	The distinction looks rather subtle. It's actually invisible and
	non-existent from my point of view...

	Hardly surprising cosidering how powerful the US government is
	and how far its control over 'industry' and 'academy' goes. It
	includes the 'community' of sold out 'hackers' too.

	Also, it should be obvious that having bad and *subsidized*
	systems like tor fucks up the 'market' for security.
