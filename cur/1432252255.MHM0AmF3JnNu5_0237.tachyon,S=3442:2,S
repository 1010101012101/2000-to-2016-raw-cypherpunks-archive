Because people like you have murdered over a hundred million people like  
me, and done so with a lordly glow of moral superiority and with the  
glowing endorsement of the New  York Times and Harvard university.

Hence that pious smugness disgusts me.   It is not the technical details  
that are off topic, as the piety and moral superiority.

If the global "fairness" of a scheme is on topic, then what constitutes  
global fairness is on topic.  Therefore the "fairness" of a scheme should 
not be on topic.

Bitcoin is intended as a more readily transportable substitute for gold,  
thus the economic history of the gold standard, and the various financial 
instruments built on top of gold is on topic.

Whether gold or those financial instruments oppressed the poor or unduly  
advantaged the Jews is not on topic.  Economic history of gold is on  
topic, political history of gold is off topic.  Economics 101 is on topic.  
That economics 101 sounds suspiciously reactionary and supposedly oppressed 
the poor is off topic.
