To Get Around US Law, The NSA Collects Email Address Books And Chat Buddy=
 Lists From Foreign Locations

by	 ALEX WILHELM posted 2 Hours Ago

The Washington Post [link below] broke news this afternoon that the Nationa=
l Security Agency (NSA) is collecting huge numbers of email address books=
 and chat buddy lists for both foreign individuals and United States citize=
ns.

It appears that the NSA lacks Congressional authority to collect buddy list=
s and address book information in the way that it currently does. As the Po=
st rightly points out, address book data can include physical addresses, ve=
ry personal information, and more.

To get around that lack of a mandate, the NSA has agreements with non-U.S.=
 telcos and works with other, non-U.S. intelligence groups.&nbsp;So to get=
 its hands on even more information, the NSA avoids the constraints of its=
 provided oversight and legal boundaries, by going to alternative sources=
 of the data that it wants.

That matters because the rules of other countries for tracking the communic=
ation of United States citizens are more lax. Recall that the NSA is in som=
e ways slowed from collecting information on citizens of the United States,=
 but not those of other countries.

So, if the NSA is willing to accept data from foreign intelligence agencies=
 that it is not able to collect in this case, why not in other cases as wel=
l?

If the NSA won=E2=80=99t respect the constraints that are put in place on=
 its actions for a reason, and will instead shirk its responsibilities and=
 find a way to get all the data it could ever desire, then we have even les=
s reason to trust its constant petitions that it follows the law, and is th=
e only thing keeping the United States safe from conflagration.

The Post continues: =E2=80=9CWhen information passes through =E2=80=98the=
 overseas collection apparatus,=E2=80=99 [an intelligence office] added, =
=E2=80=98the assumption is you=E2=80=99re not a U.S. person.=E2=80=99=E2=80=
=9D This means that when the NSA sweeps up contact data, buddy lists, and=
 address sets from overseas, the same rules that keep it from collecting in=
formation on United States citizens aren=E2=80=99t likely in play. Minimiza=
tion, it would seem, would be minimal.

The phone metadata program knows who you called, when, and for how long. PR=
ISM can force your private information out of major Internet companies. XKe=
yscore can read your email, and tracks most of what you do online. And the=
 above program circumvents Congressional oversight by collecting more data=
 on U.S. citizens by merely executing that collection abroad.

How private are you feeling?

 safe, and we will continue to be aggressive advocates for greater disclosu=

ss to our customers=E2=80=99 data=E2=80=9D and that if the above revelation=
