A few posts back when I pointed out that most businesses engage in routine, regularly scheduled deletion of potentially inconvenient records, and none of them have got in trouble for it yet, you replied that a business that engages in that practice is like a man who has jumped from a tall 
building and boasts that he has not hit anything hard yet.

Now, however, you deny ever taking that position, indicating that your previous position (the position that you proclaimed so pompously and patronizingly) was a load of old bananas, which in turn indicates that in this area of the law, you do not know shit from beans

Whenever I ask our company lawyer a legal question, he usually answers "That is not my area of expertise".

You should try that answer.  It will keep you out of lots of trouble.
