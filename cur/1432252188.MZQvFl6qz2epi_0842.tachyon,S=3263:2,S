I was thinking online obscurity (nyms, pseudonymous web pages etc) coupled
with a low tax jurisdiction like Anguilla wouldn't be one interesting
combination.

But there are plenty of disadvantages too -- limited amenities - shops,
computer parts, the advantages being within reasonable travelling distance
of a large western city affords.  The inconvenience and cost of travelling
from a remote locale such as Anguilla if you do much international
travelling to visit family, friends, conferences etc.

Apparently there are some tax advantages to residing in some Swiss cantons.

But as Tim says there aren't really any jurisdictions which offer
significant advantages in physical and financial privacy over general
western jurisdictions.
