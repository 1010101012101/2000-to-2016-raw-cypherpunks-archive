I know of one system that takes credit cards over HTTPS, and then sends the
credit card number, encrypted with GPG to a backend system for processing.
It isn't perfect, but it's better than storing the credit card number on a
database accessible to the web server.  (I would feel a lot better if
Amazon didn't remember my credit card number.)
