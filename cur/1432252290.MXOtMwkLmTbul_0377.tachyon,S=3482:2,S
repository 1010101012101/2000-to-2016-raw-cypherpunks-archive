I doubt that any kind of anti-spam mechanism which requires such 
a certification will be widely accepted. And I do not believe that
any cryptographical method can be deployed widely enough to provide
security against spam. Cryptography is simply too complicated and too
error/theft-of-secret prone to be used in common. 


(If anyone is interested, I've made an alternative proposal based on
non-cryptographic DNS-based lightweight authentication/authorization,
available at 
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-danisch-dns-rr-smtp-01.txt )
