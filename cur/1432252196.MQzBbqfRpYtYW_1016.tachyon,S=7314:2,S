To quote myself "the CopChip can be disabled easily," last paragraph
sentence begins with "For the consumer . . . " as has been pointed out by
numerous people, there is no solution to this. With a minimal amount of
electrical engineering knowledge it is possible for individuals to easily
construct a new ADC anyway.

Which can and should be done after conversion.

You seem to be of the mistaken opinion that I believe this to be a good
thing, when the design I presented was designed to minimize cost, of design,
manufacture, and removal. I am of the fundamental opinion that this is not a
legal problem, this is a problem of the MPAA and anyone else that requires a
law like this to remain profitable is advertising incorrectly. The Hollywood
studios have already found the basic solution, sell advertising space
_within_ the program. In fact some movies are almost completely subsidized
by the ad space within the movie. By moving to that model for primary
revenue it is easy to accept that a massive number of copies will be made
since that improves the value of the ad space in your next movie/episode. Of
course I'm not involved with any studio so they don't ask my opinion.
