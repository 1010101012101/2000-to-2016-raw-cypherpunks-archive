Yep.

Wrong-headed cypherpunks who must be corrected or destroyed, more than likely. 
But cypherpunks none the less.

After all, just because their end objectives and motives are completely and 
totally opposite to yours or mine does not mean there aren't significant 
contributions they could make for our benefit. Just as there are things that 
other, "correct" cypherpunks could do or have done which are or could be 
detrimental.
