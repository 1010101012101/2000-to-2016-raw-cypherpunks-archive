Unambiguous and comprehensive response from Jacob Appelbaum himself to all
this dirty slander toward him!
If this kind of response "does not enough" for you, people, - just go fuck
yourself.

Jacob Appelbaum =C2=B7 @ioerror
6th Jun 2016 from TwitLonger
Berlin, June 6, 2016

In the past few days, a calculated and targeted attack has been launched to
spread vicious and spurious allegations against me. Given the way these
accusations have been handled, I had little choice but to resign from my
position as an advocate at the Tor Project and devote my full attention to
completing my doctoral work on cryptography at the Technical University of
Eindhoven.

Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime
public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been
plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.

Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so
aggressive that I feel it=E2=80=99s necessary to set the record straight. N=
ot only
have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely
accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats
(including a Twitter handle entitled =E2=80=98TimeToDieJake=E2=80=99).

I think it=E2=80=99s extremely damaging to the community that these
character-assassination tactics are being deployed, especially given their
ugly history of being used against fellow members of the LGBT community. It
pains me to watch the community to which I=E2=80=99ve dedicated so much of =
my life
engage in such self-destructive behavior. Nonetheless, I am prepared to use
legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous
accusations.

I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against
me are entirely false.

Inevitably, there may have been moments in my professional or private life
when I may have inadvertently hurt or offended others=E2=80=99 feelings. Wh=
enever I
was aware of these instances, I have, and will continue to, apologize to
the friends and colleagues in question and to continually learn how to be a
better person. Though the damage to my reputation caused by these
allegations alone is impossible to undo, I nonetheless take the concerns of
the Tor community seriously. To dispel any further rumors, to the best of
my knowledge, the Tor network is not =E2=80=98compromised.=E2=80=99

I=E2=80=99ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime memb=
er of
the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and
to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.
These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious
campaign that is currently being waged against me.
