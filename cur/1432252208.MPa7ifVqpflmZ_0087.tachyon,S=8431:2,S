No, I didn't say there are any "good guys" (nor that there aren't any, =
mind=20
you). But even between a clusterfuck of "bad guys", each dragging in th=
eir own=20
direction, simply *because* they are dragging all in different directio=
ns,=20
there might be space for some neat projects.

Think of it as a hack on the system.

Guy A needs total secrecy of communication for their moles in third wor=
ld=20
countries and finances a tool that incidentally is a huge PITA for guy =
B, that=20
tries to surveil everything and everybody.

Guy A and guy B are far enough from each other=20
(system/hierarchy/department/competence-wise) that they do not co-opera=
te, nor=20
even know of each other too well. Or: they know of each other and are i=
n a=20
state of "cold war" for resources or ambition-related aims.
