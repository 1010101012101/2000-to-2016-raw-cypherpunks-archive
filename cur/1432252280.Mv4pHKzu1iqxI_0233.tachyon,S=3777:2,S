I'm not sure I understand this. On Cypherpunks we always seem to assume that 
the TLAs have infinite amounts of cash, and that's just not the case. If 
they can spend a couple of bucks to flush out a list rather than mount some 
major operation that's what they'll do, if for no other reason than to keep 
their exposure down. And if they're going to Gitmo me one day, I sure as 
hell want them to spend  a few hundred thou rather than a few hundred, and 
hopefully leave a paper trail so I can sue the crap out of 'em if somehow I 
survive.

And in case it's not clear, I'm suggesting that it may be useful for them to 
deliberately create a "fake" virus that is easily detectable, and so cull 
the bounce messages.
