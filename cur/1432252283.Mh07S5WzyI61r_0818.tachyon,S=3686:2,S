We probably need to define the product category we're discussing. I was
listing devices which prevent casual interception, and which Joe Average
might conceivably buy. The Starium is obviously more robust than that,
and consequently more expensive.

You asked in a previous message about the market size. For casual stuff,
tens or hundreds of thousands in the US, if the device is in the $100
range. For the serious stuff, I think you nailed the market pretty well.
One or two orders of magnitude less, if the device is in the $1000
range. Those numbers both assume no government interference, of course.
