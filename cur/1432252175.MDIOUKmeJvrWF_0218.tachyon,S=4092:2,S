from you exploded. Thought you should know. Nobody was hurt, thank goodness!
Maybe something is wrong with it?

Thanks,

Mrs. Smith

The above wouldn't just be any old email now would it?

No.

No.

Somebody give me a stick!

James, truly, I see the point you are trying to make and the logic you are
trying to apply. We will see what the courts do.
