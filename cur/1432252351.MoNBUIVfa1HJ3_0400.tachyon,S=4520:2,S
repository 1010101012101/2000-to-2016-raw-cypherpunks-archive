This reminds me of something I was looking at this spring. Markus
Jakobsson has two papers on "A Practical Mix" and "Flash Mixing" which
look at mix-nets in a different way than we see in remailers. There,
instead of a message being successively encrypted for a particular
path through a series of remailers, the remailers pass a prepared
encrypted message around and perform a distributed computation on it. At
the end of the computation, the decrypted name of the recipient 
automagically pops out. 

These kinds of remailers are not original to Jakobsson - but previous
efforts that I know about are ridiculously inefficient. The number I
remember for one of them is 1600 modexps per message per server.
Jakobsson's "Practical Mix" proposal is more like 160. The "Flash Mixing"
paper investigates ways to use precomputation to get this to 160
multiplications.

I should mention here that Yvo Desmedt and Karou Kurosawa showed in
Eurocrypt 2K that the original "Practical Mix" paper has a flaw -- an
evil node can cause one of the distributed computations to abort without
being caught. They noted that their results didn't extend to the "Flash
Mixing" paper; it's been a back-burner project of mine to look at this
for...well...too long. 

Anyway, both papers deal with a collection of mix servers fixed in
advance. It seems that disposable remailers would work well with
extensions of these protocols modified to deal with dynamic leave and
joins of servers. Add this to wireless and you have mobile disposable
remailers. 

Slightly related would be the idea of using commodity computation to do
remailing -- just tell people to "go to this page, download this
applet, become a remailer!" 
(or have your HD erased, but...)

There are massive issues with trusting new remailer nodes, unfortunately.
Imagine what happens when your adversary decides to show up with
polynomially many of her closest friends. 

So a further question would be whether we can design a mix protocol
which can 
	a) take advantage of all these cheap, (hopefully) distinct
	devices and their computation power
but
	b) doesn't give the commodity devices enough power to 
	break the mix, even if many (almost all??) of them act in
	concert.

Pretty much everything, if you believe some people. The Oxygen project at
MIT has a vision of computation in absolutely everything. Desmedt has an
intriguing article about just what might happen then..
