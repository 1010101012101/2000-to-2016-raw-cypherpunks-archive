Educational? Only in the study of aberrant thinking.

I confess I've baited Choate more than I care to remember, but I'm not
sure going out of your way to taunt him is particularly educational or
worthwhile. 

Someone wrote to me yesterday with this note:

"poor guy, i dont think he knows how to handle all the attention...and i
think he will just ignore you guys and let it passby and continue being
himself. too bad, it would in fact be fun to have cpunx mail reduced by
that much."
