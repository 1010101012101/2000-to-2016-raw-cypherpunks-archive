Subject: [liberationtech] Drones are not storytellers or why Syrians need
	better storytelling was Re: Pirate Bay turns to drones

Not only the development costs, but the litigation/jail time costs as well
are a huge issue with more innovative applications of drone tech.

Further, the idea of implementing drones in Syria first of all is a huge
safety risk, and could fundamentally change the perception of an already
hostile regime to encourage increasingly worse actions.

Secondly, the drones for human rights stuff all forgets a fundamental
issue, people care about stories, not grainy footage, unless the crimes are
so enormous, and even then they don't encourage action nor do they help
inform outsiders what exactly Syrians want or need.

For example, there is a fundamental difference between videos like these
that Iraqis we worked with in Baghdad were producing years ago:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVib2fMtP1w

http://www.aliveinbaghdad.org/2008/07/28/al-sahwa-mistakes-in-adhamiya/

http://www.aliveinbaghdad.org/2007/10/08/us-military-destroys-iraqi-homes-by-mistake/

...and shaky content and long range images of what often may or may not be
the "heinous crimes" individuals claim.

see this video for example:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kQMSkdo_jc&feature=player_embedded

I think its pretty clear why more efforts are not being made to more
effectively and repeatedly tell the stories of individual refugees and
people who have lost homes and loved ones. The people documenting are most
often men, and as a man who has had the same problem myself when
documenting police violence, war, etc, we too often resort to documenting
horrible events, both because we are shocked and because that involves an
adrenaline rush and provides its own sort of benefit to us as individuals,
and leaves beside the wayside any review of whether this content is really
moving minds or pushing forward a liberation agenda.

As a trainer who has worked with individuals all over the world in conflict
areas and the developing world, I have found that women are the best
trainees, followed closely by older men. Young people are often too caught
up in the moment and the injustice of it all to more effectively document
or listen to recommendations about composition, pacing, etc. I guess this
is a bit off-topic, but after spending a long time in a fairly pointless
discussion with a man from Hama about this subject last night, I felt the
need to mention it here.

I'm still trying to sort out exactly why I think the idea of drones as
human rights documentation may make sense, but it certainly cannot replace
storytelling or investigative reporting.
