Not especially. :-).

As with everything else I know of any use, I stole it. :-).

It comes from Peter Huber's 1986 "The Geodesic Network", containing
(Huber's?) observation that as the price of switches gets lower, like
with Moore's "law", the price of network nodes gets lower versus the
price of network lines, and the network changes from a hierarchical
network with expensive switches with the most expensive switches at the
top to a geodesic one, with most switches tending toward the same price
in the aggregate.

Huber stole "geodesic" from Bucky Fuller, who in turn stole it from
topology, where it means the straightest line across a surface. In three
dimensions it's a great circle, for instance, the straightest line across
a sphere, which is what "geodesic" translates to literally. Bucky called
his domes geodesic, because when you pushed on a point on the dome force
radiated out in all directions to the ground.

Of course, the internet is the mother of all geodesic networks, right?

:-).

I've expropriated the word "geodesic" in all kinds of outlandish ways,
like a cash settled auction-priced single intermediary (with lots of
competing intermediaries, of course, just one between each buyer and
seller) internet market is a geodesic market, like my claim that
societies map to their communication architectures and thus we're moving
from a hierarchical society to a geodesic one, and so on.

There's a collection of essays on geodesic markets on
<http://www.ibuc.com>, and pointers there to other rants of mine with the
"G" word in them, as well.

Cheers,
RAH
