Over here in Eurotrash statist London people set off fireworks all 
over the place, for all sorts of excuses. I probably hear or see 
some sort of firework party about once a week, sometimes just in 
someone's back garden.  And real ones too, rockets & mortars, not 
namby-pamby "firecrackers". Also  sometimes a big public affair - 
it seems to be the current fashion to use lots of fireworks when a 
construction project is finished.

In the weeks around our big bonfire celebrations in November kids 
throw them in the streets for a laugh.  Though they are getting 
more available at other times of the year now. The other week I 
noticed two firework shops within a few yards of each other in 
leafy north London suburb of Barnet.

Some nanny-staters (usually  conservatives who fear teenagers and 
think that all proles should be locked in their hutches at night 
watching TV and eatng junk food) write to the newspapers and 
demand that fireworks should be banned.

The government has pathetically caved in to the extent that they 
intend to introduce local bans on setting off fireworks after 
11pm. I don't think that public opinion would hold with the kind 
of restrictions on fireworks that many US states seem to have.
