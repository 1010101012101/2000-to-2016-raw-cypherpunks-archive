I don't know...I've been following some of the voting discussion, and to 
some extent for the rank-and-file, doesn't this still boil down to "trust 
us"? (In other words, it looks like a large number of people have to work 
very carefully to make sure the voting system is secure, and then voters 
have to trust that the group did the work correctly.)

Just riffing here, but isn't there some kind of possility for "Blacknet" 
voting? In other words, if the "voting machines" were by nature untamperable 
because of...

1) No one actually knows where they are
2) "They" aren't actually anywhere, perhaps being distributed entities on 
the network. In fact, votes pass into the voting blacknet and are 
untraceable.
3) The voting blacknet can be audited perhaps periodically (modula 
provisions for denial of service attacks), to make sure there's be no 
systematic tampering (which theoretically should be impossible anyway).

OK, of course there are issues of multiple votes &c...but this seems no more 
difficult than digital cash.
