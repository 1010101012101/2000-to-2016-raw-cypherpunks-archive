Twenty years ago was when the "3081"/Sierra version of the 370 
architecture was out. Not a small machine compared to others. The 
3081 had those fancy thermoconduction modules with plungers 
contacting the ceramics and all. Not small at all.

I have no idea which 370 was put on a plane, but I expect more than 
one generation rode on planes.

It's fairly "tired" to deprecate "glorious leaders" by claiming that 
dragging mainframes around in planes is ipso fact a dumb idea. 
Reasons are left for you to figure out.

More of the same deprecation.

I was the one here who tossed out the idea, in response to John 
Young's request, that maybe a classified TEMPEST document on 
"NONSTOP" had something to do with the Tandem NonStop line.

Clearly not, based on his later transcribings of the partially-elided 
FOIAed document.
