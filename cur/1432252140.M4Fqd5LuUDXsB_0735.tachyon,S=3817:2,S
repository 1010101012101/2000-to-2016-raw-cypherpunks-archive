In past wars, CNN has been rather accurately called
"Communist News Network", but in this war they seem incapable
of mentioning the fact that our armed forces frequently fuck
up.

When the airforce started blasting Taliban front line
positions, the press's natural response was to interview the
Northern Alliance commanders, who were watching the raids.
The Northern alliance commanders all said that the targeting
sucked, and had to be fixed, that the bombing was
ineffectual, that the bombs were just rearranging the rocks,
that it had to be done differently.  It was very difficult to
discern this thumbs down from the cnn network.
