"...during a 1997 interview, Adm. James McConnell, former director of the 
National Security Agency, confirmed that the Clinton administration gave 
the sophisticated key recovery surveillance technology to communist China 
in 1996.
McConnell noted that the advanced technology gives China the power to 
electronically lock out U.S. intelligence monitoring and lock in the 
Chinese population.
"Even if the Chinese use weak encryption the sheer volume of their 
communications will make it impossible for us to monitor. If China were to 
erect a public key infrastructure it will severely impact our intelligence 
gathering ability," stated McConnell.
He also stated that Clinton was aware that the advanced surveillance 
technology might be abused by hostile foreign powers.
"Can Key Recovery be used against dissidents and political opponents?" 
asked Adm. McConnell.
"In a word, YES," he concluded emphatically..."
