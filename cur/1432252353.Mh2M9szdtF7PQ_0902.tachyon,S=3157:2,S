Has anyone seen anything on the Supreme Court and the IR/4th Amendment
Search issue? It seems like a vacuum.

If the SC doesn't rule and let it just sit there won't this be the same as
agreeing that the search is legal without having to face the actual
constitutional test of issuing a ruling? What happens if they let it sit
until the court retires (Oct.?) for the year? Are they required to
re-visit when they rejoin?

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
