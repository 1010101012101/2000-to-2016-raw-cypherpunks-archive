I have no idea why speed limiters on cars is even close to being a
relevant analogy. I had a more simple and direct analogy in mind - it
seems to me that what Microsoft is trying to do is what many of us put
up with at work everyday - I use SPARC workstations to which I do not
have root access. I run programs that I cannot modify and those programs
can use data areas and drivers that I cannot access directly.

This is fine at work - the company owns the computers, besides the
sysadmins are actually really helpful. Having an external agent build
fencees inside my own home is an entirely different matter. One worth a
fight to the death.

Since it seems that the possibility to accomplish what Microsoft has
patented has existed for years prior to their disclosure isn't their
patent a bit weak? Maybe it's more of a formality, a prelude to an OS
dictatorship. After all, the 1st says nothing about the government
making any laws regarding an establishment of an OS. Time to form a
church of the homegrown OS. As of even date I consider Windows in all
forms to be spy/subpoena-ware and I don't even trust Redhat anymore. Is
it even safe to compile a TCP/IP stack without first obfuscating it?

BTW - what is pedanty? Peasantry? Pedantry?

I'm voting for 'peasantry' as the proper choice but yes, there was an
analogy at the root of the original post.
