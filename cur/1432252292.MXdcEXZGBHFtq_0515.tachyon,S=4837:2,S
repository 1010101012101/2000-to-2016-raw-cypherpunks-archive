Freedom hosting was forced to install malware on servers, which attacked 
the browsers used by tor clients.

This attack did not itself directly expose Silk Road, but Silk Road was 
successfully attacked at about the same time, so, possibly part of the 
same operation.

Silk Road was directly attacked by malware - they issued numerous 
complaints about this, and were repeatedly taken down by malware.  This 
happened at about the same time as the Freedom Hosting malware, though 
there is no direct evidence of a direct connection, other than timing 
and modus operandi.

Simply generating huge amounts of spam and firing it off at Silk Road 
from time to time would enable a correlation attack.  We know, however, 
that Silk Road was attacked both by huge amounts of spam, and malware.
