Where'd you get that idea that private citizens can't violate the
Constitution?  Take a look at 18USC241, 242.  Regardless, federal judges
are certainly state actors, or at least they were when they committed
treason and a change of status shouldn't make them immune to
prosecution.

I'm well aware.  I was only suggesting that there are many other people
beside the not-so-distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who are in
desperate need of trial, rope, and tree.  I'm confident that in a wide
sampling of religiously-motivated fanatics in the U.S., Sen. Santorum
would not rank even in the top thousand worst offenders.  His comments,
if anything, helped his opposition.  I could hardly imagine the Supreme
Court upholding the premise of Bowers v Hardwick this summer when they
rule on the current case.  Santorum's a harmless dinosaur.
