Matthew Gaylor responds:

I would hope it's not a debatable point when your Director of Defense 
Policy, Ivan Eland thinks victim disarmament is a good idea when he 
states "The ban against sharp metal objects (i.e., knives) aboard 
aircraft is a good one." [See 
<http://www.cato.org/current/terrorism/pubs/eland-010920.html>].

I think libertarian economist Walter Williams has the correct, and 
libertarian attitude when he wrote: "The new air safety regulations 
are consistent with today's anti-crime strategies: If people commit 
crimes with guns, call for gun control; if people commit crimes with 
knives, call for knife control. Current law prohibits pilots from 
having guns to protect their crew and passengers.  That law should be 
changed. Instead of meekly going along with the FAA's new, costly, 
oppressive and stupid safety regulations, Americans should rebel 
against them. Are we so timid and feminized that we'll accept 
anything politicians do in the name of safety?"  See: 
<http://www.townhall.com/columnists/walterwilliams/ww20010926.shtml>.

So my question to Mr. Eland is why is he willing to accept FAA 
regulations over freedom? And isn't Ben Franklin still right when he 
wrote: "They that can give up essential liberty to purchase a little 
temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."?
