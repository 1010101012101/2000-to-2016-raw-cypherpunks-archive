	lol! you are delusional =)

	Do you know that your beloved tor project threw that
	'anarchist', pentagon-financed clown appelbaum under the bus?
	How did that happen, sonny? =)  How is it possible that the tor
	freedon fighters didn't show any sort of 'solidarity' for their
	brother appelbaum? =)

	How do explain what's going on with a 'few' high-ranking tor
	cunts, sonny? Why are you so unwilling to share your little
	conspiracy theory? =)

	You know what you should be explaining? You should explain what
	kind of retard 'trusts' a 'project' staffed by gentlemen like
	the tor gentlemen.

	The tor gentlemen : on the pentagon's payroll. Having CIA
	employees. Lunatic left-wing 'feminist' fascists. Censors.
	And above all, backstabbing scumbags. They sure are people who
	deserve "full trust" =)

	In your delusional mind? sure.

	You say nothing happened because your government's police force
	(or germany's) says nothing happened? You are the king of
	anarchists rayzer! And's how's the DVM doing? Are people
	showing their papieren in den autobahnen?

	for charlatans like you, yes.

	Oh. People. And who are these people? =) What do they do for a
	living? =) What are their political views? =)
	
	Are you talking about your friends from the tor 'project' inc. ?

	Come on rayzer. Since you are a high ranking, highly dishonest
	tor-bot, it's quite safe to assume that they are your friends.
	Or employeers. Or something like that...

	
> I make acquaintances with

	lol! I think the psychos are your friends...and family. Didn't
	you mention your dad was a psycho from the US military? =)
