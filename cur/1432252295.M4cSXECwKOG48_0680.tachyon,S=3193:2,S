I'm not singling anybody out here at all on this, but he'd be even less of
a pest, for me, anyway, if people just kill-filed him and stopped replying
to him, or at least including his email address in their replies when they
do.

My Eudora filter file has *any* header with his email address in it going
to the trash...

Works for me, TYMMV.

Cheers,
RAH
