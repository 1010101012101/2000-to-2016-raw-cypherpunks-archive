Nonshit, Robert, Ray's an organ-eating anarchist not a 
vapid tea-sip socialist. A while back Ray yanked a
capitalist apologist's lawyer's cold dead dried nut heart 
from behind a Kevlar diamond-studded vest and lipped 
and tongued it like a lady's freeze-dried private then 
swallowed it whole, burping at the lawyer never missing a
syllable in a diatribe against outlaws, yodeling in Harvard
Law speak that cyber jesse james are the worst evil in 
the marketplace for riggers of such places.

No difference between a socialist and a capitalist, barks
the enemy of both sides of the same schema to rape the
poor and credulous, to feather the leaders' nest with yuk-yuk
a sucker every day. 

Commies, now there's a diversion fabricated in the propaganda 
mills by ideological word-toolers of capitalists and socialists, 
heeding the marketplace rule 1: concoct a worse evil to send 
the pack howling at phantasms while draining their savings, cutting
back their jobs, sending their sons off to slaughter pens, or, to put 
it more vulgarly, the free hand of the market lifting wallets and
crushnig lives while the media-mesmerized yokels stare bug-eyed 
shitless at angels and devils paraded from pulpits to chickenhawk
feeding lots.

No difference between capitalists, socialists and organized
religion. Creepy, how these fundamentalists yarp and predate,
blaming their victims, citing chapter and verse why those who
got it deserve it, QED.

Then philosophers who gloss the way things are as if nothing
can be done about.

Then there're mean anarchists, who Ray is one of, not the 
house-broken kind perfuming the fould feathered nests with 
mild wordy, wordy dissent as if an SEC regulator, or more
recently, promoter of the public paying for new power grids.

Markets suck, that's what makes them so appealing to
bloodsuckers of addled customers, and moreso to
vulture investors.
