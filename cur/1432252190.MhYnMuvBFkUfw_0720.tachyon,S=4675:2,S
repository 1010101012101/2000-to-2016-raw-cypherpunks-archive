	Because if we don't, then they get confused about what we're
trying to accomplish, they forget that privacy has lots of valuable
uses which are not the collapse of governments and tax revenue, and
try to ban what we're doing.  And then they go talk to Parliment to
get laws passed.  We see that as a bad thing.  Having spent time on
these conversations, I see it paying off.  And no, its not paying off
because we've added any backdoors.  I think we can agree to disagree
on this one, Tim.

Enough of our source is out there.  (The kernel bits of the AIP went
out a few days ago.  You can wait on the userland chunks, or write
your own.)  So, you don't like some aspects of what we've done,
replace those parts.

Feel free, if you know what the market wants.  I'm curious 
if you'll be running a node yourself?

	Actually, I'm unconvinced that even pipenet style padding is
sufficient.  Looking at the work on traffic analysis thats been done,
we're in about 1970.  We have one time pads (dc-nets), and some other
stuff, but we don't have a DES to analyze.  We have an adversary who
has spent a long time learning how to do this well.
