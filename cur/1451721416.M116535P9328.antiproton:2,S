American LEA have been heavily militarized, for sure. And they've
increasingly been trained to escalate confrontations and dominate.

Still, I find it hard to imagine how a middle-aged, upper-middle-class
white guy would have been beaten down like that. Unless he was out of
control, anyway.

But then, I have no recent experience with the San Francisco County
Sheriff's Department or SFPD. Maybe they're tired of fucking with rich
nerds. Maybe, if he were non-white, they would have just shot him.

Whatever happened, it's very sad.
