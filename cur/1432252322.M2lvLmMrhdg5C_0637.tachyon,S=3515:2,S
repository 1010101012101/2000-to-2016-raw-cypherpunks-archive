And I'll bet the Feds drop it because their corporate backer, Adobe, has 
abandoned them.

They don't like to be left twisting slowly in the wind. And the more 
Adobe now tries to "spin" their role, the more the Feds are left 
twisting.

The AG will likely say "Fuck that noise" (in his own Christian lingo) 
and the case will quietly go away.

BTW, I certainly have never argued the case would receive even 1% of the 
attention the Wen Ho Lee or Richard Jewel cases got. But it seems to be 
getting about the same level of attention that Intel's "processor ID" 
proposal got (modulo differences in the issues).

The more lasting effect is not what Joe and Alice Sixpack think of Adobe 
("Huh?"), but how it energizes parts of the hacker community. A bunch of 
hackers are now likely to expand the cracking of Adobe's ebooks by leaps 
and bounds. It'll be a badge of honor....
