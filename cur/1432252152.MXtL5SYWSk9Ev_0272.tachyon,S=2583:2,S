Greetings,

We are closing the cypherpunks@ssz.com address to non-subscriber submissions.
Actual subscriptions will remain open and unregulated. We have provided an
alternate email address for specific submissions where sender anonymity is to
be preserved,

cpunks-anon@ssz.com.

The list traffic will remain otherwise unmoderated and will mirror any
and all traffic on the CDR backbone.

These changes take place immediately.

There were two basic reasons for this:

1. My thesis that any community will fractionate into 'tribes' that will
   preserve their particular 'view' of 'reality' has been demonstrated.
   This provides yet another point to the contrary for the validity of
   Crypto-Anarcho-Capitalistic-Libertarian (CACL) societal claims. The
   various policies of processes of the current nodes stands on primary
   evidence to the 'tribalization' tendency of human psychology.

2. I no long see a positive reason to leave the submissions open without
   consideration. The load on my time and system simply no longer justify
   such effort in light of #1.

Don't worry, the SSZ CDR isn't going away...And we intend to continue to
kick CACL butt!
