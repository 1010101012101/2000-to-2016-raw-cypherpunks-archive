(Cyberpass is down.)

Jim testified for himself Friday afternoon,
presenting as good a narrative as Jeff's. He's
due to continue on Monday.

Both Jim and Jeff made little use of exhibits,
and an observer might think their testimony
was scripted by a single writer: both had
been well-rehearsed in acting style and voice
direction to perform a single story with two
Rashomons of the same events, both equally compelling
or unbelievable depending on what a viewer wanted
to see.

The main difference is that Jeff has the backing of
a bloated, self-serving justice system: the courthouse, 
the judge, the agents of several TLAs, guards, marshals, 
SEATAC, and much more maw needing cases -- Tacoma court
is a wasteland of little used overspending.

Jim has a roll of the dice with the jurors, all of
whom are  dressed and look more like Jim than the
mani-uniformed and dark-suited officials and rats.

Jim has no witnesses: Judge Jack denied all requests,
compared to a couple of dozen for the government.
Most of Jim's request for discovery have been denied,
while the gov gets all it asks for. At the end of
Friday Judge Jack denied Jim's request for access to 
his own discovery notes for use during his testimony.

Jim has so far demonstrated that he is several
grades of intelligence above that of his official
tormentors. And far less prejudicial.

So what if the show is scripted that way, that the
hero is doomed to be condemned by the king's police,
for crowd-pleasing anti-revolutionary politics.

And it's blood-quickening incendiary.

A local says the news media are staying away from the
trial in fear of subpoena -- for the trial, for the
grand jury cooking up iA victims.
