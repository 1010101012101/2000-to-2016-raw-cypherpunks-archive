This stuff is hardly new-  If you're going to engage in 
anti-governmental activity, even just speech, you're going to be a 
target of the investigatory police state.

On a routine basis I'm approached by what I consider either agents or 
agents provocateurs, both online and off, with an offer of some sort 
of illegal activity.  Usually they involve an offer of an illegal 
drug or an offer or a plea to help them convert a firearm to full 
auto. I politely inform them that those activities are illegal and I 
wouldn't be interested in them anyway (Which I'm not).

I've even outed a couple on occasion-  Once at a local civil rights 
meeting and another at a national machine gun shoot (Knob creek, KY).

Regards,  Matt-
