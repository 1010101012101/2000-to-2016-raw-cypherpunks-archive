SF Bay Area Cypherpunks March 2001 Physical Meeting Announcement

General Info:

DATE:   Saturday 8 March 2001
TIME:   12:00 - 5:30 PM (Pacific Time)
PLACE:  Alpine Inn (aka Alpine Beer Garden)
	3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley, CA 94028 USA

Agenda
    "Our agenda is a widely-held secret."
At Noon, we mill around for a bit: the organized program begins about 1:00 pm.
As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited.

TECHNICAL TRACK


      .xxx domains and a W-Washington update --  Declan McCullagh

      Declan will hold forth on his recent work opposing the creation of
      a .xxx top-level domain.  Also, he'll give an update on what 'W'
      seems to be up to in Washington, vis a vis export, network security,
      e-commerce, and anything else we can convince him to talk about.

      PKCS #11 application development: Project 'Minow' -- Rodney Thayer

      Rodney will talk about his recent adventures in the world of PKCS #11
      tokens.  He's been developing a set of tools to work with various
      kinds of key storage devices, including the iButton.

POLICY TRACK

      Open discussion on TLD's, new.net, etc.

CONFERENCE TRACK:

      Our brethern and sistern are off in snowy Boston freezing there
      encrypted key material off.  We'll have an update next time, hopefully.

NOTE NOTE NOTE:
      Next month's meeting will be the Saturday BEFORE the RSA Conference,
      the 7th, that's the FIRST Saturday of the month, following the
      canonical standard nonstandard algorithm change for RSA Conference
      month.

Location

    We meet at the tables out the back door and to the right.

    Food and beverages are available at the cafe inside Tresidder.

    For lo these many moons - the flotsam, jetsam, bikers, movers, shakers,
    VC's and horsemen of the Bay Area have mooted at this historic location.
    Many a standard (ISO, ANSI, IEEE, RFC, et al) has been hammered out there
    on the carved up tabletops - lubricated by burgers and beer.

    (In case that wasn't clear, it's a BEER GARDEN.  Has food too -- burgers,
    etc.)

    Just behind Palo Alto toward the ocean. Take the Alpine Road exit off 280
    heading away from the flatlands for a few miles until you see Arastradero
    Rd on your left - and it's right on that corner.
