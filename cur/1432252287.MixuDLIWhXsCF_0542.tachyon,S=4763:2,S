The problem with act utilitarianism is that in whatever form it takes 
it leaves itself much to open to the problems of personal view point. 
Hitler felt himself completely justified in murdering all the jews 
because he felt they were causing an enormous amount of pain to the 
rest of the population. He would have been justified under your 
framework IF it could be shown they were causing sufficient pain, 
although that would necessarily be enormous amount of pain.

This is a problem with any formulation of act utilitarianism.  Any 
formulation of act utilitarianism inherently falls victim to a set of 
extreme circumstances that result in outcomes which are clearly 
immoral (see the Hitler example above for a counter example).  That's 
why I'm not an act utilitarianist....
