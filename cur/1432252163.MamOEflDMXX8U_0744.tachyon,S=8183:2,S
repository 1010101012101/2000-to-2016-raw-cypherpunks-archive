		ECE GRADUATE SEMINAR

TITLE:      Have the Crypto Wars Been Won?

PRESENTER:        Dr. Susan Landau
             Sun Microsystems Laboratories


Place: Fuller Labs, Rm 320

Date and Time: Thursday, Nov. 9, 11 AM

ABSTRACT: Telecommunication has never been perfectly secure, as the
Cold War culture of wiretaps and international spying taught us.  Yet
many of us still take our privacy for granted, even as we become ever
more reliant on telephones and the Internet.  The security of these
transactions has become a source of wide public concern and debate.

Cryptography is a solution, but because cryptography can provide
perfectly concealable communications, over the last quarter century
the U.S. government has sought to prevent its proliferation. As a
result there have been numerous battles between academics and
industry on the one hand, and the U.S.  government on the other, over
the publication and deployment of strong cryptographic systems.  In
January of this year, in a major change, the U.S. government removed
a number of export restrictions on cryptography.

In this talk I will put current cryptography policy in the context of
decisions over the last twenty-five years, and I will discuss the
legal background behind the government controls, the purpose of the
export regulations, and the subtleties behind the remaining
restrictions.  I will examine: is the battle over, and have the
crypto wars been won?


BIOGRAPHY: Susan Landau is Senior Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems
Laboratories. Before joining Sun, she was a faculty member at the
University of Massachusetts and Wesleyan University, and held
visiting positions at Yale, Cornell, and the Mathematical Sciences
Research Institute at Berkeley.  She and Whitfield Diffie have
written ``Privacy on the Line: The Politics of Wiretapping and
Encryption,'' which won 1998 Donald McGannon Communication Policy
Research Award.  Landau is also primary author of the 1994
Association for Computing Machinery report ``Codes, Keys, and
Conflicts: Issues in US Crypto Policy.''
