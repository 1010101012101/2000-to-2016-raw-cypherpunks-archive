Dear Member,

Why have more than a million families already joined Upromise?

Answer: FREE MONEY FOR COLLEGE.

As education costs continue to rise, families need to save more for college 
than ever before. 

Now there's a revolutionary new way to save. It's called Upromise. 
When you join Upromise for free , America's leading companies such 
as Exxon, Mobil, Toys"R"Us, AT&T, McDonald's, General Motors, Border's 
Books & MusicR and many others will contribute a portion of what you 
spend with them into a college savings account for someone you love.
