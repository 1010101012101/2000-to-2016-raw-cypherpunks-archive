Moreover, it is found out that the Americans are shying away from the 
challenges of math and science. A recent National Science Foundation Study 
reveals a 5 per cent decline in the overall doctoral candidates in the US

The India side story: India produces 3.1 million college graduates a year, 
which is expected to be doubled by 2010. The number of engineering colleges 
is slated to grow 50 per cent, to nearly 1,600, over the next four years.
