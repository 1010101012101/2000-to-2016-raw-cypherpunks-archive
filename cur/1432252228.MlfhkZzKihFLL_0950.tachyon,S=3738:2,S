I tend to agree but I am not sure. At the moment I don't believe the Tor
project will die soon. It's fine with me if we can continue use it for
anonymous browsing, circumvention and so on for the next years.

It's also questionable if the Tor project should try to get a big share
of the people interested in anonymous p2p. I tend to think no, because
this opens up the project for a lot negative press. That increases the
risk for a new law to forbid the whole network in even more countries.
Let other networks try that out.

Loads of links here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_P2P

A very interesting idea is/was the owner free filesystem:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFFSystem

Depending on ones individual threat model, I believe i2p could be
sufficiently secure for file sharing purposes:
http://www.i2p2.de/

I didn't make an academic comparison, but it looks like retroshare is
quickly gaining more and more users:
