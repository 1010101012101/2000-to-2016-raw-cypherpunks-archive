There are two variants of Brands schemes: over RSA or DH.  The DH
variant can be used with the EC.  People don't do RSA over EC because
the security argument doesn't work (ie I believe you can do it
technically, but the performance / key size / security arguments no
longer work).

So for that reason I think Chaum's scheme practically would not be
viable over EC.  (Or you could do it but you'd be better off
performance, security and key/messag size doing Chaum over normal
RSA).

There are other blinding schemes also such as David Wagner's blind MAC
approach, and that should work over EC as it is DH based.
