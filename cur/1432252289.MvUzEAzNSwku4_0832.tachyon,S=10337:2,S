Hi,

It's always good to see that people are working on tools to protect=20
privacy and open the sourcecode. But i'm a bit disapointed by your=20
approach which is for me a "already seen" centralized encrypted chat.

I trully think that we need to do more than reinvent the wheel and=20
build several chat clients that are not compatible between them. We=20
just need to work on standard, decentralized protocols (like XMPP) ad=20
implemented them properly in nice clients.

By using a universal standard the users will be able to choose between=20
several solutions which are all compatibles. All theses clients are=20
implemented using several languages on several platforms too.

There's already a bunch of tools in XMPP to do that, we are just=20
waiting for nice clients :)

P.S.: I'm working on XMPP for a couple of years now

Regards,

Tim
