I am one of the authors of one of the papers there. As far as I know, only
preproceedings are available until now - the deadline to send the final
version to Matsui was at the end of May. It is no wonder it takes time to
publish the final proceedings. On the other hand, preproceedings were (I
think) printed in a small quantity and mostly for the conference
participants. You may still inquery Matsumoto Matsui about their
availability, but doubt in it. Moreover, preproceedings *really* contained
*prefinal* versions of the papers.

If you want to get final versions, contact the authors. It is also mostly
up to them to put their papers on their homepages - some authors do, some
don't: mind that not all of them have time or possibilities to maintain a
homepage.
