You should stop smoking lettuce. Just because you think something is not 
a crime does not not make it not a crime. And I don't think 'murdering 
people for fun' is the USMC charter. It might be your observation but 
also generally not true for actual marines. And actually not true in any 
sense. So. There's that.

My logic is not circular you need to look up the words in a dictionary 
as opposed to just attributing arbitrary definitions to 'm
We're not talking about games so it's probably definition 1 for illegal. 
A government is self-explanatory and might be construed as morally 
wrong. But to apply that to any government actually makes nos sense.

And the way you're talking you're probably are an anarchist. Which is 
also a form of government directed usually by direct democracy.

It might be legal, but it's definitely not moral. Which makes it criminal.

You're the inane one here. Juxtaposing random shit, yelling that all 
governments are criminal enterprises like it means something.


HUMANITY IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE BECAUSE IT'S AGENTS COMMIT CRIMES.

That obviously makes no sense because not all humans are agents that 
commit crimes.
Neither do all agents of governments commit crimes.
