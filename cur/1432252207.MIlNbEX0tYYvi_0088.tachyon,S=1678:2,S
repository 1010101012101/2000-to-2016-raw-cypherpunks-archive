Subject: Cisco Support for Lawful Intercept in IP Networks



What are service providers doing concerning lawful intercept support
in their networks?  Fred Baker, et al published an internet draft this
month (April 2003) containing a lawful intercept architecture.

Has anyone gotten a real set of requirements from the FBI for lawful
intercept in IP Networks?  Would Cisco's proposed architecture work, or
just result in buying more cisco equipment?
