Currently ISPs typically "notice" when they get complaints. ISPs could do a 
much better job of actively noticing and limiting mail at ingress ... as 
opposed to waiting for somebody to complain and canceling the account. Many 
of the recent statements about ISPs can't limit email at ingress 
dynamically are similar to the comments about not being able to filter 
ingress packets if their origin address didn't match the ip address of the 
sender (as stated in the original posting) ... per the ingress packet 
filtering RFC referenced in the original post.

My original post mentioned that the ISPs could then do their own effort of 
blacklisting (of other ISPs). Currently spam blacklists can be somewhat 
like vigilantes .... with the argument analogy that since vigilantly 
justice can make mistakes then there shouldn't be any highway patrol, FBI, 
and/or secret service. ISPs would be expected to filter on ingress of email 
from their own customers .... and even if the 10 top ISPs blacklisted other 
ISPs that didn't do a reasonable job of ingress filtering ... it could 
start to put a big dent in the spamming business, possibly cutting it from 
40-80% of existing email down under 5-10%. It is sort of like stop signs 
and stop lights .... there are typically hundreds of more intersections 
than there are traffic enforcers .... however with sufficient leverage ... 
it can significantly improve the situation ... even if it can be proved 
that it can't, absolutely, 100% guarantee one hundred percent compliance.

I didn't make any statement about ISPs attempting to identify spammers when 
they register the account .... the original post was only with regard to 
ISPs doing active email ingress filtering. My ISP recognizes and bills me 
extra if I'm simultaneously connected multiple times ... there is a little 
latitude for modem hanging, my dropping the line ... but the modem not 
reporting it ... and my connecting on a different modem. It also does 
traffic load-leveling if I really try and hit it hard. If it can bill extra 
for simultaneous connects and traffic load leveling, it can do both packet 
ingress filtering and email ingress filtering.

past thread drawing the analogy that the information superhighway is 
something like the wild west .... w/o traffic rules, traffic signs, traffic 
lights, speed limits, and enforcement. start with a couple hundred people 
in town .... and went to millions ... and there still isn't even any rule 
about which side of the road people should be driving on.
