      SHELBY ANNOUNCES SENATE APPROVAL
      FOR ALABAMA PROJECTS

         WASHINGTON, D. C. --- U. S. Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), a
      member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced today the
      approval of funding requests for several Alabama projects.  The Senate
      approved several Alabama-related projects at the request of Senator
      Shelby.

      Sen. Shelby said, "The money included in this legislation will go a
      long way towards assisting many communities in Alabama."

      The following project requests, were funded by the Senate:

      University of South Alabama, Center for Estuarine Research - $750,000
      "I am pleased to announce $750,000 in funding for the Center for
      Estuarine Research at the University of South Alabama.  The Center
      conducts important research on the ecology of coastal lands and
      seascapes in the Gulf Coast and Mobile Bay areas.  This funding will
      allow the University of South Alabama to continue the vital ecological
      research it is conducting in Alabama.  The knowledge gained from this
      research provides important scientific insights that can be used to
      preserve and protect coastal plants and wildlife,"  said Shelby.


      Renovation of the Historic Greene County Courthouse - $400,000
      Sen. Shelby said, "The historic Greene County Courthouse is an
      important part of Alabama's history.  I am pleased that this money
      will be used to restore the Courthouse to its' natural beauty.  This
      restoration effort is an important first step in the County's
      long-term plan for renovation of the old Courthouse Square."

      Hamilton, Alabama Call Center Facility - $500,000
      Sen. Shelby said, "The City of Hamilton is greatly in need of a Call
      Facility.  Our funds will allow the city to construct the facility
      that will result in nearly 600 jobs for the city and surrounding
      area."

      The American Village, Federal Hall/Liberty Square Expansion - $500,000
      Sen. Shelby said, "These funds will be used for the construction of
      Federal Hall and the expansion of Liberty Square in Montevallo.  The
      expansion will triple the capacity of students served by the facility
      to more than 150,000 per year.  The educational potential of these
      projects is significant."

      The Alabama Quail Trail - $100,000
      Sen. Shelby said, "The Alabama Quail Trail project will create a
      "Quail Trail" to attract hunters to rural Alabama hunting areas.  The
      untapped natural resources of these areas offer superb hunting areas
      for  visitors.  The boost that will be provided to local economies by
      visiting hunters is not insignificant.  Once fully implemented, the
      Alabama Quail Trail will generate considerable economic growth in
      rural Alabama."

      Cleveland Avenue YMCA, Montgomery, Alabama - $500,000
      Sen. Shelby said, "We have included $500,000 for the Cleveland Avenue
      YMCA in Montgomery to expand their existing programs.  This facility
      is a cornerstone of the community and serves an underprivileged youth
      population in Montgomery.  The expansion of these programs will allow
      the YMCA to serve a greater number of young people in the area."
