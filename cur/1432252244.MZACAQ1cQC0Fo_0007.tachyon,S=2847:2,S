Anti-abortion postings ordered removed

Fri Nov 9, 7:33 AM ET

PHILADELPHIA - A federal judge ordered an anti-abortion activist to remove
Web site postings that authorities said exhorted readers to kill an
abortion provider by shooting her in the head.

District Court Judge Thomas Golden granted an injunction Thursday seeking
the removal of postings on Web pages maintained by John Dunkle. The
injunction, sought by prosecutors in August, also bans him from publishing
similar messages containing names, addresses or photographs of health
clinic staff members.

Prosecutors said one posting targeted a former clinician for the
Philadelphia Women's Center, and that she later stopped providing
reproductive health services because she feared for her life.

Dunkle, of Reading, said Thursday that the postings had been removed.

"They're down now," said Dunkle, who represented himself. "I won't put up
language that (the judge) has told me not to put up."

Authorities said the postings violate the federal Freedom of Access to
Clinic Entrances Act.

One posting, which featured the provider's name, photo and address, stated
that "while it does not sound good to say go shoot her between the eyes, it
sounds even worse to say let her alone."

Dunkle has said he did not write the message on the blog, but that he did
post it.
