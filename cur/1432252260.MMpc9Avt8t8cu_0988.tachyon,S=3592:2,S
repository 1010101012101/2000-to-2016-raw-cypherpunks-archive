The infallible archives show that the top users here of "fuck off" 
are ... well, not to provoke additional applications of the highly
acceptable use term, check the archives yourself. Reese is no 
where near the top user, except at sea.

This is not to suggest that heavy users of the term have not
be killfiled, repeatedly, to no effect, as befits this foul-mouthed
wonderland where killfiles are a joke of venerable shallowness.

This is not to say that shallowness is not perfectly acceptable
usage here. Otherwise there'd be nothing. Sure, that's what
may be the best acceptable use but for christsakes this is
the cornucopic of plenitude, negritude and FO attitude.
