The authors of Freegate believe that for technological reasons, 
the internet will win, and the chinese government will lose. 
They are chinese.  They are familiar with repression, and 
familiar with technology.   They are the kind of people who 
know what they are talking about.  They had had fifteen million 
downloads of their software, which is continually rewritten to
meet the latest threats and tactics from the chinese
government.
