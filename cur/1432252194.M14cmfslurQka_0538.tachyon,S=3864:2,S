They're also responsible to the same law and license that every other
diamond trader in NY is responsible to. This isn't a 'market' in the
economic sense, it's an extension of their religion (clearly a
non-economic aspect to their culture).

Which again isn't really a 'market' per se since there isn't a statistical
issue here. ALL Jews, as opposed to some percentage of same, technicaly
require their food to be kosher.

They are particular mechanisms for the protection of their culture not an 
'economic market' (though both have economic aspects). They don't do it to
protect their income. They do it because they believe it's the 'right'
thing to do, they are answering to a higher calling.
