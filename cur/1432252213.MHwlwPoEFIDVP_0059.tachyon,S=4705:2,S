Erastothenes, I think. 
I don't know what a sieve of eros is. I think I'd like to try one
sometime. :>

Right - I think you may find that this slows down a bit at the 500-bit
range. Still, there are supposed to be ways to use sieving in conjunction
with random search to speed up prime generation.

Once  you have the primitives, Rabin-Miller is straightforward to
implement from the Handbook of Applied Cryptograpy. I was surprised at how
easy it was...

Another nice trick -- compute the product of the first 1000 primes or so.
Take the GCD of this product and a candidate number. Eliminates candidates
with small prime factors and often faster than trial division.

Backdoors are your responsibility with GMP, so no worries, right. :). It
is GPL'd, though, so be careful.

Looking forward to it.
