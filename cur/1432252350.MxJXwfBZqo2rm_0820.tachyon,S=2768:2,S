They can be useful.  Sarin, being volitile (gone in half an hour) mostly
causes injury via inhalation.  VX, being nonvolitile (2 weeks), causes
injury mostly by contact.  

The Israelis *also* sealed a room, and would sit in
that room with masks on.  Since buildings exchange gasses slowly with
the outside, they could survive a cloud that dissipates.  

YMMV.
