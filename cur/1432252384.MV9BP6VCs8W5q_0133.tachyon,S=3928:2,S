Your talking out of your ass. I can't speak for Finland, but around 20% of
the Swedish population is first or second generation immigrant - with
Africa, the Balkans, and Turkey making up a large part of that percentage.
Come to Stockholm yourself if you don't believe me.

Come look. 

Personally I believe that broders should be completely open, but Sweden
cannot be attacked from an international perspective for it's immigration
policies during the last 30 years, and unlike in most other countries
there is not a single xenophobic or even mildly anti-immigration party
with seats in the Swedish parlament.

Socialism is bullshit, and so is the Swedish regime, and so was the
comment you replied to - but you'll have to pick your arguments better
than that.

'DeCSS would be fine. Where is it?'
'Here,' Montag touched his head.
