Not in any 1U system that I know of unless you mean multiple racks.
The biggest ATA drives I see on the market today are 200GB.  Most 1U
systems won't hold more than two of these.  That's nowhere near 1TB!

Also you're forgetting about doing backups; and I don't know about you,
but I get a fuckload more email than 1K/day.  Granted, averaged out over
the entire population of the earth - what over 99% of don't even have
email, it may well be 1k/day/person.

Further, you'd want more than one GigE port on these machines just so as
to deal with the traffic.

And you'll need lots of cage monkeys to run around replacing failed disks.
Do the math if the MTBF of one disk is 10,000 hours, what is the MTBF of
say 2 spindles (disks) per machines multiplied by 10000 machines? One
failure every 5 hours?   Hell, that's even assuming MTBF is that high!

Have you see: http://www17.tomshardware.com/column/200210141/index.html ?

You're probably also discounting the sheer amount of bandwidth required to
copy all that data, route it to each of those thousands of 1U nodes, and
then analyze it near real time and provide the ability to search through
the results.  Oh, You'd need several such centers since the worlds data
flows aren't centralized.


I wonder what the specs are for those nice Echelon centers already in
existence....  Likely they're very different from what you propose.
