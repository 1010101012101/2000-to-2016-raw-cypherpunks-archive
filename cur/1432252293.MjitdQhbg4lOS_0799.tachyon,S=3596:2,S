Hi Normesco;

If you had ever lived in an armed society, you 
would understand why this isn't the case. 

I've lived where pretty much everyone 
was armed pretty much all of the time. I can
promise you that this bad, childish behavior
simply doesn't occur. Even when folks get
very cranked up at one another, the arguments,
while heated tend to stay somewhat civil.

These reasons you cite for not allowing folks
to be armed go away very quickly when the 
sheepish victim mentality that is inherit
in the powerless is removed. 

When folks are held accountable for their
behavior, they behave better.
