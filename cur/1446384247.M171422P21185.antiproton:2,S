<br>
</span>I selected Murphy because you mentioned Friedman&#39;s hard problem =
of<br>
privatizing defense without the presence of state actors. Your<br>
solution is crowdfunding assassinations of anybody who is unpopular.<br>
This does fit within the paradigm of Friedman&#39;s approach.<br>
<br>
I would argue that Murphy&#39;s approach of collectives banding together<br=
>
and entering into private arbitration agreements with private defense<br>
contractors is more reasonable in preserving liberty and security. By<br>
entering into said private arbitration agreement with a private<br>
defense force, you also have aspects of private jurisprudence. The<br>
arbitration clause can have stipulations for certain scenarios and how<br>
they are dealt with (e.g., trials, fines, etc).<br>
<br>
Democracy is the tyranny of the majority, and assassination politics<br>
is dangerous in that regard when they are coupled. Private arbitration<br>
agreements with private security forces wherein mobility has<br>
reciprocal agreements (similar to current travel) seems more reasonable.<br=
>
<br>
I would suggest you consider the countereconomics work of SEK (e.g.<br>
agorism) and Vaclav Benda. Benda is an interesting case because he did<br>
his work on parallel structures while under the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
The conclusion was that -- in the presence of an oppressive state -- a<br>
robust solution was an overlay of private and hidden societies as<br>
opposed to direct overt warfare with the state.<br>

&gt; My replies inline: Simply put, I don&#39;t think Vroman or Bell realiz=
e<br>
&gt; just how nutty and horrible the AP idea seems to the average<br>
&gt; American. I should point out why I view Murphy&#39;s comment as being<=

&gt; wacky, in itself.=C2=A0 The &quot;average American&quot; is fairly fam=

&gt; the deficiencies of the world&#39;s status quo.<br>
<br>
</span>I think your assumptions regarding the average American are wrong, b=

that is my opinion. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of memetic warfare,<b=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow &quo=
t;okay&quot;?<br>
I very much doubt he&#39;d say that was acceptable, and he probably<br>
couldn&#39;t argue much with the numbers themselves.=C2=A0 But suppose thos=
e<br>
&quot;average Americans&quot; were FIRST fully informed of this fact, even<=
br>
simply as an estimate.=C2=A0 THEN, suppose it was explained to him HOW a<br=
>
functioning AP system wouldn&#39;t allow that to happen, if necessary by<br=
>
killing whatever number of government employees were necessary to stop<br>
this, the &quot;Democide&quot;.=C2=A0 =C2=A0If those &quot;average American=
s&quot; were reminded<br>
that the death of a government employee is no more unfortunate than<br>
the death of ordinary citizens, then wouldn&#39;t it be reasonable to<br>
conclude that to save 250 million ordinary citizens, it would<br>
certainly be acceptable to kill 25 million government employees, and<br>
certainly 2.5 million government employees?<br>
&gt; The &quot;average American&quot; has been aware, during and since the =
1960&#39;s,<br>
&gt; that the citizens of many major governments have been under a<br>
&gt; nuclear terror.=C2=A0 Now, it seems, we simply accept it as it is a<br=
>
&gt; reality.=C2=A0 As shocking as that may see, perhaps it&#39;s made more=
<br>
&gt; understandable by the fact that there has not seemed to be anything<br=
>
&gt; we can do about it. Suppose, then, these &quot;average Americans&quot;=
 were<br>
&gt; told that a functioning AP system would make any nation&#39;s holding<=
br>
&gt; of nuclear weapons absolutely impossible:=C2=A0 They are in the contro=
l<br>
&gt; of SOMEONE, or maybe hundreds and thousands of someones, and such<br>
&gt; people can be targeted by AP until those weapons are finally shut<br>
&gt; down, and dismantled, and permanently rendered safe.=C2=A0 As many<br>
&gt; government employees could be killed until that occurs.=C2=A0 No limit=
<br>
&gt; whatsoever. So, where does Bob Murphy get off saying that the<br>
&gt; &quot;Average American&quot; would find AP &quot;nutty and horrible&qu=
ot;?=C2=A0 I say, to<br>
&gt; the contrary, that a _well-informed_ &quot;average American&quot;, inf=
ormed<br>
&gt; of what I say AP could accomplish, would find Murphy himself and<br>
&gt; his arguments &quot;nutty and horrible&quot;.=C2=A0 Why should the cit=
izens of the<br>
&gt; world tolerate the killing of 250 million more people by<br>
&gt; governments, beyond the 20th Century&#39;s toll?=C2=A0 Why should the<=
br>
&gt; citizens of the world tolerate continuing to be held as nuclear<br>
&gt; hostages, targets of 2000 nuclear bombs, just to keep a few<br>
&gt; governments in power?=C2=A0 Clearly, Murphy views the world&#39;s citi=
zens&#39;<br>
&gt; &quot;natural state&quot; to being owned and held hostage by governmen=
ts, and<br>
&gt; certainly not the opposite!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &quot; Especially if the government institutes a standing penalty of,<=
br>
&gt; say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP donation, I<br>
&gt; don&#39;t think we will have the millions of small donations that AP<b=
r>
&gt; requires. The situation would be a prisoner&#39;s dilemma: No<br>
&gt; individual donation of $10 or even $100 is going to make the<br>
&gt; difference between a target being killed or not, and so there would<br=
>
&gt; be no reason for the average person to use AP. The fact that the<br>
&gt; donations could be made &quot;safely&quot; is not enough; the governme=
nt<br>
&gt; would surely institute eavesdropping measures and would punish<br>
&gt; anyone who even visited AP sites.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Murphy, here, is beginning to show his &#39;inner paranoid&#39;.=C2=A0=
 &quot;They<br>
&gt; would never let us do it!!!&quot;Which, is one reasons we MUST do it.<=
br>
&gt; I would say, to the contrary of what he said, that if &quot;they&quot;=
, the<br>
&gt; governments, don&#39;t want us to do something SO MUCH, then that&#39;=
s all<br>
&gt; the more reason we should disregard those governments&#39; official<br=
