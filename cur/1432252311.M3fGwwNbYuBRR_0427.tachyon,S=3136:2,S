Classified Dutch military documents found on Kazaa
By Jan Libbenga (libbenga at yahoo.com)
Published Sunday 30th January 2005 22:16 GMT

At least 75 pages of highly classified information about human traffickers
from the Dutch Royal Marechaussee - a service of the Dutch armed forces
that is responsible for guarding the Dutch borders - have been leaked to
the controversial weblog Geen Stijl (No Style).

The documents, whicn contain phone numbers and tapped conversations, were
found unencrypted on Kzaa, the public file sharing service. The likeliest
explanation for their appearance is that a member Dutch Royal Marechaussee
worked on the documents from home and unintentionally shared his entire
hard drive with the rest of the world, through Kazaa.

Initially, Geen Stijl (http://www.geenstijl.nl) wanted to reveal juicy
details from the leaked documents, but backed off in the face of legal
threats by the Public Prosecutor. The weblog says it will co-operate fully
with investigators.

The disclosure of the classified documents is yet another security lapse
for the Dutch public prosecutor's office. In October last year, a leading
Dutch prosecutor resigned after he throwing out his old PC with the
rubbish. The hard disk contained hundreds of pages of confidential
information about high profile crime cases, as well as his credit card
number, social security number and personal tax files.
