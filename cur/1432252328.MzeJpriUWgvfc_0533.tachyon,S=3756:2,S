Actually they were. I can direct you to the plethora of 1st person
accounts during D-Day in Normandy for example. You will occassionaly run
across a reference of a recruit having gotten through boot and across the
big pond to only be turned back by an officer in combat. If a kid was found 
out, and the officers in their CoC gave a shit (some did, some didn't) 
they were returned home. It's a sad state that since the Civil War in this
country a considerable number of young kids have died in combat before
they were eligable for the draft.
