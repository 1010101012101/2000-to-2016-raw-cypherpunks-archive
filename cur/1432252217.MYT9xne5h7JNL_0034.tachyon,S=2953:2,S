   Interesting event, eh? Pretty well timed. They're already saying it wasn't a
missle, which may be. Could have been a bomb tho -- pretty weird that it's the
first problem they've ever had with a landing, and just happens to have the
Israeli onboard. Over Texas too. If it weren't terrs, then it must be Allah
warning the Great Satan to watch his step.
   Interesting too that Saddam's eldest son just warned that 9/11 would be a
picnic compared to what will happen if the US invades. And then there's those
3,000 Iraqis the feebs said they were looking for....
