I think the point is that the source frames were moving.  REquiring 
serious correlation to stack the right frames.  Quite different from
an earth-motion-compensated tracking telescope stacking frames.

If you are filming a nonmoving object you can get very large S/N by
accumulating frames.  If the object is moving its much harder --esp
if moving in 3D.  I once did some research programming for MD/researchers who
film Xray movies of clogged hearts (cineangiography at Cedar Sinai '90-93), 
who found better recognition of problems if you fixate the feature of
interest.  
Doing so automatically is nontrivial.
Similarly with the work described, e.g., Yo-yo cranking on the fiddle.





But your Toaster experience is correct.
