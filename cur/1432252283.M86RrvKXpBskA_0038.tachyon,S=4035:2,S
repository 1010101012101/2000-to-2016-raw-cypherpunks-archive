There was one guy from Japan who kept trying to create discussion,
in relatively-clueless mode, but he wasn't a cryptographer,
so he couldn't give us good reasons to use it other than it being 
from Japan,  and there are patent problems with the algorithm
(I think he may have been connected to the company that owns it),
and some of its relatives were broken (or maybe it; I don't remember).
Tim flamed him a lot.
