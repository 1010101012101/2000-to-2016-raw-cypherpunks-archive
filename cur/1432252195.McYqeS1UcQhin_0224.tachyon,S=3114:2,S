Eric Rescorla's new book, "SSL and TLS: Designing and Building Secure
Systems" includes two chapters which may be apropos - one which discusses
securing SMTP with SSL (including the limitations of that approach), and
one which discusses alternative means to reach a similar end, e.g., IPsec
or object encryption (where encrypted messages are sent over insecure
pipes).

It's also generally a very helpful book, and includes a much more
detailed discussion of the ephemeral DH modes than does the other
contender, "SSL and TLS Essentials: Securing the Web" (also useful)
by Stephen Thomas.
