Fujitsu Transaction Solutions Inc. will unveil a new handheld computer next
week designed for retailers. The Fujitsu iPAD, a compact, Microsoft Windows
CE .NET-based mobile device, available in mid-2002, will combine a scanner,
magnetic- and smart-card reader, keypad with encryption capabilities, and
phone capability. The devices are intended to give retailers a complete,
wireless retail appliance. iPAD can be used for inventory management, debit
transactions, price verifications, phone calls, line busting, mobile POS
and gift registry. The product uses an Intel processor and can support any
802.11b wireless LAN infrastructure. With 'Windows CE .NET', iPAD will
support both XML and VoIP.

802.11b capable as well as a magstripe reader?  Perfect retail device for
skimmers don't you think?

(PS If you do forward this, zap my name OK?)
