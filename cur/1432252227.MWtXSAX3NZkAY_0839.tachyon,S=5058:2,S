For physical books, there's always physical cash. (Pace the "Uncle 
Fester's" book bought in the Denver bookstore, that the Feds want the 
bookstore to reveal the buyer of.)

For online purchases, this trend of Feds snooping on reading habits 
could be a business opportunity for an anonymized online buying system. 
How could physical delivery be arranged?

First, purchase with some form of untraceable credit card.

Second, delivery to a local bookstore or even a Mailboxes, Etc., with 
pickup by matching the ID. For a small commission.

(This should not be in violation of any laws. This is not a mail cover, 
nor a money changing, etc. operation. Just a package delivery service.)

One can imagine t.v. cameras set up, but unlikely if there are thousands 
of such delivery sites.

Organizations like the ACLU, EFF, etc. could even set up such 
book-ordering services, perhaps via liberty-sympathetic lawyers in 
various cities and towns, to make the PR point that such services are 
the only way around government snooping on the citizen-units.


(Of course, any normal bookstore is free to order a book and then take 
cash for it. I've ordered books without ever leaving my name or number 
and then paying in cash. This works better for conventional books than 
it does for controversial books on bomb-making, pot-growing, or sex.)
