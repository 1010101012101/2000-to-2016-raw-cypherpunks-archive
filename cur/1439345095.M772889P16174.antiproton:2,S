its a strange strange complex i will never understand ... its as if they
got the fight beat out of them and they just want silence out of all the
trauma they have endured - this is the solution they find
admirable\desirable ... then ask for officials to be held `
'accountable '

please beauties point me in the direction of the 'accountability office' on
fatherfucking another fucking universe vortex vacuum some weird thing in
the center of a black whole that births new stars or some crap proving once
again there is no nothing

for fuck sake peoplish movements
