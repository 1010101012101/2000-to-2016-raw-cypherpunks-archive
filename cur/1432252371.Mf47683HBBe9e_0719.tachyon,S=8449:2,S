My information is different, though I've not used Outlook in some years.
I know several people who do, one of whom also uses PGP, RFC 2015 MIME
encoded:

    http://rmarq.pair.com/pgp/mail-clients-pgp.html
    http://www.spinnaker.de/mutt/rfc2015.html

    ...including MS Outlook Express (plugin) and MS Outlook (plugin),

Public key infrastructure.

I was spooning from the top of my head.  It's more generally known as
the RSA public key encryption patent, released by RSA September 6, 2000:

    http://www.rsasecurity.com/news/pr/000906-1.html

I don't have the patent number handy but could reference it for you if
necessary.

There were doubtless other issues.  The patent didn't help.

I"m willing to risk that.  Responses have varied, most people appreciate
the information (they simply don't know the inssues).  Maybe one in ten
responds as you suggest.  I try to provide compelling content, where
possible.

About two years.

You've got arguments against signing?  Again, pointers appreciated.

So you're going to disable all MIME handling in your mailer?

That's an astounding proof.

To expand on the the analogy:  widespread deployment of mail clients
with unsafe content handling (and yes, I'm specifically pointing to MS
Outlook, though there are other guilty parties), combined with an
operating environment with few or no effective security measures, low
user awareness of security details, and lax administrative practices,
creates a volatile, low-entropy, high-potential, readily triggered,
exploitable resource.  Rather like gasoline.

The problem isn't the attachments (matches), it's the gasoline (buggy
mailers).

I think it's rather apt, myself.

Compelling or otherwise, I'll draw your attention to the paragraphs
immediately following "Why Do You Insist On Signing Your Mail Anyway".

Summarizing:

  - Assurance of identity.
  - Assurance of integrity.
  - Evangelizing PKI.
  - Seeking broader compliance with associated RFCs in mail clients and
    handlers.

I'm not set up to run same, but I'm interested in finding one that
doesn't demime.

Peace.
