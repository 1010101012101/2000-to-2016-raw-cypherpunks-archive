The key is to steganographically encode "random" (encrypted) data and then
"shape" the result to match the mean probabilities seen in observation of a
system in usual operation. This defeats statistical analysis, since your
data is shaped just like everyone else's. If the bits are encrypted with a
recipient's public key, only with posession of the private key can the data
be perceived to be non-random, which is a nicely strong property.
