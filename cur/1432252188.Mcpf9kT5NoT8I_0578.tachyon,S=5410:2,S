For more info on the mentioned Freedom Tower, see
http://freenetworkfoundation.org/?p=403
even more technical: http://thefnf.org:9001/ro/r.lug5aGlhVVAlXMIm

Basically, it is like a wireless Access Point for mesh network routers,
such as the FreedomBox, that serves as a gateway to the Internet.

Transparency info: I am a research fellow of the FNF.

Hello All,
Isaac here. Just wanted to give you a brief update on the activity of
the Foundation in recent days, and fill you in on the plans for tomorrow.

-*- Update -*-
In the last two weeks, we have built and shipped two FreedomTowers -
one for Occupy Austin, and one for the FNF itself. The FNF Tower is
currently deployed in Liberty Park. We also have installed the initial
FreedomLink in Kansas City, and built an almost hot-swappable backup
facility in Austin. Four more towers are currently in production - LA,
Miami, Chicago, and New York. All are funded by General Assemblies of
the Occupation. Many more assemblies are working towards the goal of
funding towers. We are comitted to making sure that assemblies across
the world can communicate and coordinate with one another via secure,
encrypted channels. We have put together three tower operations squads
- what we call West, Central, and East. West is based in LA, Central
is in Austin, and East is in New York. These teams will build and ship
towers, along with serving as first-level support for towers in
operation. The FNF core will serve as second-level support.


-*- Tomorrow -*-
Tomorrow is the Contact Conference. This foundation was born of a
mailing list surrounding the Contact event. Tomorrow has been a key
date for as long as the FNF has been around. We will be participating
in the Bazaar, and competing for one of three $10,000 Contact Prizes.
It has long been our aspiration to bootstrap this foundation into a
realer operational mode using the money and recognition that would
come with a win at Contact. I will be on the floor with the FNF Tower,
talking my head off. I'm feeling the heat, but also feeling ready,
sanguine, calm.

I guess this is just to say: wish me luck tomorrow. It's a big day.



shoot me an email if you'd like to join one of the tower ops teams,
or contribute in some other way,
or just say 'hey'.


take care,
imw
