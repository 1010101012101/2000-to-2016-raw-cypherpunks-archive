I have a question: given that half the bandwidth and almost all 
of the spike bandwidth is devoted to smurfing, why don't IRC 
servers just block multicast ping? I mean, okay, so it's in the 
kernel code instead of being a separate application.  It still 
shouldn't be hard to come up with a patch that killed smurfing.

Pings should never be forwarded to multiple hosts.
