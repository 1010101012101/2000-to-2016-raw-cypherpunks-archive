I don't have data either. I'm guessing the "bad" traffic part is 95-98%.
(I'm extrapolating from absence, as the only responses to the abuse address

While there is a distinct trend in NA, EU and elsewhere to try to snoop, and
to control, it's not obvious the development is permanent, and irreversible.
P2P traffic in general is increasing, and trivial remixing and encryption is

increases the noise level. You could claim your machine was infected with
mixmaster malware, or something.
