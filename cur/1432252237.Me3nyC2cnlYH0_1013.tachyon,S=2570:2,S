Yes, GPS tracking was allegedly done to Jim, and its illegality 
is one of the points of his appeal. He claims that the legal basis 
for installing the device and data-spotting his movements were 
flawed. And that there were problems as well with interpretation 
of the data. Jim tried to argue this during his trial but neither his
defense attorney or the judge would allow the argument,
so sacred is the blind belief that the official use of the 
tracking technology is so content neutral, so credible, as 
if fingerprints, lie detector, DNA, or criminal crypto.

The agents who installed the criminal tracking device
and interpreted (doctored) the data, were in the courtroom
and smiled broadly at Jim's futile challenge of conventional
wisdom.

It is possible that there was no device and the whole rig
was made up in the narc lab, using physical tailing as
the source of info needed to confect digital, ie, neutral, evidence.
This follows, naturally, the fact that agents' testimony is
not believed by anyone any more, so often do they lie.

Lying technology has not yet had its truth told, or at not
yet believed that it is no better than official lying. George 
Maschke has made some headway against the polygraph 
(www.polygraph.org) and fingerprints are not as convincing 
as they once were, fakes being easy to make, although 
DNA is a runaway train, and biometrics are believed to be 
FUD-free. Hoot, hoot.
