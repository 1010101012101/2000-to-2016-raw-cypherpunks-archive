Right.

Wrong. I can do this - I can write IOUs "redeemable" in other IOUs or,
"sometimes", in gold or silver.

The reason the IOUs emitted by the Bank of England were *initially* accepted
was that they were redeemable in gold or silver. *One* reason they are now
accepted is that they are legal tender - you can pay your taxes with them,
and companies are forbidden from accepting them as payment.
