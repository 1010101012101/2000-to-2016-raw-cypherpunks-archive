If they check them, and they pass, how often do they check keys?

Subject: Microsoft Press Release On Digital Signatures
Date:    September 6, 2001

Microsoft announced today that all future press releases will
be signed with PGP digital signatures so that readers can verify
that they're reading genuine Microsoft press releases,
not forgeries from hackers trying to manipulate the stock price.
Microsoft's corporate PGP key 0xB9C8B513 is on the Network Associates 
keyservers, and you can verify the signatures there.

Microsoft's public relations department also announced that
plans for World Domination 2.0 are ahead of schedule,
and declined to comment on Bill Gates's muttered reference to the
antitrust prosecutors as a major-league %^%*&@.
