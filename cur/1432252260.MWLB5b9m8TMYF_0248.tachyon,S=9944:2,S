Govt planning I-cards for all citizens

TIMES NEWS NETWORK [ THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 2002 8:31:03 PM ]
NEW DELHI: Identity cards for all citizens, a Rs 15,000-crore National Rail 
Vikas Yojana and a national commodities exchange were among the 15 key 
initiatives announced by the government on Thursday. The home ministry will 
prepare a plan to issue multi-purpose machine-readable identity cards to 
all citizens. A pilot project, which will be launched in October to cover 
select districts in eight states, will also facilitate the implementation 
of e-governance initiatives to be completed within a year.The Rail Vikas 
Yojana will over the next five years aim to remove all capacity bottlenecks 
in critical sections of the Railways, including a Rs 8,000-crore project to 
strengthen the Golden Quadrilateral to run more long-distance mail, express 
and freight trains at a higher speed, and a Rs 3,000-crore project to 
strengthen rail connectivity to ports and development of corridors to the 
hinterland.Rs 3,500 crore will be spent on constructing two bridges over 
the Ganga and one each over the Brahmaputra and the Kosi. The consumer 
affairs, food and public distribution ministry will set up a National 
Commodities Exchange to streamline commodity futures trading. All villages 
will be electrified by 2007 and 130 lakh new telephone lines, including 75 
lakh mobile telephones, will be added in the coming year. A comprehensive 
social security scheme for the poor and the middle class and a food-based 
social security for the destitute will be launched. The communication and 
IT ministry will implement a programme to improve efficiency, transparency 
and accountability at the government-citizen interface, with the e-bill 
post and internet-based e-post service network to cover all districts in 
the coming year. Media Lab Asia, a collaboration between the IT department 
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, will be set up to 
address the digital divide in the country. The government also announced 
formulating a model municipal law to facilitate private sector 
participation in urban infrastructure projects, especially in water supply 
and sanitation. Simultaneously, a fund will be operationalised this year to 
promote urban sector reforms with special focus on making urban local 
bodies viable. National scholarships will be given to disabled persons to 
pursue higher technical education. The culture ministry will launch the 
National Mission for Manuscripts to preserve and unlock the scientific, 
intellectual, literary and spiritual knowledge in different Indian 
languages. The ministry of petroleum and other ministries concerned will 
take steps to universalise blending of ethanol from various feedstocks, 
including sugar factories, with petrol and diesel. Sale of gasohol will 
become mandatory in nine states and four Union territories from January 1, 
2003.
