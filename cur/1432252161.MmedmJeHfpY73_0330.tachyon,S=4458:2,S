THE grisly details of Australia's worst serial killing began to unfold
yesterday as a court was told how eight mutilated bodies were discovered
dumped in barrels inside the vault of a disused bank in a tiny Outback
township.

<snip>

John Bunting, Mark Haydon and Robert Wagner are accused of murdering 10
people between December 1995 and May 1999. James Vlassakis is accused of
five murders. All four refused to enter a plea.

The killings were allegedly carried out as part of a macabre social
security fraud. Most of the eight men and two women killed had close
associations - including, in some cases, family ties - with those accused
of their murder. Elizabeth Haydon, was a mother of eight married to one of
the accused.

Wendy Abraham QC, opening the prosecution case, said the four had collected
the welfare benefits and disability allowances of their dead victims. They
even impersonated some of those they had killed to conduct banking
transactions or to deal with the social security office. Before being
murdered, some of the victims were made to repeat scripted phrases, which
were taped and left on the answering machines of their relatives and
friends to divert suspicion from their disappearance, she said.
