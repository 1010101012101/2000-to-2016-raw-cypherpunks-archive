Of course government agents can and probably will use remailers.
Heck, they can pose as journalists, priests, etc. complete with fake
ID and cover stories and commit felonies. Using mixmaster is nothing
by comparison. The government has created the Onion Routing project
expressly to protect the identity of government workers, including
agents.

Aimee was having fun with you, and I can't exactly blame her.
