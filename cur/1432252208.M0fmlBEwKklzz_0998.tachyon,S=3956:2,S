What's needed are high-altitude communication platforms powered, from the 
ground, by users in exchange for bandwidth.  Since the 2.4Ghz band was 
originally intended for non-communication purposes (that's why its called 
ISM - Industrial Scientific Medical) why can't (within OSHA limits) small, 
inexpensive, ground stations be built (physically similar to those used for 
the DishNetwork) which both help power the plane and offer a communication 
link?  Beam spread due to the small antennas might be combatted by 
controlling each antenna's phasing to create "virtual" antennas, like the 
new SETI project envisions, for efficient energy delivery.
