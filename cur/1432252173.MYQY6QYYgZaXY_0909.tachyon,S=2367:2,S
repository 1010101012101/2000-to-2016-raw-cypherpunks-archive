IR systems capable of locating warm objects within structures have been 
available for a long time.  They are routinely used for search and rescue 
in collapsed building.  Resolution is low. they could not be used to see 
anything much beyond a warm blob through rubble.

There are purported to be devices using ultra wideband RF and microwave 
frequencies and millimeter wave active or passive devices to do 
this.  Resolution of the microwave devices should be even lower than the IR 
and perhaps suitable only for determining occupant location, for example 
prior to breaking down the door during a SWAT raid. Millimeter waves are 
emitted by warm bodies, such as own own, and can be used to passively see 
thorough clothing.  Not sure if passive devices would work through walls 
due to attenuation, but active devices probably could.
