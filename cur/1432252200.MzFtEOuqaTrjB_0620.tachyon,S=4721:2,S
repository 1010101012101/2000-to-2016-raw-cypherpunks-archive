You're orders of magnitude away from such fluxes. You're trying to hit a
moving, rapidly accelerating (possibly flying random evasion maneuvres)
high-albedo vehicle -- through the Mach cone, through the 100 km of
atmosphere filled with clouds, haze, random fluctuations, etc.

Once it's past boost phase, it's essentially invulnerable. Chemical lasers
have a limited numbers of shots, every energy leaving the vehicle must
pass through it's optics aperture (which must be damn transparent). The
vehicle is very complicated and delicate, and expensive. Given that you
have to make many kills during few 100 s window, it doesn't appear
cost-effective.

If it's in LEO, I just launch a bucket of tungsten or depleted uranium
birdshot in countersense orbit. Given a few iterations, I can keep
surprising amounts of orbital space clean of any operable machinery.

If you ablate a bit of hull sufficient to change course, you've killed the
vehicle, whether solid boosters, or cryogenic fuel tanks.

We're not talking about a fuel pellet in the focus of a NOVA laser.
