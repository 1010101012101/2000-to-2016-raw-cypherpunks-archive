I sent in the order form with a money order to start working at home for the 
$3.00 per envelope stuffing.  I have not recieved anything yet, and its been 
a few weeks.  I'm am assuming that this whole thing is a fraud which I was 
ready for, but that sucks.  Can you help me out?  I sent it to the Better 
Solutions address on this website.  I'm not sure if you are the person I need 
to write to, but your e-mail address is on here, so I am going to write you.  
Please get back to me.  Thank you.
                                Leslie.
