But the anti-child pornography laws proceed on the assumption that
even non-commercial possession of computer generated images must be
banned because inducing the stimulation or wanking is a legitimate
societal interest to be regulated.

It's classic thought crime control. Sure everyone can wank and have
their thoughts, but only until the state manages a way to control what
people think.

If someone wrote a decentralized truly realistic fantasy Virtual
Reality simulation in which everyone could get their  desire without
killing, maiming or molestating another, do you think the government
would allow such a program to exist?

I bet not.

"Getting into bed with the porn producers risks
  alienating the feminist movement who would otherwise be naturally
  aligned with Tor's goals."

You must be kidding.
Google for Catharine Mackinnon and Andrea Dworkin and the Indianapolis
pornography ordinance.

The feminist movement has changed since the 1960s.

These two leading feminists have called for the prohibition on hate
speech and pornography. And only thanks to the ACLU did they not
succeed in Indianapolis.

The question is not whether someone likes pornography, but whether
he/she believes the state should control it.
If you believe that the state should regulate which material I view in
my own home you can't in the long run be a friend of Tor's goals.

Enforcement of the neo-feminist movement's censorship goals is no more
friendly to Tor's goals than those of the Christian conservative
movement.

Aside from the failed war on drugs, there are three policy goals which
often beget more censorship: Protect the children, national security
and enforce copyright.

I don't want censor happy feminists on my side. They are as toxic to
free speech, privacy and anonymity as the RIAA.

Fortunately, both the protection of hate speech and virtual child
pornography is a settled constitutional question in the US, so the
worst which can happen is that other nations f-ck up their own laws.
