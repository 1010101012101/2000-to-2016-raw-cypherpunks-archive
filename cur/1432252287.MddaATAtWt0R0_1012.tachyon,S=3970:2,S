All your prime bases are belong to us.


BTW, I was not receiving Cypherpunks mail for several days, courtesy 
of my ISP deciding to implement some new policy on reverse DNS 
addresses (all mail from lne.com, which uses Verio, and mail from 
Eric Hughes, who uses ricochet.net, bounced at my ISP...probably a 
lot of other mail also never made it to me..so much for e-mail 
subpoenas, eh?). My ISP has now decided not to enforce this policy, 
thankfully.

Anyway, I looked at the Cypherpunks HyperArchive to see if the list 
was still active. Mama Mia! More spam and crud and juvenalia than 
ever before. An unbelievable amount of crap.

The lne.com scheme, which I think I had something to do with getting 
going, is best. It passes all mail from subscribers, plus mail from 
all known anonymous remailers. This allows uncensored traffic from 
any subscriber, as well as anonymized posts through remailers. (Few 
spammers use remailers.)

I'm happy with lne.com's approach (thanks, Eric M.!).
