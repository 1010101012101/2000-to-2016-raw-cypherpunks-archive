My working theory is that Choate is using the assembled, um, wisdom of 
the cypherpunks as an alternative to classical forms of education (note
I'm not saying he's actually learning anything).

Or, alternatively, Choate is simply a Markov chain that uses the
cypherpunks archives, the U.S. Constitution, and a high school physics
book as its base text.

Perhaps eventually the Book of Choate will become as well known as the 
Book of Beak:
