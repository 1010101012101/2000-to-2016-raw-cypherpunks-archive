Many of them space the code words away from the rest of
the subject text, i.e.

"Subject: what if it were true?                                       5258pf2"

I think this is to hide the code word since many mail readers
only show 40-60 characters of the Subject.

I've been id'ing spam by looking for excess whitespace
in the Subject line for a couple years (it's one of
about 200 checks my program makes).  I'm sure
other spam-recognition software does this as well.
