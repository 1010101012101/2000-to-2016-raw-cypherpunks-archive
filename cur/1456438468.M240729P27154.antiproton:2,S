That's called 'plausible deniability'.

If only the NSA/Mossad/MI5 funded janitorial staff grab the UIDs,
then both the fab and apple can pretend it's not happening.

Seems like the FBI and NSA are having a bad breakup over a little too
much LOVINT.

It seems much cheaper to actually and truly forget the UID once it's
been encapsulated in the chip package, than to risk that you might 
get Snowdened, and leave the spookery up to the spooks.
