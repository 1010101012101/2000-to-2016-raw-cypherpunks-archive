It is accepted jurisprudence that one is not required to obey 
unconstitutional laws.  Of course, one can be incarcerated for failing to 
do so until one is able to prevail in court.  As has been pointed out many 
times on this list, a number of significant SC decisions (e.g., Commerce 
Clause as a basis for much of Federal law) appear to fly in the face of a 
plain reading of the Constitution and its reasonable interpretation from 
historical documents (e.g., Madison's excellent notes during the 
constitutional convention).

Since FDR the SC has generally supported expansion of federal authority at 
the expense of State and individual rights.  A few recent decisions have 
shaken the confidence of the left that this trend will continue 
unchecked.  Let's hope the current members can stay on long enough to 
reverse some of the damage done in the past century.
