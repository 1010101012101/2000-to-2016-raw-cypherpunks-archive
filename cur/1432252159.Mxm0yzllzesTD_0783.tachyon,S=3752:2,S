Well the celebrity deathwatch site provides material rewards for the best
'guesses', and has been running unchallenged for some time.  The site
itself pays you IIRC
---whereas an AP machine is more an EBay, merely supporting its clients'
content.  I think the deathwatch site also requires that winners had
nothing to do with the deaths they predicted ---though they have no such
investigatory capacities.

Creating motives? The politicians do that themselves.  And financial reward
for guessing
is hardly illegal ---in fact, the State runs the gambling around here.  But
monopoly
is unnatural, no?
