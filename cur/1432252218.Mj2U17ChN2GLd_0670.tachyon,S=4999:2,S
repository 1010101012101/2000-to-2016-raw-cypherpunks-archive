The Freedom Forum, based in Arlington, Va., is a nonpartisan foundation 
dedicated to free press, free speech and free spirit for all people. The 
foundation focuses on three main priorities: the Newseum, First Amendment 
issues and newsroom diversity.
The Freedom Forum funds two independent affiliates  the Newseum, the 
interactive museum of news in Arlington; and the First Amendment Center, 
with offices at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., and in Arlington.
The Freedom Forum was established in 1991 under the direction of Founder 
Allen H. Neuharth as successor to a foundation started in 1935 by newspaper 
publisher Frank E. Gannett. The Freedom Forum is not affiliated with 
Gannett Co., does not solicit or accept financial contributions, and does 
not accept unsolicited funding requests. Its work is supported by income 
from an endowment of diversified assets.
Jim Lehrer receives Al Neuharth journalism award.(cool,we get his show here
