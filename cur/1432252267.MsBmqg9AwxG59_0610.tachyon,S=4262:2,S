I'm not at all sure "uniquely insensitive to tampering" is true against
an attacker who can influence the RNGs physical environment.  Suppose you're
timing alpha particles, using a clock accurate to microseconds, and the
attacker puts a microgram of 210-Polonium a few centimeters from your
detector; you'll have an event to measure every microsecond and your
detector saturates, resulting in an unending stream of 1s.

A similar attack (saturating a detector which is supposed to be secure
based on a "physical principle") defeats some "quantum key distribution"
systems (which seem to be snake oil for the most part); for example,
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3576.en.html

Certainly it's possible to add complexity to the system to ensure that
"everything is as it should be" and "nothing odd is going on"; this
complexity negates the putatively "simple" nature of systems that are
"uniquely immune" or whatever.
