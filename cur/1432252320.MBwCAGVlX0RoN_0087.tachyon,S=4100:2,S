I didn't say that Bram didn't do this on purpose, I just think it was a 
mistake in judgement.

or run BT-like apps within something else.  For BT clients its 
straightforward to run most  (e.g., Azureus) via a proxy that keeps no logs 
(e.g., Metropipe).  For Trackers its more difficult.  All I am saying is 
that Brahm should have paid a bit more attention to tracker protection.

Like TOR/I2P.

Its quite unlikely, at least in the U.S. that networks (e.g., those 
operated in a truly distributed fashion) will be declared illegal.  Its 
even less likely that such networks will enable ISPs to capture anything 
significant about your activities.

Using DNS to resolve the addresses of future trackers is probably a fools 
errand.
