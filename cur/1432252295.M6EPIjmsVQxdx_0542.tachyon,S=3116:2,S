That's correct, the trace legend says for both:

  "It is a HTTP server (running AkamaiGHost)."

But why seemingly terminate in Los Angeles? Is that a cloaking 
device? Usually when a final hop is blocked VisualRoute reports
the block, but not in these cases. Both traces' final two hops:

209.244.10.42 | gigabitethernet6-0.ipcolo1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net | Los
Angeles, CA | 
63.215.64.30 | www.whitehouse.gov | [no location shown] |

209.244.10.42 | gigabitethernet6-0.ipcolo1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net | Los
Angeles, CA | 
63.215.64.30 | www.fbi.gov | [no location shown] |

The final IP address does not appear in a DNS lookup for either 
of the .gov domains. Whitehouse.gov pulls up the Executive Office 
of the President, and fbi.gov an FBI information processing 
office.

Is that Praha CZ, or Praha AR?
