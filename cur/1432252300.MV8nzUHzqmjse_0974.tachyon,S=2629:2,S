If I thought I was being ripped off by anonymous file sharing, I'd try 
to push legislation that would mandate registering beforehand any 
download volume exceeding x per month.  Downloaded more than x per month 
but not registered?  Then you'll have to lay open your traffic, 
including encryption keys.

The reasoning would be that most people won't have any legitimate 
business downloading more than x per month.  By adjusting x, you can 
make a strong case.  Once you get this enacted, you first get the ones 
with huge download volumes; then you lower x and repeat until the number 
of false positives gets too embarassing.

If that seems drastic, just take a look at other legislation that has 
been enacted recently.  I certainly believe that it's possible.

Fun,

Stephan
