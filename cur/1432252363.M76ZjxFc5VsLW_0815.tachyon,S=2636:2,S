...between a rock and a hard place.

CBS this morning was repeating a segment apparently
from last night's Sixty Minutes show, on the NSA,
PGP and /bin/laden.

Nothing new.

http://cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,266857-412,00.shtml

Quick, what was Zimmerman's answer when asked what he
thought about the bad guys being able to use PGP?

There were misc links...

    The ACLU has an extensive site about
    Echelon. Click here for Echelonwatch. 
    http://www.aclu.org/echelonwatch/index.html

Another one to nsa.gov explaining their seal's
design. One of the Apostles contributed.

Like I said, nothing new. But "In the News".

    Linux advocates should announce Windows XP
    is the time to switch to Linux permanently.
