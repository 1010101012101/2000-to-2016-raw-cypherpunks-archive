This is not of course the actual text of the story, but it could be. We 
are getting closer and closer with each passing year to wholesale bans 
on writings, on expressed thoughts, on art, on music. The principle is 
the same. When a state actor claims to be able to ban speech, whether 
in books or magazines or video games, those involved should be dealt 
with appropriately.

Trusting the courts is not enough. The Courts, including the Supreme 
Court, are themselves deeply implicated in unconstitutional police 
state measures.
