There has never been any "integrity" (in OS/capabilities/verification 
terms) in the driver's license issuance. Not in any of the three states 
I have requested and gotten DLs in has there ever been the slightest 
attempt to verify who I say I am (lacking is-a-person credentials, this 
would be difficult anyway).

Our first Mexican governor expects to add an estimated 525,000 former 
illegal aliens to the Democrap voter base in California.

BTW, having briefly volunteered at a "register to vote" table a while 
back, I can assure you all that we never asked for any ID whatsoever 
upon taking the completed forms, that many of those who registered were 
obviously too recent in arrival in the U.S. to be legally qualifed to 
be citizens, let alone voters, and that many of those I "registered" 
(*) had essentially no knowledge of anything political.

(* I did not actually "register" them...that happens somewhere back 
when the form I collected from them is processed by the DP center and 
entered into the big computer. Do the staffers in Sacramento make 
efforts to verify addresses or to cross-check with Immigration and 
Naturalization? Do you want to buy a bridge? Once the forms are sent 
in, registration is a foregone conclusion.)
