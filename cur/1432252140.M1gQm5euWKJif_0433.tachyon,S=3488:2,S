"Conforming to international treaties" *is* the hip way to circumvent the
constitution. The latest copyright term extension gives a fine example --
conformance being used as a reason to walk over the concept of copyrights as
being granted for "limited times". All you need to gut an amendment is
widespread hysteria/stupidity. Drug enforcement works on the former, 1A
exceptions for commercial and sexual speech the latter.

Or just interpret existing law creatively, e.g. bring spoliation charges
against remailer operators. If people are worked up enough, nobody will
object to bringing those nasty Osama collaborators to the ground.
