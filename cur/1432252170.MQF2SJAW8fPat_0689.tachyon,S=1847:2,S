The author/releasor of Waste/W.A.S.T.E. (All Rights Reserved--neither  
T. Pynchon nor T. May use this name anymore) is apparently leaving  
AOL/Time Warner, the company that purchased his company, Nullsoft.

So I guess we won't have the Waste/W.A.S.T.E. proprietary crypto  
innards to kick around anymore.
