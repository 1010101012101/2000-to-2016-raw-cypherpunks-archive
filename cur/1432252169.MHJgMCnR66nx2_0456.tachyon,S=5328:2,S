ChinaJiang Zemin.<br>
He makes no bones about wanting to become China's third &quot;Red
Emperor&quot;. To strengthen his grip on the state, the president
launched a campaign to control the media and the Internet. A dozen
journalists have been dismissed since early 2001 for tackling
controversial subjects such as corruption. To make sure the message got
through, in July 2001 the government reminded the country of the
&quot;Seven Prohibitions,&quot; especially one about &quot;disrupting the
work of the Party&quot;. As soon as China was awarded the Olympic Games,
the president asked his security services to ensure a &quot;healthy
Internet&quot;. In less than two months, police arrested a dozen
cyber-dissidents and closed more than 8,000 cyber-caf=E9s. Described in his
official biography as &quot;modest and courteous,&quot; Jiang Zemin has
never intervened in favour of journalist Wu Shishen, who was sentenced to
life imprisonment in 1992. In fact the president personally urged a stiff
sentence for him.<br>
