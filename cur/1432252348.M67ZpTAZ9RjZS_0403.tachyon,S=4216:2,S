One of the new features, I am finishing implementation on is the ability
to quickly create "burner" accounts within ChatSecure v12.

As of last nights alpha, you can now create new accounts directly from
the app, on supported services such as Jabber.ccc.de and Dukgo.com. In
the default mode, you choose a username, password, etc, yourself.

The concept of a burner account is that you can quickly create a new
clean account with no identifying or memorable details, and have that
account only exist on your device, within the encrypted ChatSecure
SQLCipher data store.

In the burner mode, a random username and password will be generated,
all registration and communication will be required to be done over
Orbot/Tor, and possibly, we will only support using an XMPP service that
has a Tor hidden service.

One you are logged in, you can then use the typical invite/add contact
feature to start a chat with someone, either on the same box, or any
other federated XMPP service. Ideally, the other person is also using a
burner account.

Any other thoughts on this feature? Other similar implementations or
concepts to consider? Perhaps this should be a Force OTR-only as well,
and maybe the account auto-deletes after a time period or when you exit
the app?

Thanks for your feedback, and please, try the latest alpha if you have
not yet moved onto v12. It is getting very close to stable, and we are
very nearly done with all the new features.
