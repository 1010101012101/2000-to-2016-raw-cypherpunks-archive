Cyphermint Partners With PayStar to Provide Prepaid Visa Debit Services to
Worldwide Communications Group

December 8, 2004, Marlborough, Massachusetts - Cyphermint, Inc., a leading
provider of secure electronic payment solutions, announced today that it
will partner with PayStar Corporation, a provider of stored value debit
cards, banking debit card load centers and kiosks. This strategic alliance
of Cyphermint and PayStar will supply Worldwide Communications Group,
Inc.'s (WWCG) underserved low income Government Section 8 housing
recipients with Cyphermint's PayCash Now Visa. Debit Card.

The PayCash Now Visa Debit Card, issued by BankFirst, will serve as the
vehicle to deliver the nationwide ATM debit card services for the program
called the Community Technology Network Project (CTNP). WWCG developed the
"CTNP" stored value card program and is the administrator of the project.
PayStar will offer the ATM debit card program to approximately 16 million
existing SEC8 families.

The CTNP Project provides a convenient venue for participants to access the
Internet and several substantial discounted medical programs for
underserved families. The CTNP ATM Card will provide the participants who
may not qualify for credit or checking accounts, a flexible and secure
cashless payment option. Additionally, recipients of the program will be
able to render payment for rent, utilities and pay for discounted program
benefits without the use of a major credit card, a checking account or
actual cash.

The CTNP Card Program will generate a significant number of new PayCash
users and may potentially equate to 200,000 or more new PayCash customers
for Cyphermint in 2005.

"PayStar now participates with the CTNP project through PayStar's GLOBAL
Cash division", said William D. Yotty, Chairman and CEO, PayStar
