I'm not to sure on that. I've seen people who are active shooters get 
their range bags swabbed at airports, but never set off the detectors.

You'd have thought that a bag which spent a lot of time containing

firearms after sessions, and which sits nearby while firing is undeway,
would have all kinds of interesting traces on it.
