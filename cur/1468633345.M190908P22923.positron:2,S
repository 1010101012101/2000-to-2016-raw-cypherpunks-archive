	It's OK to analyze motives and means, I don't dispute that. But
	means exist to achieve some end, which supposedly is more
	important than the means. 

	In the case of appelbaum he got metaphorically lynched by
	politically correct feminists, but what really matters is that
	a) he got lynched b) by his own employeers c) who are members of
	the 'good' 'pro-privacy' 'community'.

	I think we would agree that appelbaum was indeed kicked out,
	no? We should further agree that the kicking was formally done
	by the tor project's 'authorties'? 

	So we can safely assume that either those  'authorities' acted
	on their own accord, or else got their marching orders from
	sombebody else?

	And from my point of view, that doesn't make much of a
	differece anyway. Whether they 'betrayed' appelbaum because
	they were 'following orders', or not, doesn't change what they
	did.

	I don't object to that, but I don't think it matters too much
	who the 'intellectual author' is. Whether it's some feminist
	bitches who now run at least part of the show, or it's syverson
	and the general baxter*, the tor project is still a bad joke.

	It's obvious that tor helps the state more than it
	hinders it. Otherwise the state would have never created and
	tolerated something like it.

	Nobody really wants to close it down. The factional fights
	inside the state are just for show.

	True that =P
