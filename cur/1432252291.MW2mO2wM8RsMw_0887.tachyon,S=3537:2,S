    And just what is it that makes you think that "one out of ten" 
didn't secretly cheer that news? Or maybe more? And even if it were
only "one out a thousand", isn't that a significant number? Even in
the First American Revolution, not that many actually took up arms.
Many were totally against it, and fought for the Brits. If one in
a thousand took up arms today against the fedz, wouldn't that out-
number the US military?
