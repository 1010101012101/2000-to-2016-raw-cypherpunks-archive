This is the classic "Barium Meal Test", a highly effective way to find a 
mole.

I have been meaning for some time to write a quick pythons script which 
implements the Barium Meal Test on plain text, perhaps even in a 
distributed way; by making common misspellings, by replacing whitespace 
with unicode equivalents (bit too obvious?), by making synonymous 
punctuation modifications - a dash rather than a semicolon as in this 
sentence couplet, for example.

Part of the idea is to help identify "moles" in follower networks of 
"private users" in P2P social networks, when people "retweet" private 
messages. If you could divide your followers into groups and give each 
group a different barium meal'd message, then after a few "leaks" you'd 
be able to identify likely leakers.

The other part was to point out how easy such identifying substitutions 
are to make, and to make people acutely aware of the risks involved in 
sharing potentially watermarked information.
