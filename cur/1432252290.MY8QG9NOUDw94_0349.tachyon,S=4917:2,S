I found the P239 not quite as well balanced as either my P226 or 
P228, and I can conceal either practically as well as the smaller 
P239.

Click, clack is how I describe the P7.  I wouldn't want to reveal my 
position to say a burglar with such a pistol-  Any of the other 
pistols mentioned along with other conventional DA/SA pistols seem to 
be a better choice.

Keep in mind that Glocks, while excellent, reliable and accurate do 
lead the pack in accidental discharges, even among "trained" police. 
I'd not recommend the Glock to a beginner or to someone who wouldn't 
put in the necessary practice.

The Kahr's are excellent firearms-  Especially if your primary 
purpose is to conceal it.  However as a general purpose pistol a 
higher magazine capacity model with better longer range accuracy is 
better-
