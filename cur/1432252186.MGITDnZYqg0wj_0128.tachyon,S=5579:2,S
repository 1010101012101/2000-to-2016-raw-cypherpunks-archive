You have asked me once, off list.  I replied, off list.

Now I will repost that reply on the list.

A few posts back when I pointed out that most businesses engage 
in routine, regularly scheduled deletion of potentially inconvenient 
records, and none of them have got in trouble for it yet, you replied 
that a business that engages in that practice is like a man who has 
jumped from a tall building and boasts that he has not hit anything 
hard yet.

Now, however, you deny ever taking that position, indicating that 
your previous position (the position that you proclaimed so 
pompously and patronizingly) was a load of old bananas, which in 
turn indicates that in this area of the law, you do not know shit from 
beans

Whenever I ask our company lawyer a legal question, he usually 
answers "That is not my area of expertise".

You should try that answer.  It will keep you out of lots of trouble.
