<<A Michigan boor swore at and made sexually suggestive gestures to a
woman after she asked him not to swear near a small child. He might be
charged under MI's anti-swearing law or under disturbing the peace.>>

This doesn't sound like the peace and safety of the community is being
threatened. Why doesn't the offended woman file a civil claim, if she
was that offended? I don't know Michigan law, but the offence should fit
within the common law "intentional infliction of mental distress" and
"nuisance" torts.

(I can't believe I wrote that. Two weeks in law school and I'm already
warped.)
