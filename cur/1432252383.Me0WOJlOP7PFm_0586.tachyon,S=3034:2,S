Seems like.

However, the barrier for that seems somewhat higher than an intercept or  
pen register.  (Entering into full speculation mode here) I suspect that  
one would need a direct court order akin to a full search & seizure in  
order to give the feds access to the messages;  it seems to involve  
handing over the entire device key to clone the full personality.

The original CNN article doesn't pass muster, a far more skeptical and  
analytical one is here:
