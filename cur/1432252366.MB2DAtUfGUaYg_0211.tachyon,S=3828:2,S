Who says all libertarians are obliged to come on like a ton of bricks?
There's no reason you can't keep your hardcore beliefs to yourself while
doing the most rigorous and objective analysis you can. That's the one
real difference between being just another partisan and a serious analyst
who commands repsect, when you think of it. 

Earning a reputation for using only the highest standards and most rigorous
methodology comes first, the way I see it. Your principles and priorities
never change, but by not revealing them to people all at once, you're able to
find your way into projects and situations where they can have a significant
impact. That's the plan, anyway.

Sadly enough, you're probably right.
But isn't it about time somebody started trying? I think so.
