If I have an image I took of my farm, turn it into digital bits, and put
the DVD in a safe, so nothing can copy it, it's my property.

If encrypt the image, and keep the private key in my safe, so nothing can
copy the original image, it's my property. Now maybe I install some robots
with guns to defend the safe too....

If I slap a creative commons license on the image... well, that's asking
the government (which is a lot like a robot) to hold a gun to anyone's
head who tries to modify the image and pass it off as their 'property'.

Is the last one still my property? I guess that depends on your viewpoint
on the validity of the robots of buearocracy, and if they have their guns
pointed at you or not.
