Hum.
Would there be value in a (TOR?) service whereby, if the key is beaten out 
of someone (whether that key leads to the real data or not), then a flag is 
sent up somewhere saying, "If you are reading this then the key for Data X 
has been beaten out of me, or they are attempting to beat it out of me."

This nice thing about TOR-stored data and services is that it would be 
well-nigh impossible for interrrogators to know in advance that they won't 
be making the canary sing. In fact, depending on the nature of the data 
stored, it could be set up to be irretrievable without a message going off.
