They've also spent a lot of money, through PARC and now (along with 
Microsoft and Adobe, those staunch defenders of freedom) "ContentGuard", on 
"digital rights management", which is just a nice name for the part of a 
copy protection system which decides whether or not the user gets to do 
what they're trying to do.

So it's not surprising that it's not a friendly place to work if you're a 
plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to eviscerate the legal protection that the 
copy protection industry has gained for their technically infeasible 
product line. Doesn't he realize that it's very important that nobody 
criticize the RIAA/MPAA's new clothes?
