It strikes me as likely that the government can obtain your search
records from Amazon without even a minimal court order.  Note the
following item in Google's privacy policy:

? We conclude that we are required by law or have a good
? faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of
? such information is reasonably necessary to protect the
? rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the
? public.

It's pretty hard to avoid the conclusion that they're allowed to
comply with a simple FBI request:  "we think that your user so-and-so
is an evil terrorist; can we have his search and email records?"
Sure sounds like a public safety issue, right?  Or how about
"we think that so-and-so is an evil file-sharer; can we have records
of all of her searches for 'mp3' or 'kazaa'?" from the RIAA?
That sounds like a property issue.  But we can go a step further.
Google is really good at finding information matches; what if they
themselves develop a search profile that "identifies" a terrorist,
a file sharer, or what have you?
