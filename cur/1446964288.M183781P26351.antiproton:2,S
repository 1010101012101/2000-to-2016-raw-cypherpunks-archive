	I don't, though I didn't bother checking. July 2014 isn't too
	ancient anyway.

	Oh, if they so then it must be true =)

	Well, I'm 100% confident that a company like apple is not to be
	trusted.

	Good luck. Out of the fire into the frying pan =P

	Very few. However, as far as I know, people who need to
	encrypt stuff that the government isn't supposed to read, say
	people buying and selling 'illegal' drugs, use p/gpg not
	iphones.

	Well, it's a client-side encryption tool. Nobody can 'encrypt'
	the fact that he sent or received mail. PGP is not a mix
	network...

	And does a company like apple which collects information about
	hundreds of millions of people protect 'metadata' better? 

	Anyway, to expect the likes of apple to actually oppose the
	government (that is to say their partners) is naive at best,
	in my opinion.
