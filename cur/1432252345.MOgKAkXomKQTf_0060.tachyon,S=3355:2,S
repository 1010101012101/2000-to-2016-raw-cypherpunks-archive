Speaking for myself, I don't really want to know my customers any more
than I absolutely must.  If y'all are so willing to identify and treat
differently one class of customers  (spooks), I believe that you have
no moral leg to stand on when a different class of customers (say,
hispanics) are treated differently.

If there's no morality bit in encryption, then there's no morality
bit, and the fifth horsey of government can be as anonymous as the
rest of us.
