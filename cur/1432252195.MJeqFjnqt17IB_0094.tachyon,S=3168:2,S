What percentage of Kerry supporters are supporters, and not just an
anti-Bush vote?

This is my point.  He hasn't done *everything* wrong, yet given the
shrill denouncements from both sides, you'd think that both the
candidates were complete morons.  I'd think there would be some
measured discussion on this list, but its the same slogans spewed out.

Do you really think Kerry wouldnt have signed the Patriot Act if he
was president?  Federalized the drivers license requirements?  Pushed
for socialized medicine with central controls?  Kerry or Bush, Kang or
Kodos, in the end it means the same thing.
