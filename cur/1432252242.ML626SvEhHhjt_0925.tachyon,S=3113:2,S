I need to add another comment.

I don't know if you speak for the P.E.T. Workshop or not, Dave, but the 
mistake with this and similar recent conferences is to think that you 
can just issue a "cattle call" for papers and have interesting papers 
come in.

The challenge when launching a new conference, as in Information Hiding, 
Financial Cryptography, this one, is to do more than just issue cattle 
calls.

Sadly, too many of these b.s. conferences take the easy way out and just 
do the cattle call, hoping that some droids at Philips or Siemens or 
Intel will write up something vaguely related to the ostensible theme of 
the conference.

The frosting on the cake will be when Esther Dyson is invited to give 
the keynote speech.
