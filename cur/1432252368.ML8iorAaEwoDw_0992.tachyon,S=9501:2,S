	And that, indeed, is a statement. Grarpamp said he was told
	pigs fly. I replied  ¨what you´ve been told is wrong¨.
	<---statement.

	You are right. I didn´t provide any further comment. Just
	like grarpamp did =). 

	Now, as far as I can tell, grarpamp´s statement is meant as
	irony. He isn´t just saying that writting letters to
	politicians ´works´ - he´s saying it in a particular way which
	underscores the message. 

	By saying ¨Oh, I was told this works¨, he actually means ¨this
	definitely works and only idiots would doubt it¨

	Again, he just basically stated a falsehood, and ´supported´ it
	by hearsay, If we assume he wasn´t being ironic. 

	Either way, irony or not, he made an unsupported and mostly
	wrong assertion. 

	I replied with an unsupported but correct assertion.

	Ah, OK,. I can agree with that.

	But your position strikes me as rather different from what
	grarpamp said. 

	Whereas you´re saying that some kind of public involvement
	*can* work, and you are correctly noting the nature of the
	political  system (corrupt by design), grarpamp did nothing of
	the sort.

	I didn´t say ¨nothing´ gonna chage¨.

	But I´ll say it now : nothing is going to change IF you use the
	´democratic tools´ given to us  serfs  by the ´democratic
	masters´.

	If public involvement means rioting and killing state
	personnel, then we are talking. 

	If public involvment means taking money from the pentagon to
	create an ´anonimity network´ to spy on ¨the west´s enemies¨
	, then public involvement is a bad joke. Counterproductive. Or
	exactly what the powers that be want.

	Well, at the very least, to correct people like grarpamps, and
	any other people  who either support the american
	government in particular, or support the fuckingly stupid  and
	criminal idea of ¨good government¨ and ¨good politicians¨ in
	general.

	I would have thought that preaching anarchy in this list would
	be be preaching to the choir, but I am not so sure that´s the
	case now.

	Except I didn´t say that civil participation can´t do shit. I
	objected to the particular kind of civil participation that
	grarpamp suggested. 

	Did he, for instance write  ¨I was told civil DISOBEDIENCE
	works¨? and then I shot down his assertion? Nope...
