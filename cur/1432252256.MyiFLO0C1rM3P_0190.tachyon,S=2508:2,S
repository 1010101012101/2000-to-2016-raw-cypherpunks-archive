         I should have been more careful.

         Serpent, per se, has been given over to the public domain.

         What has been released under the more restrictive GPL terms are 
the optimized Serpent implementations -- by a variety of talented folk, in 
a variety of useful languages -- which were in the AES submission package. 
They are now available from the Serpent website at:
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html>.

         As the website puts it:

"Serpent is now completely in the public domain, and we impose no 
restrictions on its use. This was announced on the 21st August at the First 
AES Candidate Conference. The optimised implementations in the submission 
package are now under the GNU PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL), although some comments 
in the code still say otherwise. You are welcome to use Serpent for any 
application. If you do use it, we would appreciate it if you would let us 
know!"

         Sorry if I confused anyone.
