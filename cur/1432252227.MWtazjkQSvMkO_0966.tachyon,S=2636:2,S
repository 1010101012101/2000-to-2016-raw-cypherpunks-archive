There's no reason to think those backtrees wouldn't get too hard to follow 
even without superpolynomial problems to solve.  After all, finding a 
collision in SHA-512 is O(1), as is brute-forcing a 256-bit AES 
key.  There's just a really big constant term.

Honestly, I think for real-world cryptography, we need about an N^3 
advantage or so between defenders and attackers--the defenders do 2^{25} 
work, and the attackers have to do 2^{75}, say, to break it.  Merkle's 
puzzles and all the related schemes give you N^2, and that's not *quite* 
enough to be useful.
