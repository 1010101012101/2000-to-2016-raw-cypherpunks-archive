Me was making a different point, that presumably there is no legal 
distinction, at least in America, between the religion of Islam and 
the religion of the Great Squid.

As to your language about "it is NOT permissable ...under ANY 
circumstances," there are many religious beliefs which are overruled 
by law in the U.S. Mormon polygamy (several spouses), for example. 
Peyote rituals, for another example.

Though there are some "variations in regulations" allowable for 
various religions, such as rules about wearing hats in military 
services, etc., there is a very general principle in the U.S. which 
says that the law applies equally to all, regardless of religious 
beliefs.

(This is a major reason for having a minimal state, with the set of 
laws only being the "Schelling points" (a game theory term many of us 
like to use) which nearly all persons can agree to.)

The Great Squid has equal standing with Mohammed, in other words.

Things are dramatically different in Germany and other countries, we 
all understand. But in the U.S., no particular religion is supposed 
to have any special favor in the eyes of the law. There are even 
Satanist chaplains/priests in the U.S. armed services.
