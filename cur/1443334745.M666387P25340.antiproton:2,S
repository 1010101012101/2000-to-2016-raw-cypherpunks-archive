Augur May Become the Greatest Gambling Platform in History. Is There Anythi=
ng the Government Can Do to Stop It?
A blockchain-based prediction market that won=E2=80=99t be controlled or ma=
naged by anyone.
Jim Epstein =C2=A0 Aug. 11, 2015 12:36 pm

An online gambling platform could do to the neighborhood bookie what electr=
ic refrigerators did to the ice delivery man.
Coming this fall,=C2=A0Augur=C2=A0will allow participants to wager money on=
 any future event of their choosing. Software will set the odds, collect th=
e bets, and disperse the winnings. The price alone should give Nevada sport=
sbook operators pause; an estimated one percent of every pot will go to kee=
p the system running. The average vig today is about 10 times that.
Augur isn't a full-fledged casino. You can't play roulette or poker, and ru=
nning lotto on the platform would be tricky. But it'll be great for sports =
betting.
Here=E2=80=99s what=E2=80=99s truly novel about Augur: It won=E2=80=99t be =
controlled by any person or entity, nor will it operate off of any one comp=
uter network. All the money in the system will be in Bitcoin, or other type=
s of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, so no credit card companies or banks need=
 to be involved. If the system runs afoul of regulators=E2=80=94and if it=
=E2=80=99s successful, it most certainly will=E2=80=94they'll find that the=
re's no company to sue, no computer hardware to pull out of the wall, and n=
o CEO to lockup in a cage.This is new legal territory. If Augur catches on =
as a tool for betting on everything from basketball games to stock prices, =
is there anything the government can do to stop it?
Augur is a=C2=A0decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace,=C2=A0a new kind of =
entity made possible by recent breakthroughs in computer science. The purpo=
se of these platforms is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services a=
mong perfect strangers on a platform that nobody administers or controls. A=
ugur=E2=80=99s software will run on what=E2=80=99s known as a =E2=80=9Cbloc=
kchain"=E2=80=94a concept introduced in 2008 with the invention of Bitcoin=
=E2=80=94that's essentially a shared database for executing trades that's p=
owered and maintained by its users.
Bitcoin=E2=80=99s blockchain was designed as a banking ledger of sorts=E2=
=80=94kind of like a distributed Microsoft Excel file=E2=80=94but Augur wil=
l utilize a groundbreaking new project called=C2=A0Ethereum=C2=A0that expan=
ds on this concept. Ethereum allows Augur's entire system to live on the bl=
ockchain. That means the software and processing power that makes Augur fun=
ction will be distributed among hundreds or thousands of computers. Destroy=
ing Augur would involve unplugging the computers of everyone in the world p=
articipating in the Ethereum blockchain.
If Augur is destined to become the cypherpunks answer to gambling prohibiti=
on=E2=80=94the betting man=E2=80=99s version of the online drug market Silk=
 Road if you will=E2=80=94you'd never know it from talking with its develop=
ers. They work for a San Francisco-based nonprofit, attend conferences, hav=
e legal representation, and talk openly about what they=E2=80=99re up to wi=
th reporters. Augur even commissionedone of those cheesy motion graphics pr=
omotional videos=C2=A0favored by new tech startups.
About half of the roughly $600,000 raised by Augur's development team comes=
 from Joe Costello, the successful tech entrepreneur who was once=C2=A0Stev=
e Jobs' top pick to become the CEO of Apple.
Joey Krug, a twenty-year-old Pomona college dropout and Augur's lead develo=
per, never uses the world =E2=80=9Cgambling" to describe his venture. He an=
d his team of five employees call Augur a =E2=80=9Cprediction market,=E2=80=
=9D a term that emphasizes the information generated when a bunch of people=
 have a financial incentive to feed their expertise into a sophisticated al=
gorithm.
With Augur, as bettors move money in and out of the pot, the odds adjust. T=
his yields publicly available statistics that should carry weight because t=
hey're derived from the opinions of a crowd of people with a stake in the r=
esults. InTrade, for example, the best-known prediction market until federa=
l regulators forced it to stop serving U.S. customers in 2012, beat the pol=
lsters and pundits by foreseeing the outcome of the 2008 presidential elect=
ions in 48 out of 50 states.
Augur=E2=80=99s developers hope that their platform will make it possible t=
o do a Google search to look up the likelihood of some future event. This c=
ould usher in a better world, with more informed policy decisions and less =
malinvestment.
But Augur also serves the less high-minded=E2=80=94though no less noble=E2=
=80=94purpose of providing cost savings and convenience to gamblers. Restri=
ctions on gambling serve to protect government revenue at the betting man's=
 expense. State-sanctioned casino operators pay high taxes, and state-run l=
otteries fleece their customers. But there's no logical or moral case for g=
overnment restrictions on gambling, since no third party is harmed when con=
senting adults wager money on the future. Augur actually has the potential =
to make the world safer by taking away market share in the gambling industr=
y from criminals.
And yet sports betting is illegal in most states, and prediction markets ar=
e tightly regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC). The=
 agency sued Ireland-based InTrade in 2012 to prevent it from accepting bet=
s from U.S. customers. (The company folded shortly after.) In 2013, the CFT=
C and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly sued the predict=
ion market Banc de Binary for allowing U.S. customers to make bets on commo=
dity prices.
The CFTC has approved other prediction markets, such as the New Zealand-bas=
ed PredictIt, but only after it agreed to abide by the agency's restriction=
s.
Krug says the Augur team is planning to meet with CFTC staff go over how th=
eir system works before it=E2=80=99s launched, but says he's not overly con=
cerned. =E2=80=9COur friends in Washington, D.C. say the CFTC will probably=
 just dismiss Augur and say it=E2=80=99s not a big deal,=E2=80=9D Krug told=
 me in a phone interview.
That doesn=E2=80=99t sound like much of a legal strategy, but how do you ha=
ve a legal strategy when you're building something unlike anything that's e=
ver existed? Federal anti-gambling laws, such as the 2006 Unlawful Internet=
 Gambling Enforcement Act, target the companies that facilitate online bett=
ing=E2=80=94 website operators, credit card companies, banks=E2=80=94not in=
dividual gamblers.
Augur=E2=80=99s biggest legal vulnerability is the community of human =E2=
=80=9Creporters=E2=80=9D who are needed to settle bets on the platform, say=
s Cardozo Law School's Aaron Wright, who is writing a book about the legal =
implications of blockchain technology. Let=E2=80=99s say a group of people =
wager money on Augur over the outcome of a boxing match. Once the bout is o=
ver, human participants (who receive a portion of the trading fees as compe=
nsation) must report the outcome to the system before Augur=E2=80=99s softw=
are will disperse the money to the winners. "There=E2=80=99s at least an ar=
gument that the people doing that reporting are aiding or abetting unlicens=
ed options and could be prosecuted," says Wright.
But Augur doesn't collect personal information on any of its users, so iden=
tifying these people could be difficult. And Augur is a borderless technolo=
gy, so U.S. gamblers could simply rely on foreigners to report on the outco=
mes of their bets.
One attorney I spoke with suggested that the team that=E2=80=99s building A=
ugur could be brought up on charges for aiding and abetting a criminal cons=
piracy. Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundat=
ion, thinks that's far-fetched but says he can't rule it out. Cardozo empha=
sizes that writing open source software doesn=E2=80=99t necessarily protect=
 the team from prosecution.
=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve taken the steps that we need to take in order to bra=
cket the individual's risk and the organization=E2=80=99s risk,=E2=80=9D sa=
ys Augur=E2=80=99s attorney, Marco Santori, who declined to comment further=
 on exactly what those steps might entail.
Even if Krug and his colleagues were to face criminal prosecution, the tech=
nology would live on. After Augur is born into the world, the development t=
eam could release a software update that would cripple the system. But in t=
hat case, Augur's users could band together to block any changes to the und=
erlying code, or another developer could copy the open source code and simp=
ly re-launch the platform.=C2=A0
The big question with Augur=E2=80=94and with blockchain platforms more gene=
rally=E2=80=94is whether they can outrun our regulatory state long enough t=
o grow so large and popular that they're truly unstoppable. My money=E2=80=
=99s on Augur in that race.
