     Go tell that to the Seattle/Portland/wherever wireless people. Or the
people in rural MN who are putting them up on silos and running a 10 mile
radius. Totally depends on your topography. And even with p-p they aren't
doing parabolics, more like yagi directionals, which could be just another
TV antenna, cut to the harmonic.
      Gee, maybe they'll start raiding home with TV antennas.
