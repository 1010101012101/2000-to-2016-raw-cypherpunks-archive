Yes, I know. I have known this for many years.

Thankfully, many folks were liberal Jews in Weimar Germany. Guns were 
icky. Guns were inconsistent with reading the Torah, selling 
diamonds, and arguing for a more powerful central state. Well, look 
where supporting gun confiscation got the Jews a few years laterL: 
"Up in smoke."

Your liberal Jews are indeed coming to get our guns.

And we folks will be ready.

(I said "we folks." Your own "hope your ready" and "us gun grabing" 
patterns, esp. with the "us" error, give some useful supporting 
evidence as to which name you used to post under. Thanks for 
providing more clues.)
