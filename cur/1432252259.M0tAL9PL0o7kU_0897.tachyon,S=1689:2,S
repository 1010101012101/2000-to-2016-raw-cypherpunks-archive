Amongst the earliers RAMs were tubes of mercury with a pulse-generator
at one end and a microphone at the other.  The speed of sound provided

The fascists will define the language they desire, the technologists
have to deal with reality.  App level encryption with
privately-exchanged
PKs are the answer.  Verification / reputation up to you.
