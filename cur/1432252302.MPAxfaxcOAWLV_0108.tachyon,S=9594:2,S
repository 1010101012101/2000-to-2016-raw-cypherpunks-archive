They were given the coins by people who trusted them and their code to not
be easily manipulated. Their code was crap and didn't do the tracking
properly. They didn't steal the coins, they screwed up the code by not
ensuring that it was to the level of quality needed for such a high amount
of finance moving through it. This is not theft, it's incompetence. This is
closer to your bank leaving it's vault open or, in the case of Target,
accidentally having all of the credit card numbers stolen.

The problem here is that it is cheaper in the short term to create crappy
code security-wise and push it live than it is to create code that is
actually properly implemented for a banking environment to handle both the
large amounts of money and the quite serious number of attacks that will
take place once the amount of money available is established.

In a competitive environment, the folks who take short cuts will save money
in the short term, and thus will be more likely to pick up users than a
more expensive equivalent that actually did the security correctly.

Regulations in this circumstance only have the effect of ensuring a certain
level of quality and security for the end consumer by levelling the playing
field to a certain standard.
