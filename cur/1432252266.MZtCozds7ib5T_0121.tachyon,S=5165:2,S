IEEE Signs VoteHere's Jim Adler for Book on Electronic Voting
Tuesday November 2, 1:00 pm ET

PISCATAWAY, N.J. and BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- The Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), under its Standards
Press program, has engaged with VoteHere, Inc. Founder and CEO, Jim Adler,
to write a book on electronic voting security and voter confidence.
Tentatively titled: "Where's My Vote? A Framework for Securing the
Electronic Ballot and Gaining Voter Confidence," the book will explain how
technology can enhance electronic voting and prove that votes are counted
properly.

"Where's My Vote" will discuss the issues and analyze the technology behind
electronic voting, verification, and audit. Electronic voting technology
has ignited a national debate surrounding the security of our elections.
This book will establish a framework for secure election systems, now and
in the future.

"A book on voting security is an important contribution to the current
debate," said Susan Tatiner, Associate Managing Director for Technical
Program Development in the IEEE Standards Association. "Mr. Adler is a
recognized expert and pioneer in electronic voting technology."

Upon their agreement Mr. Adler commented, "I believe these issues are very
timely and my hope is that the security solutions discussed in this book
can help guide election reform, so that election leaders and voters might
better understand the fundamental science of elections and the proper role
of technology in providing transparent and auditable elections."

What has been missing in the electronic voting and ballot verification
debate is a scientific framework to break through the issues regarding the
current election system. "Where's My Vote" provides this framework in the
context of providing a unified theory of elections for verification and
confidence.

Jim Adler is Founder and CEO of VoteHere, the leading worldwide provider of
electronic voting security technology. Mr. Adler is widely regarded as an
authority on the subjects of cryptography, Internet security and e-voting.
Mr. Adler co-chairs the IEEE voter-verifiable standards group and served on
California's groundbreaking 1999 Internet Voting Task Force. He has
testified before U.S. Congress, the European Parliament, and state
legislatures on the subject of e-voting security.
