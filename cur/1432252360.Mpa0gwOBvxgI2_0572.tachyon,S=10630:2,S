is a patent-pending so|ution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP call. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any cellular or landline push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP ca|| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia||y or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2OO,OO0

units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi||iOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team,

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mil|iken GMBH
