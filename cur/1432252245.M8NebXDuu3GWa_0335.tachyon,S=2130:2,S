I don't think this hasn't got to do much with Antigua.  It's also not
specific to North America.  It's very difficult to create market
conditions which result in low-latency routing, so only smaller
countries with a sufficently developed Internet economy have it.

(The U.S. issues in this area are so bad that even a network with
extensive peering hasn't got drastically better connectivity to major
U.S. sites than a consumer DSL line in some European countries.)
