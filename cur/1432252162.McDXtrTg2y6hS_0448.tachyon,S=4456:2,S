"This happened just a few miles
from me, so perhaps I've paid closer attention than you have. T-shirt
man wasn't merely minding his own business while wearing an offensive
shirt. He was stepping in front of people and haranguing them in front
of a large anchor store in the mall. After a while he was asked to
leave by a store employee, so he took himself to the food court and
repeated the procedure. After complaints from several mall patrons, a
security guard asked T-shirt man to either knock it off or leave."

Well I haven't heard the story told this way before. If this were the case, 
he should be removed no matter what T-shirt he was wearing.

As for the "private property" issues, I'm still not convinced they're 
cut-and-dry (though in some cases maybe they are). If nothing else, the 
demonstration the following morning lets the local thugs know that consensus 
reality these days does not equate benevolence with US foreign policy. Thus, 
the barely-made-it-out-of-high-school managers of the Mall's Security will 
know that anti-war T-shirts may not be any more controversial than pro-war 
t-shirts, despite what the TV has instructed them.
