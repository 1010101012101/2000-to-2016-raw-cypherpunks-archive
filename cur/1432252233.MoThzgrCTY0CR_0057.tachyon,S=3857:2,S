There are always hints about such a thing supposedly happening. When you
press for details, it becomes very hard to find anything resembling actual
incidents.

The "Cyber Terrorism" scare is just that. A scare.

It is a way for various government agencies to justify their insane
budgets.

I expect we will have a few real incidents in the near future, but I
expect they will be like the rash of cases a few years ago involving
supposed Anthrax attacks.  Lots of cases where fake anthrax attacks were
supposedly staged. (Conviently in public places where people would find
them before hand.)  No real indication of the real thing.

I expect if we do have a "Cyber Pearl Harbor" it will be from some
government agency (probably the FBI) trying to work up the funding to
"protect" us.
