Do we know for sure that Reddit deleted the canary because something
happened that killed the canary, rather than because their legal department
decided that the canary was possibly not legal in the first place? One
would think they would simply say that's why they did it if that were the
case, but the fact that they didn't say that is the only evidence I'm aware
of that it's NOT because they decided it was illegal.
