                           Who's got an
                           eye on you?

                           Secret
                           cameras are
                           everywhere

                           By Andrea
                           Cavanaugh,
                           Staff Writer

                           Smile!

                           If you're
                           making your
                           way around
                           Los Angeles
                           -- or any
                           metropolitan
                           area in
                           America these
                           days -- there's
                           a good
                           chance your
                           movements
                           are being
                           recorded by a
                           surveillance
                           camera.

                           Once limited
                           mostly to
                           banks and
                           convenience
                           stores, the
                           beady eye of
                           the surveillance camera has appeared nearly
everywhere over the past
                           decade. Cheaper surveillance systems and
heightened fears of terrorist
                           attacks have created a world that is
increasingly captured on camera.

                           "If you're outside doing anything, you're
being recorded 50 percent of the
                           time," said Paul Ramos, vice president of
sales and marketing for Fairfax
                           Electronics, a Los Angeles company that sells
security systems.

                           "If you're shopping or attending an event, it
goes up to 90 percent. Yes,
                           Big Brother is there, and Big Brother is
strong."

                           Perched on rooftops and under eaves, cameras
discreetly rake shopping
                           centers, stadiums, office buildings and
parking lots.

                           Police say surveillance cameras, whether
installed by businesses,
                           homeowners or local governments, act as a
powerful law-enforcement tool
                           and crime deterrent. Law-abiding people have
nothing to worry about, said
                           Lt. Paul Vernon of the Los Angeles Police
Department.

                           "When people start talking about Big Brother,
I say, 'I've got nothing to
                           hide.' Those cameras aren't looking into my
home, and if they were, it
                           would be pretty boring."

                           Although law-enforcement agencies hail the
technology as a labor-saving
                           device that allows them to patrol much larger
areas with fewer sets of eyes,
                           many civil libertarians view surveillance
cameras as a creeping erosion of
                           privacy rights.

                           "How would you like to be followed around by
a slimy guy in a raincoat
                           who records everything you do? It's a
technological version of a slimy guy
                           in a raincoat," said privacy expert Lauren
Weinstein, who is producing a
                           radio series about technology's impact on
society.

                           "The difference is, you can't see it, you
don't know what it's pointed at, or
                           how long the images are going to be stored."

                           The mostly unregulated recording takes place
with a tacit nod from the U.S.
                           Supreme Court, which has indicated again and
again that people have no
                           reasonable expectation of privacy in public
places.

                           Government agencies across the United States
are installing cameras in as
                           many public areas as possible, but they are
still behind the curve compared
                           with European cities, Ramos said.

                           In Los Angeles, surveillance devices
increasingly are used by government
                           to patrol public places. Several recently
installed cameras along Hollywood
                           Boulevard scan stretches popular with
tourists and criminals alike.

                           And, buoyed by the success of a surveillance
program at crime-plagued
                           MacArthur Park west of downtown, the LAPD
recently unveiled a camera
                           system capable of scanning thousands of
license plates per hour and
                           employing controversial facial-recognition
software to pinpoint known
                           criminals.

                           Once clunky and obtrusive, some surveillance
devices are now so small
                           they're nearly undetectable. And the days of
scratchy, black-and-white
                           images recorded on videotape are long gone.
Advances in technology
                           mean crystal-clear digital pictures that can
be reviewed in real time -- as
                           they occur.

                           "These are beautiful tools," said Ramos,
whose company sells 20 to 30
                           surveillance systems each month. "It's the
ability to be anywhere in the
                           world and see what's going on, and also
review what happened yesterday,
                           or last week, or last month."

                           Although the cameras raise the hackles of
privacy advocates, most people
                           don't mind being recorded everywhere they go,
said A. Michael Noll, a
                           communications professor at the University of
Southern California.

                           Graduate students polled about privacy issues
routinely rank surveillance
                           cameras nearly at the bottom of a long list
of concerns, he said.

                           "Most people just don't care about being on
camera," Noll said. "In Los
                           Angeles, they probably enjoy it. They
probably see it as a screen test."

                           Northridge resident Rochelle Matthews sees it
as an invasion of privacy.
                           The 37-year-old insurance agent said she
doesn't like being under constant
                           scrutiny.

                           "What are they looking for? I don't think
everything needs to be patrolled.
                           People need and deserve privacy."

                           Chatsworth resident Leanne Vince said she
doesn't mind being recorded
                           when she ventures out in public. Only
criminals need to worry about being
                           under surveillance, the 35-year-old music
company executive said.

                           "It doesn't bother me at all because I'm not
doing anything wrong," she
                           said. "If I'm at the grocery store and
they're following me, so what? It's
                           technology. You take the good with the bad."

                           But Weinstein cautioned that constant
surveillance can cause the shadow
                           of suspicion to fall on the innocent when
innocuous activities are
                           misinterpreted.

                           "A lot of people don't care, but they haven't
thought about it," he said.
                           "The dark side of this stuff isn't
discussed."

                           The benefits of surveillance cameras, such as
capturing Oklahoma City
                           bomber Timothy McVeigh on film just before he
picked up the rental truck
                           used in the bombing, far outweigh the privacy
concerns, Noll said.

                           And the concerns of those "screaming about
Big Brother" may be
                           overblown, Noll said.

                           "If someone were tracking me down the street,
I might care," he said. "But
                           there aren't enough people at the other end
to be watching all this
                           surveillance."

                           Armed with that knowledge, experts are now
developing software that
                           alerts authorities when certain types of
behavior are detected.

                           Weinstein cautioned that the practice of
recording people in nearly every
                           public place could escalate out of control.

                           "It's always a balancing act," he said. "It's
not to say you have a total
                           expectation of privacy in public places, but
there shouldn't be none.

                           "Unless we want to live in a pervasive
surveillance society where all of
                           your moves are tracked and recorded, we'd
better start putting rules in
                           place."
