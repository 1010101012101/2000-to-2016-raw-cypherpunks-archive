I am scheduled to moderate a panel on TCPA and Palladium at the upcoming
USENIX Security Conference this Wednesday in San Francisco.
Representatives of Microsoft's Palladium project and the EFF have
confirmed their participation.

See http://www.usenix.org/events/sec02/ for details.

The slides of the talk on TCPA that I gave over the weekend at DEFCON
are now available at http://www.cypherpunks.to

Hope to see you all at USENIX,
--Lucky
