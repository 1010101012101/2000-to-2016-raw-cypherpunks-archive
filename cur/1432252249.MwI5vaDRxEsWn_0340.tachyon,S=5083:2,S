That's a GREAT point about parole making it cheap to make something criminal.  I never thought of it that way before!

That being said, in a Libertarian society, I'd not mind parole, so long as the person voluntarily signed away the rights that were being disposed of in favor of physical freedom.  In a Libertarian society though, you'd see a DAMNED lot fewer things that are illegal.

I'm curious what types of felonies you've committed.  If they're nothing more than drug use and the like, I don't care.

Standard economic theory: making more people criminals doesn't cost much, and makes them more malleable. As so many people have said so pithily, "At the rate they're going, we'll _all_ be felons." And felons don't need no steenking constitutional rights.

: One of the biggest concerns Keith Henson had in his probable 6-month sentence in his case (which is another issue) is that he was likely to receive a 5-year probation term, during which his house could (and likely would) be entered at any time, day or night, and during which period his private files and records would be scrutinized for any thoughtcrimes which could be used to send him back for a longer period. (Which happened with both Bell and Parker.)
