You are right. Actual cases in which the bare-assed anti-paramilitary
training laws are applied are in short supply. Generally they are
associated with other infractions. Do note, however that there is a
consistent thread of discussing the speech and the act i.e. the
manual-based "training" regarding propane cylinders and the actual
posession of same. The separate items are not puniushable but together
seem to imply conspiracy to commit the act.

Sure, I mention it because despite its being non-functional and
unpunishable it seemed to have been brought into the courtroom with the
purpose of spicing up the case.

You are absolutely right.

Where I think you misread me is this : I don't think that the government
*has* this power, I think the way the laws are written and discussed,
this degree of power is something for which they reach.
