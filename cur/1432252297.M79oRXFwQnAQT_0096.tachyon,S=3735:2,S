This is just a guess but you'd be pretty likely to incur the wrath of
your owners if you started experimenting with effective solid fuels even
out in the middle of nowhere on your own property.

Just acquiring the raw materials would probably draw unwanted attention
and give the fascists enough grist to prove intent. Intent for whatever
they feel like charging you with, that is.

I think they want a monopoly on research and technology even remotely
related to warfare.
