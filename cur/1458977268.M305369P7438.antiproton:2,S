Yes, it is known that quantum computers will break at least most of today's
public key crypto (factoring, discrete logarithms) very efficiently.

Several years ago IBM tested this in practice with the toy experiment of
factoring 15.

Some cryptographers are preparing for the day when quantum computers
will come -- the buzzword is "post-quantum cryptography".

I am a newbie at this and suspect the full potential of quantum
computers is not currently known (AFAICT it is open if they will break SAT).
