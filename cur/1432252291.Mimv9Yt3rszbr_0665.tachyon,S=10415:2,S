button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine

high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 200,0OO

represents 
in excess of $52 milliOn USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.
