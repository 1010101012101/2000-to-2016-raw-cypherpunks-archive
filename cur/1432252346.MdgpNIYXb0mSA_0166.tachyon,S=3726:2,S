"Asked and answered."

Nearly 80 million people have already voted today, without incident.

That this woman Takikawaladan Shakiradon _claims_ to have been turned 
away at 10 a.m. has nothing to do with extending hours in St. Louis.

If in her crack haze she went to the wrong place, or had never 
registered at all, or was registered under the name she uses on her 
_other_ welfare claim, does anyone really think that she'll somehow 
be voting between when the polls _would have closed_ and whenever 
they eventually do?

Get real.
