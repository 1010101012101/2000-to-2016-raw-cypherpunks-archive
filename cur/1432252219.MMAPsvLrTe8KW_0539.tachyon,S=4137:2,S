Still, despite the slight irritation about drone killings, there
have been, AFAIK, no protests at the CIA HQ gates against
the agency's drone pilots, sensors and weapons launchers
located at temporary huts at both sides of spies' pig sty
dining hall.

Nor at the drone pilots, sensors and weapons launchers training
base at Indian Wells AFB, Nevada.

Nor at the homes of spy and mil drone operators, sensors and
weapons  launchers. (Apparently none have yet been doxed
although DoD droners have been named in news reports and
DoD PR media when medals are awarded.)

Nor at the contractors who build and staff drones, training and
deployment.

Nor at the homes of the USG three-branch members who
support the drone murders.

Nor at the several universities where students are trained to
operate drones in expectation of well-paying jobs in a booming
(no pun) industry. DoD recruits by touting the swell future for
droners trained by DoD for later civilian employment. As well
as touting the role of drone contractors (CIA does too but more
discreetly).

Nor any sabotage of drone systems. Oops, that criminal, don't
do it.

So it is not clear what opponents of drone kilings are willing
to do beyond risk-free bitching, strutting, mail bombing and
petitioning. All of which is a good start but not likely to have
much effect until opposition is well beyond verbal puking.

Does this remind of the way crypto is handled by deft verbal
puking about the industry while quietly working within it, hoping
the pukers will continue helping draw attention to the need for
a duplicitious practice to combat enemies of the industry.
