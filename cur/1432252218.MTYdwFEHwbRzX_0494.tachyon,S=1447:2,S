The FTC seems to think they can require (by force)
the disconnection of zombie PCs.  To cut spam.

If they assert the right to control what software runs
on net-connected machines, what is to stop them
from barring any other software?  After all,
P2P threatens the economy, anonymity and
encryption threatens the State.

Will no one think of the chiiildren?
