You might need a lawyer for that one.

As far as I can remember,
The court has a transcription
the defense has a copy and the DA gets one.

Nobody else can get a copy. This is not to
say you aren't legally afforded the right to one.
I just think you'll need a lawyer to get one.

Another subpoena was served on me today by Treasury 
Agent Tom Jack to appear at Jim Bell's trial on April 2, 2001
9:00 AM, in Tacoma, WA.

I have tried three times to get a transcript of my grand jury 
testimony: faxed letter to the Grand Jury Foreman and AUSA
Robb London January 27; a phone message left for Robb 
on February 12, and another faxed letter to Robb and the 
Foreman on February 20 with copy to Judge Tanner, 
presiding in Jim's case. No answer to any of the 3 requests
-- except today's subpoena dated February 21.
