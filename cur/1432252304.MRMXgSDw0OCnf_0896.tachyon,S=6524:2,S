    <font color=#900000>
    No-one likes the concept of the National-ID
    card... that's a given.  However, for all intensive
    purposes, we have had a national ID system for many
    years. A police officer, requesting your social security
    number, or using the driver's license to obtain the SSN
    as required for a license, can display everything about
    you down to credit, criminal, run-ins with child
    protective services, domestic altercations, arrests that
    did not result in convictions.... <p>

    What is the difference in the current ID system rather
    than a standardized national-ID card which contains
    biometric information which has the additional "benefit"
    of protecting you from identity theft? <p>

    However, implantable ID? that's "mark of the beast".<p>

    What I do object to is adding credit, criminal, CPS,
    religion, etc type data to the contents of the card
    --that should be on a need-to-know basis by those
    involved who will not he hindered either way --just
    establish ID beyond a doubt. <p>

    However, it is equally critical, if not more so, that
    they implement an alien identity card. Refusing to
    implement a National-ID card only benefits the aliens
    who survive quite nicely on fake ID. Biometric ID would
    be registered and identifiable --forgery would be
    impossible (or would be until you consider political
    graft). <p>

    Given the computer proliferation of personal data in the
    last 20 years, we were right on schedule for 1984 as it
    was.  If the data access is going to be out there, might
    as well do it correctly and establish who has right to
    access from the gate --and make it a three or
    four-tiered implementation: citizens, resident aliens,
    non-resident aliens, and visitors. <p>

    Sure, no-one wants ID, but we already have it, fakes and
    all; secondly, failure to produce ID currently means
    detention under the "John Doe" rules which technically
    means three hots and a cot until you can conclusively
    prove who you are --there is no requirement to grant
    bail. <p>

    At least Larry Ellison is beating the Evil Empire to
    the punch. <p>

    Aw, shit, why don't we just round up all the towel
    heads, liberals, and other troublemakers and get on with
    our lives? </font><p>
