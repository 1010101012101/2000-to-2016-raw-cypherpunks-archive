The reason why I have little faith in the Sectra Tiger is because I talked
with one of Sectra's head cryptographers. Below is a brief recap of the
conversation:

Lucky:	How did Secrta solve the key distribution problem in the military
version of your product adopted by the Swedish army?

Sectra:	We are using a central key server.

Lucky:	How does the system respond to a failure of the central key
server?

Secrta:	The hansets revert to a system-wide default key installed in the
handset at time of manufacture. The key is idential for all handsets.

Lucky: [Pause]. I see... Do you believe that a communication
system that depends for its security on the enemy ignoring your central
key server to be suitable for military applications? What if somebody
destroys the key server?

Secrta: [Visibly surprised by the question]. But we live in times of
peace! Why would anybody wish to destroy the key server?

Lucky:	Right..... [I guess they no longer shoot military
suppliers who's products endanger the armed forces for treason].
