Scary Psychological Test
Read this question, come up with an answer, and then scroll down to the
bottom for the result. This is not a trick question. It is as it reads. No
one I know has gotten it right - including me.

A woman, while at the funeral of her own mother, met this guy whom she did
not know. She thought this guy was amazing, She believed him to be her dream
and she fell in love with him right there but did not ask for his number and
no matter how hard she tried shecould not find him.

A few days later she killed her sister.

Question: What is her motive in killing her sister?



Give this some thought before you answer.

Answer:

She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again.

If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test
by a famous American Psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality
as a killer.

Many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question
correctly. If you didn't answer the question correctly - good for you.

If you got the answer correct, please let me know so I can take you off of
my email list unless that will tick you off, then I'll just be extra nice to
you from now on.
