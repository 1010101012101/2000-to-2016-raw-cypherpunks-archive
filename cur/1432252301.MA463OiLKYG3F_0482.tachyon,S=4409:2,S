DMITRY SKLYAROV: CHIPS SERVED FOR LUNCH IN AMERICAN JAIL

Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov is comparing the condition in American jails
with the building group or young warrior courses. "One can't intimidate us with
American jail!",- said Sklyarov.

>From the time of his arrest on July 16, 2001 the programmer managed to stay in
4 jails - in Las Vegas (Nevada), Oklahoma (Oklahoma), Santa Clair and finally
San Jose (California). In Sklyarov's words, the conditions of American
penitentiaries are similar to the works Sklyarov had to do in the building
group during his student summer holidays or they reminded young warrior courses
in the army. Sklyarov surely said he had to adjust himself like for example
breakfast in the San Jose jail was served at 4 a.m. in the morning, lunch - at
11 a.m. and dinner - at 5 p.m. For his lunch Dmitry had chips (14 grams), 2
pieces of bread with sausage, some other little things and something to drink.
"It is allowed to buy food with your own money if you have any", - Sklyarov
said. If you wish you can work in the jail getting 18 cents per hour, RIA
Novosti informed.

There were 60 people in the cell of the Las Vegas jail where Dmitry Sklyarov
was: the people on trial and those who will have to face the court in the
future. The people were sleeping on two-level bunks, the attitude between the
people was sympathetic and understanding. One of Sklyarovms cell-mates told him
the state was paying $300 daily for each person in jail.

Sklyarov is optimistic about the things that happened to him, he is still
hopeful he will soon see his family. The office of the Russian Consulate
General in San Francisco renders him some help in this respect. The session
devoted to Dmitry Sklyarovms pending case will take place August 23 in San
Jose. The courtms decision will show if the case is over or is going to
develop. Dmitry Sklyarov was released on bail with an obligation not to leave
the territory of North California until there is the final decision made on his
case. He visited the Russian Federation Consulate General in San Francisco on
Thursday. Sklyarov arrived at the office with 2 lawyers. They warned their
client to withhold any comments to the media until the court session takes
place August 23.
