Joseph's question is really important not even for me, as for person,
who just want to try to run multi-purpose "home server". I think it is
good idea for some bigger Documentation and HowTo project, too.

Eugen's idea to have .ovf packages for different purposes is relevant too=
=2E

Both ideas still need to be answered, and seems to me even propagated,
so let me add one more question: Is there some Propaganda/Documentation
Project/HowTo Wiki for this purpose?

One of interesting .ovf I have found is *Libert=C3=A9 Linux*:
http://dee.su/liberte
[seems to be kind of out-dated]

One of interesting "multi purpose, out of the box, home server" seems to
be this:

*arkOS: Building the anti-cloud (on a Raspberry Pi) - open source,
Raspberry Pi - Development - Techworld*
http://www.techworld.com.au/article/528273/arkos_building_anti-cloud_rasp=
berry_pi_/

Both projects seems to be worth to add human power to and more propaganda=
=2E

*Tails* https://tails.boum.org/ seems to be paranoid enough to not to
support .ovf, or em'I wrong?

BTW all of mentioned projects are good hint, what is trend on side of
services but list of services and tools is still more than welcome.

Btw2: On this wiki, I'm tiring to complete list of user side apps for
different platforms, so it could be helpful too:

I think we need more hidden services to make the darknet more attractive,=

less exits. The open Internet has been dead for a while, time to accept i=
t.

Running a non-exit relay from home is still worthwhile, since it raises t=
he=20
bar for physical access, and also increases the traffic background.

Decentral search is pretty important, we could really use lots of
YaCy nodes as hidden services -- indexing not just the hidden web, of
course.

I wish there was a library of different privacy-based appliances in
virtual formats (.ovf) which are kept up to date for easy deployment
(even though running it on bare iron would be preferable). That would
seem to be a lot of work, though, and run into trust issues.
