[I submitted this for posting on the Cryptography list, 
cryptography@metzdowd.com, but it has not yet appeared]

With the expiration of Chaum's key patents it was assumed that someone 
would step up an try their hand at launching a DBC-based financial 
service.  Some time has passed and I'm happy to announce that this has 
finally happened.  Taking a cue from the lively Digital Gold Currencies, 
eCache's first denomination if gold backed.  Unlike Digicash's instruments, 
eCache is using a mixing technique, rather than blinding, to help preserve 
unlinkability.  Its mint is located on a hidden server in TOR-land.  More 
information at: https://ffij33ewbnoeqnup.onion.meshmx.com/doc.php

Comments are invited about the technology and governance aspects that such 
financial services invoke.

Steve


PS: and Hettinga can comment about why their fees are too high :)
