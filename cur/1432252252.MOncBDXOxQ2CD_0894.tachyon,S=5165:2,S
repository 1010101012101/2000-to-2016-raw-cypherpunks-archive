hi,

eer..I think we need a defenition of an Rng & Prng
that every 1 should agree on.

would this help?

RNG & PRNG
----------------

1:>A RNG has an infinite period where as a PRNG has a
defenite period after which the sequence will repeat.
Atmospheric noise,Radiation decay are examples of
RNG's.(Difference)

2:>An RNG & PRNG should pass a series of radomness
tests. (Similarity)

3:>For the same set of input parameters,a RNG always
give a different output.
A PRNG always gives the same set of outputs for the
same input parameters (Difference) 


would any 1 also like 2 review

http://www.ircsuper.net/~neo/prng.html
thanx.

Regards Data.
