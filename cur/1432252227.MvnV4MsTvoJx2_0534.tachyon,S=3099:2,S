This following a near impeachment.

What happens if by the day the new president is to take his oath there is
still no clear winner? Even if the candidates get together and one is a
gracious loser, the trauma won't be lessened. There will be literaly no
faith in the president. What would Congress need to do in order to pass an
emergency resolution that would allow the current president to stay in
office until the issue is resolved. Could this be a new way to get a third
term? Would the vice-president (who serves when the president can't) then
be the next in line (assume the speaker of the house would be next if
memory serves)?

Any civil liberties group worth the name better get ready to go into high
gear. Voters and juries are going to be extremely critical of government
activity.

Expect to see a drop in law and government related employment below it's
current nadir.

This will probably distract the military from as many foreign involvements
as well. There will be no clear foreign policy. This could have
devastating effects for many of the high tension areas (e.g. China -
Taiwan). It will probably effect global terrorism as well. We'll also see
an increase in espionage as well. This could effect future crypto regs in
a negative way as well. Cyphers and paranoid politicians.
