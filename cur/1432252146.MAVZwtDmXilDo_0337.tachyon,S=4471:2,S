There are at least two more ideas that come to mind here.
The first would be to embed links in your spam messages which take you
sites that you have previously set up which contain a high amount of graphics.
You could then hide the data steganographically in those images. Of course
an automated tool of retrieval for those sites would be handy then as well
(say a browser plugin which scans images tries to extract data out of each
image and only accepts the extracted information if it has been signed with
a previously agreed on key -- i favour a browse plugin over a commandline
tool cause it would maybe look a little bit suss if somebody mirrored a
'become-a-millionaire-in-two-weeks'-website with wget or similar tools).
You might also want to have a look at MP3Stego, a tool which allows hiding
of information in MP3 files.
URL: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/steganography/mp3stego/
Sending someone a couple of megs of non-copyrighted mp3s (say bolivian
folklore) should not raise too much suspicion, or better yet, just mail him
links to some geocities account where he can download them instead of sending
them directly.
Any method for data transfer can be used for steganography -- just be creative.

Cheers,
-Ralf
