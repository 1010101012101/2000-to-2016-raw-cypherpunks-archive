Also:

>From the talk I got the impression, that attacks on iPhones always seem
to work. The slide from der Spiegel shows that this infection only works
via close access method and a remote infection path would be available in the
future (the slide is from 2008, but we don't know if this actually exists
now):

I guess the slide got accidentally chopped off in the talk or am I missing
something?

The UPD+RC6 story does not make sense to me, too (how could they know
about the encryption algorithm if they didn't dissect the actual bytes). I
also don't believe that current state of TLS would help much preventing
those redirection attacks.
