Yawn. Some things are not worth my time, and editing Choatisms is one
of those. Flaming him is slightly more rewarding, but ranks as
pleasures about as high as watching George W. Bush be inaugurated:
It's more interesting for the reaction than the substance.

Similarly, if Reese is the best intellect that the cypherpunks list
offers nowadays, not only is that a damnable shame, but a strong
indicator that it's time to leave. Guess I'm starting to sound like Tim.
