In this corner we have John Gilmore. He's a 49 year-old philanthropist who 
lives in San Francisco, California. Through a lot of hard work (and a 
little luck), John made his fortune as a programmer and entrepreneur in 
the software industry. Whereas most people in his position would have 
moved to a tropical island and lived a life of luxury, John chose to use 
his fortune to protect and defend the US Constitution. 

He's challenging the unconstitutionally evil stench of the Asscruftinator!

Who will win?  Place your bets, place your bets, the courtroom showdown
begins today:
