This is a very good point, but for one big glaring reason I disagree;
the costs of actually fabricating mining chips of your own design is a
capital-intensive process.

Plus, given that you're *designing equipment to print money* in effect,
you would only have a good reason to sell it if it wasn't worth the
price, right? Unless you're idealistic and good-natured.

The reason CPUs are great is because they already have market
saturation; anyone can go and buy a CPU tomorrow for as low a capital
input as you're likely to accomplish in this area. Not so for FPGAs or
ASICs.

I'll accept GPUs as a close-runner-up; although also available widely
like CPUs, they're harder to set up than just running an application on
your PC. I'm looking not at the profitability angle, remember, but the
anarchism angle. How can we make a 'coin where, if someone looks about
to accomplish dominance, we can all fire up the daemon and prevent it?
In bitcoin, that's not even remotely possible. Even if we all had the
cash, there's an ASIC bottleneck, and the relationship of
hash-power/cost isn't linear enough to permit us to collectively
overthrow a wealthier opponent. His =E2=82=AC10,000 gets better hardware th=
an 10
* =E2=82=AC1,000 does.

So yea, Litecoin's nearly there. Maybe we can make a CPU-hash, maybe
not. But at least we can make a hash that either guarantees GPU-only
for a few years, or one that's hardcoded to match Moore's Law so it'll
always stay ahead of the curve (bearing in mind Bunnie's plausible
suggestion that Moore's Law is levelling off:
