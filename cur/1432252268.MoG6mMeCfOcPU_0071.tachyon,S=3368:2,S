Not really.  My problem with spam is not so much the use of my 
network services sans permission as the use of my eyeballs and 
attention sans permission.  I could give a flying leap about 
how busy my router is (well, within its capacity anyhow) as 
long as I can read my email without being pestered by 
advertisements.
