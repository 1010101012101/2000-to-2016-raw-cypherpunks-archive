Yes. Also, human-generated traffic (the relevant part: which email you write,
which sites you browse) has an upper bound for each meat person. Even if one
doesn't have access to your ISP's logs this should be enough to identify (not
necessarily link to a specific fed-issued ID, though) almost
every person within a session.

I think it is safe to assume that every relevant traffic which is in clear is
being recorded, some or all of it forever.
