<br>
 Why consider C<diiv>HINA G</diiv>OLD CORP (C<font>GDC</font>)? Seee n0wadays what happened.<br>
<br>
 * Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.)<br>
<br>
* HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.<br>
<br>
 * China is the world's last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China's rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.<br>
<br>
 * China is already the world's 4th largest producer of gold - and will soon be the world's #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!<br>
<br>
 * Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.<br>
<br>
 You can see China's developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 0pp0rtunity for early investors!!<br>
