"Teller can not make change for bills over $20."
"Visa/MC minimum charge: $15"
"$30 fee for all wire transfers"

So, I don't agree with you that we have a payment system that works
for arbitrary amounts.  Silly laws aside, paying for a multi-million
dollar purchase with cash is irksomely difficult, because
multiple thousands of dollar bills are bulky.  (I'm assuming that
forgery is an important deterrent to having million dollar bills.  I
know I wouldn't want to accept one.)

I think that the Mojo guys are using un-blinded Chaumian-style cash.
