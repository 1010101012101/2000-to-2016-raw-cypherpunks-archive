                  When you log on to the FastTrack network, you are
routed by a FastTrack
                  server to what are called SuperNodes that contain
lists of user files you can
                  search, connect to, and download. Members
automatically host
                  SuperNodes on their PCs when needed -- and the number
of SuperNodes
                  grows and shrinks relative to demand. SuperNode
computers are clustered
                  by the thousands, so one search for a file may be
handled by a hundred PC
                  SuperNodes that intelligently rout and distribute
requests, according to
                  FastTrack chief executive Niklas Zennstrom.

                  Zennstrom says the number of users on its network has
been doubling each
                  month, from 200,000 in June to 440,000 today, even
higher than
                  Webnoize's estimates. According to FastTrack, one
million files were
                  downloaded from its network last week. It reports 3.5
million copies of its
                  software have been downloaded through its largest
customer, MusicCity.
