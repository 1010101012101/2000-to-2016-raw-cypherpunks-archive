The research shows that being AS-aware will reduce timing attacks (that
NSA, GCHQ and other well funded groups can support) from 58% chance of
exploitation, to 5.8% by strategically creating circuits with more
divergent AS owners. I wouldn't get hung up on Astoria itself as it's
mostly just a PoC for additional value to their grant writers and
university. The functions can be (relatively) easily integrated into Tor in
the future. I suspect there may be some expansion on the Tor circuit
building algorithm it uses. [1]

It's also a great summary of the new threat model based on some of the
recent disclosures. No longer academic threats, we now see examples of
timing attacks in the wild.
