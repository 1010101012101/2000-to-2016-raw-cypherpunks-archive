That sort of destroys the 'public' part of that doesn't it? This takes us
into the "if you've got a channel to send the code on how to decode the
public key, why not send the public key privately? And if the channel is
safe enough to send the key privately why not send the message itself?

There is also the point that if there is a public key and you claim it
valid then by assumption you're also claiming there is a private key.
