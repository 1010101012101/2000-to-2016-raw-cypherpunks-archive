Even the Evil Baathists had the sense and respect to keep the zoos and 
other institutions running.

Now that  the cowboys and good ole boys have taken over, it's target 
practice on civilians and shooting caged tigers.

And worse things. And we are paying an average of $3000 per year per 
taxpayer, charged to our collective credit cards of course, to pay for 
Dick Cheney's company to grow richer, for George Bush's oil interests 
to benefit, and for the creation of a state more inimical to American 
interests than anything a guy living in the mountains of Afghanistan 
could ever have imagined.

Which was probably the intent all along for those who support and 
benefit from the National Security State.

But, the other side of me is chortling. A clusterfuck which is 
unfolding nicely. Deaths of imperialist soldiers on a daily basis, 
thefts of the electoral process by their Democrap opponents back home, 
more unwinding of U.S. support, and the growing prospects for some true 
strikes at the heartland.

What's not to like? (Just steer clear of the major population centers 
which are pawns in this game.)

Me, I don't fly on Jet CIA Blue or Delta Delta Operations, or any other 
of the Big Brother-controlled airlines. (And now they are financially 
suffering and want citizen-unit taxes to bail them out...any airline 
which takes tax subsidies deserves to have its airplanes blown out of 
the sky....KA_BOOOOOOM.)

And I rarely leave Santa Cruz these days. And I keep my claymores in 
good shape and my perimeter alarms armed.

This fascist and communist nation has danced to the tune of the Mud 
People too long.
