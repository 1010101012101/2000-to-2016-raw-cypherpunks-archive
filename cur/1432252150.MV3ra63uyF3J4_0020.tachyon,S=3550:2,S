Back in the days of such companies as emutualfun.com and
stockgeneration.com there were cases where e-gold froze accounts
without waiting for court orders. I was involved with the discussion
on the e-gold mailing lists back then and it caused considerable hard
feeling among the users. E-gold was struggling to deal with the
onslaught of criminal activity (Ian Grigg described the prevailing
mood as one of 'angst') and they were thrown into a reactive mode.
Eventually I think they got their house in order and established
policies that were more reasonable.

Yes, but unfortunately it is not clear at all that courts would find
the opposite, either. If a lawsuit names the currency issuer as a
defendant, which it almost certainly would, a judge might order the
issuer's finances frozen or impose other measures which would impair
its business survival while trying to sort out who is at fault. It
would take someone with real cojones to go forward with a business
venture of this type in such uncharted waters.
