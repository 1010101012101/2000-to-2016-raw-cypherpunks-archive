Philosophy major here, and you are a gentleman and a scholar.

For a while now I have been pondering the idea of "fuck that, can't sav=
e the=20
world, just let proles get all the shit they are bound to get, and let =
us=20
techie kind just dance between the raindrops as we know how".

So far the realisation that the same can be pondered from (for example)=
 a=20
medical professional's perspective (i.e. "fuck that, the proles will ne=
ver=20
learn, I'll just wash my hands and not bother myself with their well-be=
ing"),=20
and that in that case I would be the prole, was enough to keep me on my=
=20
altruistic path.

Not to mention that the more and better people are educated, the better=
 we're=20
all off (as it's harder for politicos to paint us techies/hackers as=20=

criminals).

Using the stated tactic against politicos (OHAI, Mr Censormoron...) wou=
ld be=20
something I am sure some of the less peacefully inclined could indeed f=
ind=20
interesting, I guess. *cough*
