For people who are interested in such technologies, I recommend looking at
Pond:

https://pond.imperialviolet.org/

It is written by Adam Langley, so it comes with some serious credentials
behind it. It provides asynchronous email-like messaging that's forward
secure, resistant to traffic analysis and the whole thing runs over Tor.
Messages are stored for a week and are strictly limited in size. There's no
spam because nobody has an address - instead you have to grant someone the
ability to message you by giving them a small file. So, not really intended
as an email competitor convenience wise, but it has many interesting ideas
and a reasonable GUI.

As a testament to the seriousness with which Pond takes forward security,
it can use the NVRAM in a TPM chip to reliably destroy keys for data that
an SSD device might have otherwise made un-erasable.

The main downside - it's written in Go :)

Get your SQL database under version control now!
Version control is standard for application code, but databases havent 
caught up. So what steps can you take to put your SQL databases under 
version control? Why should you start doing it? Read more to find out.
