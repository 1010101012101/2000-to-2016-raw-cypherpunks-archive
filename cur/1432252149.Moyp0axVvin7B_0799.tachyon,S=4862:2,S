I'm actually surprised to see Steve launch into a critique of laissez-faire 
capitalism here on cypherpunks, of all places. One can admit that 
globalization has ill effects (mostly, bricks through windows of Starbucks 
thrown by bored, upper-middle-class, college-age protesters), certainly. 
But when responding to claims that factory workers in poorer countries are 
only being paid $2/hour or whatnot, it makes sense to ask: Is this worse 
than their other alternatives, like mud huts in villages?

To argue against people voluntarily entering into market-based transactions 
with each other is so a-economical and contrary to cypherpunk philosophies* 
-- wlel, I just don't think it's worth taking the time to go any further in 
a response.

-Declan

* = To the extent that there are any cypherpunk philosophies, of course.
