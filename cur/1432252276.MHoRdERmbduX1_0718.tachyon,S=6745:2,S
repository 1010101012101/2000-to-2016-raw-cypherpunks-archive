Cryptography Research Expands Into Europe
Wednesday November 10, 8:09 am ET

Industry Veteran Ken Warren Takes Reins as Smart Card Business Manager

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Recognizing the strategic
significance of Europe in driving the deployment of smart cards,
Cryptography Research, Inc. today announced it has set up operations in the
United Kingdom to provide enhanced support for European licensees of its
recently launched DPA Countermeasures Licensing Program. Cryptography
Research also announced the appointment of smart card industry veteran Ken
Warren to head up the effort as smart card business manager. Warren will
ensure European customers can successfully implement CRI's patented
countermeasures, and he will actively represent CRI in all European smart
card industry activities.

Although the smart card market is becoming increasingly global, the
majority of the industry leaders have their headquarters, R&D facilities
and design centers in Europe. By establishing representation in Europe,
Cryptography research is again demonstrating its commitment to the smart
card industry and to providing the necessary support to improve the
security of smart card devices. In his position as smart card business
manager, Ken Warren brings a wealth of industry expertise, and CRI's
European customers will be able to benefit from his support at the local
level.

"With Ken Warren leading our European expansion, Cryptography Research has
achieved a new milestone in its quest to reduce fraud and piracy in the
smart card industry through effective DPA countermeasures," said Paul
Kocher, president of Cryptography Research. "Europe is key to building on
the early success of our DPA Countermeasures Licensing Program, and we are
fortunate to have someone of Ken's stature at the helm and to represent us
to the leaders in the smart card industry."

Ken Warren has extensive experience in the smart card industry, having
worked in a variety of roles for more than 12 years. Before joining CRI,
Ken was group marketing manager at Renesas Technology Europe Ltd, the
world's number-one supplier of microcontrollers and a leader in security IC
products. Prior to that, Ken was smart card business development manager
for Hitachi Europe Ltd. Ken has also held positions at NatWest Bank and
Mondex International where he was responsible for IC security.

"CRI has taken the lead in developing the technologies necessary for
cryptographic device manufacturers, smart card vendors and smart card
issuers to produce more secure, DPA-resistant products, and now we are
bringing them directly to the major industry players in Europe," said Ken
Warren. "I look forward to working with Kit Rodgers, director of licensing,
and the others at CRI, and to supporting the smart card industry in its
efforts to prevent DPA attacks and reduce fraud and piracy."

Differential Power Analysis and related attacks were first discovered at
Cryptography Research by Paul Kocher, Joshua Jaffe and Benjamin Jun. DPA
involves monitoring the fluctuating electrical power consumption of smart
cards and other secure cryptographic devices and applying advanced
statistical methods to extract secret keys and other information. An
attacker who successfully employs DPA can create fraudulent transactions,
generate counterfeit digital cash, or receive unauthorized access to
digital content.

Cryptography Research's DPA-related patents provide the basis for
implementing effective DPA countermeasures in smart cards and other
devices, and a license is required to make, use or sell any DPA-resistant
product. Organizations that join the Cryptography Research DPA
Countermeasures Licensing Program receive priority access to Cryptography
Research's experienced technical staff and research team. Licensees also
gain the right to display the "DPA lock" logo on qualifying products.
Early-adopter terms are being offered for a limited time to provide
competitive advantages to early licensees, including superior pricing and
forgiveness for infringement of CRI's countermeasure patents in
already-deployed products with DPA countermeasures.
