Sorry, I'm not proposing a law, certainly not on this list.
Rather a voluntary concordance for reputation building,
not only in citizen-world but in government-world.

There has been a lot of good discussion about this
here in the past and I'm not going against that wisdom.

Greg is tracking that in one of his posts, and Declan
too if the focus on law is shifted to reputation. How
to build reputable products for privacy protection and
how to keep them trustworthy. Use of these by
officials to invade privacy will surely diminish the 
products. The capability of the intrusive products 
should extend to public warnings of likely abuses 
by whomever, but by officials most so.

Nothing unusual about that unless you want government
customers. And who doesn't after age 30. So, again,
daredeviling products are for those who have nothing 
to lose. You making profit, handsome profits, you won't
give them up for principle, right. That's okay, we are all
subject to enlightened self-interest, the same force
that leads officials to spy on us and criminalize
us doing it to them.

I foresee criminalizing anonymizers for us not them.
Their laws not ours. Ours is to . . . concord in sweet
harmony, as here we do -- until some mean son of
a bitch subs up to discord.
