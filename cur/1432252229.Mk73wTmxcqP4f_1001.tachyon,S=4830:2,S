I posted this quote, along with your comments, at another list.

I received this, in reply:

    http://abbc.com/aaargh/fran/chomsky/cassandra.html
    --a 1985 essay by Christopher Hitchens defending
    Chomsky against such charges.

As I've said, I'm not a Chomsky hater, nor am I a Chomsky admirer.  I've
heard the name on this list, but have not yet investigated him.  I've read
the page the url above leads to and must say, it makes more sense to me
than do your philippics.  It gives better attributions at first blush.  It
dissects whines such as yours and sends them to the oven, where they can
be properly roasted with flesh-searing heat, the better to reduce the
fatty content.  I shall not bother to read your paranoid posts from this
day, forward.

Go away.

Reese
