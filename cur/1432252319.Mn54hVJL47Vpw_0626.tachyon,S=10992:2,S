Micro$not, hoping that QuadRuple/NoScruple Felons who have been =
Convicted of sending !!!DEATH THREATS!!! to ABillionaire2BeNamedLater =
might be diverted from their past fixations by being provided with =
*Fresh Victims*, have included Spying&OR&Stalking Features in their =
OutLook eMail SnoopWare.

ForNoApparentReason, I seem to be getting Return Receipts from my eMail =
messages, INFORMing me who is reading the messages I send, who is =
deleting them, and RoadMaps to their Homes and WorkPlaces...
(OK, I just made the last part up, eh?)

Thus I am INFORMed,

I was also INFORMed,
This is a Return Receipt for the mail that you sent to
bwphilli@cisco.com.
piolenc@mozcom.com.
Note: this Return Receipt only acknowledges that the message was
displayed on the recipient's machine. There is no guarantee that the
content has been read or understood.
so that if they ever GetInMyFace, I can reply, "Hey! You're so =
FuckingSTUPID that your own computer doubts whether you can even read, =
or understand diddly, even if you can read..."

And an AutoResponse Return Receipt INFORMs me,

Will return on 10/11.  Check with Kevin Deeley if you need an immediate =
response
so that if I suddenly get the Irresistable Urge to [Imaging *Your* =
WorstNighMare Here], I know that I will either have to wait for Martin's =
return date, or [I*Y*WNH] Kevin...

OfCourseOfCourse [TM], this SpyStalk Feature of Micro$not'S eMail =
product will provide PerseProseCuting Attorneys with ValuableEvidence in =
Court Cases where RealEvidence is lacking, but this is of little import =
in light of the fact that CyberStalking Laws will no doubt soon be in =
place that make sending or receiving email a Federal Crime.
(Don't worry, I'm sure they'll only prosecute the *BAD* guys, eh?)
