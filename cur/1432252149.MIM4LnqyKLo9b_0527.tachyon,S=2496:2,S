Uh...huh? Dunno. I think the Java Linux was able to run some software like 
spreadsheets and whatnot.

Uh...OK. But you can you repeat the part about the things, or thing?

Sorry. Me no speaky linux. Me ex-telecom geek. Ask me about RZ-encoded 
solitonic transmission and maybe I'll sound smarter.

On the other hand, it occurs to me one does not necessarily need Linux on 
top of Java at all.

How secure would it be to have a Tor client run on top of Java directly?

This way, no matter what computer one were on, it should be fairly easily to 
pull down the "portable cone of silence" from a site somewhere and start 
doing your business.
