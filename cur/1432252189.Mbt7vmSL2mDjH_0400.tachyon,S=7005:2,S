#2 - Doesn't look so bad - she can produce all physical copies and still
get access to her safe site. Safe is pretty generic, meaning possibly
out of the jurisdiction, out of her control and visible to herself and
possibly others as plaintext or otherwise. Not sure how it is possible
to hassle her if she produces all physical copies as ordered but has
taken steps to maintain future accessibility for her own purposes.
Pardon me for being sloppy about "safe site".

If the motherfuckers want all of the copies they can achieve that goal
assymptotically by downloading the data repeatedly. Disks are cheap.

#3 - not entirely unlike #2 really - the data is out of her control.
Only difference I can see is that there is a record of a transfer with a
date prior to the subpoena. 

#2 admits of this same solution if blocks of data are mailed to some
safe location on a regular basis. I don't see why some official type of
escrow is required as long as the unsquelchable distribution predates
the subpoena. 

BTW - would a subpoena such as the one served on the journalist specify
that the contents of the records were not to be communicated to anyone?

Not a particularly useful answer and not necessarily justifiable on the
part of the court. I think eventually a better answer would have to be
produced, one that justified the censorship. We're back to what
originally struck me as odd, and wrong, about this item. Whoever has her
stuff should copy it and move the copy offshore because something is
very wrong on the part of the court.
