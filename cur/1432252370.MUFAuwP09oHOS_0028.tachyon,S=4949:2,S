That's my read.

Several press articles mentioned the GBU-28, and Rumsfeld mentioned it
(or was asked about it) specifically in a press conference Wednesday or
Thursday (NPR's on continuous-feed mode here).  The only reference I saw
to the B62-11 specific to the current conflict was a Wired article "Nuke
'Em From On High"

    http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,47319,00.html
The device itself is nuclear (not merely a d-u casing, in fact I don't
see d-u mentioned at all), with yields from 300T - 300KT, in a focussed
charge.

Peace.
