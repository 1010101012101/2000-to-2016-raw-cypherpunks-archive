	Yes. But how easy it is for your or my local government to get
	logs from an ISP in a different country? There isn't a single
	answer, but I suspect in general it's not that easy. So unless
	we are a relatively serious 'criminal' 'threat', we should be
	safe, I'd think.

	And if the aim is to avoid surveillance from one's local ISP,
	then the bar is low since ISPs don't have police powers...yet.

	True. So it would seem as if tor would be effective against
	adversaries in some particular cases...

	But the fact remains. Against 'small' adversaries tor isn't
	needed and against big adversaries tor doesn't work...

	Yes, cost would be a problem. But it's not that tor is free
	either. Somebody else is paying the bill.
	
	On the other hand, tor is a subsidized state project. Like any
	 state project the quality is limited AND it drives off
	 'private' investment and development.

	I think there's a C++ implementation now as well.

	Just in case, please don't think that I subscribe to the "I've
	nothing to hide" bullshit or something like that. I'd love to
	use a really robust darknet. But since I don't think the current
	darknets are to be trusted I'm doing without them, at least for
	the time being...

	They are, if they use tor! OK, bad joke on my part.
