I wonder what American Express, VISA (and Plus), MasterCard (and Cirrus),
Diner's Club, NASDAQ, Autex, Telerate, and even Quotron -- not to mention
CRESTCo, DTC, and SWIFT -- would have had to say about *that*?

*This* should be fun...

AT&T Files Patent Infringement Suit Against PayPal, Inc., and eBay, Inc.
 


AT&T Corp. today filed a patent infringement suit against PayPal, Inc. and
eBay, Inc., in federal district court in Delaware.

AT&T alleges that, through the use of their online payment systems, PayPal
and eBay have infringed AT&T's U.S. patent that covers transactions in
which a trusted intermediary securely processes payments over a
communications system such as the Internet. The use of a trusted
intermediary ensures that one party will not have to disclose sensitive
information, such as a credit card number or bank account number, to the
other party to the transaction. AT&T's lawsuit seeks compensation for
PayPal's and eBay's unauthorized use of the patented technology.

More than a year ago AT&T notified both PayPal and eBay that they were
using technology covered by AT&T's patent in the PayPal and BillPoint
payment systems. AT&T offered to license the patented technology to each of
the companies.

AT&T has attempted to reach an amicable agreement regarding this matter
with eBay and PayPal. AT&T has invested hundreds of millions of dollars
every year in research and development, and the company seeks to protect
its inventions by licensing its patents to those who use its intellectual
property. Because the two companies have refused to pay for a license to
use the patented technology, AT&T has been forced to bring the matter to
the court.

AT&T's patent was originally filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office in 1991. In July of 1994, the Patent and Trademark Office granted
AT&T U.S. Patent No. 5,329,589 for its invention.
