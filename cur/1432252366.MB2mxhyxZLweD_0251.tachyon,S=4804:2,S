Dear Friend, I saw that you unsubscribed from the anti-immigration email list. 

I am the moderator of this group. Please Read the Census Burea statistics at the bottom of this email. 

Would you please take a moment and write me and tell me why you unsubscribed and tell me how I can, could or should improve the anti_immigration email list. I want to thank you in advance for helping me make this email list more pleasing to more people by offering your suggestions. 

You may write me at BobfromMichigan74@hotmail.com 

Friend, you and I corresponded many times in the past. However, I have switched ISP's and email addresses several times and you may not recognize me. The last time we corresponded I do not remember if I was using AOL or another ISP. If you wish to be removed from my anti-immigration email list just let me know and it will be immediately done? 

I purposely moderate this list to keep the volume of emails very low. The anti-immigration email list only generates perhaps one or two emails per day on average. 

Peace be unto you, Bob from Michigan, The Moderator of this email list. 

PS - It would make me very happy if you would re-subscribe and rejoin the email list.  Please write me at BobfromMichigan74@Hotmail.com 

ATTN: VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOLLOWS BELOW - PLEASE READ THIS AND SEND IT TO YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

The following information comes from the Census Bureau 
http://www.census.gov/ 
http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0029/tab04.html 
http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0029/tab03.html 

Legal Immigration - Total numbers for each decade is listed as follows
1990 – 19,767,316 
1980 – 14,079,906 
1970 – 9,619,302 
1960 – 9,738,091 

FRIENDS - PLEASE NOTE THAT OVER 45 MILLION LEGAL (YES I SAID “LEGAL”) IMMIGRANTS HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY SINCE 1970. 

ADD TO THE 45 MILLION LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ANOTHER 15 TO 30 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF 60 TO 75 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO WERE BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. 

EVEN AN IDIOT CAN SEE THAT THE VERY COMPOSITION OF AMERICA IS BEING INTENTIONALLY CHANGED BY THE IMMIGRATION POLICY OF OUR GOVERNMENT. 

GOD HELP US IF WE DO NOT STOP THIS NOW!!!

I am going to miss you... please come back soon. Bob, Moderator of anti_immigration email list. 

Sincerely Yours, Bob from Michigan.
