Pgp Corporation Announces That U.K. Borough Council has Selected Pgp Universal

"PA"


 Business Editors/Technology Writers

 PALO ALTO, Calif. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Oct. 28, 2004 - Bournemouth will use
award-winning encryption solution to secure email communications and help
comply with regulations

 PGP Corporation, a global leader in enterprise encryption

 solutions, today announced that the Bournemouth Borough Council in Dorset,
U.K., has selected PGP(R) Universal to secure electronic communications
containing personal information between the Council and its residents,
merchants, and other government agencies.

 "A great deal of the information held by the Council is private, including
personal and health information, data about schools and students, and tax
and voting records," said Fred Baert, Bournemouth's Information
Communication Technology (ICT) Security Officer. "The 1998 Data Protection
Act and the Freedom of Information Act both require the Council to ensure
the security of electronic communications, and the Council's own security
policy states that confidential information must be encrypted. PGP
Corporation is the market leader in encryption, so choosing a PGP solution
seemed like the right thing to do."

 "Regulatory mandates and societal concerns continue to pressure all types
of organizations to secure confidential information in electronic
communications," said Phillip Dunkelberger, president and CEO for PGP
Corporation. "We are pleased the Bournemouth Borough Council chose PGP
Universal to help comply with requirements for encrypting private data
transmitted via email."
