    Arabs with wet feet? --no, actually pragmatic. Now that
    22 days have elapsed, the mullahs have had time to stir
    the people and threaten the collection of kings,
    princes, sheiks, dictators, etc. who rule their
    countries without popular consent and try to keep a lid
    on their own fundamentalists. <p>

    This is the precise reason why, by the strategy of any
    war planner, you strike when they are least prepared for
    it --several hours after the attack, even the Arabs were
    numb. Our military planners must learn to understand
    --and accept-- that we are facing a cultural war. <p>

    Revenge may be part of the decision, but there is no
    point in blanket revenge.  This is a strategy game and
    there is no time for idealistic ramblings that the US
    and the free world should be investigating the causes of
    terror, or the determination of the fundamentalists to
    destroy the non-fundamentalist world --it's a stone cold
    fact, it's war, and the name of the game in war is to
    win. Finishing second only counts in horse races. <p>

    Churchill put it clearly: <p></font><blockquote>

      If you will not fight for right when you can easily
      win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your
      victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to
      the moment when you will have to fight with all the
      odds against you and only a precarious chance of
      survival.  <br>

      "There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when
      there is no hope of victory, because it is better to
      perish than to live as slaves."  <table><tr><td width=48><br></td><td>
    	--Winston Churchill </td></tr></table></blockquote>


    <font color=#900000>Churchill also said: <p></font><blockquote>

      "Politics are almost as exciting as war and quite as
      dangerous.  <br>
      In war, you can only be killed once, but in politics many times." <table><tr><td width=48><br></td><td>
    	--Winston Churchill </td></tr></table></blockquote>

    <font color=#900000> which has a double meaning: if you
    fail to have the courage of your convictions, the body
    politic which you represent may be killed in the ensuing
    war on the enemy's terms, not your terms. <p>

    This is not a war against an "enemy"; this is a conflict
    between civilizations and the decisions made need to
    reflect that reality. <p>

    This is not the time for collective action from a
    coalition which is, at best, giving lip service to
    Washington solely to avoid being on the wrong side of
    Bush's statement to the effect: ...'either you are with
    us, or against us...' <p>

    The US must be willing to go it alone; the US is the
    target since the collapse of the US accomplishes the
    objectives of the fundamentalists: the collapse of the
    free world. The fundamentalists do not care if the world
    is plunged into poverty and darkness --their stated
    intention is to set the clock back 1300 years as they
    ban radios, TVs, movies, the internet, etc. --not to
    mention the treatment of women --worse than chattel
    slaves. <p>

    We, the United States, are fighting for our survival;
    the Brits will probably hang in there with us as they
    seem to recognize the imperative nature of survival
    --even the Queen sang the Star Spangled Banner in
    St. Paul's Cathedral (that must have been really
    impressive since St Paul's has a massive, thundering
    organ); and, the day before, the Queen ordered the Star
    Spangled Banner played at the changing of the [palace]
    Guard. <p>

    Let's not let a few weak-kneed client governments get
    in the way of our unfinished business.

    Times [This Is London] <p>

    <center><font size=+1><b>US 'called off first attacks'</b></font> <br>
    by Jeremy Campbell in Washington <p></center>

    The United States and Britain yesterday called off
    military strikes against terrorist targets in
    Afghanistan at the last minute. <p>

    Washington officials say today that a severe attack of
    last-minute cold feet by some key Arab members of the
    coalition caused President Bush to postpone the
    operation. <p>

    The waverers are Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Oman, and
    US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is embarking on an
    urgent mission today to strengthen nerves in these
    countries. <p>

    Prime Minister Tony Blair is also about to undertake a
    hasty visit to the region. Saudi Arabia's support is
    especially vital, because Allied aircraft and commanders
    need its base facilities. <p>

    Two senior US officials have told reporters that until
    yesterday the Saudis were firm in their offer to provide
    assistance for strikes, including use of a
    state-of-the-art command centre at the Prince Royal
    Sultan Air Force Base. <p>

    Then the situation changed. One US official told Knight
    Newspapers: "That is no longer true. We fear there is
    something deeper here." <p>

    Mr Rumsfeld's trip to the Middle East is intended to
    mend these unexpected ruptures. <p>

    Downing Street, meanwhile, confirmed Mr Blair will be
    departing on a mission tomorrow but refused, on security
    grounds, to be drawn on any of the detail. Amid clear
    unease over the advance leaks of the trip, a spokesman
    dismissed all reports as "speculation&icirc; maintaining that
    some of the suggested calling points for the Prime
    Minister were simply wrong. <p>

    Mr Rumsfeld's tour, which includes Saudi Arabia, Oman,
    Egypt and Uzbekistan, is being compared to the
    stage-setting trip made by Dick Cheney, then Defence
    Secretary, to the Gulf just before the start of Desert
    Storm. <p>

    This time there is more at stake.  Near the top of Mr
    Rumsfeld's list of priorities is to talk his way to an
    agreement with Uzbekistan, on the northern border of
    Afghanistan, to use the country as a staging area for
    the attack. <p>

    Uzbekistan is now regarded as a potential key asset in
    the coming showdown, but is rated the coalition's single
    most fragile link. <p>

    Highly attractive to the US are the number of abandoned
    air bases there, once used by the Soviet Union. <p>

    This will be Mr Rumsfeld's first face-to-face meeting
    with the ruling regime there. It has demanded that the
    US negotiate a complete Status of Forces Agreement
    before it will permit the use of its military bases - an
    unrealistic condition which could be tangled up in legal
    knots for years. <p>

    The trip, undertaken at the request of President Bush,
    is expected to last three days. <p>

    Oman, also skittish, is regarded as an important support
    base for a ground incursion. US special operations
    forces can be flown there and then put on amphibious
    invasion ships. <p>

    US officials are not sure whether this is a case of
    lastminute jitters, or "something more serious". <p>

    One notable omission on Mr Rumsfeld's itinerary is
    Pakistan.  "The last thing Pakistan needs is a high
    profile visit by a US Secretary of Defence," said a
    Pentagon official. <p>

    The country is contending with ferocious anti-American
    demonstrations, with Mr Bush burned in effigy and hordes
    shouting: "Death to America! Let Americans come here to
    be buried!" <p>

    Washington officials advised reporters not to assume
    military action was only hours away. They stressed that
    Mr Bush will act only when he is convinced, by Mr
    Rumsfeld and others, that "all the pieces are in
    place". Such action will come "at various stages and
    times", they said. The President himself told reporters
    there is "no calendar" for the start of hostilities. <p>
