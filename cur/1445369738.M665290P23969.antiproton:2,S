	Come on Sean. Your previous comments about bitcoin were

	So you're saying fukerberg is going to protect the hayrabs form
	his own nazi-amercunt-zionist goverment? You should stop

	Poor little Sean. I said nothing about 'growth'. That's a
	distraction you just introduced.

	To sum up : The evil foreign (non 'american') governments
	attack facebook users. And now, CAPTAIN FACEBOOK will protect
	them. 
	
	I hope you enjoy your	six packs of kool aid.
