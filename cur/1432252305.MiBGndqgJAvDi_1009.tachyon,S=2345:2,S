FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Hackers Track Visitors to New York City

New York, NY - May 15, 2008 - This summer, hackers from around the world 
will track the movements of thousands of visitors to New York City.

As part of a social experiment, attendees at a hacker conference in July 
will be issued badges with electronic tracking devices.  Large displays 
will show in real-time where people go, with whom they associate, for how 
long and how often.

The tracking technology, known as RFID, is fast becoming an unseen part of 
everyday life.  This July, for the very first time, the general public will 
be able to participate in the transparent operation of a major RFID 
tracking program.

Conference attendees will participate in games built around the tracking 
system.  Players will seek ways to protect their privacy, find 
vulnerabilities in the tracking system, employ data mining techniques to 
learn more about other participants, and choose how much personal 
information they will disclose in order to play.

This demonstration will be open to the public at The Last HOPE conference 
from July 18-20 at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The first 1500 
preregistrants will be guaranteed an RFID badge enabling them to 
participate in the game.  More information and preregistration is available 
at http://www.hope.net/.
