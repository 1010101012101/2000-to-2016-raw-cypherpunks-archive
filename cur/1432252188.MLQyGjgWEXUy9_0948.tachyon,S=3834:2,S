>This list is no stranger to Tim May's sarcasm and anti-semitic rants.

	He's bashing a completely facist and dictatorial country of 
which a sizeable number of citizens are completely willing to commit 
genocide of the very same kind that was once waged against them.

	I cannot recall seeing him bash *jews*, rather he bashes Isreal.

	As they deserve.

Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
