Where we have historical record, this is not the case.  Romulus
was made King in order that the Romans could abduct and rape
women.  William the bastard became William the conqueror by
stealing land and enserfing people.

After George Washington defeated the British, his next
operation was to crush the Whisky rebellion.   You could say
that he defeated the British in order to protect property
rights, but his next military operation was to violate property
rights, not uphold them.
