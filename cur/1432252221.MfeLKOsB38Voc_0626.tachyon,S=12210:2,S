> Order becomes a shop traveler/work order, with each

> traveler/work order contains a "notes" section.  The
> Shop traveler/work order allows for the storing or
> attachment of drawings to the traveler/work order.

> of production sequence, and re numbers them if new

> traveler/work order number; i.e., 100, 100-1, 100-2,
> etc.  All shop traveler/work orders and related
> revisions are retained in memory for future
> reference.  The shop traveler/work order is bar
> coded for tracking of production step by step, and
> production of ongoing client status reports.  Bar
> coding includes the ability for an employee to
> "swipe" their own ID bar code for recording in the
> system as to who upgraded what step.  The shop
> traveler/work order function also allows for manual
> update of production status.  The shop traveler/work
> order allows for quality control sign off, and the
> final production of certifications, either from a
> "canned" list, or hand typed in on a case by case
> basis.
> 
> 5. INVENTORY.  The application includes an inventory
> section, which allows operations to check materials
> inventory in and out.  The inventory section allows
> for the comparison of inventory received against a
> P.O., and produces an "overage/underage" report of
> inventory received as compared against the P.O.  The
> inventory section allows for the setting of minimum
> (re-order now!) and maximum inventory amounts, and
> produces reports showing what inventory needs to be
> ordered, as well as inventory that is at or above
> the maximum set to have in house.   The inventory
> section also tracks "partially shipped" orders,
> which are tied in to the shipping function.  This
> section shows how much completed product under a
> particular order has been actually shipped to a
> client, and how much remains to be shipped.  The
> balance is adjusted as shipments are made.
> 
> 6. REQUEST FOR PURCHASE.  The application allows
> operators to produce a Request For Purchase for
> accounting for any inventory items, which need to be
> ordered.  Inventory items have a drop down of
> approved vendors for each item.
> 
> 7. REQUEST FOR BID.   The application allows

> items, which need to be ordered.  Inventory items
> have a drop down of approved vendors for each item

> 
> 8. INVOICE.  The application produces an
> invoice/invoice detail for all completed items ready
> to be billed/shipped to clients.
> 
> 9. PRODUCTION OUTPUT STATUS.  The application
> produces a date range selectable report on how much
> product, and the value of the product, which was
> completed during a selected date range.  The
> application also produces a report on how many
> orders, and the value of those orders, which remain
> to be completed during a selected date range.
> 
> 10. The application produces SHIPPING DOCUMENTS as
> per selected shippers, and produces a PACKING SLIP.
> 
> 11. The application has a "FIND" FUNCTION in
> selected sections, allowing for searches by customer
> name, work order number, etc.
> 
> 12. The application has "AUTO FILL;" i.e., when an
> operator starts to type in a name, number, etc. all
> related information auto fills after the first few
> letters or numbers are typed in.
> 
> Job Master is currently being sold in the
> marketplace for $2,495.00 per package.  However, if
