This is incorrect.  The black panthers were torn apart because they murdered dissidents, and "dissidents" came to include anyone who wondered if Newton was snorting too much of the Black Panther funds.

The same is true to a greater or lesser extent of most of the other communist armed communist organizations.  The first target of those arms was always themselves, to a greater or lesser extent, though this was most dramatic and bloody in the case of the Black Panthers.
