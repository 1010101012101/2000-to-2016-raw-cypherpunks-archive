Also imesh (http://www.imesh.com) seems to work ok.

No details of how it works, but it has a reasonable selection
of music (and porn videos by the look of it) and is faster
than gnutella.

I guess a big thing going for distributed file sharing is the
interest level.  These napster a-like people (imesh) claim to
have 4 million users.

If they get closed down next there are lots of others.  I
figure the thought police have lost already.
