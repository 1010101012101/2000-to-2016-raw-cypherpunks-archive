Dear Friend 

I am Mr. Michael Heinz, Chief Accountant and also 
Chairman of Investigating and Auditing Department of 
WUESTENROT GERMANY. Wuestenrot Bank is  solely 
an investment bank. 
With due respect and regard, I have decided 
to contact you on a Business Transaction that will be 
very beneficial to both of us and also create room for 
future business relationships. 

During our Investigation and Auditing in this Bank, I 
came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one 
Deceased Mr. Morris Thompson 61 years ( at time of death), 
of Fairbanks, Alaska America who died on January 31st 2000 
with Alaska Airlines Flight 261, You can as well confirm it 
by yourself through under stated Website of the incident, http://www.cnn.c=
om/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ 

As the fund has been dormant in his account with this 
Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody 
either from his family or relations. We started making 
inquiries and on the course of the enquries, we learnt of 
the tragedy and besides, he did not indicate any next of kin to 
his account incase of missfortune or death. 

We are to keep these informations secret within ourselves 
to enable the whole plans be profitable and successful. 
Long-term security is a huge factor here, keeping this stricty 
Confidential is the key. 
The amount is 58.5M Euros  (Fifty eight million, Five Hundred thousand Eur=
os). 

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive companies 
information through one of my good friends who works with 
Chamber of Commerce on foreign business relations here in Germany, 
though I did not disclose the details to him. 

As the  Chief Accountant in this bank, I have perfected all modalities. 
The plan is to make you the bonafide next of kin to Mr. Thompson; after al=
l documentations
and formalities, this money will be transferred into your account or accou=
nts,in parts. 

I do hereby assure you that this transaction is absolutely risk free, 
We do guarantee you this if you in turn guarantee us that this information=
 
Is to be kept top secret. 
  
For your assistance you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratif=
ication, 
while 75% will be for me and my colleagues. Sir, you practically do almost=
 nothing, 
all you do is to sign some documents and have us use your bank account to =
make the transfer.

Please sir, you are again being advised to keep this "TopSecret"  even if =
for any reason 
You wish not to be a part of this. I and my colleagues are still working f=
or this bank. 

I shall send you more informations as soon as i recieve your feedback. 
I suggest you send your feedback via fax number: 0012062194174.
Do include your phone, fax numbers and email address as well.



Best Regards, 

Mr. Michael Heinz, 
WUESTENROT BANK 
Frankfurt - Germany.
