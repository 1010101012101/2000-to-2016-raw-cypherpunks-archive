No, you're right.  Medeco should certainly work on a better lock.
Except there comes a point at which, relatively speaking, ALL doors
are "glass" doors compared to the security of this new medeco++ lock.
At which point no, it doesn't make sense to develop an even better
lock until you come up with better doors. :)
