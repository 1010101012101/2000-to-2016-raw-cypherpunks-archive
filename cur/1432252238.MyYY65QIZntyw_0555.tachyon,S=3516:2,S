On further reflection, I think it is necessary to go out on a limb and
suggest a correction to my comment above.

I "verified" the original quotation from a quick google search.  That was
probably not enough.  My recollection suggests that the original quote
should be "where is Socrates now that we need him".  I rather suspect that
the people who 0wn the upstream pipe from my points of access are toying
with their ability to interpose their data in place of quasi-authoritative
texts.  I cannot consult the physical document owing to the fact that its
rarity is such that there are no copies available at either the Metro
Central Reference Library, and I have no access to the stacks at the
University of Toronto Robarts library.  Someone who does may consult the
book themselves with its call number:  B72 .M55 1987.

Further, Ms. Harsh may be said to posess the probable physical vector.  I
cannot say what level of participation she has had in this travesty owing
to the fact that after she perjured herself in court in 2001, she has
entirely avoided using her actual identity online.  However, she could
answer the question with her copy of the book in principle if there were
any way to compel her testimony.  It is possible that the quote is being
used as a source by online spooks by virtue of the text's presence in
their funky everything database.
 
Any way you look at it, the phrase "tax money well spent" would seem to
apply here.


Regards,

Steve
