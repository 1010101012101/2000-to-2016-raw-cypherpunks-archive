We wouldn't have a problem is it stopped at our individual right of self 
defense.  Unfortunately, taxes, murder, regulation, and kidnapping are not 
rights of self defense that I possess so I can't delegate them to the 
state.  The state does all those things and therefore cannot be justified 
under a theory of delegated rights to self defense.
