Recording Artists File Brief Against RIAA
Matthew Skala writes: "The Recording Artists' Coalition, which includes 
such luminaries as Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, and Sheryl Crow, is still 
annoyed about the "Work for Hire" legislation we heard about in August 
2000. They've filed a brief in the Napster cases, urging the court not to 
accept the RIAA's copyright registration documents as proof of ownership, 
because accepting the documents would allow the music cartel to sneakily 
destroy artists' claims to the music they recorded. They don't take a stand 
on other issues we might be interested in, but it's still worth thinking 
about. If the artists are against the RIAA, then whom exactly does the RIAA 
represent? Some quotes and info are on Siliconvalley.com."
