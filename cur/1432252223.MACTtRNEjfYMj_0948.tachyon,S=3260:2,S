Thanks! That's a very detailed and well-written article.

I was just skimming through a new book on the Masons; mostly I read 
about the period when cathedrals and castles were being built in Europe 
and the Masons operated as a union.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
