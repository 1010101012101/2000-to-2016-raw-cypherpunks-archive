A draft paper by Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir was 
released on July 25, 2001 and announces new attacks on the RC4 cipher 
that is the basis for CipherSaber-1. Some of these attacks 
specifically involve the use of an IV with a secret key, the very 
scheme used in CipherSaber.  Prof. Shamir states in an e-mail 
accompanying the release:

"Attached you will find a new paper which describes a truly practical 
direct attack on WEP's cryptography. It is an
extremely powerful attack which can be applied even when WEP's RC4 
stream cipher uses a 2048 bit secret key (its maximal size) and 128 
bit IV modifiers (as proposed in WEP2). The attacker can be a 
completely passive eavesdropper (i.e., he does not have to inject 
packets, monitor responses, or use accomplices) and thus his 
existence is essentially undetectable. It is a pure known-ciphertext 
attack (i.e., the attacker need not know or choose their 
corresponding plaintexts). After scanning several hundred thousand 
packets, the attacker can completely recover the secret key and thus 
decrypt all the ciphertexts. The running time of the attack grows 
linearly instead of exponentially with the key size, and thus it is 
negligible even for 2048 bit keys."

The paper itself, titled "Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm 
of RC4," has been posted at 
http://www.eyetap.org/~rguerra/toronto2001/rc4_ksaproc.pdf (in PDF 
format) and  at http://www.crypto.com/papers/others/rc4_ksaproc.ps 
(in Postscript).

WEP is an encryption system used with 802.11 wireless Ethernet that 
employs RC4, but the attack affects CipherSaber as well.  Note that 
"several hundred thousand" separate CipherSaber messages encrypted 
with the same key would have to be collected for this attack to 
succeed.  None the less, from a cryptographic standpoint, this is too 
close for comfort.

Accordingly I recommend that CipherSaber users switch to 
CipherSaber-2 with a parameter N=20 or larger. The RC4 state vector 
will thus be mixed 20 times instead of once. This large a value for N 
is probably overkill, but until there is time to fully digest the 
implications of this paper, it is better to err on the safe side.  If 
this is impractical for any reason, I recommend changing keys on a 
regular basis to limit the amount of traffic encrypted with any one 
CipherSaber key (even though the IVs differ).

If and when a consensus develops on the best way to fix RC4, I will 
announce a corresponding version of CipherSaber. Visit the 
CipherSaber page http://ciphersaber.gurus.com periodically for 
updated information.
