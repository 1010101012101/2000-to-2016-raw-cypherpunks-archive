INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!

A new issue of Insight on the News is now online

http://insightmag.com/news/258763.html

...............................................

Folks, the summer’s upon us here in the nation’s capital. And, matching the 
weather, your representatives are heatedly working to improve the Wall Street 
mess. Let’s hope they don’t make it worse. Jennifer Hickey tells all in her 
revealing Washington’s Week piece http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html. 

And Zoli Simon has discovered that the Chinese have targeted Russian cruise 
missiles at U.S. ships. Read all about it 
http://insightmag.com/news/258778.html. And guess which party is poised to 
become a major force in time for the November elections? Hint – It’s not the 
Republicans or Democrats http://insightmag.com/news/258781.html. Along with the 
usual reliable revelations and opinions described below. ‘Bye for now. From the 
Bunker, I remain your newsman in Washington.

...............................................

CHINA ARMS FOR WAR

Zoli Simon writes that China's acquisition of cruise-missile weapons systems 
from Russia poses a clear and present danger to U.S. naval forces – and to the 
American homeland as well.

WASHINGTON’S WEEK – ON THE LEGISLATIVE WARPATH

Jennifer Hickey tells us as investor anger registered more clearly with each 
downward tick of the stock markets, legislators engaged in an indelicate 
parliamentary exchange of whoops about arcane congressional rules while they 
danced and ululated to mutual charges of chicanery.

http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html

...............................................

TAX CODE TRAUMA

John Berlau tells us that experts contend that simplifying the U.S. tax code 
would do more to cut down on corporate-accounting chicanery than the 
introduction of still more regulations and criminal penalties.

               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?

On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded "red alert" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a "worst case scenario" -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:

AUSTRIA CONFRONTS ITS DARK NAZI PAST

Ken Timmerman writes that as a government commission prepares to release an 
inventory of property stolen from Jews by the Nazis, a new tide of anti-Semitism 
is sweeping the country.

‘PARTY OF PRINCIPLE’ GAINING GROUND

Doreen Englert says, once an afterthought on the U.S. political landscape, the 
Libertarian Party steadily has increased both in numbers and influence since its 
founding 30 years ago.

http://insightmag.com/news/258781.html

CHURCH EXPLORES ‘HARD CHANGE’

Jennifer Hickey writes that seeking to repair its severely damaged reputation 
and begin the healing process, the Catholic Church takes steps to implement a 
nationwide policy on sexual abuse.
