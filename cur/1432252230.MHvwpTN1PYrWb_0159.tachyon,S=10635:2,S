button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa|

in excess of $52 mi||i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH
