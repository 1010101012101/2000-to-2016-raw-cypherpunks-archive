Actually, I was told that if it has a blade under 3 inches you're fine. My 
hands are so small I don't need a big one anyway. For what it's worth, here 
are the specs on the best California-street-legal defensive knife I've ever 
seen: 

Smith & Wesson Small SWAT Tactical Folder   

Each folder features a Kraton insert for a more secure gripping surface, 
and ergonomic contours. Depending on your needs, there are a variety of 
sizes and two colors to choose from as well. 

Small SWAT 
 2001 / 3001 
Length, Open: 6" 
Length, Closed: 3.3" 
Blade Length: 2.8" 
Blade Material: 440C Steel 
Handle Material: Aluminum 
Locking Method: Liner Lock  
Opening Method: Thumbstud 
Clip: Yes 
Weight: 2.35oz 
 
The Black coated models feature a teflon coated blade and handle, with the 
handle coating textured for enhanced gripping during situations where the 
material may be slick.

Each knife features a thumbstud for ease of opening, and a pocketclip 
situated for tip down carry."

Highly recommended...hope that helps!
