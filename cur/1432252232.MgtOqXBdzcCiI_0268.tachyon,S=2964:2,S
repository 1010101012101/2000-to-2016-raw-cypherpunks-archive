After reading Steve Levy's "Crypto," two points he covers
still intrigue: the true origin of public key encryption and the 
true origin of cypherpunks. Intriguing, to this reader at least, 
is the link between the two in fostering public use of crypto --
and whether there was covert involvement of TLAs in
both efforts. Levy does not examine this possibility, but
the affairs and persons he explores do offer tantalizing
hope for there being more than has been made part of
the public record.

Levy writes a swell account of the public, bright side of 
crypto liberation, and why there's not more about the dark 
side is a mystery, for there's not a really bad character, or 
agency, in the whole tome. To be sure, Levy notes that
the awful aspects of crypto is either classified, NDA
or criminal, thus not fit for angelic e-commerce and
PGPeople's liberation.
