Just like the good ol' USA, AFAIK.  It's just that the inequities at home
aren't limited to those that are a product of the petrochemical industry. 
All of which is not too different from what I see in the poorer parts of
the city I live in: Toronto.

Lately people were talking about PSE/COA topics which make moot much of
the bickering and squabbling that is a constant feature of capitalism.  We
don't hear much about PSE these days for some reason.  I suspect that the
path from here to there is still too far beyond the planning horizon of
too many people.  So, if PSE in a recognizeable form represents a rational
outcome of current economic progress, then I guess we must wait until it
looms nearer before selling it to the world.

> What is your solution?

PSE.  And the death of all superstitious nonsense.  Of course, there are
probably enough people around who like domination games that the
elimination of bogus memes such as those attached to theology may prove
difficult.

Do you have a better idea?

Give them more money.  Aridrop directv dishes, televisions, and old
computers.  Hell, I don't know.  Winning arab hearts and minds is a topic
that is entirely beyond my area of expertise.

And then what?  What are we and they going to do the following year?  And
the year after that?  I'm sure your military think-tanks have walked
through the scenarios and have a good handle on the likely outcomes, but
they aren't really talking at this time.  (And of course, I wouldn't trust
public military think-tank product to correctly predict the sunrise.)

Ok.  That may well be true.  And it is a step in the right direction. 
However I would guess that the long-term stable state of Afghanistan is
entirely up in the air.  Barring coups and such I guess we'll have to
revisit the Afghanistan question in a few decades.  At that time, and
after they've had a little practice with the democratic process, we'll
probably have a much better idea of how well their liberation from the
taliban went.

I suspect that not many of them get to the civilised portions of the
Internet all that often.

You gotta admire the hands-on leadership style, at the very least.

Of course.  All the soldiers just packed up and moved on, or retired into
the relative and mundane obscurity of civilian life.

No, I imagine that isn't very likely.  So, it is clear that the answer is
to bomb the snot out of any country that harbours terrorist warlords. 
Then, we send in the educators and election facilitators.  Correct?

Perhaps I am too cynical and in short order, Afghanistan will quickly form
up and join the modern age.
