This could be bad.  Say B doesn't want to allow access to C for its file
systems. Then what?  Any mechanisms to prevent A from resharing it?  It's
also bad depending on how it's implemented.

Say A has a low bandwith connection to B such as ISDN, but it has a high
bandwith connection to C.  If C uses A to get to B, that slows you
down.  Does it treat the file systems differently or is it just resharing
a mounted file system?

Yeah, so now you're eating double the bandwith of hangar 18.  Say hangar
18 is connected over a T1 and nothing else.  You mount it's file systems
over nfs or whatever Plan 9 uses and do cd /ftp2.sourceforge.net, then you
copy a file from there.  

Well now, you've just effectively doubled the traffic to hangar18.  If the
owner is paying a flat rate, it's not so bad, you're just wastng bandwith.  
But if it's at a colocation it will be enough to go over the percentile
rating and have to pay for extra usage.

Even if the two boxes are on the same local network (broadcast domain),
you'd still saturate your hubs/switches by doubling this traffic, and even
slow down access (latency) as you're using plan-9 to translate from ftp to
it's native scheme to nfs.  Further, you're eating lots of extra cpu
cycles on the plan 9 box(es) while they do this. 

What if hangar18 has a few ftp sites mounted and you run the equivalent of
the find command (which recursively searches for files.)  It goes over the
ftp connections and walks every single connection of the internet?  That's
kind of insane.  It'll take forever and eat up bandwidth at both ends.



And as you say below, it would even cache some of it... ugh...  hope there
are limits to this.

Yeah, it's "cool" but wasteful.

Just DES? And no disk encryption????  What about swap?

Any ip filtering / firewalling mechanisms?  Any routing mechanisms?  Any
NATting mechanisms?

The clustering / distributing computing aspects of it are
cool.  But... I'm still not convinced...

So it's like kerberos in some ways?

Xwindows by itself without a window/desktop manager? yes that would suck
balls.  XWindows with Ximian GNOME or KDE, nope - it rocks, though not on
old hardware.

Whoop. :)  You can control most internet appliances through a web gui or
telnet/ssh command line anyway.
