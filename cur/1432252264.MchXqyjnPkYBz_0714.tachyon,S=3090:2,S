:     You obviously have never done any door-to-door. People are quite often very
: interested. We've had fairly good success organizing people on local issues
: which affect them, like opposition to street widening. Voter registration is the
: same thing.

Actually, I /have/ done door-to-door.  Granted, it's not extensive, but I
have been involved in a few campaigns.  In a good neighbourhood, we'd get
about 3/4 of the people who would care enough or have enough time at that
moment to listen/contribute.

: 
:    The mention was "giving talks in libraries", which works fairly well. The
: local library is the logical meeting place for local groups to hold meetings and
: talks.

Yes, it does, so long as you get people there.  It's the getting people
there that's difficult.  I s'pose a door-to-door campaign advertising a
speaking at the library would be best.
