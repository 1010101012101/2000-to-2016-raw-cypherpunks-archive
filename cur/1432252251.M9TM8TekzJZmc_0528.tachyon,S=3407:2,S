I don' think there's an out-of-the-box solution for this one so far. if
there is, I'd be very interested in it myself.

one low-tech solution would be using SSL. set up a dedicated machine
that talks on smtps, but not on the normal smtp (which makes sure your
inbound traffic is encrypted). the listmails are send EXCLUSIVELY to
local users, who can read them via an IMAP server which also doesn't
allow unencrypted access.

of course, that may not be feasable if you're talking about an open
forum, where readers come and go all the time, but you sounded like you
had a more closed target audience.
