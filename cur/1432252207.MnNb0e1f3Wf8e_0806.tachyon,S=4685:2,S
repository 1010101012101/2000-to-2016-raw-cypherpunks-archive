So, how would one go about a gateway which strips all of it on the way 
into/out of an onion router, without jeopardizing that basic 
functionality which can at all survive after anonymization?

At least to me it would seem that you can't adopt a firewall mindset 
where you just blacklist/shave-off certain features and options. If you 
want to be certain, you'll have to have an exacting parser which only 
accepts as an input language something "clean". Probably on the pain of 
rejecting a whole lot of otherwise common or even valid emails and such.

Has anybody tried to write a truly anal parser/normaliser/rejecter to 
date?

All except Message-ID can be dropped without jeopardizing service. 
Message-ID, well, that's just such a basic part of the service that 
you'd have to go with zero knowledge proofs in a funky and expensive way 
if you wanted to get rid of that one.

We need them *too*. Doesn't mean we shouldn't sanitise our outgoing (and 
incoming, because of replies) email all the same. Automatically. With 
minimum hassle. On as many platforms as needed.

True Names. They're now there. So let's deal with the problem.

Yes, SMTP is the basest problem. It's difficult to get around envelop 
addresses in the clear and all that. But above you talked about 
something within the protocol which *can* be sanitised. Let's do that, 
programmatically, at least, and right now. After that, it's suddenly 
*much* easier to deal with the address on the envelope.
