I've already posted this to cryto-canada@greatvideo.com, but it seems to me
wider distribution might be appropriate.

My reading of that is that the current 64-bit limit for freely exportable
commercial software dies at the end of this year if any Wassenaar country
acts sensibly and votes to kill it.

Of course, there will be pressure from the US and perhaps some others to
act stupidly and maintain the 64-bit limit or rplace it with some larger
but still insecure limit.

What can we do to ensure that unanimous consent to this does not occur?

It should be rather difficult to get unanimous consent to anything from
a group of 35, and maintaining the limit is clearly a remarkably dumb
thing to do, so the odds may be with us here. Still, I'd feel better if
I knew of a dozen or so countries publicly committed to withholding
that consent.
