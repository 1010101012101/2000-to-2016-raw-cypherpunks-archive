Dear Mr. Young,

I am still in prison, and I will probably be so until Sept 2009. (You
know I was railroaded.) I am very, very worried about my future.
When I get out, I will have nearly no assets and I will need a job.
Right now I'm "networking" to figure out how I will live under
exceedingly trying circumstances.

If you have any ideas, or contacts, or ? My degree is
in chemistry (MIT 1980, Bachelors) and I have extensive
knowledge of electronics. (Analog, digital, etc.) (Ham N7IJS)

Thank you for your past efforts. Please contact my
parents with any ideas.

Please help if you can.
