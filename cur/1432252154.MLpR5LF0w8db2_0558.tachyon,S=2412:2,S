Black Rock, Nev (Routers)
Air Force spokeswoman Jane Denning apologized for
the accidental detonation of a fuel-air munition
above the "Burning Man" campgrounds, blaming the
error on outdated National Imagery and Mapping Agency
maps that showed the area as part of an active nearby bombing
range.  Bureau of Land Management rangers on the scene
said there were no survivors.

Department of Justice spokesman Louis Slaveh said that
although there will be no compensation from the government,
officials are taking steps to see that this doesn't happen
again.   A DEA official on the scene commented "We should have
thought of this earlier."
