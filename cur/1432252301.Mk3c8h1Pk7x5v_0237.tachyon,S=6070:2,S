Isn't there some sort of rule where at the first mention of "Hitler" or
"Nazi", it's the end of the thread? ;)

Heh.  Maybe ridicule wasn't the right word.  I can take a joke, ridicule
is ok.  I guess a better word would have been "unjustified slander" (OK,
that's two).  Satire and ridicule are good things, and are
protected...this is good.

But now, I am beginning to see what you are saying.  We shouldn't blame
*speech* for the result of speech.  It's the *result* of said speech that
should be the grounds of wrongness.  Makes sense to me.
