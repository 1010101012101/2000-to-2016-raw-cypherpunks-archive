                              HOT OFF THE PRESS !!!

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

        THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

        Burbank, CA., June 27, 2001 – The Neptune Society, Inc., (OTC BB:
        NTUN) one of the country’s largest publicly traded cremation
        specialists, announced its significant strategic accomplishments
        and financial results of operations during the three months ended
        March 31, 2001.

        On June 1, 2001, the staff of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) came to a position of no further comment with
        respect to Neptune Society’s Registration Statement Form 10 filed
        with the SEC to register its common stock under the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, completing an extensive and
        expensive 18-month process.  During the process, with guidance
        from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society developed its
        accounting policies related to recognition of pre-need
        merchandise revenue prior to the provision of cremation
        services.  Subsequently, Neptune Society implemented changes to
        its pre need sales programs that will allow it to recognize
        pre-need merchandise revenues at the point-of-sale in certain
        states on a going forward basis.

        Also with guidance from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society
        adopted new accounting policies, which resulted in the deferral
        of pre-need merchandise revenues in the amounts of $1.6 million
        and $4.3 million during the first quarter and the year ended
        December 31, 2000, respectively.  Under United States generally
        accepted accounting principles, these deferrals are not
        recognized in the revenues of Neptune Society.  During the first
        quarter ended March 31, 2001, Neptune Society recognized revenues
        of $2.7 million.

        Approximately two and one half years ago, Neptune Society
        acquired a group of closely-held corporations and limited
        partnerships loosely connected with virtually no standardized
        policies and procedures for financial and managerial information
        reporting.  In 2000, Neptune Society invested heavily to
        substantially retool these operations for the purposes of
        realizing operating efficiencies.  Neptune Society has attracted
        talented management personnel, expanded its telemarketing
        operations, updated and expanded its accounting and management
        information systems (including networking office locations
        together), made two strategic acquisitions, opened two new
        offices and implemented the infrastructure and quality controls
        necessary to support future growth and expansion.

        In the first quarter of 2001, Neptune Society began to realize
        positive results from the changes to its business infrastructure
        and the addition of new offices.  Neptune Society’s first quarter
        operations generated positive cash flows, after taking into
        consideration certain prepaid expenses and certain payments
        related to fiscal year 2000, which caused cash flows related to
        operating activities to decrease.  In addition, Neptune Society
        incurred $176,000 in professional fees, primarily related to the
        registration of its common stock under the Securities Exchange
        Act to qualify its shares for listing on the NASD
        over-the-counter bulletin board and, in the future, a listing on
        a major exchange.  The costs incurred for professional fees are
        anticipated to begin to trend downward toward the end of the
        second quarter.

        Management believes that other indicators of growth and progress
        of Neptune Society’s performance include transaction volume and
        non-refundable sales (sales for which the customer has no refund
        or cancellation rights even though these sales may not be
        recognizable as revenue under the new accounting policies and US
        GAAP).  Below are selected financial and operational results for
        the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to the same period in
        the prior year:

        Pre-need contract sales volume up                 76%
        Total transaction volume up                            58%
        Revenues up
        68%
        Non-refundable sales (non-US GAAP) up      67%
        Gross profit  up
        100%
        Gross profit % up                                            17%
        Earnings & deferred earnings before interest,
          taxes, depreciation and amortization (non-US GAAP) up $796,099

        While other major death-care industry companies reported
        declining transaction volumes and top line revenues during the
        first quarter compared to the same period in 2000 due in part to
        declining mortality rates, Neptune Society experienced increased
        transaction volume across all product lines.  Pre-need contract
        sales volume increased 76 percent overall, with existing offices
        accounting for 41 percent of the overall increase.  At-need case
        volume increased 46 percent over the same period last year, with
        existing offices accounting for 13 percent of the overall growth.

        Revenues were $2.7 million for the for the three month period
        ended March 31, 2001 compared to $1.6 million for the same period
        in 2000.  Non-refundable sales were $4.2 million for the three
        month period ended March 31, 2001 compared to $2.5 million for
        the same period in 2000.  Non-refundable sales increased 67
        percent due to increased at-need and pre-need activity, change in
        product mix (from installment sales to paid-in-full sales) and
        the introduction of a new travel assurance product offering. The
        introduction of the Neptune Society Worldwide Travel Assurance
        Plan, a new product offering, contributed $295,000 to the
        increase in non-refundable sales and revenues during the first
        quarter of 2001.

        Gross profits doubled from $.65 million for the first quarter of
        2000 to $1.3 million during  for the same period in 2001.  Gross
        profit percentage increased 17 percent due to the increased
        volume of activity and the resulting revenues, which covered
        certain fixed costs related to cremation and telemarketing
        operations.

        Earnings and deferred earnings (deferred revenues and costs, net)
        before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are
        representative of the Company’s operating performance if no
        revenues or costs had been deferred.  This non-US GAAP metric was
        $387,000, up $796,099 in the first quarter of 2001 versus the
        same period in 2000.

        Management believes that the Neptune Society is well positioned
        for growth in each of its core product lines:  Pre-Need contract
        sales and at-need case deposition.  Neptune Society has
        consolidated a group of companies into a strategically focused
        public company serving the cremation segment of the death care
        industry.  Neptune Society’s goal in 2001 is to continue to
        integrate its product offerings, achieve higher organic and
        expansion growth, maintain positive cash flows and maximize the
        value that management believes to be inherent in Neptune Society
        for the benefit of its shareholders.

        The Neptune Society’s complete Form 10 and Form 10Q for the
        quarter ending March 31, 2001 is available for viewing at
        www.neptunesociety.com or the Securities Exchange Commission
        website at www.sec.gov.

<p><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>
<p><b>THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</b>
<p><b>Burbank, CA., June 27, 2001 – The Neptune Society, Inc., (OTC BB:
NTUN) one of the country’s largest publicly traded cremation specialists,
announced its significant strategic accomplishments and financial results
of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2001.</b>
<p><b>On June 1, 2001, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) came to a position of no further comment with respect to Neptune
Society’s Registration Statement Form 10 filed with the SEC to register
its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
completing an extensive and expensive 18-month process.&nbsp; During the
process, with guidance from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society developed
its accounting policies related to recognition of pre-need merchandise
revenue prior to the provision of cremation services.&nbsp; Subsequently,
Neptune Society implemented changes to its pre need sales programs that
will allow it to recognize pre-need merchandise revenues at the point-of-sale
in certain states on a going forward basis.</b>
<p><b>Also with guidance from the staff of the SEC, Neptune Society adopted
new accounting policies, which resulted in the deferral of pre-need merchandise
revenues in the amounts of $1.6 million and $4.3 million during the first
quarter and the year ended December 31, 2000, respectively.&nbsp; Under
United States generally accepted accounting principles, these deferrals
are not recognized in the revenues of Neptune Society.&nbsp; During the
first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Neptune Society recognized revenues
of $2.7 million.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Approximately two and one half years ago, Neptune Society acquired
a group of closely-held corporations and limited partnerships loosely connected
with virtually no standardized policies and procedures for financial and
managerial information reporting.&nbsp; In 2000, Neptune Society invested
heavily to substantially retool these operations for the purposes of realizing
operating efficiencies.&nbsp; Neptune Society has attracted talented management
personnel, expanded its telemarketing operations, updated and expanded
its accounting and management information systems (including networking
office locations together), made two strategic acquisitions, opened two
new offices and implemented the infrastructure and quality controls necessary
to support future growth and expansion.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>In the first quarter of 2001, Neptune Society began to realize positive
results from the changes to its business infrastructure and the addition
of new offices.&nbsp; Neptune Society’s first quarter operations generated
positive cash flows, after taking into consideration certain prepaid expenses
and certain payments related to fiscal year 2000, which caused cash flows
related to operating activities to decrease.&nbsp; In addition, Neptune
Society incurred $176,000 in professional fees, primarily related to the
registration of its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act to qualify
its shares for listing on the NASD over-the-counter bulletin board and,
in the future, a listing on a major exchange.&nbsp; The costs incurred
for professional fees are anticipated to begin to trend downward toward
the end of the second quarter.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Management believes that other indicators of growth and progress
of Neptune Society’s performance include transaction volume and non-refundable
sales (sales for which the customer has no refund or cancellation rights
even though these sales may not be recognizable as revenue under the new
accounting policies and US GAAP).&nbsp; Below are selected financial and
operational results for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 compared to the
same period in the prior year:</b>
<p><b>Pre-need contract sales volume up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
76%</b>
<br><b>Total transaction volume up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
58%</b>
<br><b>Revenues up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
68%</b>
<br><b>Non-refundable sales (non-US GAAP) up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
67%</b>
<br><b>Gross profit&nbsp; up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
100%</b>
<br><b>Gross profit % up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
17%</b>
<br><b>Earnings &amp; deferred earnings before interest,&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; taxes, depreciation and amortization (non-US GAAP) up $796,099</b>
<p><b>While other major death-care industry companies reported declining
transaction volumes and top line revenues during the first quarter compared
to the same period in 2000 due in part to declining mortality rates, Neptune
Society experienced increased transaction volume across all product lines.&nbsp;
Pre-need contract sales volume increased 76 percent overall, with existing
offices accounting for 41 percent of the overall increase.&nbsp; At-need
case volume increased 46 percent over the same period last year, with existing
offices accounting for 13 percent of the overall growth.</b>
<p><b>Revenues were $2.7 million for the for the three month period ended
March 31, 2001 compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2000.&nbsp;
Non-refundable sales were $4.2 million for the three month period ended
March 31, 2001 compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2000.&nbsp;
Non-refundable sales increased 67 percent due to increased at-need and
pre-need activity, change in product mix (from installment sales to paid-in-full
sales) and the introduction of a new travel assurance product offering.
The introduction of the Neptune Society Worldwide Travel Assurance Plan,
a new product offering, contributed $295,000 to the increase in non-refundable
sales and revenues during the first quarter of 2001.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Gross profits doubled from $.65 million for the first quarter of
2000 to $1.3 million during&nbsp; for the same period in 2001.&nbsp; Gross
profit percentage increased 17 percent due to the increased volume of activity
and the resulting revenues, which covered certain fixed costs related to
cremation and telemarketing operations.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Earnings and deferred earnings (deferred revenues and costs, net)
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are representative
of the Company’s operating performance if no revenues or costs had been
deferred.&nbsp; This non-US GAAP metric was $387,000, up $796,099 in the
first quarter of 2001 versus the same period in 2000.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Management believes that the Neptune Society is well positioned for
growth in each of its core product lines:&nbsp; Pre-Need contract sales
and at-need case deposition.&nbsp; Neptune Society has consolidated a group
of companies into a strategically focused public company serving the cremation
segment of the death care industry.&nbsp; Neptune Society’s goal in 2001
is to continue to integrate its product offerings, achieve higher organic
and expansion growth, maintain positive cash flows and maximize the value
that management believes to be inherent in Neptune Society for the benefit
of its shareholders.</b>
