That could only happen, without regulation, if monopoly powers were abused
pretty badly. I don't think this one has a pulse.

I think that is the worst possible example of a poorly working 'free'
market. It's heavily driven by military funding and *strictly* regulated
even when not. Generally the only intrinsically bad side I can think of is
the high barrier of entry caused by massive R&D and materials investment and
low volume deliveries.

death/suffering/whatever.
