There are doubtless etymologists who could answer this definitively. 
I don't have aceess to the OED online, which could at least give us
info on how far back it goes.

The question on hand is the origin of boot (British) vs trunk (American)
for the storage at the rear of a sedan car.

I really, really don't think either Tim or Mike are on the right track.
American pimp slang is very unlikely to have affected British 
motoring jargon. Instead, I suggest the both 'boot' and 'booty'
may come from a much older English usage of 'butt' to refer the
the rear end of something - whether a person (buttocks), or the
end of a spear or a cigarette (butt).

Many horse-drawn coaches (and some early automobiles) had
a luggage style trunk strapped on the back for storage. Thiis 
seems a source for the American 'trunk', and also give an 
alternative route to 'boot'. Many early automobile terms are 
from the French (chauffeur, carburetor ), and the French
term for 'box' is 'boite', which could easily migrate in British
English to 'boot'.
