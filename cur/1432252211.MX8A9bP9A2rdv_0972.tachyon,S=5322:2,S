Exactly.  And there aren't many things *that* big.

Wait a minute: since when does a forest fire create explosions?  Or have
enough ground force to push up a mushroom cloud?

Agreed.  Except that _I_ do not have access to those sattelites, so I
don't know what it is they saw (or didn't see).

And, lo, a *lot* of people noticed it.

That I didn't know.

Yes, I do remember that.  I also remember everyone denying it at first.

Agreed - we can only wait and see.  However, I do *not* expect that the
USG would want this out if it *is* a nuclear test - Shrub is facing a PR
nightmare if it is, since he is the one who pushed them into the nuclear
corner.

That of course brings us full circle: how many fuels can produce a blast
which results in a 2+ mile mushroom?  That's a *lot* of explosive force.

Hey look here Shaddack: you're ruining a perfectly good conspiracy theory
here!  I'll have none of this well reasoned CRAP in *my* conspiracy
theory!  :-)

I, like many other, will be looking at this as it develops...  You may be
right, but, really, a *forest fire*????
