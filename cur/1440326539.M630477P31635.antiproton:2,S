Well said on skepticism of news reports concerning crypto, comsec,
infosec, natsec. Disinfo and deception are inherent in security and
survival, and best, most reliable, most trusted are typical tools of
misleading exploitation.

Where a single means and method, such as crypto (or science), is
encouraged for rock-solid assurance, at least one other means and
methods should be employed which in no way depends upon the
single means. Hoodwink wins by cheating.

A single means is certain to be continously under attack, and its
vulnerabilities concealed both by the attackers and by the promoters.

Blind faith in a single means is as old as religion, art and royalty, perhaps
as old as humans faced with unending threats from nature and
mortality -- and most of all from each other's thieving and murderous
practices. Duplicity and con-jobs were essential, along with bigger
clubs and rocks, voodoo and faux-virgin sacrifices -- ISIS hardly
different, except more modest and sane and much less wealthy,
than Los Alamos, The Vatican, JP Morgan, Ashley Madison,
Silicon Valley and the IC all fostering blind faith in their own
advertising of rockefeller-st-peter-approved STD protection.

Some HTTPS Everywheres lately have been advertising encryption
and HTTPS as condoms to protect against Internet STD, aka privacy
rape. Peddlers of these hygienics are surely donors to the of Church
of Crypto whose priests do enjoy the pleasures of insider hoo-haa.
