Notes to articles:

Once again I am seeing eyewitness reports claiming more
U.S. Casualties.  Yet I don't see simular reports in the U.S. Press
confirming or denying these claims.

Time will tell.  Dead bodies have a tendency of piling up in Afganistan
and I have no doubt that if they do exist they will be eventually noticed.

regards
joe

Uzbekistan Eyewitnesses See Dozens of US Casualties

Daily news, articles and interviews on the Jihad in Afghanistan 

LONDON (IWPR): The London-based Institute for War and Peace
Reporting has reported from Khanabad, Uzbekistan, that the US
air base in this city is receiving daily flights carrying dead
and injured US soldiers. Uzbek sources at Khanabad suggest
that the real figures of US casualties are far higher than the
Pentagon's official totals. Uzbek army personnel working at
the air base said scores of US casualties have been arriving
there. From November 25 to December 2, an Uzbek orderly
working with American medical staff said he had witnessed the
arrival of four to five US helicopters - carrying between them
10-15 American casualties - each day. The orderly said the US
staff he was helping confirmed the casualties coming off the
aircraft were Americans.

A reporter who managed to enter the air base with a group of
visiting Uzbek parents said that one whole floor of a building
and four large canvas tents were full of injured US soldiers,
who have suffered shrapnel and bullet wounds to the arms, leg
and head. The airport sources could not confirm how many
incoming casualties had died. One Uzbek soldier said that
since October 15 he had helped US servicemen load 20 body bags
onto American transport planes. But he could not confirm
whether they were dead US soldiers.

But there is other evidence of American fatalities. One Uzbek
officer said US soldiers had told him that four of their
comrades had died of their wounds on December 1 while being
airlifted to Khanabad. An Uzbek pilot spoke of the death last
week of an American soldier who he had become friendly with
while he was on the base. The US serviceman, he said, had died
in the attempt to end the prison riot on the outskirts of
Mazar-e-Sharif two weeks ago. "A lot of American troops died
there - it was a real battle, " the pilot said.

Uzbek army personnel say the atmosphere on the base has
changed distinctly in the last week or so. They say that in
October when the Americans began deploying at the airport,
they were gung-ho, telling their Uzbek counterparts that it
would take no more than a month and a half to defeat the
Taleban and al-Qaeda. While the Taleban appear to be on their
last legs, al-Qaeda fighters continue to resist in mountain
redoubts, with some US servicemen at Khanabad now resigned to
a long haul. Uzbek military staff say frustration at this is
noticeable. They say they have witnessed growing tensions
among American troops, often overhearing arguments and
shouting matches.

ARAB MUJAHIDEEN WITNESSED AERIAL SUPPORT FROM ALLAAH(SWT)

TORA BORA (Special Report): On Saturday afternoon after Asr
Prayers, the Eastern Shura launched a concentrated offensive
against Mujahideen positions in the Tora Bora mountains.
According to news reports from the area, it was the most
intense attack launched against them so far. Haji Qadeer's
forces had close air and armour support. The US Air Force
bombed the Mujahideen positions savegely and heavy armour was
also pitted against them. The fighting was so intense that the
Mujahideen initiated a tactical retreat to the mountains with
light weapons. They had earlier resolved to die fighting
instead of being taken prisoner. It was when they had moved
back and the forces of the Eastern Shura, supported by a heavy
detachment of US ground troops had moved forward, that bombs
began to fall on the Coalition forces from the sky, killing
300 of the enemy comprising Americans and Haji Qadeer's
militia.

This was without doubt a miracle from Allah (SWT) who had
blinded the American pilots so that they bombed their own
people. The Mujahideen counter- attacked after this incident
and killed another 300 US troops/ Alliance militia, capturing
100 prisoners. It has been reported that a joint force of 900
troops including US soldiers and Eastern Shura militia
attacked the Mujahideen who numbered around 500 troops.

This was a highly organised offensive against the Mujahideen,
which was coordinated by high-ranking US military commanders,
whose mutilated bodies littered the battlefield at the end of
the battle. It has been reported that after this major victory
for the Mujahideen, Haji Qadeer asked the Americans to deploy
more ground troops as American air support has proved to be
impotent against the Mujahideen and lethal instead to the
Americans and their agents. The Mujahideen sources claimed
that it was doubtlessly help from Allah (SWT)

AL-JAZEERA CHANNEL: AMERICAN COMMANDERS KILLED BY MORTAR FIRE
IN TORA BORA

TORA BORA (Al-Jazeera): It was one day last week when a mortar
round from the Arab Mujahideen positions in Tora Bora hit the
command center of the Eastern Alliance, while a planning
session was in progress. According to news reports, high level
US military commanders as well as Haji Qadir's top commanders
were present in the session. The command center was destroyed
by the round and the Eastern Alliance militia used excessive
force to keep the foreign journalists and TV crews from the
scene of carnage. Al-Jazeera Network speculated that this
harrassement was to cover up the heavy blow dealt to the
command structure of the US forces in the area.
