Hi everyone

I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686, x86_64 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhenced by
hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing
logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has
access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in
ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP.

Changelog:

This is an early release to address a bug in the dhcp client for the
i686 port only. We did not update tor which remains stable at 0.2.1.26,
but we did update busybox to 1.17.2 and the kernel to 2.6.32.23 +
Gentoo's hardened-patches-2.6.32-22.extras.
