    Spoken like a true simp-wimp. A vote for *either* algore or gwbush
is a direct vote for the New World Order. No ifs, ands, or buts. They 
are both trilateralists, scumbag bush even went the same Skull&Bones 
route his father did, his grandfather did, etc. There is no difference,
Nader is right, it's TweedleDum & TweedleDee, Dumb & Dumber. 
        Vote Nader -- at least he's honest. And don't give us all that
horseshit about Nader=commutarian. Just because he's pro-labor and anti-
megacorp doesn't make him a socialist, or commu-anything.
     You've shown your true colors, Tim -- you're just a simp-wimp under
the skin. Vote for Bush and the NWO, commieboy.
