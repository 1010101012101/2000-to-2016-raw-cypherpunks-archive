Which would seem to get us back to my original point. This "Goth" look is as
powerful a message as any, and as likely to shock current Christians as it
would have been earlier ones, especially if you happen to be the only one
not to belong. The same goes for groups of chanting classmates and an
isolated Wicca. In both cases the message is a one of collective aggression
and certainly regularly sending such a message casts doubts on both the
sender and the message. Even if the message takes the superficial appearance
of valid religious expression.
