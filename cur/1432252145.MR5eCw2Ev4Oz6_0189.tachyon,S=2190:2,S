Ashcroft is pretty good compared to recent Attorney generals. 
Under Reno, political extremists were not asked threatening
questions.  They were apt to get their dog shot, their son
shot, their baby shot in its mother's arms, etc.

If unpleasant people with intimidating questions was the worst
menace to our liberty, we would be in mighty good shape.

Ashcroft has completely failed to enforce all the "Child
protection" legislation that congress passed against the
internet - which makes him the nearest thing to a friend of
liberty as you are likely to find in Washington.
