Interestingly, nearly everything that is "interesting" depends on 
perspective (including what is interesting). Entropy and randomness 
both depend on perspective. The value of some item depends on 
perspective: what is of high value to Alice may be of little value to 
Bob.

This is part of a much larger issue, and is not just verbal game-playing.

Perhaps I was so accustomed to this "relativist" point of view that 
the fact that reputations share the same characteristics was not at 
all surprising.

I did a major article on this some years back, about probabalistic 
belief networks...which is what reputations seem to best map into. 
The Dempster-Shafer method of propagating beliefs seems most useful.
