So instead of responding to the text of the article, you rant about the
author. That's intellectual integrity about on the level of many of
those anti-property rights protests.

The problem is that the protesters have no coherent message. Take this
bit of silliness:
http://www.mccullagh.org/image/10/breastfeeding-is-your-right.html

Does anyone really think that breastfeeding is a right anytime,
anywhere?  Don't I have a right to tell someone to leave my home if
they're doing it at a gathering I'm hosting on my property? (I
wouldn't, but that's not the point.)

Yep. And it's also pretty accurate. The protesters have no coherent message,
but a disdain for property rights is about as close as they come to one.
