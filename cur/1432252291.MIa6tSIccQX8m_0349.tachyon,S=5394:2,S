The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dri||ed 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
s|ightly, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
