In the UK ISPs certainly can bill the police for any taps installed
at their standard rates, just as the telcos have always billed the
police for the cost of wire taps.  There was a lot of opposition
from ISPs to taps 2-3 years ago; it largely disappeared when it became
clear that they would be paid.

The FBI made a presentation on Carnivore a couple of years ago at
a NANOG conference in Washington.  In a side remark, the guy giving
the presentation made it clear that the practice in the US is the
same: ISPs are paid by the police for any taps, paid at their normal
rates.

I ran an ISP for seven years and was involved in a number of industry
associations.  Never heard of anyone anywhere billing a customer for
the cost of taps, or of anyone putting such a provision in their
contracts (I reviewed quite a few such contracts very carefully).  It
would amount to a form of tax without any basis in legislation and would,
I believe, arouse very strong opposition.

But perhaps I miss the point of the thread ;-)
