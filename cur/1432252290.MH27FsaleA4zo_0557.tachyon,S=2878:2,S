Amusing. I commented to one of my classmates last week that it wasn't
going to be too long before Jim stuck the ugly stick in the wrong eye and
someone reacted.

Since when is the use of "whois" illegal? Mapquest? Public DMV records?

Jim may be "invading the privacy" of these CIA agents, but if they have
been negligent enough to allow that information to become public, it's
their own fault.

I don't recall Jim advocating any action against said CIA installation. He
was just reporting public information, and making inquiries. No bombing
requests... not that anyone here would be really upset if such a thing
happened...

Do you know what law enforcement agency these "types" represent? Can we
get names and badge numbers?

Hopefully we'll hear from Jim soon.
