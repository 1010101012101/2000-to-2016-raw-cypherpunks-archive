Subject: The Word Spy for 05/01/2003 -- ethnomathematics
Date: Thu, 01 May 2003 04:16:55 -0400

ethnomathematics (ETH.noh.math.uh.mat.iks; th as in thin) n.

Mathematics as practiced by non-Western ethnic groups and 
marginalized groups within Western society. Also: ethno-mathematics.
--ethnomathematical adj.
--ethnomathematician n.

Example Citation
---------------------------------
Starting in 1993, he traveled across Africa on a Fulbright 
scholarship to investigate evidence of fractals in windscreens, 
carvings and textiles. He explored villages -- once leaning 
precariously out of a small airplane to take pictures of layout 
patterns. His resulting book, "African Fractals," argues for a 
mathematical intelligence in African design more complex than 
generally appreciated.

Eglash's research fits in squarely with "ethnomathematics," a term 
coined in the '80s and usually used to describe the mathematical 
practices of smaller or indigenous cultural groups. While 
ethnomathematicians have studied Mayan calendars and even boomerang 
flights, a unifying theme is an emphasis on mathematical 
accomplishments outside the Western canon.

Advocates see ethnomathematics as a useful way to make math more 
expansive and relevant to students from different backgrounds. 
Critics characterize it as a diversion from numbers that could lead 
to softer standards.
--Michael Hill, "In hair and Latin beats, professor creates math 
lessons," The Associated Press, April 29, 2003

Example Citation #2
---------------------------------
Ethnomathematics -- the general name mathematician Ubiratan 
D'Ambrosio of Brazil coined for this study of the concepts, 
practices, and artifacts through which we discover mathematical 
elements among peoples living outside or on the margins of Western 
culture -- teaches us to look at "exotic" forms of mathematics as an 
intrinsic element of the civilizations in which they have flourished, 
well worth studying for their own sake.
--Dirk J. Struik, "Everybody counts," Technology Review, August 1995

Earliest Citation
---------------------------------
Native American Mathematics appears at a time when interest in 
ethnomathematics is on the increase. Educational projects devoted to 
developing mathematics materials relevant to the Native American 
heritage, style of learning, and economic environment are currently 
under way at Northern Arizona University, Oklahoma State University, 
and the Fort Ojibway School in Minnesota, to name but a few. An 
International Study Group on Ethnomathematics has been established, a 
newsletter on the subject is being published, and international 
meetings have been scheduled.
--Charles G. Moore, "Native American Mathematics (book review), 
Science, May 22, 1987

First Use
---------------------------------
Ethnomathematics [is] the maths practised among cultural groups such 
as national-tribal societies, labour groups, children of a certain 
age bracket, professional classes and so on.
--Ubiratan D'Ambrosio, "Ethnomathematics and Its Place in the History 
and Pedagogy of Mathematics," For the Learning of Mathematics: An 
International Journal of Mathematics Education, February 
1985
