John's writing may lead to some speculation about whether he
did a little too much James Joyce in the 60s,
but it's worth reading a much higher fraction of the time than
most Internet writers, and when he's making stuff up
it's almost always creative and interesting.

On the other hand, it's less clear whether *you're*
asking about people who write in a gently intellectual spirit
or whether you're talking about goyish intellectuals here...
