Well I was aware of RA things where you do your own RA and on the CA side
they limit you to issuing certs belonging to you, if I recall thawte was
selling those.  (They pre-vet your ownership of some domains foocorp.com,
foocorpinc.com etc, and then you can issue www.foocorp.com, *.foocorp.com 
.. however you dont get a CA private key, you get web integration with the 
RA
so you dont have to do the email verification dance for each cert you
create).

Handing over a signed sub-CA is a much higher level of risk, unless perhaps
it has a constraint on the domain names of certs it can sign baked into it,
which is possible.

To hand over a blank cheque sub-CA cert that could sign gmail.com is
somewhat dangerous.  But you notice that geotrust require it to be in a
hardware token, and some audits blah blah, AND more importantly that you
agree not to create certs for domains you dont own.

Start of the thread was that Greg and maybe others claim they've seen a cert
in the wild doing MitM on domains the definitionally do NOT own.

(The windows 2k box sounds scary for sure, and you better hope that's not a
general unrestricted sub-CA cert, but even then you could admit its similar
to the security practices of diginotar.) 

Secure as the weakest link, and the weakest link just keeps getting lower.  
It would be interesting to know if there really are CAs lax enough to issue
a sub-CA cert to a windows box with no hardware container for the private
key.  (Not that it makes that much difference... hack the RA and the private
key doesnt matter so much).

The real question again is can we catch a boingo or corp lan or government
using a MitM sub-CA cert, and then we'll know which CA is complicit in
issuing it, and delist them.
