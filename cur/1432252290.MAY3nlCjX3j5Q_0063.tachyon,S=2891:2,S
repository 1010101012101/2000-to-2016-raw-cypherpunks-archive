Yes. It's illegal in Cambridge to smoke in Boston, as the old joke went,
before it became actual fact.

Remember the guy who was extradited to Kentucky for his porn server in
California.

Tim May used to say that national borders are mere speedbumps on the
information superhighway, but the fact is that exponentially growing and
geodesic internetworks, coupled with exponentially increasing legislation
(judicial, extralegal and otherwise), make everything illegal everywhere
all the time.

Add that to:

1.) the collision of identity-based transactions with the business
necessity for instantaneous transactions resulting in the possibility of
the instantaneous theft of all an identity's assets,

2.) the explosion of intellectual "property" legislation (infinite
copyright, and the logical necessity to grant patents to any behavior that
can be reduced to software),

and we live in a very Chinese definition of "interesting times".

Cheers,
RAH
