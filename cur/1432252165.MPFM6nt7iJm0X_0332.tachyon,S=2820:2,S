Nearly all the spam I ever see (when cleaning out my "probably spam" 
folders to make sure I'm not losing real correspondence) is transparently 
fraudulent, advertising illegal or stolen products, from forged or hijacked 
sender addresses, etc.  The fact that the spammers are violating laws right 
now, but prosecutors can't be troubled to do anything about it, makes me 
deeply skeptical that passing an antispam law would change that much.

And when you think about it, spending a lot of police resources to go after 
spammers probably wouldn't make much sense, at least beyond shutting down 
really large organizations.  It's the same problem as fighting the war on 
drugs or the war on music piracy, or trying to deal with your kitchen ant 
infestation by mashing each ant you see with your fingers.

This is aside from the first amendment problems (it's commercial speech, so 
it may be possible to get around those problems, but who really knows?) 
with antispam laws.
