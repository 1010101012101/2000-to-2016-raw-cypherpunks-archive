The cop is also, from news reports, a dirty cop, using his position 
of power in ways that citizen-units would be sent to jail for. 
According to news reports out of Modesto, the big brother (tm) Condit 
was involved in taking handguns out of the Modesto P.D. and selling 
them on the street to the usual suspects.

As for the direction they all took, they all got into the same basic 
line of work. Shakedowns and rent-seeking.
