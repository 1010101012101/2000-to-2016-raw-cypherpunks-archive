Making users prove they are human without disclosing any personally
identifying information is not an easy task.  As far as I know, nobody
has found a way to do it.

The closest the IT industries have come so far is the CAPTCHA.
Automated CAPTCHA breaking methods include forwarding the challenge
image, puzzle or etc. to 3rd party websites where users solve CAPTCHAS
to access content, and submitting those users' solutions back the site
your automated gadget wants to fool.

Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!

However, this would lead to...

The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.

A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."

One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and
etc. redundant.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973

Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.
 But someday, somewhere a window of opportunity might open up, and
meanwhile "there's no such thing as wasted basic research."
