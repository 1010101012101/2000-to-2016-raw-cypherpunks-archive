DARK WALLET: A RADICAL WAY TO BITCOIN

POSTED BY MICHAEL DEL CASTILLO

Cody Wilson is a twenty-five-year-old former law student at the University =
of
Texas at Austin. He is also the inventor of the Liberator, a gun made almost
entirely from plastic pieces created with a 3-D printer; he also uploaded to
the Internet a blueprint that anyone could use to print such a gun.

Wilson, who espouses libertarian views, created the blueprint to make a
point: information should be free. Not everyone agreed with him. In May,
after Wilson successfully fired the gun at a range near Austin and posted t=
he
design online, the State Department requested that those files be removed
=66rom the Web site of his nonprofit, Defense Distributed.

Wilson complied=E2=80=94but not before the files had been downloaded two hu=
ndred
thousand times, igniting a debate about whether there should be limits to t=
he
free flow of information over the Internet, and over the role of the
government in enforcing those restrictions.

Wilson lives in =E2=80=9Ca utopian world in which contraband will be only a=
 notional
concept, because enforcement will require policing ideas and blueprints, not
simply goods,=E2=80=9D Jacob Silverman wrote in a piece about Wilson and the
Liberator in May.

A native of Cabot, Arkansas=E2=80=94a small suburb of Little Rock=E2=80=94W=
ilson said that
the State Department=E2=80=99s action persuaded him to drop out of law scho=
ol and
pursue revolutionary activities full-time. In fact, he had been planning his
next endeavor for a while. When Indiegogo, a crowdfunding site, booted
Defense Distributed=E2=80=99s campaign in August, 2012, for violating its t=
erms of
service=E2=80=94Indiegogo said the project related to the sale of firearms;=
 Wilson
said it was for the creation of information=E2=80=94Wilson began to raise m=
oney by
asking people to support him using a currency called Bitcoin: encrypted,
difficult-to-trace bits of code that function like cash and can be exchanged
over the Internet without a bank or a PayPal account.

Wilson said that he eventually raised two hundred bitcoins for the
Liberator=E2=80=94the equivalent of twenty-seven thousand dollars, accordin=
g to the
current exchange rate. His efforts attracted the attention of a
twenty-five-year-old Brit named Amir Taaki, who e-mailed him with an
invitation to speak at the Bitcoin 2012 Conference, in London. He accepted.

Wilson and Taaki met in person for the first time in January of 2013, when
Taaki took Wilson to visit a workspace for hackers is Bratislava, Slovakia,
and to anarchist squats in London. They reconnected in Berlin that July and
began hashing out a plan to use the as of yet unregulated, untaxed, nearly
untraceable currency in a way that would, like the Liberator, undermine the
ability of governments to regulate the activities of their citizens.

In the Bitcoin world, where banks no longer serve as intermediaries between
people and their money, bank accounts have been replaced by online =E2=80=
=9Cwallets=E2=80=9D
that people can use to virtually store and send bitcoins.

Wilson and Taaki=E2=80=99s project, tentatively known as Dark Wallet, is a =
simple
wallet designed to be easier to use for people who aren=E2=80=99t tech-savv=
y; they
hope that in turn accelerates the currency=E2=80=99s rate of adoption aroun=
d the
world. The wallet will be open-source and free to use. Eventually, Wilson a=
nd
Taaki hope to create a vast stable of Bitcoin-related tools.

The goal, for Wilson, is similar to what he tried to do with the Liberator:
use technology to remove government intervention from his life, and from the
lives of like-minded people.

Unlike many current Bitcoin wallets, which can be difficult to download and
cumbersome to use, Wilson and Taaki are designing Dark Wallet, they told me,
as an easy-to-install plug-in that sits discreetly on users=E2=80=99 Chrome=
 or
Firefox browsers. Made for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, Dark Wallet
would move most of the energy-sucking process of insuring there=E2=80=99s o=
nly one of
each bitcoin in circulation, and that they aren=E2=80=99t spent in two plac=
es at the
same time, to separate servers.

Wilson still lives in Austin, working remotely on Dark Wallet with Taaki, w=
ho
lives in an anarchist compound called Calafou, outside of Barcelona, and
writes most of the code behind the wallet. Taaki and Vitalik Buterin, the
co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, a periodical covering the currency, are part
of a Calafou-based organization called unSystem, which came up with the idea
for the wallet; they=E2=80=99re working with a team of developers from arou=
nd the
world. Wilson, who will manage the development team behind Dark Wallet,
making sure they meet their targets on time, is also producing a video and
other material for a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for the project.

Dark Wallet should be ready sometime in January or February of 2014, Taaki
said, though he=E2=80=99s not committing to anything. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99l=
l launch when it=E2=80=99s ready,=E2=80=9D
he said. And the details of an upcoming crowdfunding campaign have still yet
to be solidified, though Taaki and Wilson expect it to launch sometime in
October.

The person or group that, in 2008, created Bitcoin=E2=80=94that is, release=
d the
protocol that defined what Bitcoin would be=E2=80=94called itself Satoshi N=
akamoto.
The online comments that Satoshi Nakamoto made before disappearing
completely, in 2012, indicate that the creator of Bitcoin, like Wilson, was
deeply mistrustful of economic institutions and designed the currency to be
intentionally subversive.

Bitcoin is created, or =E2=80=9Cmined,=E2=80=9D as it=E2=80=99s called, by =
powerful computers that
race to solve complex math problems and are rewarded for their work with the
encrypted code that is a bitcoin. Today there are 11.7 million of the coins
in existence, worth an estimated $1.6 billion, though their value fluctuates
dramatically. Nakamoto set the number of coins entering circulation to halve
every four years until 2140, when they will plateau at twenty-one million
coins and never be produced again.

Because no one can arbitrarily decide to print more bitcoins, and because no
banks intermediate the storage and spending of the currency, the value of a
bitcoin is determined by market demand. Wilson finds this very attractive.

But where a currency exists, capitalism will inevitably find it. In recent
months, Bitcoin has caught the attention of entrepreneurs, many funded by
venture-capital firms, who have begun building Bitcoin-related start-ups. T=
he
companies include exchanges where people can trade bitcoins, along with
services that let people store and spend the currency in places ranging from
Amazon-style online markets to brick-and-mortar bars and restaurants.

The mainstream entrepreneurs who are interested in Bitcoin have found a hav=
en
in a nonprofit called the Bitcoin Foundation. Writing about Bitcoin in Apri=
l,
Maria Bustillos described its executives as a =E2=80=9Crational and sober g=
roup of
adult administrators=E2=80=9D who stand in contrast with the image of Bitco=
in users
as =E2=80=9Cwild-eyed kids camping out in half-deserted lofts.=E2=80=9D Mem=
bers of the
foundation met in August with several federal agencies, including the Feder=
al
Reserve, the F.B.I., and the Secret Service. On the surface, the meeting was
an educational exercise, meant to explain how Bitcoin works, but many
observers assume it was a step toward regulating the currency.

The foundation, which celebrates its first anniversary this month, calls
itself an advocacy group =E2=80=9Cdedicated to serving the business, techno=
logy,
government relations, and public affairs needs of the Bitcoin community.=E2=
=80=9D One
goal, according to Jon Matonis, its executive director of the Bitcoin
Foundation, is to educate both public and private interests=E2=80=94includi=
ng the
government=E2=80=94about how the currency operates. (=E2=80=9CThe Foundatio=
n is not
pro-regulation as some have claimed, but it is pro-education,=E2=80=9D Mato=
nis has
written, adding that he supports =E2=80=9Cbitcoin education for legislative=
 and
regulatory entities=E2=80=9D and that =E2=80=9Clobbying on behalf of Bitcoi=
n is not
necessarily anti-market.=E2=80=9D)

Wilson, not surprisingly, sees working with the government as a betrayal of
Bitcoin=E2=80=99s fundamental purpose. =E2=80=9CThe public faces of Bitcoin=
 are acting as
counter-revolutionaries,=E2=80=9D he told me. =E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re acti=
vely working to try to
diffuse it, and to pollute it.=E2=80=9D He was referring, he said, not only=
 to the
Bitcoin Foundation but to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in New York
and Silicon Valley who increasingly embrace the currency as a way to profit,
but don=E2=80=99t share his revolutionary aims. (Matonis said he is aware o=
f Wilson=E2=80=99s
concerns. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t see my role as advancing crony capitalis=
m,=E2=80=9D he said.)

Wilson believes Bitcoin should remain the backbone of a separate economy th=
at
undermines the government=E2=80=99s ability to collect taxes and to control=
 the value
of currency=E2=80=94not be subsumed into the mainstream economy.

=E2=80=9CThe state is basically allowed because we have all chosen to use t=
hese
certain institutions to channel our activity and commerce,=E2=80=9D he told=
 me. =E2=80=9CBut
when we are enabled, through alternative means and technologies, to channel
our commerce as we will, channel our production as we will, the state simply
disappears.=E2=80=9D

Not everyone agrees, of course, that society would benefit from the
disappearance of governments. Wilson used the Liberator to make the point
that the government shouldn=E2=80=99t regulate the flow of information; he =
wants to
use Bitcoin to help build an economy outside of the government=E2=80=99s re=
ach.

But his ideology, taken to its logical conclusion, would also leave services
like roads, libraries, fire fighting, and policing in the hands of the
private sector=E2=80=94whose interests may not be aligned, Wilson=E2=80=99s=
 critics argue,
with those of the public at large.

Wilson knows that he could see blowback for his stance against the
foundation: as a self-described =E2=80=9Ccrypto-anarchist,=E2=80=9D perhaps=
 he shouldn=E2=80=99t be
so concerned with who is or isn=E2=80=99t determining the currency=E2=80=99=
s future. And if
the U.S. government attempts to regulate the currency, which seems likely,
Wilson will also find himself once again in direct opposition to the
government.

Wilson and the suit-and-tie-wearing people at the Bitcoin Foundation share a
common interest in bringing Bitcoin to as many people as possible. The
foundation seems willing to play nicely with the establishment, and has been
open to hearing about the interests of old-school players like venture
capitalists and government regulators. Wilson, however, who was only recent=
ly
firing an illicit gun into the desert, isn=E2=80=99t looking only for a new=
 currency
but for another way to liberate himself=E2=80=94and others=E2=80=94from gov=
ernment oversight.

Michael del Castillo is the technology and innovation reporter at Upstart
Business Journal, a member of American City Business Journals, which is a
sister publication to Cond=C3=A9 Nast. A graduate of Columbia University, h=
e is
also the cofounder of Literary Manhattan, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting
Manhattan=E2=80=99s literary community and creating new ways to appreciate
literature.
