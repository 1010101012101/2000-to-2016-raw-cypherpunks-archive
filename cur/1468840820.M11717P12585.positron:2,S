Who owns merica's debt? (And the chinese involvement)

This was intended as reply to juan's reply, but deserves
another thread.

juan claimed the chinese are against 'merica.

i thought that the chinese are the main 'merica public debt
creditor, but can't find reference for this on the
interwebz.

| Who owns America's debt?

| Donald Trump says he can "make a deal" on America's debt.

| Last week, he implied that he could negotiate with America's creditors to get them to accept a lower rate of repayment, such as 85 cents for every dollar. 

| The top holder by far is U.S. citizens and American entities, such as state and local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and the Federal Reserve. Together they own the vast majority -- 67.5% -- of the debt.

| China's share of the debt is sizable -- about 7% -- but it's hardly the largest holder of U.S. government bonds.

What do you expect from 'mericuns? They are creditors of
themselves, lol. And they "negotiate" paying less...

Though the chinese give mericuns virtual money, they don't mind
stealing from them:
