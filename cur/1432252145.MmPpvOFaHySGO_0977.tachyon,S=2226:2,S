No more of that-I will have a good read. I am
basically confused of the fact

we don't know - or it wouldn't be random :)

We say that, we-don't know or it wont be random. Then
we say that we must see roughly equal numbers of heads
and tails for large trials. Thats what I fail to
understand.



The idea of a perfect random experiment was taken just
to understand the concept.
