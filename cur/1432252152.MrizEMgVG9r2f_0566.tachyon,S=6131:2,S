"Tyler Durden's"

GET them damn quote marks offa my name, or I'm comin' over there to stomp 
your pasty-white British ass!!!!!

Ahem.

As for Tim May's replies to my original post, he seems to have 
misenterpreted most of the basic gist of it. My basic point was that 
corporate culture (as you say) basically imitates a monarchy (or other very 
'statist' structures) and as a result often prevents them from utilizing 
their resources properly.

It would be nice to think of Borders as a counter-example, and I'd LIKE to 
believe that utilizing their talent-on-the-floor has helped them do so well 
here in the US. (Though these mega-Barnes-and-Nobles may have dented their 
numbers in the last few years...)
