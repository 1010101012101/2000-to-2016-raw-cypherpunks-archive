It's not difficult at all, you can play semantic games all day long. If you want to get down to absolutes NOTHING is a fact... I choose to put my faith in what seems to be the most obvious truth, based on a preponderance of scientific evidence. Anyone who chooses otherwise, particularly with important shit like this, just doesn't give a fuck or just doesn't get it, IMO.
