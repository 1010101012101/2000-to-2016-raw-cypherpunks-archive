#    There's no cpunks mail in the queue at lne.
#    If you're still subscribed (there's no
#    "George@Orwellian.Org" in the subscriber list but
#    I assume that's not the address you receive

I received the above via my subscription route,
which is cyberpass.net.

Sub name is cypherpunks@Orwellian.Org.

So, three emails were dropped, to me at least.
That is, they didn't make it from lne thru
cyberpass.

The above one did make it.
