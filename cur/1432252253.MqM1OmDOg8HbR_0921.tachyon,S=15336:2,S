This is a TIME SENSITIVE ANNOUNCEMENT pertinent to Lawyers,
Attorneys, Law Firms and other Legal Professionals regarding
the immediate liquidation sale of 24 High Quality .COM 
domains suitable for Legal Professionals.

All domains must be liquidated immediately, so now is your
opportunity to take advantage of this special offer.  Each
of these .COM domain names are valued at over $5,000 but
they must be sold immediately, so for a limited time you
can get yours for only $1995!

Why are these domains being sold off?  Good question, and 
I'll be honest with you.  I acquired these domains for
investment purposes with the intent to use them for a
developing business, however due to cash flow requirements I
need to immediately liquidate my assets.  That's why you are
now being offered such a great deal.

READ THIS EMAIL BECAUSE IT MAY BOOST YOUR LEGAL 
BUSINESS!

Great Legal Profession .COM domains are virtually all taken
up.  This announcement is your opportunity to acquire a
memorable and effective domain name to better market your
legal services.  LEGAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE MANY RESTRICTIONS
pertaining to marketing their services in most regions.
Take better advantage of what little opportunities are
available for marketing of your legal services.  

***** REMARKABLE RESULTS FOR YOU!!! *****

Boost your Legal practice with a highly memorable and
marketable .COM web name. .COM domains are considered the
most valuable and prestigious of all.  Imagine having an
easy to remember web name on your marketing materials and
advertisements.  Potential clients will find it easier to
find your website, and won't they be impressed with a
good web name?  In fact, many people on the Internet are
influenced by the web name of a company in deciding whether
the company is credible, and worth doing business with.

THINK OF THE MARKETING ADVANTAGE THIS COULD MEAN FOR 
YOU!
Considering the limitations imposed on advertising and
marketing for Legal Professionals in most regions, this
business expense may easily improve your "COMPETITIVE EDGE"
in PROMOTING YOUR LEGAL SERVICES.

YOUR .COM IS YOUR INTERNET REAL ESTATE, AND YOUR NAME 
IS
LIKE THE CLICHE "LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION"!

***** OUTRAGEOUS!!! *****

The best domain names for Legal Professions would be names
like lawyers.com, legal.com, attorney.com, and a few other
one-word domain names.  These are memorable, and highly
valuable.  The purchase value of the above domains is in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars, if they were available for
sale.  They are virtually impossible for you to get.

***** REALISTIC FOR YOU *****

Multi-word domains descriptive of one's services may be used
effectively.  Names such as legalhelpservice.com,
justicelawfirm.com, and servicelawyer.com have already been
purchased because they have great marketing value, but are
now being made available to you!  Here is a list of the 24
domains available for a limited time:
