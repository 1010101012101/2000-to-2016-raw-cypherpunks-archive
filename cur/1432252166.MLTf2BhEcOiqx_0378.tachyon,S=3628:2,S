Pure bullshit, putting it politely. More accurately self-serving
bullshit. None of these bear-hugging rhetoricians have the guts
to do what Manning and Snowden have done, nor those who
have been their clients, speechifying fees and funding topics,
career boosters, campaign posters, cowardly woe-is-the-US
industry while enjoying the beltway and coastal perks and
prizes beloved of arm chair pundits and civil liberties pimps.

This is vulgar behavior parading as valiant derring-do, never
ever crossing the red line of genuine courage.

Merely thanking Snowden and Manning, rather than crossing
the line of lawfulness into their fearful terrain is as predictable
national security mongering on all sides.

Pity Snowden for falling into their trap.

And burn that ACLU card after gazing at the 1/2 million
salary of its slick director over-paid to suck the teats
of excessively wealthy under cover of thousands of
lesser contributors corraled into craven water-carrying
for legal actions amply exploited for billable hours.

Why Wyden and his ilk milk insider knowledge as if
privileged journalists should be no mystery. It is the
coin of kings.
