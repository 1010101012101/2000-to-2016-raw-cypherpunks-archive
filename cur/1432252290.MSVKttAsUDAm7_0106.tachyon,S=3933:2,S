#1. I wonder what was used to encrypt the letter and how they were able to
decrypt it. Did he give them the password? Was the encryption weak (it would
be funny if he had used DES)? Blah blah blah...

#2. Our (I'm US) govt. can't even keep its own members from spying on it.
Yet they have a problem with us exporting crypto tools so that mom and dad
can buy their goods over the net? Or they are afraid that terrorists will
get ahold of something they can download off the net already. Hmmm...gotta
love the US govt.
