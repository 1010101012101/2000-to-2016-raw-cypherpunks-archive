Web Scammer Targets
Senior U.S. Executives
Email Hoax Believed
To Dupe Thousands;
Mr. Stewart's Pursuit

By CHRISTOPHER RHOADS

November 9, 2007; Page A1

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. -- For months, a sophisticated hacker has been stealing
the personal data of American corporate executives.

Hot on the hacker's trail is Joe Stewart. The former
bass-guitarist-turned-cyber-sleuth stumbled onto the case in February.
Since then, the 36-year-old Mr. Stewart has spent weeks in his office, in a
nondescript building next to a half-abandoned strip mall here, virtually
chasing the mysterious perpetrator across several continents. Mr. Stewart
early on thought he had traced the scammer to China, then realized it was a
false lead. Only when the perpetrator stumbled did Mr. Stewart get a break
in the case.

Mr. Stewart, a top researcher for Atlanta-based Internet security firm
SecureWorks Inc., says most of the scammed executives declined requests to
discuss their experience. He says they include senior executives at Fortune
500 companies, working in industries from airlines and banks to
manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. The number of those affected is likely
in the thousands. In May, Mr. Stewart, who works closely with law
enforcement, says he found one cache of data stolen by the scam from more
than 1,400 executives.

News of the con, which specifically targeted intended victims with
personalized emails, quickly swept through the nation's Internet security
ranks. This scammer "knew your name, your title and your organization,"
says Jose Nazario, a researcher in the Ann Arbor, Mich., office of Arbor
Networks Inc., an Internet security company.

In the early days of the Internet, hackers broke into large computer
systems just to prove they could. Later, mischief-makers created and
blasted "virus" software world-wide, rapidly infecting millions of
terminals within hours and slowing legitimate Internet traffic.

Over the years, Americans also became acquainted with the email scam, such
as a sender posing as a bank and asking for account information. Such scams
often were loaded with grammatical and spelling errors and lacked details
tailored to the recipient. They were sent far and wide in hopes of hooking
a few naove victims.

But in the past two years, law-enforcement officials and Internet security
experts say the global growth of broadband has fed a dramatic jump not only
in the quantity but also the quality of cyber-attacks.

MessageLabs, a New York-based Internet security firm, says the number of
hoax emails addressing recipients by their names and including their
professional affiliation, among other personal details, has soared in
recent months. In mid-September, the company discovered more than 1,100
such emails over a 16-hour period, and in late June more than 500 over two
hours. Last year, it rarely saw more than one of these emails a day.


One factor behind the change is the explosion in popularity of social
networking Web sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, which give scammers access
to information like a person's professional title and company affiliation.
Mr. Stewart figures at least some of the targeted executives were found by
the scammer searching for those with "C"s in their titles, like CEOs and
CFOs. Corporate Web sites and news releases also provide helpful data for
criminals.

What's more, since many executives answer email directly, they are directly
accessible in ways their predecessors weren't.

Then there's the wide availability of illicit skills online. Criminals on
the Web used to have to design and program their own viruses and scams.
Now, such expertise can be purchased online for several hundred dollars.

Armed with such tools, scammers can target specific groups of people, such
as wealthy executives. The emails are sophisticated enough to dupe even
discriminating Web users.

One morning in May, such an email landed in the inbox of Scott Foernsler,
head of global sales at Air2Web Inc., an Atlanta mobile messaging and
marketing company. It informed him that a Better Business Bureau complaint
had been filed against him and asked him to click an attached link to
respond.

The email featured the Better Business Bureau's familiar torch logo running
across its top on a blue background. It addressed Mr. Foernsler by name and
also provided the name of his firm as well as a case number. The sender's
email address: consumer-complaints@bbb.org.

The email looked so professional that Mr. Foernsler, an executive with 22
years of sales experience, never suspected a thing. "Anything about our
customers I want to take action on," he says. He clicked on the link and
was informed he would be contacted again. Mr. Foernsler then received
another email informing him that the complaint had been resolved. He gave
the matter no further thought until early June, when SecureWorks notified
him that his computer was infected.

By clicking on the bogus complaint link, he had downloaded software that
was sending anything he then inputted online -- such as passwords,
credit-card numbers, usernames, banking information and personal browsing
-- to a Web site controlled by a criminal.

Mr. Foernsler has since changed all his passwords and usernames and had the
software removed. But like the other executives scammed, he has no idea
what information was stolen -- or what criminals may be doing with it.

One of a handful of Web sleuths to proactively go after bad guys, Mr.
Stewart is chasing this con artist largely on his own. With Internet
service providers more focused on signing up subscribers and law
enforcement only recently bulking up on resources, policing the Web relies
heavily on a loosely coordinated community of obscure university
researchers, volunteers and security experts of varying backgrounds and
expertise.

"It's like the Old West when there was very little law enforcement for a
large territory," says Mr. Stewart.

A dogged gumshoe, Mr. Stewart almost never got into computers. He taught
himself programming languages on his sixth-grade teacher's computer after
school, but abandoned the hobby several years later, assuming there were
few interesting careers in the field. It was the late-1980s, before the
existence of the commercial Internet. Mr. Stewart turned his attention to
radio broadcasting in college, but dropped out when he ran out of money for
tuition.

With a wife and two young boys to support, Mr. Stewart stocked shelves at a
Lowe's Home Improvement store during the day and at night alternated
between stacking shoes in a shoe store and mopping floors at a Pizza Hut
restaurant.

In 1996, Mr. Stewart's mother gave him her old computer. He scrounged up
enough money to get online and began programming again, occasionally fixing
computers for friends. That led to a job as an analyst with an Internet
security firm in town, which was eventually acquired by his current company
SecureWorks.

Mr. Stewart quickly gained notice for his willingness to post his findings
online, in order to make others aware of new threats and to share his
various techniques. Many experts demur out of fear of retribution. After
Russian hackers described by Mr. Stewart attacked his personal Web site,
SecureWorks decided to remove the company sign from the Myrtle Beach
office. The gray, one-story building is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence,
with a security camera at the gate.

Mr. Stewart first became aware of the Better Business Bureau scam last
February, when a colleague forwarded him the email. Mr. Stewart was
impressed with the email's professional appearance and its tactic of
striking at the recipient's desire to keep customers happy.

Server in China

He gave chase. Mr. Stewart found the attack was hosted on a new domain name
registered on a server located in China, under the name Li Hu. The
registrar that sold the domain name did business only in Chinese. At one
point the attack was collecting 70 megabytes of data every day.

The attacks escalated. By the beginning of June, the virus was unleashing
nearly 43,000 fake emails a day on SecureWorks clients alone.

But Mr. Stewart began to believe the scam did not originate from China. The
typical Chinese scams involve extracting trade secrets from companies and
governments. Moreover, Chinese computers are often enlisted in attacks by
scammers trying to conceal their location. Since a high number of Chinese
computers use pirated software, security measures are low, making them
particularly vulnerable to enlistment in cyber armies controlled by others.

Realizing the Chinese connection was a decoy, Mr. Stewart began looking for
clues in the cache of stolen data. Before Mr. Stewart found it, the scammer
had moved the stolen data with increasing frequency. Mr. Stewart tracked it
to Web sites hosted on a server in Dallas, then Philadelphia, Toronto and
back to Dallas.

In late-June, Mr. Stewart discovered the perpetrator had made a costly
mistake. Combing through the stolen cache of data he had found, Mr. Stewart
noticed one infected computer had accessed a familiar Web site address --
the same one used to host the scam. Mr. Stewart concluded the scammer had
mistakenly infected his own computer. Now he had the scammer's computer
address, a numerical address attached to every computer.

Public sources available online show the Internet service provider where
every computer online in the world is registered. Law enforcement can use
that information to identify -- and in some cases eventually arrest -- the
suspect.

Armed with his first real clues, Mr. Stewart was then able to obtain files
from other Web site hosting services associated with the address. He began
piecing together the person's identity, tracing his online activity back
several years. He found connections between this scam and others that used
the same Web server and employed similar coding techniques, leading to
additional email addresses, online aliases and Web sites most likely used
over the years by the same person.

Those included a Web site for what initially appeared to be a legitimate
investment company, called Ronald West, and another for a company called
Beitel Electronics. Both turned out to be bogus names used as part of his
criminal operation. Mr. Stewart found an older version of the Beitel
Electronics site under the name Trispective. A Google search of that name
led to an array of postings dating back several years from a young Romanian
male.

Those postings provided additional details: The person is fluent in
English; born on July 21, 1982; and often goes by the online alias
"Raynor," a reference to a character from the online game Starcraft.

Professional criminals on the Web rarely leave clues, but there is a point
in their lives when they are just entering the field and still learning how
to conceal themselves. That formative period -- still traceable on the
Internet -- can provide tidbits of information critical to unlocking the
person's identity.

Using the variety of names he had collected, he found one posting from late
2002 under the name Trispective, showing that the individual at the time
owned and wanted to sell the domain name thegov.org. Using an archival Web
tool, Mr. Stewart in mid-June found an actual photo of "Raynor" attached to
the site at the time.

It shows a glowering young man standing in what appears to be a computer
room, with tiled walls and a bank of computer terminals behind him. He has
dark, heavy eyebrows, jet-black bangs hanging over his face and a holstered
gun strapped over his shoulder. Mr. Stewart forwarded his collected
evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The agency in recent years
has stationed agents in Romania and more than 60 other countries to follow
up on such leads.

"We are in an electronic arms race," says Shawn Henry, deputy assistant
director of the FBI's cyber-crime division. "Every time our technology
catches up with the latest [malicious software], the bad guys come up with
another way to get in." He declined to comment on whether the agency is
investigating Raynor. The person using that screen name did not respond to
an email seeking comment.

The scam is still circulating -- one week last month SecureWorks detected
8,323 such emails -- though it is likely being done by copycats. The scam
has also taken other forms, including an email that purported to be from
the Internet Revenue Service informing recipients they are being
investigated for tax fraud. Another version sent a phony invoice for
services rendered.

Raynor's Advantage

Raynor's biggest advantage: lack of awareness, since most of its victims
are too embarrassed to go public. Patrick Boegel, an executive with an
advertising company in Albany, N.Y., called Media Logic, discovered the
scam software on his computer after Mr. Stewart contacted him.

Mr. Boegel didn't believe it at first, but eventually was able to determine
that several things were compromised, including log-in information for
email and other Web sites, including a photo gallery site. Initially
willing to discuss his experience, Mr. Boegel later declined, citing
"company policy."

Mr. Boegel was lucky. His data was found by Mr. Stewart, and he was told
what was happening. Nobody -- except perhaps Raynor -- knows how many
executives were ensnared, how much data stolen, or the financial toll.

Mr. Stewart's pursuit continues. Late last month, Mr. Stewart found the
Romanian had come up with a new idea: sending infected emails purportedly
from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission telling recipients a
harassment complaint was filed against them. This week, Raynor was sending
as many as 1,000 such emails to SecureWorks clients each day.
