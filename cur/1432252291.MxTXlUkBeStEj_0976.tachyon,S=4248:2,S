Based on preliminary reports, this is what seems to have happened on
Tuesday evening: Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a UCLA student, was quietly
studying in the campus library around 11:30pm. Campus police asked him
for his ID, a usual procedure. Mostafa didn't have it with him and
walked toward the exit.

While en route, one of the police officers laid a hand on Mostafa (which
may well be simple battery) and he reacted by saying "Get off of me."
That's when he was hit with a blast from a Taser, which can render
someone unable to walk for 5 to 15 minutes.

But the cops, through malice or ignorance, kept demanding that Mostafa
immediately stand up and walk to the door. He was screaming at this
point and said he could not, at which point they Tased him again and again.

The cops also threatened to Taser bystanders as well if they persisted
in asking for badge numbers. This, too, is on videotape and is in fact a
crime. (Think that cop will go to jail? Right.)

Excerpt:
"They have been used against unruly schoolchildren... and people who
argue with police or fail to comply immediately with a command. Cases
described in this report include the stunning of a 15-year-old
schoolgirl in Florida, following a dispute on a bus, and a 13- year-old
girl in Arizona, who threw a book in a public library."
