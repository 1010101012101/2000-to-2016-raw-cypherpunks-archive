"This week Ellison offered specifics about his proposal in an interview..."

"The new ID's would be voluntary for everyone except immigrants..."

"Q: why is a national ID necessary? A: All ... IDs are different and they are easy to counterfeit.  My pilot's license ... is cut from a piece of cardboard."

"Q: You've offered ... the database software for free.  What about maintenance, tech support and upgrades?  A: In terms of associated services we have a very wealthy government. I don't think the government has any trouble paying for the labor associated with the software...   What's in it for me is the same thing that's in it for you: a safer America."

"Q: How do you take this beyond the talking stage? A: I've been back in Washington talking to the FBI, the CIA, ... had lunch with Attorney General Ashcroft...there are meetings planned at the White House..."

...ad nauseum
