Who indeed?

The Zionist Entity claims they need their germs, their chemicals, and 
their nukes (which they say they do not have, wink, wink) as a 
deterrent against the sand niggers who want their farms and orchards 
and shops back.

As the Zionists have emulated nearly every other measure of their 
teachers, including concentration camps, identity checkpoints, and a 
socialized economy, one wonders why they do not go ahead and deploy the 
Final Solution?
