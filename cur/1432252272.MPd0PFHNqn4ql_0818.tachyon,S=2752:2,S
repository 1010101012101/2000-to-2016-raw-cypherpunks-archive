You are pretending, not very well, to be someone you are not.

As to whether the real you is a government provocateur, I
have no idea.  But the real you is not this persona "Aimee",
nor does it have the beliefs to which "Aimee" pretends.  You
are also making an effort to conceal your writing style, or
writing in a style that is not natural to you.
