I thought everyone knew that the U.S. Constitution was secretly 
suspended by the Emergency Secrecy Order of 1862, with the suspension 
renewed and expanded by the Double Secret Emergency Order of 1913, 
establishing the Federal Reserve and imposing personal income reporting 
orders. And in the 1930s the Communists in power imposed more secret 
orders than I can hope to list. One of these was the That Which Cannot 
be Written Down secret order on radio and newspaper distribution.

Since then, both fascist and communist regimes have expanded the list of 
secret orders.

The fact that many regulations contradict each other is seen a a feature 
rather than as a bug.
