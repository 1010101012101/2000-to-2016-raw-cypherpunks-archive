There are many patterns to these emails.

We've got the 'legitimate' spam, and then there is the spam that gets sent
to the list by members who subscribe the list to the spammers.

Then theres emails which are spam sitting in peoples inbox that gets
retransmitted by viruses, worms, and trojans. They may have started out as
spam but they've been hijacked for more nepharious purposes. Usually these
have lots of garbbled text in them.

Then ther are emails like the previous which are just 'snow' to blind the
users.

Another is non-english text. We've been seeing a lot more of these over
the last six months or so.

We've also been seeing lists of words being sent to email addresses. The
purpose is to dictionary attack the various security passwords on the
list.

It wouldn't surprise me one bit considering the human mind if a lot of the
spam we get isn't from non-spammers themselves. Priming the pump so to
speak.
