I was just referring to the Snowden documents.

Ok, CryptoAG is a story of its own, I agree. But they are not that much of a
major hardware vendor, either. Depends on which customer base you consider.

Agreed, but in the end it is important how they act in the long term. But
that needs more time to come until conclusions can be drawn. It is much more
difficult for hardware vendors to strike such good PR stunts as Google did.

Also, I guess, Google had this change in the works for a longer time,
otherwise I don't know if they could make the switch to crypto for
their internal cross-DC links so rapidly. It still seems a lot of work
+ testing and their services seem highly depending on good latency.

Greetings,
