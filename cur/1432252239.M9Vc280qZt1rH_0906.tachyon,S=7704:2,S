the whole system is based on anonymity, which means it'd be hard to get

If this system were operated from overseas, it would be difficult or
impossible to restrict communication with the main organization, etc. I 
believe that the enthusiastic support by some well-known software company
(even if they didn't intend to actually run or assist in the running of the
operation itself) would make the politicians shit bricks, leading to a
cathartic national debate that we sorely need. > I do have some ideas for

(Anti-abortion
activists are the group which come most immediately to my mind, BTW. I'm
not in sympathy with them; quite the opposite.) I've never claimed that
this system is totally immune to such abuse, in the same way that the seller
of a gun can certify that it will never be used to commit a crime. >B. I 
don't trust the average person to look ahead enough to make this

Politics" will achieve this "crypto anarchy"
even if only a tiny fraction of the population participate and use it. The
reason is that the number of decision-maker government employees is
comparatively small and most will resign before being "terminated." (with
extreme prejudice.) The total cost to bring down the US government will
probably be substantially less than $100 million. > In other words, the

  I've been asked what I think would be the average payoff for a medium-level
government official "kill" would be. Naturally, that would be
market-driven, but it is reasonable to assume that most of the payment for a
CURRENT contract killing is based on the risk; not merely the risk of doing
the job and/or getting caught, but also the risk of dealing with (and
trusting, etc) the other guy. I suspect that the vast majority of
convictions for contract killings occur not because the killer was caught in
the act, but because of these relationships associated with it. Since 
"Assassination Politics" promises essentially perfect anonymity to the
donors as well as the "predictors", the majority of the "risk" associated
with having such a job done would be far lower than currently. I estimate,
therefore, that you could get "action" for around $10,000. Since 
"Assassination Politics" is based on a combined-donation system, even
people on a subsistence wage could contribute; a quarter here, a dollar
there, pretty soon it turns into real money.

Allen I understand your concern. I wish there was some simple argument I could
give which would assuage your fears. However, I look at it this way: The
Federal government (and all other governments, around the world) are
currently parasites on the rest of the population. Now "parasite theory" is
that the parasite has some sort of optimum "parasite level" above which he
cannot go. Once the cost for such parasitism is removed, there will be an
economic boom for those "hosts" of the parasite. Naturally, the parasite 
will be in trouble, but that's only justice.

Has the US dollar depreciated that much in 6 years parasite justine?
