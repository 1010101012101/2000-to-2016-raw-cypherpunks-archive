Actually, yesterday was my last day on Signet's payroll; there has been
some writing (both English and Java) regarding risk transfer, signatures,
evidence, etc., at Signet, but the legal and technical people who were
gathered at Signet have pretty much dispersed to other, more fruitful
projects. I don't know what direction(s) the company will move in the
future.

I seem to be eternally a few hours away from finishing a paper on
the legal aspects of digital signatures - but the really short version
is that context and intent are crucial. Software applications and
business applications which don't take those aspects of a signature
into account are likely to be useless at best and dangerous at worst.
