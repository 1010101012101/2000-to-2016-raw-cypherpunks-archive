I just got my wife a Bvlgari watch and she really loves it. I can't afford to spend $30 000 on a watch for her, though I would love to; but this did the trick. It looks exactly like the real thing and she's actually glad I didn't spend $30 000 on a watch but saved $29 750 instead. This turned out perfect guys, thanks for providing such a great product, with such great prices. This was a great experience ordering from your company.
