Depends on your definition of progress.  I think that the work that
esp. Goldreich has been doing in the foundations of cryptography (ie,
http://www.toc.lcs.mit.edu/~oded/tfoc.html) is very exciting stuff,
because it pushes us towards a solid grounding for systems, and away
from the need for one of a dozen or so really solid cryptanalysts to
look at each system published.

Is this progress in the space of librarization, standardization, or
economics of security?  No.  But we need stronger foundations in both
security and crypto in order to justify the investments in it.  When a
company can spend really large sums of money for only small assurance
that its systems are more secure, its a hard decision to justify.
(Not that there aren't justifications, they're just non-obvious.)
When those investments are butressed by an understanding that the
features will work as planned, they'll be easier to make.

Speaking for myself,

Adam
