Aside from Dimitry, 

Has any "person" been successfully prosecuted under
the DMCA? or under UCITA? or any other of these
anti-piracy laws in the US? 

Operation Sundevil took place a relatively long
time ago. We all hear dire warnings relative to
software piracy and rumors of the Secret Service
showing up and shutting a company down for bootleg
M$ Office products and such things. But has anything
like this actually happened? 

Yes, I hear folks go on and on about Steve Jackson
Games, but I haven't seen anyone really concern themselves
too much about the millions of bootlegs of M$ and Adon'tBee
products in use in corporate america. 

Where lies the truth?

anyone?
