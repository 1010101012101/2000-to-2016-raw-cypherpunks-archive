> Receiving a ZixMail message is simple: You get a regular e-mail message in 
which there is a link to a secure (SSL) web page. From there, if you've never 
used ZixMail before, you set up a key for yourself by adding your e-mail address 
and a password to the database. (Any e-mail address will do, but be aware that 
your "key" will be linked to that particular e-mail address from now on — you 
can't use another e-mail address for sending or receiving ZixMail without going 
through this setup again.)

(Get this:)

ZixIt quietly generates a key for you and stores it on their server for future 
use.

(Both halves? Zap. End program.)

Now you can go read and respond to the encrypted e-mail from your friend or 
colleague at the ZixMail web site. That e-mail can be responded to, back and 
forth, for an unlimited period of time — you cannot, however, generate a new 
piece of e-mail (unrelated, to another person) unless you download the software 
and run it yourself.
