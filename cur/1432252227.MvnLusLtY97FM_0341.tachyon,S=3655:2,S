Oops.  I sent a message earlier, before noticing this message, 
where some remarks did not hold Mr. Terranson in the highest 
regard.  This appears to be a misunderstanding between Declan 
and Mr. Terranson.  I apologize for any remarks using Mr. 
Terranson as an example.  I believe my comments are still valid 
with the references to Mr. Terranson removed.

My apologises to Mr. Terranson.

I mean what would you expect from a representative of FBN 
Technical Services!!
