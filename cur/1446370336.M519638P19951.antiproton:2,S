[Quote from Brandenburg:]
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919. From 1917 to 192=
0, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territ=
ories. E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the Unit=
ed States 21 (1939). In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of=
 California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code =C2=A7=C2=A7=C2=A011=
400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio.=
=C2=A0Whitney v. California,=C2=A0274 U.S. 357=C2=A0(1927). The Court uphel=
d the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means =
to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the securit=
y of the State that the State may outlaw it.=C2=A0Cf. Fiske v. Kansas,=C2=
=A0274 U.S. 380=C2=A0(1927). But=C2=A0Whitney=C2=A0has been thoroughly disc=
redited by later decisions.=C2=A0See=C2=A0Dennis v. United States,=C2=A0341=
 U.S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principl=
e that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not p=
ermit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law=
 violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing =
imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.=C2=
=A0[n2]=C2=A0As we=C2=A0[p448]=C2=A0said in=C2=A0Noto v. United States,=C2=
=A0367 U.S. 290, 297-298 (1961),the mere abstract teaching . . . of the mor=
al propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is =
not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to suc=
h action.See also Herndon v. Lowry,=C2=A0301 U.S. 242, 259-261 (1937);=C2=
=A0Bond v. Floyd,=C2=A0385 U.S. 116, 134 (1966). A statute which fails to d=
raw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by=
 the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation spe=
ech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control.=C2=A0Cf=
. Yates v. United States,=C2=A0354 U.S. 298=C2=A0(1957);=C2=A0De Jonge v. O=
regon,=C2=A0299 U.S. 353=C2=A0(1937);=C2=A0Stromberg v. California,=C2=A028=
3 U.S. 359=C2=A0(1931).=C2=A0See also United States v. Robel,=C2=A0389 U.S.=
 258=C2=A0(1967);Keyishian v. Board of Regents,=C2=A0385 U.S. 589=C2=A0(196=
7);=C2=A0Elfbrandt v. Russell,=C2=A0384 U.S. 11=C2=A0(1966);=C2=A0Aptheker =
v. Secretary of State,=C2=A0378 U.S. 500(1964);=C2=A0Baggett v. Bullitt,=C2=
=A0377 U.S. 360=C2=A0(1964).Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndical=
ism Act cannot be sustained. The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teac=
h the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishi=
ng industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display =
any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission=
 of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriet=
y of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" =
with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndica=
lism." Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jur=
y in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime[p449]=C2=A0=
in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent law=
less action.=C2=A0[n3]Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute wh=
ich, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and =
to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to a=
dvocate the described type of action.=C2=A0[n4]=C2=A0Such a statute falls w=
ithin the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The contrary=
 teaching of=C2=A0Whitney v. California, supra,=C2=A0cannot be supported, a=
nd that decision is therefore overruled.Reversed.
