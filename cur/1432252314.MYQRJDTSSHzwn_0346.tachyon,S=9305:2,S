	I'm not mad. I simply don't bother with fake politeness.

	That's not what free market governance stands for although some
	utilitarians  may say stuff along those lines.

	Well, if you do hate being controlled, I hope you're not
	supporting government(s)...

	'true capitalism' requires unconditional respect for individual
	rights. Governments do not respect those rights at all so I'm
	not sure how you manage to equate criminal competition between
	criminal organizations (competing mafias or 'governments') with
	'true capitalism'.

	Unless of course your argument is simply misrepresentation.

	Well, that is a possibility and I imagine it's favored by a few
	people...

	So you are just another government advocate? And a world

	I knew that song. It's pretty good. I remember reading a random
	forum with some americans discussing it, and some saying 
	that although the song might be satire, it was also praise for
	american 'culture' - oh well...

	Of course. US govt using https in their stupid propaganda
	websites is irrelant. What is weird is that some US govt
	employee bothered to advertise it here. Is he clueless?
	Was he trolling?
