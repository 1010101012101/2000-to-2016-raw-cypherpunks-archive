I'm pretty sure that my posting rate dropped long before I came to
ZeroKnowledge.  Many of the factors you describe contributed; the lack 
of new things being said here, increasing demands from my previous
startup (Netect), and from ZK.

Likely true about my posting rate.  However, I think that some of the
new stuff we're working on is actually quite interesting, and I'm
planning to stay here.  I do filter the list heavily, tend to read
only the first few paragraphs of text, etc.

Sad as it makes me, I don't know of any system which allows 2-way
untracability and fraud prevention.  Can you point me to one?  With
trustworthy reputation systems, you might be able to get away from
this problem.  I don't know of any reputation system that I'd trust
for a multi-hundred dollar transaction today.  (Speaking of
reputation, Syverson and Dingledine have done some new work on
reputations and cascade mixes, at
http://www.freehaven.net/doc/casc-rep/)
