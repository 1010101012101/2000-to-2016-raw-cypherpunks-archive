Bush Order on Military Tribunals is Further Evidence
That Government is Abandoning Democracy's Checks and Balances

Statement of Laura W. Murphy, Director
ACLU Washington National Office

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, November 14, 2001
WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply disturbed 
by President Bush's executive order allowing special military 
tribunals to try non-citizens charged with terrorism. The tribunals 
would even reach non-citizens in the United States, including lawful 
permanent residents.

To our knowledge, the move to establish a military tribunal when 
Congress has not declared war is unprecedented.

We do not believe that the Administration has shown that the 
constitutional jury trial system does not allow for the prosecution 
of those accused of terrorist activities. Absent such a compelling 
justification, the President's decision is further evidence that the 
Administration is totally unwilling to abide by the checks and 
balances that are so central to our democracy.

The use of military tribunals would apparently authorize secret 
trials without a jury and without the requirement of a unanimous 
verdict and would limit a defendant's opportunities to confront the 
evidence against him and choose his own lawyer. What's worse, these 
important legal protections would be removed in a situation where 
defendants may very well be facing the death penalty.

It is difficult to understand how the Administration can justify the 
use of a tribunal when the United States has successfully tried in 
our courts non-citizens accused of terrorist acts, organized crime, 
and others in situations where the safety of jurors and the 
disclosure of government intelligence methods were at issue.

As the prosecutions of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers and 
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh demonstrate, the government has 
managed to protect the safety and identity of jurors while achieving 
convictions in terrorism cases. And there is already a system 
established to handle classified information in the course of a 
trial; it is called the Classified Information Procedures Act. For 
decades, CIPA has adequately balanced national security and due 
process concerns. The government has made no showing that CIPA 
procedures would not be adequate in these circumstances as well.

Further, it would be hypocritical of the United States to impose such 
a tribunal when we have repeatedly protested the use of such courts 
against U.S. citizens abroad.

Congress has already given the Administration and the Justice 
Department virtually everything they asked for to fight terrorism. 
This latest move, combined with the Justice Department's announced 
intentions to eavesdrop on attorney conversations with inmates and to 
begin interviewing foreign visitors to the United States, 
demonstrates the government's increasing willingness to circumvent 
the requirements of the Bill of Rights.

We call on Congress to exercise its oversight powers before the Bill 
of Rights in America is distorted beyond recognition.

Subject: FC: Text of Bush's order creating military tribunals for civilians

Many folks wrote to me pointing out that President Bush's order was
online this morning, probably by the time I sent my note to
Politech. It also appeared in today's New York Times. Mea culpa. I
wrote my note last night, but did not doublecheck before sending it
out this morning and heading off to the Cato Institute conference for
the day.

I haven't has as much time to look at this as I'd like, but the order
says military tribunals will hear cases dealing with only an accused
terrorist "who is not a United States citizen."

Jason Zengerle has a perhaps-prescient article giving arguments
for a military tribunal here:

                                                     For Immediate Release
                                             Office of the Press Secretary
                                                         November 13, 2001

    Military Order
    Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War
    Against Terrorism

    By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief
    of the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the
    laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for
    Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat.
    224) and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:

    Section 1.  Findings.

    (a)  International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have
    carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel
    and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United
    States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that
    requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.

    (b)  In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism,
    including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the
    headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the
    national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on
    civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national
    emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declaration of National
    Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks).

    (c)  Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international
    terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake
    further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not
    detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and
    massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity
    of the operations of the United States Government.

    (d)  The ability of the United States to protect the United States and
    its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations
    protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist
    attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed
    Forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt
    their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support
    such attacks.

    (e)  To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the
    effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist
    attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order
    pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be
    tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by
    military tribunals.

    more

    (OVER)

    2

    (f)  Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the
    nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and
    under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10,
    United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military
    commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of
    evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the
    United States district courts.

    (g)  Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths,
    injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential
    acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that
    such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary
    emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency
    constitutes an urgent and compelling govern-ment interest, and that
    issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.

    Sec. 2.  Definition and Policy.

    (a)  The term "individual subject to this order" shall mean any
    individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I
    determine from time to time in writing that:

    (1)  there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant

    times,

    (i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;

    (ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit,

    acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor,

    that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to

    cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its

    citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or

    (iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in

    subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order;

    and

    (2)  it is in the interest of the United States that such individual

    be subject to this order.

    (b)  It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of
    Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any
    individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with
    section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual
    is tried only in accordance with section 4.

    (c)  It is further the policy of the United States that any individual
    subject to this order who is not already under the control of the
    Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer
    or agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a
    copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith
    be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense.

    Sec. 3.  Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense. Any
    individual subject to this order shall be --

    (a)  detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary
    of Defense outside or within the United States;

    (b)  treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race,
    color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;

    more

    3

    (c)  afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and
    medical treatment;

    (d)  allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the
    requirements of such detention; and

    (e)  detained in accordance with such other conditions as the
    Secretary of Defense may prescribe.

    Sec. 4.  Authority of the Secretary of Defense Regarding Trials of
    Individuals Subject to this Order.

    (a)  Any individual subject to this order shall, when tried, be tried
    by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military
    commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may
    be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable
    law, including life imprisonment or death.

    (b)  As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1,
    including subsection (f) thereof, the Secretary of Defense shall issue
    such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of
    one or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out
    subsection (a) of this section.

    (c)  Orders and regulations issued under subsection (b) of this
    section shall include, but not be limited to, rules for the conduct of
    the proceedings of military commissions, including pretrial, trial,
    and post-trial procedures, modes of proof, issuance of process, and
    qualifications of attorneys, which shall at a minimum provide for --

    (1)  military commissions to sit at any time and any place, consistent

    with such guidance regarding time and place as the Secretary of

    Defense may provide;

    (2)  a full and fair trial, with the military commission sitting as

    the triers of both fact and law;

    (3)  admission of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the

    presiding officer of the military commission (or instead, if any other

    member of the commission so requests at the time the presiding officer

    renders that opinion, the opinion of the commission rendered at that

    time by a majority of the commission), have probative value to a

    reasonable person;

    (4)  in a manner consistent with the protection of information

    classified or classifiable under Executive Order 12958 of April 17,

    1995, as amended, or any successor Executive Order, protected by

    statute or rule from unauthorized disclosure, or otherwise protected

    section 113(d) of title 10, United States Code.

    Sec. 7.  Relationship to Other Law and Forums.

    (1)  authorize the disclosure of state secrets to any person not

    otherwise authorized to have access to them;

    (2)  limit the authority of the President as Commander in Chief of the

    Armed Forces or the power of the President to grant reprieves and

    pardons; or

    (3)  limit the lawful authority of the Secretary of Defense, any

    benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law
    or equity by any party, against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees, or any other

    any time hereafter, to transfer to a governmental authority control of
    any individual subject to this order.  Nothing in this order shall be

It's simple, maybe unethical and way off the moral high ground we claim to be
staking out but effective and legal under the US Constitution. Make sure you
check for any text that says these protections apply to non-citizens.  While
I am unqualified to comment on the national security aspect of these issues,
there certainly are security issues presented by them. I quote the US
Constitution, 14th Amendment:

Amendment XIV

Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor
shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.


Under this reading, the rights accorded under our federal constitution are
not extended beyond US Citizens without regard to location of those citizens.
I read this to require treatment by the US of US citizens abroad the same as
in the US.

You don't feel outraged if it applies ONLY to non-americans?

How would you people feel if we took the same liberty
to try and execute suspected American terrorists and
hold secret tribunals for them?

It is just a question of perspective - one man's freedom fighter
is another man's terrorist, like the Taleban have learned. The
victor writes the history - and can re-write it again, like the
Americans have proved to the Taleban.

Why can't countries respect each other's citizens' rights? Or
more specifically, why is it that America has such a big problem
understanding that perhaps the non-Americans consider themselves
worthy of the same basic human rights? Is that arrogant of (us)
non-Americans? It is *this* very attitude which is birthing the
"hate" towards the US, that very "hate" which americans find so
hard to understand, and account it to envy and jealousy.

If you can't afford to give other people/nations the respect
they deserve, you shouldn't expect to get any in return.
