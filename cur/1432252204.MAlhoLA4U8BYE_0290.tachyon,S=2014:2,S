NSA has provided FOIA documents about a 1977 letter to
IEEE by an NSA employee, Walter Meyer, warning that export
of crypto would violate munitions export law, and the subsequent
disputes between NSA and the public crypto community, including
actions within NSA and through Congress to hinder public crypto
development:

While a fair amount of the information provided is public
there is more, formerly classified, that is not. The principal
document was formerly classifed "Top Secret Umbra,
Handle Via Talent Keyhole Comint Control Systems Only."
This 15-page excerpt appears to be from an unnamed much
longer report and is stamped released 9-18-2008.

NSA wrote that it will continue to search for relevant
documents and that it did not have a copy of Meyer's letter.

A copy of Meyer's letter and comments on what is new would be
appreciated.

We are not on other crypto maillists and fora and it would be
helpful to forward this for responses.
