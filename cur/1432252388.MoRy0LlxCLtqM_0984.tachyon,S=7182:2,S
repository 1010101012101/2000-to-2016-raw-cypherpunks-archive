So, by extension, people who are 98 years old should be able to
purchase life or health insurance at the same rates as those who
are 22 years old.  After all, they have no control over their age.

Your position is internally inconsistent as well as dishonest and
unfair.  If you believe that people are entitled to medical care
simply because they exist, then at least admit that to yourself
and advocate that government should provide it through tax
collections.

The "Big Rich Insurance Company Who Can Afford It" is simply passing
the costs on to the rest of us anyway.  But why should this burden
be placed on the managers and stock holders of the insurance company?
It isn't *their* fault that the prospective insured has a genetic
predisposition to heart disease (or whatever).

The poor old widow whose mutual fund owns the insurance company
stock is being deprived of income thanks to your mandate.  How
is that fair?

Again, this is being dishonest.  Coverage is less expensive than
care only because *someone else is paying for it*. It is the care
that is needed, not "coverage".  Mandated "coverage" is simply
care that someone else is being required to provide.  Any insurance
company obviously prefers to minimize "coverage" that *it knows*
is going to require care to be paid for.

No.  The idea of insurance is to *insure* yourself (and family,
etc.) against unexpected catastrophic losses by pooling risk.

This is why the current American system where virtually everyone's
insurance pays for virtually every visit to the doctor is such a
bad idea.  People should be paying for their ordinary, year-in
year-out health care.  Insurance should only enter the picture if
"large" unexpected expenses are incurred.  This type of insurance
would have a huge positive effect on health care prices in this
country.  Prices keep spiraling upward because the individual
doesn't have any incentive to control costs.  The individual's
only motivation is, as you stated, "get out more than you put in".

Since the individual is not motivated to control costs, neither
is the doctor (excluding HMOs which are an effect of this whole
issue).  Given an unknown condition, the doctor is inclined to
order any test or administer any treatment that *might* be
beneficial, no matter how unlikely.  After all, this covers his
ass: the more tests or treatments tried, the less likely the
doctor is to be sued for "negligently" failing to consider an
option.
