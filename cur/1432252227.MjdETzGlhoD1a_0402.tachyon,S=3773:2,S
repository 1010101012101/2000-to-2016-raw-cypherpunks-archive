The slave trade was centered around some negroes capturing and selling 
some other negroes. The Moslems who ferried the captured negroes along 
the coast were just middlemen, as were the Dutch and English who 
carried the negro cargo to the final customers.

Ironically, the negro in America, especially the negro Muslim, blames 
the Jew for what other negroes and other Muslims did to some of his 
ancestors.

And now the negro in America wants the "honkey" to give him reparations.

(Tyler Durden, _please_ learn to trim your replies. Your "quote the

mailer you are using.)
