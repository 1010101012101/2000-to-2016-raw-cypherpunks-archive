I think they're drafting up the specs. Tor would be a save idea,
ip2 and LAFS-Tahoe another.

Not necessarily WiFi, thogh if the wall wart has a radio, why
not. Just another NIC.

I think you're being too harsh here. These are wired nodes, running
vanilla current p2p stuff. Tor e.g. might not scale to a meganode,
but it would be fun to find out when and how it breaks.

I notice you didn't comment on the sketch I gave you. While
not a rocket surgeon, the issue of routing by itself is doable,
provided you meet certain constraints. I wish I had time to 
write a simulator for that to prove a few points.

Let's compare notes. I tell you how I think it could be done, and
you take it apart. Deal?
