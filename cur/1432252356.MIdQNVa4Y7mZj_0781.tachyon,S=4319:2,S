Before going further, let's examine your "could constitute intent" point.

Do you know of any prosecutions, successful or not, of groups who 
"played soldier in the woods"? Assuming, of course, that the 
prosecutions were not for weapons law violations, trespassing, hunting 
out of season, possession of illegal explosives, noise violations, etc.

If you know of any such cases, I would like to hear about them.

Note, by the way, that the Aryan Nation(s) routinely does as you say, 
i.e., they practice in the woods, but the only thing that they have been 
charged (as individuals or as an organization) were connected with 
actual crimes (the murder of radio talk show host Alan Berg in Denver, a 
couple of bank robberies) or political thoughtcrimes involving supposed 
harassment (a woman who claims she was "chased and terrorized" by AN 
thugs after driving past their compound several times.

Do you know of any actual cases where this confluence to "create intent" 
(not even clear what that means in this context, though) was claimed?

Assuming your hypo, there is little protection in the "Alice talks, Bob 
codes" solution, if Alice and Bob associate. For a conspiracy charge, 
the fact that some talk and some build things is not important.

No, it can't.
