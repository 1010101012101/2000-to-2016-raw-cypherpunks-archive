In case it's not already obvious, Steele has a clue.

I heard him speak at H2K last year.  He's either the world's
greatest liar, or has a tremendous background and authority
on how the goverment handles secret and subversive activities.

Although the financial arguments (below) are compelling
in themselves, he has a whole other series of arguments that
basically point out how incredibly incompetent the government
agencies are at dealing with secret data.
