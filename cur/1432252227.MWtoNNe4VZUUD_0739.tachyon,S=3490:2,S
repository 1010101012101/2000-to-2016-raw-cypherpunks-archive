Not so, because I am not in arrogant denial of legal realities as are the
three village idiots in question.  At this point, I don't know your position
on the underlying question so I don't know yet whether to elevate your
status to that of the fourth village idiot.

You are confused.  I was asking Jimbo to increase his level of testicular
fortitude and take the LSAT.  There is nothing quite so sobering for a
village idiot as to have his idiocy documented by an objective test of the
skills in question.

Some folks can only see what they want to see.  My guess is that your
personal animus towards me has merely caused you to "project" your own
negative tendency onto me.  That's fine by me; it gives me a good insight
into where you're coming from.

My goodness, living out your violent fantasies vicariously through your
child.  Have you sought counseling?  ;'D
