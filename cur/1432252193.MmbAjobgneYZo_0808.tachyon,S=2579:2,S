A normal ISP account accessed through ZKS (for example), where the
'normal' account is blinded (give 'em bogus data, just make sure the MO's
get there on time) through some mechanism. One could lie, I've never been
asked for ID when setting up an account if I paid with cash to start it.
If these new 'anonymous' credit cards work out this might be a good way to
pay.

What purpose is that? To be anonymous does not imply that return traffic
is prohibited. All that is required is a mechanism to 'hide' the
'anonymous <> known' database. In addition, accessing the 'known' account
via transient and real-time (e.g. ZKS) anonymous accounts will provide an
additional layer of mix.
