	It seems kinda obvious that virtually all bitcoin developers
	and users *in the west* are richer than people in Africa and
	India.

	That's what I was getting at. Bitcoin devs  - *already
	rich by 'third world' standards* - are richer now. Millionaires
	even (notice that grarpamp was talking about impoverished
	wages...and people)

	So what amount of btc is being used to make payments between
	Botswana and Mumbai? 

	What amount of btc is being used to speculate/gamble in a few
	big, centralized and fully NSA-AML-monitored exchanges?

	But I said *cash* not fiat.  And the collapse of relatively
	untraceable *cash* is *bad*.

	What we may end up with is FIAT currencies and 	NO CASH
	option* for those fiat currencies. Bad. Pretty bad.


	*aka credit cards.

	Do you know where I live? Of course you don't have to know
	where I live. But you'll know it in a second anyway. I live in
	argentina - and let me tell you, bitcoin isnt exactly 'popular'
	here.

	Yep, that's quite correct as far as argentina goes. I suspect
	it's true regarding venezuela as well.

	The evidence is called 'history'. That, and the nature of
	government and its business 'partners' - or accomplices.

	You seem to be assuming that an uncontrollable and untraceable
	crypto-currency exist? I'm not seeing anything of the sort.

	And yet there seems to be a fair amount of people in the bitcoin
	'community' who are quite eager (or desperate) to have bitcoin
	'regulated' so that it becomes 'respectable', 'legal'...and
	usable. 

	Of course, this isn't a shortcoming that only affects btc.
	Anything that the government 'outlaws' becomes harder to
	transact.

	I do wish that was actually the case, but I think that view
	doesn't fully take into account the capabilities of the
	'enemy'.
