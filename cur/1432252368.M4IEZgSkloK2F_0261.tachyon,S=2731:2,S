      And the others that didn't even get mentioned -- what category do
you rate them? So are we idiots supposed to feel crushed by this and
slink away, never to be heard from again?
     Or should we just try harder? Or maybe simply
double/triple/quadruple  the volume of our posts to achieve eminence?
      I guess I'm not seeing the relevance, since you don't have the
balls to do this openly.
