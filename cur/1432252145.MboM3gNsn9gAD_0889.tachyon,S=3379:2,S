The difference between "Wag the Dog" and "The Big Terrorist Hoax" is that the former was done far more professionaly, it cost more and returned no profit at all.

Face it: catalyzing suicidal WTC spectacle and mailing some anthrax probably did not cost more than $10-15 million altogether, and that is what purchased them their wet dream - dictatorship at the dawn of third millenia. One must commend the government for wise spending - this is the most bang for the buck I've ever seen.

Governments *always* killed their own subjects for gain, and the 5K bodies is actually low count for the effect produced. This kind of power shift usually required a major war with 10-100X more bodies.

So, the government is not only economical. It is also humane.
