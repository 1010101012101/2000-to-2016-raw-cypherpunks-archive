One thing that is bothering me these days are all the reports coming out
of Afganistan that nuclear bomb making plans were found.  Big
deal.  Anyone on the planet can make a nuclear device if they have the
appropriate materials.  The hard part is staying alive due to exposure
while manufacturing the device.

If however death is not an issue then the process itself becomes easy to
accomplish.

Materials
---------

 4 stainless steal salad bowls (5 - 8 inch diameter)
10 pounds of U-235 (Plutonium)
 1 containment cylinder in which to fit the salad bowls
 ? some explosives - C4 platic works best - but TNT or gun powder is
acceptable.

Assembly
--------

10 pounds of U-235 is required to achive critical mass.  However less will
work but you will get a sub critical mass on detonation.  The difference
is taking out an entire city as opposed to a few city blocks.

Divide the U-235 into two five pound masses.  Beat it evenly into the 
inside of one of your salad bowls.  U-235 is malleable like gold so you
should have no problem shaping it.  Do the same with the other U-235 mass
and shape it into the other salad bowl.

Keep the two bowls apart - you don't want an accident to cause your
project to go critical.

C4 explosives work best.  You simply mold the C4 into the other two salad
bowls.  This is the most dangerous part of the project.  Improper handling
of C4 can cause an explosion.  But gun powder is just as effective.

Now fit the U-235 salad bowls into the C4 salad bowls and place them at
each end of the cylindrical containment.  Connect your explosives to a
detonator and close off the ends of the cylynder.  Make sure the detonator
sets off both explosives at the same time.

The trick is to bring the U-235 masses together at the same time.

And thats it.  I would recommend some form of protection while building
the project.  The aprons worn by dentists will work.  They will protect
you to some degree from radioactive poisoning.  However - your life is
only being prolonged by taking such measures - you still will end up dead
due to the U-235 radiation regardless of what you do.

And thats it.

Conclusion
----------

Anyone on this planet can build a nuclear device.  So the only issue in
building the device is the will to die for a cause.  And the only thing I
find unfortunate in all of this is that there are so many causes that
people are willing to die for.  And war will not make those reasons go
away - it will only encourage them.
