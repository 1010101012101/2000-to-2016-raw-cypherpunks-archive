If you work for a company that exports stuff, you can refer to list
"C" which includes the largely moslem usual suspect countries.

List "D" are the relics of the cold war.  No beowolves in fuckistan.

They're on the List.

Of course, they must prove their

Allah knows what we see in a week.

What if you fly it upside down?

Too bad there wasn't an "Arabic, not Judaic" box on the census forms,
eh?
All those empty bunks in them private jails...
