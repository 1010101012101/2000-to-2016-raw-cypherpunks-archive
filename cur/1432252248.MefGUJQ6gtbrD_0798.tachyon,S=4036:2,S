I still remember doing some Y2K work down at DSC on the day they were
purchased by Alcatel (I think it was).

Back in the digital switch area there were two characters, one an old
drinker-nosed Texan named "Sonny" the other a young 20-something.

The young guy kept making fun of Sonny pointing out that the only thing Sonny
had that was worthwhile was his gun stockpile.

He said his own plan for surviving Y2K (in the event something actually
happened, which none of us seriously considered) was that he was just going to
go over to Sonny's house, kill Sonny, and grab his stockpile and provisions.
(Oh, and he told us this with Sonny standing right there.)

Me, if there's actually a scenario like The Road, well I'm not that interested
in surviving. But if I had to do something I'd just hole up in NYC and try to
figure out how to survive in the whole new barter economy.
