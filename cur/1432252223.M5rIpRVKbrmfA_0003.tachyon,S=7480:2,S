Hi,
I like your model of different points of view and strange methods of
communication as base for some surrealistic RPG, which lead me to idea:
- imagine, that you have players of the game, that are able to
understand surreal logic of the game and now one of them is killed by
game-master, possibly because game-master do not like this person or
something like.

So now you have rouge ex-player who do understand whole "system"
perfectly, all surreal concepts are clear to him, no problem with all
that CHAO magic.
And as cypher it just behave as cypher with hidden logic, which does not
work as soon as logic is revealed.

But again, I like that concept as RPG setting, to have PC, that are
communicating by juggling and music [different languages ], NPC that
have problem to understand, what is still code and what is only noise
pattern... unwillinglingly transmited informations [veneric or other
diseases + gene modification]... pasterns in the void. Really surreal
and I do like it a lot, but as hidden and obscure it is inapplicable.

Btw when we are in surreal mood: Have you ever tried to think about
moment, when most of the informations public available is coded by some
artificial system [cypher sets] and there will be some inherited
civilization without enough e.g. computing power to just count
algorithms even they know it function and in worst case even the key.
Imagine all of the data/informations lost in case we do not understand
ASCII or UTF-X table anymore. Just example of another Baabel world to
play with. [related: Jorge Luis Borges : Babel Library]

Sorry for OT, in case of any, in this thread [PARACrypto] to subject?
