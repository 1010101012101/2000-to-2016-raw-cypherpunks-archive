There were several USG offices in the Twin Towers, some of
them intelligence. In addition, CIA was located in 7 WTC, along 
with Secret Service and military offices. The military offices
were used as cover for the others. There was far more USG in 
WTC than in Murrah, and the lesson learned in OKC was no doubt 
useful to the attackers: collateral hurt to innocents is magnitudes
more powerful than hitting military targets -- that is what
strategic bombing was invented to demonstrate, not to say 
threatening with WMDs, a practice invented by the US and
which remains its primary defense strategy.

The cause and effect between USG WMD threats and terrorist 
attacks is yet to be fully admitted outside military circles: the
military accepts that innocents will be slaughtered, and the
winner must slaughter the most. 

Terrorism to the military is a nuisance even when a few of its 
troops are picked off.

The losses in Iraq do not even make a blip on expected
casualties of a major war. More military have died in
conventional accidents, murders and suicides around the 
world than have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

But those in the Middle East have greater utility for the military 
to boost its suck for more funds and more "our boys and girls"
sacrifice and more bawling in congress and the presidential 
campaign about protecting the nation, defense cut-back not
even a dream since ever so convienent 9/11.

Murrah bombing helped the battle against homeland militants,
and WTC got the ball rolling for battle overseas.

Who planned them is yet to be revealed, but the usual suspects
don't mean shit.
