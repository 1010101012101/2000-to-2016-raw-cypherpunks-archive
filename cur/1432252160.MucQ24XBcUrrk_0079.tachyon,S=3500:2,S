BTW, I assumed folks would know that "Senator Albert Gore," and the 
St. Alban's time period, implied Albert Gore, Sr., the old man. But 
maybe some of you don't know that algore is the son of Albert Gore, 
Sr.

Albert Gore, Jr. and his brother(s) were the participants in the dope-smoking.

And yet algore and Tipper cluck about an open can of beer being held 
by a 16-yo at a party.
