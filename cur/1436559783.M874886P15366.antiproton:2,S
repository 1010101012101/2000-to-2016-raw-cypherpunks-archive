	Right.

	Well, that's the theory, but as you just mentioned, at least
	part of the network isn't looking too much P2P-like anymore...

	Working for people who pay in btc. For instance, selling drugs

	I don't think that's really a problem. You can earn btc like
	you earn any other kind of money. Or you could at least if btc
	was a common medium of exchange. (you can of course simply buy
	btc)

	But why should they? So that they can be easily monitored? THAT
	is dodgy too.

	Sorry, that's a typically retarded rant against 'anarchy'.
	Bitcoin isn't the same thing as political anarchy so valid
	criticism of bitcoin isn't the same thing as valid
	criticism of political anarchy. 

	"If You Want to Sit At The Adults' Table Act Like Adults" 

	Adults know the basic meaning of words and know that the STATE
	of somaliland isn't 'anarchy'. Adults are intellectually
	honest. Unlike the author of the article you linked.

	Yep. It is mostly bullshit. Blockchain
	'technology' (technology? it's just an algorithm) seems like a
	more robust version of digital signatures. And what of it? What
	kind of fundamental problem does a better digital signature
	system solve?

	That is bullshit. But that bullshit is not the same as the
	political theory of anarchy. In other words don't confuse
	bitcoin with anarchy, regardless of what bitcoin pushers may
	say.
