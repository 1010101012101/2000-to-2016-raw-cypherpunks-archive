So far nothing about the Reid incident distinguishes it
from a low-level security test.

Whether Reid was informed of his role by the operation
planners could be questioned.

And whether the planners were "terrorists" or the counter-
terrorism industry is a fair question.

Time magazine says in its December 31 edition:

  "White House aides tell Time they are envisioning a war 
  against terrorism that could last 50 years. As a model for 
  fashioning a long-term game plan, Bush aides have been 
  looking at old cold-war national-security doucments, such 
  as NSC-68, a plan the Truman Administration drafted in 
  1950 to contain the Soviets."

Terrorism is a godsend for those forever looking for terrifying
enemies of the state, family, church.

NSC-68:

Mattd is a guy I'd like at my back in a fight. I wouldn't expect
him to climb a tree like a scardy cat to lick his weeping anus.
