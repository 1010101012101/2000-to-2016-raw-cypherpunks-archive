Some good points, Johnny.

I'm not convinced Spam and the remailers are inherently incompatible. Or at 
least, I'm thinking there's a sort of uncertainty principle that should work 
between legit remailable messages and spam.

it may be a tricky business, but I suspect that the need of spammers to send 
out huge numbers of messages may be exploitable. Hell...they may in some 
ways be an asset if handled correctly: Much easier to hide remailed messages 
in larger torrents than in sparsely trafficked remailer networks.

And of course, it may be that the need to sell goods (ie, from a specific 
URL) means that anonymity is not so useful, particularly if there are 
time+bandwidth constraints on portions of the network (eg a remailer has a 
max bandwidth that gets throttled back if there's a large woosh of traffic 
in a certain period of time).

So I don't think the problem is unsolvable, but I agree with your essential 
point that it needs looking into.
