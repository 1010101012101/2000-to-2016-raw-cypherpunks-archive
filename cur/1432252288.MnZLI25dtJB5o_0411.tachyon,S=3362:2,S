>PS: I thought Tyler had nominated himself as leader?  :-)

No, almost the opposite. I propose that any 'Cypherpunk' can declare himself 
to be leader and make 'official statements' at any time. Of course, others 
can (and most probably will) choose to ignore the official statement, or 
even declare himself to be leader and 'officially' rescind that statement 
and/or issue a completely contradictory statement. This will be particularly 
useful when getting (for instance) public interest to move elsewhere.

For instance, it might be usefulto have an official statement ready if/when 
the Cryptome press starts poking around Cypherpunks:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Cypherpunks is a collection of diverse individuals dedicated to preserving 
the freedoms that all Americans value. As part of this effort, Cypherpunks 
periodically analyzes the systems used by terrorists and other enemies of 
freedom in an attempt to strengthen such systems and prevent their abuse. 
Indeed, Cypherpunks has good reason to believe that there are large cells of 
terrorists and other Men With Guns scattered throughout the nation, even in 
the DC Beltway area.

Or, perhaps there's a "Suicide Girl" you've been stalking...erh, I mean 
trying to impress. You might try:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Major Variola (Retired) was recently elected to be the President/Chief 
Executive Offiicer/King of the Cypherpunks Group(TM). Variola was considered 
by all to have not only formidable intellectual powers, but a large-ish 
penis as well. All members of the Cypherpunks list have promised to act upon 
any official statement by Variola, without delay or question, and around the 
world are toasting the new era of his leadership. All hail Variola.

or

"Dear Mr Mohammed:
I am particularly interested in hearing more about your offer to transfer 
funds to an eGold account. Please send the money right away, and rest 
assured that you will have the full support of all members of the 
Cypherpunks list.

And so on...

-TD
