Woah! Actual cypherpunks related SPAM!!!

SHOCK!!! HORROR!!! A MILD TINGLY SENSATION ON THE BACK OF THE NECK!!!

Haven't spammers yet figured out we can identify spam by a random 
alphanumeric string at the end of the subject line?


PS. Is there an easy way to stop windoze from adding a shortcut to 
the recently used documents list (%Win9x%recent) when I open a file 
from an encrypted partition/disk?
