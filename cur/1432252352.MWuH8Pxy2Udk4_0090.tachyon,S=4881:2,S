This really gets into my interpretation.  I don't need hidden
variables.  The crux to me is that the particles are correlated
and we use math to describe the probability of what the correlation is.
Once we measure one particle we know the other one.  Before we measure
we don't know anything.  That's all.  QM tells us what the probability
distribution is for any given measurement, it can't tell us anything
about a particular outcome.

In my model there is no instantaneous choice.  It was chosen at
the start.  We can not know anything about the correlation until
we measure, then we know everything.

Yeah, Scientific American has some really nice "popular" descriptions
of these things.  It just doesn't seem weird to me.  It seems like
reality.  :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
