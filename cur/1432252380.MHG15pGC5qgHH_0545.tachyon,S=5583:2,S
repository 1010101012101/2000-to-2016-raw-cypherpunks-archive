Change "the hour" to "an hour or two", and I would agree with
this.  However, we have an incredible bloatocracy, and about the only
thing that can be coordinated within an hour or two nowadays is a blowjob
from the intern...

And here is where you completely part with reality, and start
regurgitating the carefully crafted bullshit you have been fed by this
bloatocracy.  The fact is, we have already killed many more than the 18
million you cite, and *that* is one of the many reasons we are so loathed,
both externally, and internally.

Yup, sure *sounds* rational alright  like a guy on Ketamine.

No. not "Pay off", just leave the fuck alone.  We had this one coming.  In
fact, we had this coming _in spades_, and for a _very_ long time.  What
goeas around comes around, ya?  We kill _millions_  of innocent civilians
unjustifiably, and then have the GALL to complain when our own tactics are
used against us???

You mean there were such fools *before* this happened???

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
