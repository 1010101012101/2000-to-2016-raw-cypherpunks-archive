A one Mr. Blank Frank invoked me with:

Eh, the attorney-client privilege has a good many holes in it.

Some circles of folk are of the opinion that attorneys are very talky,
perhaps second only to marketers. It seems that in these circles, lawyers
are not known for being paragons of confidentiality, in stark contrast to
their ethical principles and their personal beliefs. The moral? Well, let us
just say that it extends beyond the "shithead federal public defender"
context.
