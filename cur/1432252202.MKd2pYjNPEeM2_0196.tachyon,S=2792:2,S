I don't have Knuth's book handy to look at, but it's not really correct
to speak of a particular sequence or subsequence of digits as being
random or non-random.  For example, is this sequence of bits random:
01100100010?  How about this one: 0000000000?  From a true random number
generator, both are completely possible and equally valid.

(Furthermore, I would contend that the digits of pi are *non-random* by
definition.)

One can only do statistical analyses of sequences of digits to determine
whether they *appear* to have a uniform distribution of individual
digits and subsequences.

Of course the result of such a test (positive *or* negative) doesn't 
positively confirm
whether a given digit source is truly random.

Wikipedia has a good article on randomness:
