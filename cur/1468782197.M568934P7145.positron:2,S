Remember what Chris Dorner did to the LAPD that scared the living shit
out of them? He went after the cops' family and friends. It's classic
counterinsurgency tactic he learned from the kind of people who want to
kill Snowden and Assange.

It's NOT limited to high profile people either. I knew a woman a junkie
hooker, who was murdered so the feds could spook her memorial service to
see if her weatherman fugitive boyfriend would turn up.

Like that...

As I already said to Zen - thanks for filling me in :P

P.S.  All sarcasm/snide bullshit aside - do you really think Applebaum
is of the same level of importance to the things you mention -
privacy / human rights / surveillance state, etc, as Julian Assange
or Ed Snowden?  Snowden may have clammed up but he got a lot of
good shit out there. Likewise they have tried to clam Assange up
but he keeps on pumping shit out.
