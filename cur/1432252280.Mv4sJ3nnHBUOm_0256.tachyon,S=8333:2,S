SF Bay Area Cypherpunks September 2000 Physical Meeting Announcement

General Info:

DATE:   Saturday Sept 11 2000
TIME:   12:00 - 6:00 PM (Pacific Time)
PLACE:  Eric Messick's Dome, Santa Cruz Mountains

Agenda

This is a low-key meeting at Eric's home in the mountains, beginning about
1pm.

   ~12 -Bring lunch, undo geographical delocalization, admire mountain
        roads and wildlife. Carpooling would be a good idea, given limited
parking.
   ~1 - Admire the E-Dome, Hugh's Lab and the Copper-Insulated Wall,
        socialize, discuss Burning Man, Plan RSA Patent-expiration party
   ** - Eric Blossom's Starium Bump-in-the-wire Cryptophone demo -
        They're finally here, 3DES and everything.
   ** - Bill Scannell's trip to Ascension Island - An alternate landing site 
	for the space shuttle, Ascension island is forbidden turf, occupied by 
	NASA, NSA, and several other American spook agencies.
   ** - Hugh Daniel - IPSEC and FreeS/WAN update and demo.

As usual, this is an open public meeting on US soil.  
Please leave the US soil outside :-)

RSA has released the RSA patent to the public domain two weeks early,
so bring code!  There will still be a party around 9/20-9/23.

Whit Diffie and Dave Del Torto will speak at an EFF meeting Mon 9/11 7:30pm
at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport in Burlingame.  
Details http://www.eff.org/EFF/BayFF/ will be posted soon.

Location

Most of the online maps provide unreliable directions, so use the attached.
I find the drive takes about 30 minutes from Mountain View or 15-20 from
the 280/17 intersection except during heavy traffic; parking is country roads 
and dirt driveways.

%   Exit Highway 17 at Summit Road and head west, in both directions that's
% a right off the highway and left onto Summit Road.
%   Follow Summit Road past two streets on the left until Summit makes a hard
% right turn at the third street, you want to turn left from Summit Road onto
% Hutchinson Road which is more like going straight (in the day time be VERY
% carful making this 'blind to oncoming traffic' turn!).
%   Follow Hutchinson until just after Riva Ridge Road veers up on the left
% and you see a long group of black mailboxes on the right, make an acute
% right turn here from Hutchinson Road onto Old Ranch Road.
%   At the first curve/split of Old Ranch road you want to stay right when the
% road splits, (there is a "SLOW 10 SPEED LIMIT" sign at the fork; keep
% to the right of this sign).
%   Follow the drive down the hill until it flattens out and the trees thin
% out above you, you should see the top of the E-Dome on your left, our
% driveway is the next left.
