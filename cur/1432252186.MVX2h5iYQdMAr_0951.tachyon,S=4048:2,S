Well,

Obvously, the policeman is NOT your friend.  However (not to excuse, only 
to point out the reality): Most people in general, are spineless sheep, 
easily cowed by anybody in a suit-badge combo.

"I have nothing to say" and let THEM prove whatever it is they are trying 
to frame you for.

About Martha, and various and sundry "poor little plutocrats", I have to 
wonder why many passionate little people who are struggling to get by, and 
ALSO fighting to maintain their civil liberties should really take that 
much pity or concern, any moreso than when some unconnected, non-rich 
person routinely gets railroaded and immolated by the daily affronts of 
abusive government.  I mean, if Martha and Co. are REALLY so concerned 
about how they are/have been treated, then perhaps they ought to put a 
least a little MONEY behind the civil liberties movement at whatever level 
of their choice.  I mean if "rich people are so smart and superior" (as 
self-evidenced by their ability to attain "wealth"), then how come they are 
not generally smart enough to NOT be further strengthening the schemes of 
the State to disenfranchise all OUR rights--including their own!?  And if 
it's not a question of smart-stupid, but priority (like greed is king, and 
fuck everything/everyone else) well, then again, why have any sympathy for 
them.  These are the people that finance and strengthen the State when it 
suits them.  The so-called "rich" believe in the system, strengthen it, 
support it.  So it's just pudding when the unjust state gives them a taste 
of what everyone else from middle class on down suffers everyday.  You 
leave too many large guns laying around, don't cry when you get shot by one 
of them.  Us "'po" civil libertarians fight this crap everyday, and we 
don't get paid for it, and we give in the way of logic and arguments and 
tactics because we don't have much money, fighting against the shit-tide of 
brainwashing telling us to "BUY!" and that everything's just "Fine and 
couldn't be finer".  Maybe it's time for the moneypots to ante up some.  I 
mean, why should the average Joe divert attention from other civil 
liberties causes to protect these poor plutocrats when they trip themselves 
up.  There are a billion other issues, equally important if not moreso, 
which affect many more people day to day via state sanctioned inequity.
