Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic but I can't imagine this kind of
thing happening on a routine basis. If anything, it looks like the
government is closing ranks and increasing the indoctrination of their
employees. I fear that we're going to see fewer and fewer people with
the courage of Edward Snowden as we move forward.

It's nice to think that conscience will win in the end but I honestly am
starting to see just the opposite. This is why I think we're going to
need groups like Anonymous and others who are willing to do straight
infiltration in order to find the truth. We can't rely on those who are
already in government to get a fit of conscience.
