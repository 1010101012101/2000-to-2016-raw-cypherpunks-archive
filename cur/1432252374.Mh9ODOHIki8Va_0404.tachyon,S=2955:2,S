FSC Does Nightline
WASHINGTON - Free Speech Coalition general counsel Jeffrey Douglas and 
lobbyist Kat Sunlove will discuss the so-called "virtual child porn" case, 
FSC v. Reno, tonight on Nightline, the long-running late-night ABC news 
program hosted by Ted Koppel. The program usually begins at 11:30 p.m. 
Eastern and Pacific times on local and regional ABC affiliates following 
local news. Check your local television listings - you will not want to 
miss this critical discussion on the question of whether a computerized 
image that resembles a child can be classified the same way as an actual 
image of an actual child.
