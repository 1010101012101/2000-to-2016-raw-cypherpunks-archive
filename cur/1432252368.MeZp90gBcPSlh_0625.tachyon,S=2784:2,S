   Yas, yas, yas -- and the only place we can see this being enacted is in
Venezuela, where more people carry copies of their Constitution than carry the

I said something about some pol being "so stupid", and he responded: "Don't ever
think that they are stupid, they aren't stupid -- stupid people can be taught,

they are evil."
