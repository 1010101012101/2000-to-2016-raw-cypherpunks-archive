Intel would be a strange beast for you today Jim.

there's a secret underground facility in Oregon (perhaps Cali too) for
classified intelligence work.  some small fraction of Intel employees
even know it exists. (maybe i'll post GPS coords?)

there they sequester CPU vulnerability research of sufficient
implication.  there they sequester hardware level exploitation
research of sufficient implication. there they work on TS/SCI
compartmented projects for USGOV.


these people do not have your best interests at heart!


whatever justifications they hoid dear and true are facades for
compliance.  sooner or later this will come to light, and it is
incredibly disheartening to see loyalty twisted toward state power
under guise of social good and justice.

make no mistake: these efforts are a direct affront to freedom,
liberty, and other ideals we hold paramount.


NO MORE SECRETS
