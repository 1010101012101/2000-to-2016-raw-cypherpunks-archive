Thanks for the heads up - the last time you posted part 1, I found it
too depressing to go very far and it was all "yeah, of course" for
me...

This time, well it's good to be reminded, as well as read some new
ways to view aspects of the world which may beg for comprehension
otherwise, eg:
"Stupidity is an unwitting tendency towards self-destruction. It’s why
operations run by bad people always go bad. And why, since the Deep
State is run by bad people - sociopaths are actively drawn to it - it
will necessarily collapse."

Anyway, today these two articles kept me reading to the end,
Thanks.
