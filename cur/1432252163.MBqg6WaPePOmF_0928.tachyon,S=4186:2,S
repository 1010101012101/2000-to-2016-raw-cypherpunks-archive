                 Channel Six News has learned former UN Weapons
Inspector and Delmar resident Scott
                 Ritter was arrested during an Internet sex sting
operation.  But it turns out police caught
                 Ritter months before, but declined to press charges.
Sources tell us Ritter tried to meet a
                 14 year-old girl he chatted with online.  He was
instead met by police officers, who let him
                 go.  Ritter was arrested in June of 2001 for allegedly
trying to lure a 16 year-old girl he met
                 online to a Burger King.  But that girl was really an
undercover cop- surfing the web as part
                 of a police sting operation.  Ritter was charged with
attempted endangerment of a child.
                 But the charge was dismissed and the case sealed.  That
means, essentially, that it never
                 happened.  Ritter searched Iraq for weapons in the
years following the Gulf War.  More
                 recently, he's been speaking out against President
Bush's policies on Iraq and is frequently
                 seen on local and national television.

ALBANY, NY, Jan. 20 - More details are emerging about the June 2001
               arrest of former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter of
Delmar. He was
               apparently arrested by Colonie police as part of Internet
sex sting. The
               Schenectady Daily Gazette reports Ritter was under
investigation for a similar
               incident two months earlier.
