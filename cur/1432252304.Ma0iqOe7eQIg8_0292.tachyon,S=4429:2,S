    How could the library have the info, it's SOP to *not* keep the 
info, as I said. Most libraries wouldn't dare keep the info, if other 
librarians found out about it there would be all sorts of nastiness. A 
library director of a library that kept that sort of info would be 
destroying his own career if he expected to go anywhere else. And I 
think cooperating with the feebs would do likewise.
    Nobody really believes the gov't anymore -- Asscruft would be spat 
upon if he entered most libraries. I think at this point most educated 
people recognize the Un-Patriot act for what it is - the USA Fascist 
Manifesto. There's lots of people in libraries who have no doubt at all 
that 9/11 was engineered by the CIA to give the military the pretext to 
invade Afghanistan and regain control of the opium market. That's what 
the "War on Some Terror" is all about, that and another big domestic 
power grab by the feebs, just like the "War on Some Drugs."
