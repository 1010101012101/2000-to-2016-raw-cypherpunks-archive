Scientists Uncover Bones Buried Under El Salvador's Police Headquarters
The Associated Press
Published: Dec 27, 2001
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) - Scientists digging beneath the police 
department's national headquarters Wednesday discovered bones that human 
rights activists said belonged to people killed by state authorities during 
this country's 12-year civil war.
Skulls and dozens of other bones believed to be human were unearthed in two 
secret graves buried 6 feet below San Salvador's police plaza by a team of 
excavators hired by this country's independent Human Rights Commission.
The headquarters once housed the military-dominated national police force, 
which played a key role in the state's battle against leftist guerrillas 
during a war that killed 75,000 Salvadorans.
As part of the 1992 peace accords that ended the fighting, the existing 
police force was disbanded and replaced by the autonomous National Civil 
Police, which now occupies the headquarters.
"We have to determine, first of all, if these bones are human, then 
determine how long they have been here," said police spokesman Howard Coto.
But Human Rights Commission director Miguel Montenegro said he had no doubt 
that testing would confirm that the remains were human.
The graves prove that Salvadoran authorities tortured and killed dozens of 
"political prisoners" who were hauled into custody for interrogation at the 
height of the civil war and haven't been heard from since, Montenegro said.
"We have on record a series of cases where, in these headquarters, many 
people were tortured and disappeared," he said.
According to Montenegro's commission, at least 2,700 Salvadorans vanished 
after being arrested during the civil war.
SOA terrorists involved?
Im reading a book called "Instant of Treason"about the Sorge spy ring.The 
Tokyo police station seems to have seen a few murders.Treason trials in 
Malaysia and Russia bring back memories of writing as Dr Rat for a small 
samizdat called Treason,20 odd years back.I sold one to Laurie Oakes once! 
I digress.
Cheney and His Wife Make Over Vice Presidential Residence in Western Style
By Scott Lindlaw Associated Press Writer
Published: Dec 27, 2001
WASHINGTON (AP) - He doesn't spend much time there, but Dick Cheney has one 
of the finest homes in Washington - a newly renovated 33-room mansion with 
an indoor gym, seven fireplaces and art borrowed from some of the nation's 
most prestigious collections.
The government-owned residence "doesn't have an institutional feel about 
it," said Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife. "It's still very warm. 
At the same time I think it has a lot of dignity."
Mrs. Cheney led a pair of Associated Press reporters on a recent tour.
Sitting on grassy hillside inside a 12-acre compound, the vice president's 
mansion is a good fit for the Cheneys' western lifestyle. "When you grow up 
in the wide-open spaces you just don't like to feel crowded," said Mrs. 
Cheney, like her husband a Wyoming native. "You just kind of like the feel 
of your space."
The white brick Victorian, on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, 
was updated with a $363,000 renovation this year. The work included all new 
hardwood floors in most of the house, remodeling the seven fireplaces, new 
paint or wallpaper in every room, electrical updating and new carpeting.
The vice president spends many nights away from home.East coast arsonists
