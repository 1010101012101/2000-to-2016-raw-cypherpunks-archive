This isn't an area where we need to start reasoning from analogies or first 
principles - there's already case law more or less directly on point - 
_RIAA v. Napster_ and _RTC v. Netcom_, both of which look back to _Fonovisa 
v. Cherry Auction_ 76 F.3d 259 (9th Cir. 1996), online at 
<http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/76_F3d_259.htm> and discussed 
in the Napster context at 
<http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/08/23/napster_fleamarket/>.

The shippers could be held liable for the contents of the packages they 
carry if a plaintiff can establish that they knowingly materially 
contributed to the distribution or sale of infringing items. I suspect they 
avoid criminal liability by cooperating fully with law enforcement, so that 
even where they're technically guilty (or indictable) they have no 
realistic fear of prosecution; and that they avoid civil liability because 
domestic infringers will be attacked by IP holders directly, and foreign 
infringers will have their goods seized during Customs inspections, so 
Fedex et al never really get a chance to contribute to the infringement.
