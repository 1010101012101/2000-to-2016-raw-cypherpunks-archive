I am Hironari Noda, an ex-PSIA official. 
http://216.167.120.50/noda072300.htm

As I reported to you last November, on September 23, Tokyo metropolitan police arrested me on charge of striking a PSIA agent on the head. Until the incident, PSIA had kept me under surveillance for several days and stationed an official vehicle just in front of my apartment house on the morning of the accident.
Although I did not hit him, I was arrested and forced to be detained in the Nogata Police Station for total 18 days. Eventually I was released on October 10. Even the Tokyo Prosecutors' Office could not help deciding that they gave up prosecuting me. That was because there was no proof except for unreliable witnesses by PSIA agents themselves. The "injured" man was not able to submit even a piece of medical certificates.

Then, in return, I finally decided to bring two lawsuits against the Japanese and the Tokyo local governments, based on the National Compensation Law and submitted two written complaints to the Tokyo Local Court on December 28, 2000.
The purpose of one of the lawsuits is to blame for the illegal investigation and fabrication by PSIA and that of the other to accuse the inadequate judgment and law procedure by Tokyo Metropolitan Police, Tokyo Prosecutors' Office and so on.
The courts have already been held since February 13, 2001. The governments try to delay the judgment process. As a result, the next court will not be held until April 13. The foreign correspondent who attended the court was surprised because it finished in ten minutes. Just the exchange of the documents. That was the reality of the Japanese court system. However, at some points during the procedure, the PSIA agents will have to be summoned to the court.

I opened a website on December 14,2000 in order to criticize PSIA, publicize the developments of the lawsuits and make the related legal documents available to all those who are interested in this matter.

Unfortunately, most of the content is written in Japanese but I follow the intelligence related topics in Japan.

On the lower part of the top page, two colored images of the books are attached. The right one is a cover picture of the book titled "PSIA secret documents", which was published on February 5, 2001.
