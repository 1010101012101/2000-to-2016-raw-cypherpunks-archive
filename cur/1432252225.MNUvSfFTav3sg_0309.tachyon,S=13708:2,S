DOVEBID TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS

DoveBid Transportation Services complements DoveBid's auction capabilities by providing full, end-to-end transportation service referrals for DoveBid's customers. Transporting an asset requires the coordination of several separate vendors to break down, crate, ship and sometimes arrange for warehousing. As a courtesy to our buyers, DoveBid can provide contact information for licensed and insured shipping companies that are scheduled to attend each auction.  DoveBid's network of 34 reputable rigging and transportation professionals, representing 550 vendor branch offices worldwide, will provide the services.

For more information on DoveBid Transportation Services, please visit our website at http://www.dovebid.com, contact our Customer Care group at mailto: CustomerCare@dovebid.com or call (800) 665-1042.
