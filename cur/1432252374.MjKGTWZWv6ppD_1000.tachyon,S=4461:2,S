   Osama Has a New Friend

   WASHINGTON -- Evil Bert, meet Evil Osama.
   
   Right now, the two appear to be inseparable -- at least on ubiquitous
   posters carried by pro-Taliban protesters.
   
   Devotees of freak-humor websites will recall the infamous "Bert is
   Evil" page, a shrine to the gourd-like Sesame Street character, which
   offers compelling photographic evidence of the muppet consorting with
   Hitler, the KKK and, of course, Jerry Springer.

   Now, in a move that defies all rules of logic, a doctored photo
   showing Bert with the world's most-wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden,
   seems to have made its way into an anti-American Islamic protest in
   Bangladesh.
   
   Reuters photographs of a rally this week organized by
   Jaamiat-e-Talabaye Arabia, a radical Islamic organization, show that
   protesters created a pro-bin Laden sign out of a collage of photos
   they apparently lifted from Internet sites.
   
   But -- is it fate or coincidence? -- the sign featured a Bert muppet
   sitting on the left side of the man believed to be responsible for the
   bloodiest terrorist attack in U.S. history.
