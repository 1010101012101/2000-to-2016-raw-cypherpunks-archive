Of course, the paranoid amonsgt us now believe that Mr. Back wrote the
code, and is engaging in a little misdirection below.

| variable names.
| 
| Off the cuff guess based on coding without looking at samples of code
| to remind, probably Colin or Ian.
| 
| Of course (Lance Cottrell/Ian Goldberg/Pr0duct Cypher/Ben Laurie/Hal
| Finney/Eric Young/Colin Plumb) possibly deviated or mimicked one of
| their coding styles.  Kind of interesting to see a true nym in there
| also.
| 
| Also the Cc -- Coderpunks lives?  I think the Cc coderpunks might be a
| clue also, I think some of these people would know it died.  I think
| that points more at Colin.
| 
| Other potential avenue might be implementation mistake leading to
| failure of the scheme to robustly make undecidable which of the set is
| the true author, given alpha code.
