Speculation, nothing more.  Notice the "IMHO" above.  I'm not claiming
to be stating facts.

Most crypto algorithms are mathematically sound.  I'm not worried
about the NSA finding some miraculous way to factor large numbers.
I'm worried about the NSA discovering security bugs in crypto tools.
Just a few days ago, a bug was discovered in GnuPG that allowed for
clearsigned texts to be altered with the signatures remaining valid.
And, of course, there was the ADK bug in PGP.

These aren't technically bugs in cipher algorithms, but most mere
mortals, such as myself, utilize algorithms through security software
that may be, and very likely is, buggy.
