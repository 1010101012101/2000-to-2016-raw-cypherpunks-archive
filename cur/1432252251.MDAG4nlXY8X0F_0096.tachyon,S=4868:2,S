Missing uniforms revive 9/11 fears in Canada
Gurmukh Singh
Vancouver, December 7

The 9/11 has cast its shadow over Canada as hundreds of uniforms, including
badges, worn by screeners at 89 airports across Canada have gone missing,
setting alarm bells ringing over air travel safety in North America.

Numbering 1,127, the uniforms and badges have been stolen or gone missing
over a period of nine months.

Canadian and American aviation authorities fear the uniforms and badges
might be used by terrorists to gain entry into airports and hijack planes.
Hundreds of planes fly into the US every day from Canadian destinations.

Transport minister Jean Lapierre sought a report from the Canadian Air
Transport Security Authority (CATSA), which looks after security at the
nation's airports, on Saturday.

The minister was booed in Parliament when he tried to assure the House that
all possible steps were being taken to check the misuse of the uniforms.
Airports had been alerted and the private firms conducting screening at
airports asked to double-check the ID of all employees.
