The DVDCCA license requires that DVD equipment never allow access to
the raw digital data.

It is also quite evident that the MPAA was planning to use CSS as a
'hook' to force DVD player/software/equipment manufacturers to sign
this license. Essentially creating a licensing regime protected by
law.

This ties in nicely with the content manufacturers' dream of a
tamed digital environment where neither piracy nor fair use is
possible, and everything is pay-per-view, controlled and metered.
