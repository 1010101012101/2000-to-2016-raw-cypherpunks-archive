Who cares who sides with Al Qaeda?  They're not keeping track of their

perhaps?), and volunteers for martyrdom they want, not rhetorical
support.

The WTC and the pentagon were specific, well-thought-out targets.  The
plane that crashed in PA was headed to the Capitol.  If you're so eager
to see Al Qaeda blow up better targets, why not suggest a few?
