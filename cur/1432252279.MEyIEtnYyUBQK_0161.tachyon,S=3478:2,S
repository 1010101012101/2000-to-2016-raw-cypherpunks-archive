Dear Valued myspace Member,

As part of our ongoing efforts to provide users with quality products 
and services, myspace will be temporarily removing InBox from the 
myspace site.  

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  But, don't 
worry.  Inbox is not going away forever.  We will be reintroducing 
InBox in a short while as part of a premium myspace service that 
will include all of InBox's benefits, PLUS dedicated storage space 
and servers to ensure that our valuable customers receive the best 
service possible.

This change in service will take place in two phases.  1) Beginning 
on Friday, January 12, 2001, you will no longer be able to receive, 
send, or forward emails and files from your myspace InBox.  
2) On Friday, January 26, 2001, we will be temporarily removing InBox 
from the myspace site.  As of this date, you will no longer be able 
to access or retrieve files or emails previously stored in your 
myspace InBox.  

If you have files or emails in your InBox that you would like to 
use in the future, please move them into a folder within your 
myspace account or to another location prior to 
Friday, January 26, 2001.

Stay tuned for more news on the re-release of InBox and myspace 
premium services.

Sincerely,

The Myspace Team
