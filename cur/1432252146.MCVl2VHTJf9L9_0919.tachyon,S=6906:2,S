Pretty short-sighted if CRII is a Chinese govt. intel operation. Looking 
through my logs I see scans from rooted boxes in Guangdong. As well as 
hundreds of locations all around the world. A number of Middle Eastern 
locations, for instance. Unless they're all honeypots, they're giving as 
much as they're getting. If this supposition is true, which I doubt. 
Could have been anybody, and no particular reason to single out China 
over any other potential culprit.  Nope, no telling who, and more 
importantly, no point worrying about it, since everybody and his brother 
that's wont is exploiting it. Just chalk it up to entropy and deal with it.

I'm wondering if that Mykotronx box couldn't have done more guod for 
U.S. intel if it *had* gone to China, but I'm not familiar enough with 
it to know. Unless the recipient was planning to set up a counterfeit 
assembly line or something. In which case I wouldn't be too happy if I 
were Mykotronx.


Since Mykotronx is getting press, I will put in a word for Bytex, which 
also makes encrypting ATM firewalls and such. You can get a way-cool Leo 
Marks WWII Silk Code mousepad from their website, http://www.bytex.com, 
in exchange for your sekrit personal info.
