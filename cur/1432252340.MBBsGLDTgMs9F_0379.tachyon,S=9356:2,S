I think the simplest is probably true, they genuinely are after something,
they do a quick web search and a mass mail out to all matches.

I got this one which I can only attribute to the <<TUNNEL CONNECTION BETWEEN
DIVING TANK AND DEEP DIVING SIMULATOR IN CHINA-DSIGN & BUILD PROJECT>> above
method. (included
for entertainment value)
 

It is probably hard for people in some countries to get their hands on
certain equipment and thus end up resorting to Spam.

A 'sting' operation would be one where the only response would be one that
confirmed guilt, I think these are just mis-directed pleas for help, when
they should be doing a little more research and approaching only those
that can help.

The paranoid side of me notes a certain similarity in style (has anyone
else received emails like these?)

	cya,	Andrew...

I was 99% sure that these posts were some sort of spam-scam, whose
purpose I didn't quite get.  (Am I falling for it by replying?)

And about 1% doubtful that it might be a genuine company who had somehow
been tricked into sending mail to toad. In which case, if you are
reading this, know that your mail got sent to an obsolete gateway to a
discussion list on the political and economic effects of new
communication technologies & cryptography and we don't now anything
about scintillation meters (I haven't used one since September). 

But what if, just what if, it is some crazy snoop trying to fish for
illegal arms dealers? Are they that crass? Are they that imaginative? Do
they really have that much time and money to play with? Are these the
sort of people who have been so successful in getting Iraq to disarm?


(if there are any intelligence agents reading this, that last bit was an
example of "irony". This paragraph is "sarcasm".   You need to know
about those things to decode communications between civilians. Look it
up in the handbook. It will be in the exam.)

Dear Sir, 


We are working on a very interesting project as per captioned one. 

We take liberty to ask you whether you are interested to take part in this
particular project because you are a submarine builder.

We are seeking your technical comment whether you are interest and able to
DESIGN AND BUILD a CONNECTION TUNNEL SECTION for the captioned project. We
have to design and build this section between the DIVING TANK and DEEP
DIVE SIMULATOR. The diving tank is 8 Meter deep. The Deep Diving Simulator
is for training professional divers in different water depths. It can hold
a team up to 8 divers with full diving equipment. There will a hatch door
at the Tank and another one at the Simulator in the connection tunnel. The
1-2 M  diameter x 8 M length connection tunnel may be made of heavy duty
stainless steel or other stronger material. Our work will be including
this connection tunnel and the connecting/jointing systems at both ends.
The whole unit can be made and approval tested in your country by an
independent institute and ship to us for on site installation. 
 
If you are interested, please give us a check list of questions and
information that you would like to have at this preliminary stage. Then we
will obtain them from the Architect and Owner. If you would like to meet
and discuss this project in details, we can meet each other either in your
country or HK as you wish.

We are working closely with the architect on this project and they require
a preliminary proposal from us very shortly.
 
We can manage to design and build the connecting system between the tunnel
and the concrete wall opening at the diving tank. The opening detail of
the Simulator will be given by the supplier later. However we have no
experience to design and build the tunnel section itself that is subjected
to high water pressure internally. I think you may be able to use your
submarine technique to design and build this SECTION. 

Thank you and looking forward to your positive and reply soonest.
 
I will be in China the next whole week, you may reach me at my GSM in
China at + 86 1390 22 33 134. 
 
For your information, we are a specialist agent representing products like
under water side scan, multi-cable-transit and Linkseal for pipe for off
shore and inland.
