They most assuredly are enough to correct the problem, provided 
they are allowed to work.

If there is a resource limitation such that a larger population 
cannot be supported *easily*, then the market comes back into 
equilibrium by killing off the excess humans.  The problem is 
corrected, and things may then continue on a more even keel. 

Get it through your head -- the Market is NOT the same thing as 
the individual economic actors whose actions make it up.  That is 
the fundamental mistake made by Marx and Rousseau -- Thoroughly 
refuted by Adam Smith and Thoreau, but you can ignore the theorists 
anyway, and look at history for the refutation instead.
