We encourage the publication of the (paper) school records which the FLA
hurricane reportedly distributed to locals, as part of an effort to show
the sheeple

[FLA is required to bus lower caste students within counties, to achieve

a certain average complexion, so even in Jeb'$ neighborhood the schools
suck.]
