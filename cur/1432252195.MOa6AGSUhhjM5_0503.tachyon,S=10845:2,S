Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Release Advisory

Bank Pres Drags Journalist into NY Court Over Drug Expose

Electronic Frontier Foundation Urges U.S. Court to Respect Mexican Rulings

For Immediate Release: July 12, 2001

New York - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today urged a New York
state court to respect Mexican court rulings that have disallowed lawsuits
against independent journalist Al Giordano for publishing allegations of
drug trafficking by Banco Nacional de Mexico President Roberto Hernandez
Ramirez.

EFF seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of online, independent
journalists against the abusive "shopping" by large, powerful corporations
for favorable jurisdictions. The Mexican bank brought the case against a
Mexican-based website, produced solely by Giordano, the Narco News Bulletin:

http://www.narconews.com/.

"The EFF is concerned that the bank resorted to New York courts to try to
shut down this website because it could not do so in Mexican courts," said
Cindy Cohn, Legal Director for the EFF. "This kind of forum shopping
threatens to shut down one of the greatest benefits of the Internet --
giving a voice to independent, Internet-based journalists. Faced with having
to defend themselves in far-flung jurisdictions, many independent
journalists will simply choose not to publish on the Internet."

The case arises from allegations published on the the Narco News Bulletin
website that the bank president was involved in illegal activities in
Mexico. The EFF filed an amicus brief urging the New York court to rule that
it was improper for the bank to force Mr. Giordano into New York state court
for the statements posted on the website. The hearing on the case is set for
July 20, 2001.

Since April 18, 2000, Al Giordano has produced the Narco News Bulletin, an
online newspaper devoted to spirited investigative journalism on the
US-Latin America drug trade. Articles posted on the Narco News Bulletin
website have discussed allegations by others that Roberto Hernandez Ramirez,
the president of the Banco Nacional de Mexico, is involved in drug
trafficking. Some of these stories were reprinted articles from the Mexican
newspaper Por Esto!, published in Mexico by Mario Renato Menendez.

After failing three times to successfully sue Menendez in Mexico over the
allegations, Banco Nacional de Mexico now seeks to force Menendez and
Giordano to defend themselves in New York state court against the same basic
claims. The New York case groups together the allegations against the
Mexican-based website, hosted in Maryland, with statements made by Menendez
and Giordano in New York City on a radio broadcast and at a Columbia
University Law School conference.

The EFF amicus brief asked the Court to adopt one of two courses of action.
First, in order to deter abusive forum shopping, the EFF asked the court to
dismiss the case since Mexican law governs the dispute.
Alternatively, since Narconews.com mainly republished investigative work
done by others, the EFF asked the New York court to apply a distinct legal
standard for libel claims related to republished statements. The legal
standard requires that a republisher had, or should have had substantial
reasons to question the accuracy of the articles. EFF believes that this
higher liability standard for republishing on the Internet is necessary to
encourage the growth of Internet journalism.

Subject: New Legal Briefs: Friday's Hearing Heats Up



June 17, 2001
Please Spread the Word

Dear Colleagues,

Just a quick note, as we race toward Friday's New York Supreme Court hearing
in the Drug War on Trial case, to let you know that:

- Two new legal briefs are now linked from page one:

http://www.narconews.com/

(Joint memorandum by Narco News Bulletin and I, and my own sworn affidavit
about the latest court Exhibit, "The Mexico Papers" with lots of interesting
drug war facts)

- Tomorrow we shall post the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) amicus
brief in support of Narco News' motion to dismiss the Banamex lawsuit.

- At press time, we have heard of another amicus (friend-of-the-court) brief
being filed on our behalf, and as soon as we receive it, we will post and
announce it.

Apologies for being so brief about the briefs. For a pro se defendant, this
is worse than cramming for the bar exam.
