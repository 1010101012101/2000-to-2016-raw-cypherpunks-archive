Cypherpunks Mailing List Information

Last updated: Sep 12, 2002

This message is also available at http://www.lne.com/cpunk

Instructions on unsubscribing from the list can be found below.


0. Introduction

The Cypherpunks mailing list is a mailing list for discussing cryptography
and its effect on society.  It is not a moderated list (but see exceptions
below) and the list operators are not responsible for the list content.

Cypherpunks is a distributed mailing list.  A subscriber can subscribe to
one node of the list and thereby participate on the full list.  Each node
(called a "Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer", although they are not
related to anonymous remailers) exchanges messages with the other nodes
in addition to sending messages to its subscribers.  A message posted
to one node will be received by the list subscribers on the other nodes,
and vice-versa.

1. Filtering

The various CDRs follow different policies on filtering spam and to a
lesser extent on modifying messages that go to/from their subscribers.
Filtering is done, on nodes that do it, to reduce the huge amount of
spam that the cypherpunks list is subjected to.

There are three basic flavors of filtering CDRs: "raw", which send all
messages to their subscribers. "cooked" CDRs try to eliminate the spam
on that's on the regular list by automatically sending only messages
that are from cypherpunks list subscribers (on any CDR) or people who
are replying to list messages.  Finally there are moderated lists, where
a human moderator decides which messages from the raw list to pass on
to subscribers.

2. Message Modification

Message modification policy indicates what modifications, if any, beyond
what is needed to operate the CDR are done (most CDRs add a tracking
X-loop header on mail posted to their subscribers to prevent mail loops).
Message modification usually happens on mail going in or out to each CDR's
subscribers. CDRs should not modify mail that they pass from one CDR
to the next, but some of them do, and others undo those modifications.

3. Privacy

Privacy policy indicates if the list will allow anyone ("open"), or only
list members, or no one ("private") , to retrieve the subscribers list.
Note that if you post, being on a "private" list doesn't mean much,
since your address is now out there.   It's really only useful for
keeping spammers from harvesting addresses from the list software.

Digest mode indicates that the CDR supports digest mode, which is where
the posts are batched up into a few large emails.  Nodes that support
only digest mode are noted.

4. Anonymous posting

Cypherpunks encourages anonymous posting.

You can use an anonymous remailer:
http://www.andrebacard.com/remail.html
http://anon.efga.org/Remailers
http://www.gilc.org/speech/anonymous/remailer.html

or you can send posts to the list via cpunks_anon@einstein.ssz.com and
your mail's headers will be stripped before posting.  Note that this
doesn't provide complete anonymity since the receiving site will still
have log file entries showing the source of the mail (or you have to
trust that they delete them).  You also will be 'sharing' a reputation
with the other entities that post through this alias, and some of them
are spammers, so some subscribers will have this alias filtered.

5. Unsubscribing

Unsubscribing from the cypherpunks list:
Since the list is run from a number of different CDRs, you have to
figure out which CDR you are subscribed to.  If you don't remember and
can't figure it out from the mail headers (hint: the top Received: line
should tell you), the easiest way to unsubscribe is to send unsubscribe
messages to all the CDRs listed below.

How to figure out which CDR you are subscribed to:

Get your mail client to show all the headers (Microsoft calls this
"internet headers").  Look for the Sender or X-loop headers.  The Sender
will say something like "Sender: owner-cypherpunks@lne.com".  The X-loop
line will say something like "X-Loop: cypherpunks@lne.com".  Both of
these inticate that you are subscribed to the lne.com CDR.   If you were
subscribed to the algebra CDR, they would have algebra.com in them.
Once you have figured out which CDR you're subscribed to, look in the
table below to find that CDRs unsubscribe instructions.

6. Lunatics, spammers and nut-cases

"I'm subscribed to a filtering CDR yet I still see lots of junk postings".
At this writing there are a few sociopaths on the cypherpunks list who
are abusing the lists openness by dumping reams of propaganda on the list.
The distinction between a spammer and a subscriber is nearly always very
clear, but the dictinction between a subscriber who is abusing the list
by posting reams of propaganda and a subscriber who is making lots of
controversial posts is not clear.  Therefore, we tolerate the crap.
Subscribers with a low crap tolerance should check out mail filters.
Procmail is a good one, although it works on Unix and Unix-like systems
only.  Eudora also has a capacity for filtering mail, as do many other
mail readers.  An example procmail recipie is below, you will of
course want to make your own decisions on which (ab)users to filter.

# mailing lists:
# filter all cypherpunks mail into its own cypherspool folder, discarding
# mail from loons.  All CDRs set their From: line to 'owner-cypherpunks'.
# /dev/null is unix for the trash can.
