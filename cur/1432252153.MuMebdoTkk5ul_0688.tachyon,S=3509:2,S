	So did you discuss what was going to be done *after* the current 
government is destroyed? What sort of government will follow?

	Or was this just an exercise in later day bakuninism?

	I'm not (just) being a smart ass. If the necessary stuff was in 
place (fully anonymous digital currencies, blacknets, Bell's AP system 
etc.) the state would be gradually rendered ineffective, then die on the 
vine over a great enough time that people could adapt, institutions and 
attitudes could adjust.

	You can't just strike off a slaves chains and say "You're Free", 
that slave has to understand how to deal with freedom, he has to have 
the skills and thought processes to live without his "master" taking 
care of him. The vast majority of the people in this country lack one or 
more of skills and thought processes to live w/out an effective 
government.

	What are you going to do about that? Or is your purpose, like those 
Russian Nihilists, just to smash the state?
