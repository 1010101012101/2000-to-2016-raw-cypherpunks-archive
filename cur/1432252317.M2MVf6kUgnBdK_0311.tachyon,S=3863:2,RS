Good idea.  But, with all respect, I don't know you.  Epecially given the 
(very, very, very unfortunate) domain name, it would be much better to get 
an invite from someone I recall from the old days.  Preferably signed with 
a key on a keyserver with a decent trust chain.

And domain names are cheap.  CPUNKS-LIST.COM is available.  Why not pick a 
different one if you are serious about this? Or get someone to lend you a 
subdomain?
