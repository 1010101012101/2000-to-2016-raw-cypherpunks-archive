The Real Story Behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn, Pills,
and @*#?% Enlargements
O'Reilly Releases "Spam Kings"

Sebastopol, CA--At one time, spammer Davis Wolfgang Hawke grossed more
than $600,000 per month selling herbal male enhancement products over the
Internet. His customers came from all walks of life--CEOs, mutual fund
managers, soldiers, housewives, landscapers--in other words, people who
should have known better. Most people consider spam to be at least an
irritation; many consider it to be more: a scourge, a significant drain on
resources and money, a violation of the sanctity of one's personal
computer, even an assault against one's moral sensibilities.

With spam making up more than sixty percent of today's email traffic, it
is indeed a problem, but is the problem solely the fault of the spammers?
Brian McWilliams, author of "Spam Kings: The Real Story Behind the
High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn, Pills, and @*#?% Enlargements"
(O'Reilly, US $22.95, hardback), explores the shadowy world of the people
responsible for today's junk email epidemic. McWilliams reveals the
motivations and practices of the people who fill our email in-boxes with
spam, but he also points out, "Hawke's customer list just underscores one
of the key issues of the book. Spammers are willing to put up with all
sorts of wrath and attacks because they honestly believe customers want
what they have to offer."

McWilliams, an experienced investigative journalist who gained
international attention in 2002 when he wrote about the contents of Saddam
Hussein's email in-box for "Wired News," offers a fascinating account of
activities of spam entrepreneurs in search of easy money. He chronicles
the careers of several spam kings, including Hawke, the notorious Jewish-
born neo-Nazi leader.  The book traces this twenty-year old neophyte's
rise in the trade, which would make him a major player in the penis
enlargement pill market--and eventually a millionaire and the target of
lawsuits from AOL and others.

"Like a lot of people, I get tons of junk email," McWilliams explains. "But
in May, 2003, I was deluged with over one hundred spams for pills from  the
same company, all in a two-week span. I managed to trace the messages
to a firm in nearby Manchester, New Hampshire. I discovered spammers
practically in my backyard, and I decided to tell the world about it."

"I set out to write about the dozen or so spammers whom I thought were the
best representatives of this strange species," McWilliams continues. "But
in the process of researching the book, I was surprised to learn how
interconnected many of them were.  There's definitely less than seven
degrees of separation between the spam kings--and sometimes even
between the spammers and their antagonists, the anti-spammers."

In addition to Hawke, McWilliams introduces readers to other bizarre
denizens of the spam underworld, including Sanford Wallace, one of the
original spam kings, who insists that spam is a First Amendment right;
Jason Vale, the champion arm-wrestler and cancer survivor whose spam
messages promote Laetrile as a cure for cancer; Alan Moore, known as Dr.
Fatburn to his diet-pill customers; Rodona Garst, middle-class,
white-collar suburbanite by day, running stock pump-and-dump scams in her
spare time; and a fascinating assortment of others.

But "Spam Kings" isn't just about spammers; it also tells the story of
anti-spam cyber-activists, like Susan Gunn, a computer novice in
California whose outrage led her to join a group of anti-spammers.
McWilliams reports that in September 2004, the FTC recommended that
Congress consider creating a bounty system for people who help catch
spammers. Says McWilliams, "At present, anti-spammers hunt down spammers
as unpaid volunteers, but that could change if Congress decides to put a
bounty on a spammer's pelt."

In June, 2004, McWilliams notes, "AOL revealed that one of its employees
had sold AOL's entire member database to spammers. One of the people who
bought that list was Davis Hawke, the central figure of 'Spam Kings.'
Hawke's partner, Brad Bournival, was the unidentified source who
cooperated with law enforcement and enabled them to arrest two men in June
for the theft. The case is still pending, with indictments due any day."

McWilliams acknowledges that there are much bigger problems in the world
than spam, "But on the Internet, it's arguably THE biggest problem, since
junk email is limiting our ability to communicate, and communication is
the whole point of the Internet." McWilliams believes that eventually
technology will reduce spam back to a minor nuisance.  "But in the
meantime," he says, "the root of the spam problem is people; specifically,
the folks who buy from spammers. There's a big market out there of what I
call 'furtive shoppers'--people who want convenient, anonymous access to
shady products like porn, fake Rolex watches, drugs without prescriptions,
cable de-scramblers, and 'free' government grants."

"Spam Kings" sheds light on the technical sleight-of-hand--forged headers,
open relays, harvesting tools, and bulletproof hosting--and other sleazy
business practices that spammers use; the work of top anti-spam attorneys;
the surprising new partnership developing between spammers and computer
hackers; and the rise of a new breed of computer viruses designed to turn
the PCs of innocent bystanders into secret spam factories.

Praise for "Spam Kings":

"The inside story of who's behind all that junk filling up your inbox is
both good reporting and a good read. All the scum-sucking bottom-dwellers
of the spam underworld are represented, as well as many of the unsung
heroes in the war against unwanted email. "Spam Kings" should be required
reading for anyone who hates spam--which includes just about everybody
except spammers."
--Daniel Tynan, contributing editor, PC World

"Spam Kings" deftly exposes these creeps, humanizes them, and helps us to
understand how and why they do what they do. It isn't a pretty picture but
is one we all should look at and understand. Read this book."
--Robert X. Cringely, creator of the PBS documentary, "Triumph of the Nerds"

"Like a deep-sea photographer, McWilliams brings us a shocking series of
portraits of the bizzare creatures feeding and fighting at the bottom of
the Internet. Anyone who has wondered what kind of person would send spam
can find the answer here. The truth is stranger than fiction, and more
disturbing, as their tentacles reach us daily."
--Jason Catlett, founder and president of Junkbusters Corporation
