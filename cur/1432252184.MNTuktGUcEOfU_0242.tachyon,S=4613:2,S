"A friend of mine was blown up on the bench."

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?artid=18356788

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to Tehelka investigation 
editor Aniruddha Bahal, who was arrested earlier on charges of manhandling 
a CBI officer.The bail was granted by Metropolitan Magistrate Reena Singh 
Nag when Bahal was produced before her.
Granting him bail on the personal bond of Rs 25,000 and a surety for the 
like amount, she said that Bahal had to surrender his passport within a week.
Bahal was arrested by Delhi Police on Wednesday morning following a CBI 
complaint that he had manhandled one of the officers of the investigating 
agency.
CBI Deputy Superintendent of Police N S Kharayat, who is probing a case 
under the Official Secrets Act involving some scribes of the news portal 
and home ministry officials, had alleged that Bahal had abused and 
manhandled him when he had gone to the Tehelka office in connection with 
the probe on Monday.
Police has registered a case against Bahal under sections 186 (voluntarily 
obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public function), 353 
(assaulting or using criminal force to any person being a public servant in 
execution of his duty), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.
