It may be that the cybersec wizard encountered a TLA sting being
run on P2P -- those exact six IP addresses among tens of thousands, 
each wearing a sign that says Wikileaks right here, log us.

Someone writes that the USG has been seeding P2P with bogus files 
for quite a while in order to trace their arranged discovery and 
appearance elsewhere. Following the lead and using the means
and methoids of the copyright pig kissers.

To be sure that is what the USG and its contractors would claim to 
cover their ineptitude. Meanwhile, using old style bribing, burgling, 
paying lawyers and journalists and whistleblowers and hackers and 
goofy soldiers to entrap would-be info liberators, then turning those
captured into pig kissers.

No disrespect to pig kissers, they happily admit to doing whatever
is necessary to outwit professionals.
