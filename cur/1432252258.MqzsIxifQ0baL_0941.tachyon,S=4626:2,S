In the context that Bitcoin needs an anonymizing layer to be anonymous,
yes, it's rather silly.

Abuse through the plain old internet is likely far more of a problem
regarding volume of tickets generated.

There is this

That's why you should only use services that send such
deposit defaults to established third party 'charities' you preselect
when creating your account. The Bitcoin blockchain could be
used to prove your default was sent to such third party by posting
the txid to your account that you are now otherwise locked from
using (at least until some future deposit/appeal is made). A service
provider that has this charity policy, cancels an account, and then
chooses to steal the money for themselves would quickly develop
a painfully public reputation issue.

Some say service providers really shouldn't cancel accounts except as
matter of Law, not their own policy whim, but that's another issue altogether.
