With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and
