	I did, and you brought up the reason why yourself:

	It's not kindness, it's *for the money*.

	If I (as Evil Insurance Inc) can make money selling a policy, 
I am going to do it. If you have a genetic pre-dispositing to, say, 
Brain Cancer, and I can write a policy that says I cover you for 
everything *BUT* that, why shouldn't I?

	Yes, it might be inordinately expensive for you to get a 
policy that *does* cover brain cancer, but you will be covered for 
lung cancer (unless you choose to smoke), testicular cancer or 
Alzheimer's disease.

	I can make money, so I will.

	How so?

	Insurance companies make money 2 ways. First is through a 
slight profit on their premiums. The second is through *investing* 
that money.

	If they can invest wisely--and they should be able to after 
all, they're in it for the profits--and properly balance the payouts 
v.s. premiums equation--and they should, they've been doing it long 
enough--they should have no problems.
