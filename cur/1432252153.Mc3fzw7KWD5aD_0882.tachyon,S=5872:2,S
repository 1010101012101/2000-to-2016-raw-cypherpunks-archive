*IF* the battle takes place.  What if they gave a war and nobody came?  I
really doubt there would be any greater loss of human life were the meeting
held in Switzerland for reasons I'll get into below.

That's an interesting, but unsupported assumption.

Those may be their STATED reasons, but I submit that you have no idea what
the "protestors" actual motivations are.  If we all look back to our younger
days, I think we can see a much more plausible explanation for their
actions.  Hell raising.

For certain people at certain ages, it's FUN to riot, throw things at the
cops, trash stores, overturn cars and burn stuff.  It is exactly the real
lack of coherent messages from the "protestors" that supports this obvious
conclusion.  At the University of Michigan, the riots were basically the
same, only the justification was more banal--the outlawing of booze on
campus.

It should be obvious that these riots are not so much ideologically
motivated (though that's the pseudo-rational), but testosterone motivated.
Most of these monkeys couldn't spell anarchy let alone understand it
philosophically.  Let's not confuse the cover story with the real
motive--fucking stuff up for the fun of it.

So, if the "protestors" were faced with a REAL opportunity to get hurt,
other than the mostly fake danger of charging police lines, I doubt many
would bother to show up.  Hell, running with the bulls at Pamplona is a more
dangerous rite of passage than torching a MacDonald's in Genoa.

If you think these folks have deep ideological/philosophical support for
their rioting, you have been duped.
