Well, I never claimed to be Einstein, but your "3 simple steps" sound a hell 
of a lot like my recipe for making a ham sandwich:

First, order a steak in a restaurant.
Second, tell them to add two slices of bread.
Third, tell them you don't want beef as the primary meat of your steak, you 
want pork.
Tell them, "Uh, change that pork to ham, and put it between the two slices 
of bread".
Oi La! Instant Ham sandwich!
