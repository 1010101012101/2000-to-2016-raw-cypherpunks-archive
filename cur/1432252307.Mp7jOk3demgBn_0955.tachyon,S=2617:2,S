Tim is cackles from his hilltop fortress that he expects Assange 
to be found fatally injected with drugs in a gutter. Just being 
disappeared or Gitmo'd comfortably or Hollywoodized does 
not send the right warning to the world's tax authorities to 
boost budgets.

A show trial would be perfect. Assange is willing and eager.
Ellsberg pissing his britches, Wales kicking Ellsberg's shoe hoping 
a bust for publicity. The Internet would go over the top with delirium 
at being finally top featured as godawfully threatening as promised 
early on by its pimps and whores. Kelly, Gilmore, The Well, The
Archive, EFF, the globe's privacy hustlers -- what, you snoozed 
through week's of cryptoanarchy. Julian was wide awake taking 
notes. No credit to the mastermind of superiority, narcissitic 
Nietzsche (and those he stole his best gat from).

Tim wrote a provocative long essay a couple of months ago but 
barred publication, well, never answered a permission request.

He may be now violently executed -- that was foretold in the essay 
to happen immanently along with a gaggle of executioners.

Assange promises to do the same. Lessons learned.

Most likely a faked execution is in the offing, see Cryptoanarchy
under multiple personas used by Nazis in Brazil where Julian
has arranged a bunker (fuck Mike for banning Nazi too).
