I had a debate with my poli-sci prof, too. I asked her, specifically, about
anarchic institutions and the role of government. After a preamble about
there being nothing to discuss if there weren't any government, she
replied something like, "The role of government is to plot a vector
towards the unobtainable, in hopes that people will reach for it. Bad
regimes will throw lines at horror. Good ones throw them at the stars.
If a set of people with the reins of power steer things the wrong way,
it is indeed the duty of those governed to set them right."

I am sure I misquoted her, so I am not including her name. 

On another note, I just rejoined the CP list after a rather long
hiatus. I hope people will be just as abusive as when I left before.
