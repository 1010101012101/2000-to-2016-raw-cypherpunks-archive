Interesting.  So, in theory, someone could do their thing at a central 
console and next morning everybody at the company could be looking 
at their new linux desktop?  :-) The thought amuses me, but then so
does the thought of an outlook virus that installs RedHat.

I don't deny that such tools are useful when used as intended.  So is 
a sledgehammer, but that certainly doesn't stop it from being a highly  
destructive weapon that can be turned against its owner.

What gets me is that this contains a HUGE potential for security 
compromise, and people who don't know it exists aren't being given 
an opportunity to NOT get it.
