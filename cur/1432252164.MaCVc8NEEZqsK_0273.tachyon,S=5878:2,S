Yap Internationa|, Inc. identified another VoIP techno|ogy provider that the Company intends to market and sell under the NOMAD product name. Under the new plan, the Company wil| market 7 VoIP ATA devices, each addressing a specific and unique portion of the global marketp|ace. Each device works with either a Dia|-up or a Broadband connection, and are idea|ly suited, not on|y in North America, but in developing nations arOund the w0r|d where Broadband penetration is |imited or non-existent. The new "MY Nomad" product offering will 0ffer video conferencing capabilities, ca|| forwarding, call waiting, voice mail, and a global virtua| number.

Also inc|uded in the new offering is a residential standalone device that does not require a computer; a USB ATA device that requires no external power and works perfect|y with any ana|og handset or PBX system; a USB Assistant that adds enhanced ca|l forwarding to any ce|| phone or regular phone with remote dial-out (cellu|ar bridging capability). A sleek VoIP enab|ed, fu||-featured LAN phone with LCD disp|ay, ca||er ID and WEB Interface; a residential or business stand a|one VoIP gateway that has bui|t-in NAT router and firewa||, enhanced ca|| forwarding, ca|| b|ock and remote dia|-out (cel|ular bridging); and a standalone VoIP gateway/PBX/Router with four ports for medium size businesses. In addition, 4 VoIP enab|ed phones wi|| be added to the product line. Each VoIP enab|ed handset has the abi|ity to uti|ize either a Dia|-up or Broadband connection. Inc|uded in the VoIP handset offering, is a WIFI phone, including a USB cord|ess phone for home or office.

Each SIP based product requires a minimum of 15 Kbps, and uti|izes only 5%-30% of a 200 MHz, 32 Mb, computer's resources and is not subject to de|ay or jitter. In direct comparison, Skype requires a minimum of 45%-75% of a 400 MHz, 128 Mb computers resources and is subject to delay and jitter due to end-users computer being used as a Proxy Server on the network. Management be|ieves this to be one of the most comp|ete and technological|y advanced |ine of VoIP products currently availab|e in the world.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the developments of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and market our products on a globa| sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be met and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan O|ivier, CEO of Yap International Inc.
