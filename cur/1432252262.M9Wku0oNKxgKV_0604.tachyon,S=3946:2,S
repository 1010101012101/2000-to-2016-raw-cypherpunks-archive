Simple codes were used during the operations of the business - for
example, many words were made up almoset like
a Spanish version of Pig-Latin - "Coban" meant Banco, or bank, "Tebille"
meant "Billette" or cash, "Tabogo" was
Bogota... also some words were simple substitutions: if someone was
"sick", that meant they had been spotted by the
police, various numbers needed to be multiplied by several thousand to
arrive at the real amounts, depending heavily
on context. "Five pesos" was generally five hundred dollars, while "One
Peso" was generally a million. Some more
peculiar shorthand was "Rock and roll" (in English) for car, if they had
a "Colibri", that was a tail, and handcuffs
were referred to as "engagement rings" in a few cases. Another code was
used between the drug lords in Columbia
and Caliche to talk about phone numbers - the word "CONTEMPLAR" was used
to correlate the first letter of a name
with a number, e.g. "Tomas, Carlos, Olivier" would be "T,O,C" or 420. On
top of this, each worker had a code
number to identify himself when beeping Caliche or each other to have
them call back. There were a few other
beeper codes, like "51", meaning "A Successful round" or transfer of
cash or drugs, while "911" meant an urgent
message.
