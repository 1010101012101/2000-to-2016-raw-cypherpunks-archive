Feds tend to stick out in the same way she does.  That does not 
prove she is a fed of course, it is not even particularly good 
evidence that she is a fed, but there are feds on this list.

She does not know enough about us to bait us correctly -- she 
also issues appeasing win-their-confidence stuff, and it is the 
wrong stuff.  That incompetent buttering up very fed like 
behavior.  Someone who does not know enough to issue the right 
win-their-confidence stuff usually does not care enough to issue 
win-their-confidence stuff.  Of course it could be she is merely 
incompetently trying to douse the flames she has incompetently 
raised.  The distinctive characteristic of an undercover fed is
that they are pretending to be someone they are not, and doing it
badly, confused about what their role is, and uninformed of how
real people in that role act -- for example her recent flame
againt ZKS.  Real people who are really concerned about the
security of ZKS, and really hate and fear the NSA, do not talk
like that.

Now quite possibly she is just upset by getting continually 
flamed, and is just putting on a rather bad act to persuade us 
she is on our side.  But putting on a rather bad act is also 
something feds do.  Incompetent acting is does not mean one is a 
fed, but if one is a fed, it means one acts incompetently.
