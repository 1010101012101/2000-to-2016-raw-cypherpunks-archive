Well see...

What is 'obscene'?

>     o child pornography

What is 'pornography'?

As to the 'child' part of that, any interaction with a minor in any way
without parental consent should be grounds for immediate hanging (just
kiddin').

>     o generated non-child child pornography

What two or more consenting adults do is between them and nobody else.

                                 Amendment I

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

                                Amendment IX

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

                                 Amendment X

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people.

Now a couple of questions for you...

Where in the Constitution does it say the fed's are supposed to regulate
pornography or sex?

Where in the Constitution does it draw a distinction with regard to 'the
people' between adults and minors?

The 10'th Amendment clearly makes these issues STATE issues, not federal
ones.

Simply because a bunch of religious fascist/socialist wanna do it don't
make it right.

See first two para's of the DoI.
