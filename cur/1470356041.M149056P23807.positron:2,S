I haven't yet been able to convince myself that "large and dominant
syndicates" are even necessary. Do we really need large scale coordination
separated into different cliques like that, or is it possible to have a
single large network (in the abstract sense) of distributed transactions?
If transaction costs get close enough to zero, the optimal firm size goes
to one. So the question becomes how much we can reduce transaction costs.

This feels right to me. Which is to say I think it's right but don't know
enough to make a good argument for it.

I don't know if I understand the point well enough to debate it, but I'm
interested to know what your definition of "public" is. Does such a thing
exist with respect to government? Aren't they really government roads?
Please forgive me if that's the exact kind of discussion you want to go
onto another thread.

I've been slowly slogging my way through Robert K. Massie's _Dreadnought_,
and it struck me how openly the government of the British Empire considered
themselves primarily protectors of the commercial interests of British
companies. I suspect future historians will think us terribly naive to
think that capitalism and mercantilism are different things. Capitalism,
for the most part, seems to be just mercantilism with less transparency and
the more competition for the government's favor. "Competition" being
competition to see who can give the most political donations to the right
people, etc.

I think most of the time it's not even fear of being shot,  though. It's
fear of losing privileges. Anyone can be blackballed in any industry at any
time. Just associate them with kiddie porn or name them as a "person of
interest" in some investigation.

I think it's both, really. You qualify it with "political" here, and I
think that's right. Unfortunately it's a pretty "charged" term, though, so
it will only convey your meaning in particular circles.

I haven't yet been able to figure out how much of a collectivist or
individualist you are, but "democracy" strikes me as a fairly collectivist
term. It's rule by the people over all the other people. I prefer rule of
oneself by oneself. To the extent possible, at least.

I'm a fan of "polycentric order" or "polycentric law" myself. Though that

The temptation to design is a very hard one to avoid. It took me a long
time to break myself of it. In fact, it was an individualist anarchist who
finally broke me of the habit.

Despite probably being the "wrong" kind of anarchist according to many
here, Hans-Hermann Hoppe does a pretty good job of obliterating the notion
that voluntary societies cannot defend themselves from traditional
nation-states in _The Myth of National Defense_.

In any case, though, Zen (and I) expect such a society to evolve alongside
and among traditional nation-states, so it has to be able to protect itself
or it could not exist in the first place. So there's no need to "site" the
society anywhere.

If we do get access to our own planet, though, it might help things along a
bit. Of course, then you run into the problem that all
intentional/constructed communities run into, which is that they have an
extremely low probability of success. This is one of the reasons I've
mostly gotten over the idea of seasteading as the answer to our problems.
Of course, while an *individual* seastead might have very low probability
of success, tens of thousands might produce a couple of interesting ideas.

And a "transition" or "emergency" government that's really just a

And often this is "literally" true - the old servants become the masters
and the masters become worm food. And then the old servants are just as
brutal of masters, if not moreso, than their old masters. Especially if the
new masters really did comes from the lowest echelons of society where they
have no experience at all with leadership. At least internal coups don't
tend to have this problem quite so badly. But they also don't tend to
change much.

Personally, I don't plan to go to war at all, ever, if I can avoid it. And
by "avoiding" I mean "can physically escape with my loved ones," not "I've
tried everything else to effect change and now must take up arms." I care
enough about my home to kill an individual or small band who try to invade
it, and even to band together with my neighborhood to do so, but not to go
to war. I'm not sure I could tell you what the crossover would be in terms
of level of organization, but I'd guess it's at the level where we need to
resort to any kind of abstraction.

They are not on the bottom, though. They are the bourgeoisie. They
typically form alliances with those on the bottom by promising to make
their situation better, though never better than their own. Go with us to
war and we'll share the spoils (unequally) with you.

Historically, it's been very hard for small syndicates to grow into large
ones without winning favor from the existing players. Today we have Ubers
that can grow without having a revolution. It used to be much harder.

I don't consider this a likely contingency. The trend has been toward LESS
violence, and there is no particular reason to believe that there's a
simple inverse relationship between income and fertility rate. Doesn't mean
I am not hedging against such a possibility, but I'm certainly not betting
on it, just making it more likely my family and I could survive it if it
happens.

The economies of developed countries are too intertwined for USD to "go
down hard" without taking a lot of other economies with it. What do you
think will happen to the Chinese economy if, for example, the US suddenly
stops buying their products? They'd have a bunch of saved dollars to spend,
and the best way to spend them would be on American goods. More likely it
would be gradual and we'd see a shift in the US back toward manufacturing.

The US government actually *wants* the dollar to decline in value. It makes
US products more competitive both domestically and abroad. It causes
inflation and thus reduces real incomes and debt. It would put a bunch of
people back to work. Sure, skyrocketing oil prices would hurt the US
economy, but look how much US investment there is in electric cars, solar,
etc. And nobody in the US is going to be buying Chinese solar panels when
they're no longer cheap. They'll be buying American ones.

Yeah, I don't see history as a series of disasters either. Just paradigm
shifts. But I guess I'm fundamentally a "progressive" and not a
neoreactionary. But then again, I don't see how anyone who understands
evolution can think it can't apply to human knowledge & culture as much as
it does to genomes. Unless they're predisposed to believing there's nothing
they can do anyway, because they would otherwise feel back about NOT doing
anything. Most of us do seek meaning, after all, and it can be hard to
accept that your life thus far has had none. Or maybe I'm just more
sanguine about it because I have my backup strategy: kids. And I want to
believe they're not destined to live in a world that's shittier than the
one I grew up in.

I'm not opposed to "radical decentralization of industry and agriculture,"
provided there is not a significant reduction in productivity, which with
improvements in technology there doesn't have to be, especially when you
account for the increase in resilience & the reduction in the (presently
hidden/subsidized) cost of transporting food/goods over long distances.

I suspect this is the direction technology is already leading us, though.
Take steel mills as an example: they reached peak scale in the 1950s or so
and then got outcompeted by smaller, more flexible mini-mills with smaller
machines with less up-front investment. Farming equipment is getting
smaller and smaller, and I suspect a lot of the current scale of farming is
a result of artificial barriers to competition, *not* the technology or
genuine economies of scale. Get rid of those barriers, and the scale will
naturally fall as smaller, more flexible firms and individuals jump into
the market.

I think the only thing I'd add here is that it's important not to lump all
genetic modifications together. While some of them may be "gratuitous" and
dangerous, others may turn out to be vital, like salt tolerant crops, more
nutritious grain varieties, etc. I suspect patent reform would go a long
way toward reducing the problems with genetic modification.

I would submit that progress toward a more voluntary society would ALSO
produce greater resiliency. How do you propose to convince a large fraction
of the population to move away from cities, farm, and make their own stuff?
How do you propose to get them to stop using computers, or to decentralize
the manufacture of computers? I'm not saying this is not doable. In fact, I
think it IS doable, but it's going to take the development of new
technologies. I'd love a chip fab that I could own as an individual or in a
partnership with a few friends. I'd love a robot gardener that could turn
my back yard into a farm without my needing to spend a significant fraction
of my time doing it (which is also known as "subsistence.")

"Eat local" doesn't work when there's a "local" drought.
