So what you need is wide scale deployment of the stego decoder in some
otherwise popular software.  Eg. talk ID Games into putting a stego
subliminal channel in doom computer generated character movements so
network doom players can talk to each other steganographically by
playing a game and typing in some "cheat mode" to switch the mode on.

(The stego channel is the RNG).
