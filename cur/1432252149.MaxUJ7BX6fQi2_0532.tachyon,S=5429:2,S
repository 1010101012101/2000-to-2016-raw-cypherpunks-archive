Re saddam et all...
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EL19Ak01.html

The war of words over Saddam & Bush is quite amusing. The blind faith in ones
govt structure and the willingness to support force that is in such extreme
measure overpowering and statist such as the dropping of tons of depleted uranium
high explosives shows that some on this list have not broadened their news
reading beyond fox news.

What courage is required to fly at 40000 ft and drop the MOAB containing DU
on essentially defenceless targets? How can people think that Bush would never
harm civilians? It does not really matter if there are democrats in the whitehouse
or "republican" kings appointed by courts. Just because you choose not to deeply
examine the effects of the policies of your govt does not make them "reasonable".
Successful policies  and reasonable policies can be two different things. Its
possible to be both successful and reasonable. Its also possible to be successful
and un-reasonable...

Saddam merely gassed a few thousand people maybe. Bush senior's gulf war and
now Shrub's fine legacy will ensure the slow torturous death of many generations
of Iraqis and those American soldiers involved. The awful horrors of Stalin,
Hitler and Saddam will pass with a few generations... the half-life of DU is
in billions of years.Re American soldiers: Bush has cut medical care for active
duty personnel as well as veterans.(link via google search: http://www.veteransforpeace.org/bush_cuts_vet_benefits_041503.htm)

The childish blind faith in US statist instituitions does not make their pronouncements
right.This is no better than those that blindly followed their communist or
nazi leaders.

The USA is at the heights of its power because of a well defined strategy of
monetary and military control of the world (the dollar as the currency of international
trade and its consequences, see links below).

Only the people of the USA can prevent the degeneration of their vaunted state
into a hellhole that will make the Soviets blush. The seeds are in place -
fine grained monetary oversight, 99.99% unsecured easily intercepted private
conversation, the shredding of the "bill of rights", willing armies of police
and other govt organized thugs, the impending death of the dollar as the only
currency of international trade, the overvalued stock market with absurd PEs,
the willingness to scam for a buck (Enrons, Halliburton etc), the lack of true
capitalism and open competition in certain sectors [eg medical cos, microsoft].
Those on this list should know better. Note: I'm not suggesting that this is
going to happen overnight, but as I said the seeds are in place...

Some links to ponder:

Why is the width of damage to the pentagon not as wide as a 757 (flt 77)?

Of course there will be the chest pounders vouching for their wonderful state...
about how all this is Internet garbage. Those unwilling to make a deep and
wide investigation are unteachable. Bush needs you.
