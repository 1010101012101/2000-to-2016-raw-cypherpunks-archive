Well, what about Shanghai, Guangzhou, and a bunch of the other coastal 
Chinese cities? No doubt they're clearly hammering their way out of any 
"slum" status, and oddly enough with CCP help. (Of course, there aren't any 
communists left in the Chinese Communist Party.) Well, 'help' is possibly 
tto strong a word...the Communist Party has basically been backing out of 
daily life for 20 years or so.

One could also argue that Mumbay/Bombay has a shot of de-slumming. At least, 
this seems to be one Indian city where the effects of an exploding Indian 
middle class are more easily seen.

In general, I agree. The big slum cities seem to remain slums and get 
bigger. But the existence of sizable cities where de-slumification is 
happening indicates this is not the inevitable fate of big slum cities. (Or 
perhaps there's some slum-line beneath which it becomes exponentially more 
difficult for cities to crawl out of.)

Hey wait...I just forgot about the most obvious counter-example, literally 
underneath me: New York! (Though 1970s slum-NYC had a lot more character 
than the present day-washed out self-simulacrum its becomming.)
