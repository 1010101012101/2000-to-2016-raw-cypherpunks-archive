Eudora has trouble with some of the MIME variants used by Mutt.
I don't know if that's because Mutt's outputting wrong formats,
or because Eudora's failing to interpret them correctly,
but if they reuse the same code in their mail servers
it wouldn't be surprising if their policy chokes on some of it.
And there's *lots* of other badly formatted mail out there,
though lots of that is spam.

If you do good bouncegrams when you reject incorrectly formatted mail,
the sender will probably retry, so occasional false positives
on mail from humans aren't a big problem, and of course bouncing
mail from spambots isn't a problem.  The worst case is when you
reject mail that was generated by a bot you actually *wanted*
to receive mail from, but hopefully most of those have 
administrators checking their rejects.
