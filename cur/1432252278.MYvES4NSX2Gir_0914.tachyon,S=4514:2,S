No, she was using THEIR property and services.

I hope you mean explicit, otherwise you ain't got a leg to stand on -
zero 'meeting of minds'.

Censorship is not strictly limited to government...

Censor -

Official who examines anything to be read, heard, or viewed, in order to
suppress some objectionable feature on moral, political, or military
grounds.

Note it does NOT require government membership to be an official.

Everybody self-sensors, all day, every day. Nothing wrong with it since
the individual is the ONLY agent with the authority to decide
applicability or acceptability.
