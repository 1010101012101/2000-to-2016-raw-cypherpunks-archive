A wild thought that occurs to me is that some mileage could be had by 
using remotely attested servers to verify _signatures_ of untrusted 
peer-to-peer stuff. So, you get most of the benefits of peer-to-peer and 
the servers only have to do cheap, low-bandwidth stuff.

I admit I haven't worked out any details of this at all!

Cheers,

Ben.
