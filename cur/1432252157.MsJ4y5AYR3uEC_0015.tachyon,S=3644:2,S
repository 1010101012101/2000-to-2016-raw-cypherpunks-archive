The friend was Daryl Cherney, and he's not dead, and is still 
making trouble ^H^H^H singing folk songs up near Humboldt, I
think. He was mentioned recently in the Contra Costa Times for
helping to coordinate a womens' topless protest against 
clearcuts in coastal northern CA. 

My guess is that the left's Tim McVeigh (or David Koresh, or
Randy Weaver, for variants on that story) will come out of
the animal liberation groups - Rodney Coronado has already
spent a fair amount of time in jail, and there's whoever set
that log-cabin-style ski lodge in Vail on fire. Ted 
Kaczynski seems like a good candidate - I think he and
McVeigh have been talking in prison, they're being held in
the same facility IIRC. 

But most of the left is too superstitious about having a
personal relationship with violence for a likely suspect to 
emerge - they don't really embrace it until they're already
in power, and then they're happy to use the existing 
institutional providers of force.
