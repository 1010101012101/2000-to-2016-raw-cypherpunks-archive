Subject: Risks of the Passport Single Signon Protocol


> Risks of the Passport Single Signon Protocol
> by David P. Kormann and Aviel D. Rubin
>
> Passport is a protocol that enables users to sign onto many different
> merchants' web pages by authenticating themselves only once to a common
> server. This is important because users tend to pick poor (guessable) user
> names and passwords and to repeat them at different sites. Passport is
> notable as it is being very widely deployed by Microsoft. At the time of this
> writing, Passport boasts 40 million consumers and more than 400
> authentications per second on average. We examine the Passport single signon
> protocol, and identify several risks and attacks. We discuss a flaw that we
> discovered in the interaction of Passport and Netscape browsers that leaves
> a user logged in while informing him that he has successfully logged out.
> Finally, we suggest several areas of improvement.
