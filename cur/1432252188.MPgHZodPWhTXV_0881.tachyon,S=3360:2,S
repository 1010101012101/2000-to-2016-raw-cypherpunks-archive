Subject: [Freedombox-discuss] Introduction

Finding my path shares much with FreedomBox.

At home in the mountains, I live on a HughesNet satellite connection and
hanging a server on that connection is impractical. Recently set up another
connection at my home in Fairfax, VA and could not get my Buffalo router off
of port 80. I had a spare Dell Dimension 2400 so I undertook to make it a
server gateway.

For good or evil, I live on Ubuntu and I wrote the simplest instructions I
could. http://ls.net/category/topics/linux-server-class. About a dozen
people have managed to replicate the experiment. Sinne tasksel does most of
the heavy lifting, the process on Debian should be similar.

I'd like to do this on a "green" box. I felt deterred by the marginal cost
of dual nic motherboards but USB Ethernet adapters probably make that
irrelevant. The price of laptops is still dropping and the issue may be
moot.

Still struggling with a reliable DDNS solution. BIND/nsupdate seems to be
doing its job but I am noit getting proper name resolution.

To me the central issue is capacity building. People with their hands on a
server have a better chance of developing understanding than those who
delegate that task to others.

Jim
