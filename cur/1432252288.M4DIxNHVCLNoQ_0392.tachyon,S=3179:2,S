I haven't seen this brought up on this list yet, so I thought I would  
mention it.  Tech Dirt (among others) are reporting on yet another round  
of misguided (U.S.) legislation supposedly targeting copyright  
infringement.  Part of this legislation involves attempting to prevent DNS 
from resolving "offensive" domain names.  The part that seems like it could 
potentially affect Tor (in my non-lawyer) mind is:

"To ensure compliance with orders issued pursuant to this section, the  
Attorney General may bring an action for injunctive relief.... against any 
entity that knowingly and willfully provides or offers to provide a  
product or service designed or marketed for the circumvention or bypassing 
of measures described in paragraph (2) and taken in response to a court 
order issued pursuant to this  subsection, to enjoin such entity from 
interfering with the order  by continuing to provide or offer to provide 
such product or service."
