One of the more troubling (to me) things is Chemerinsky's comment that 
people have no expectation of privacy in public.  The idea that you
may follow someone around with a video camera, take mm scale radar
pictures through their clothes, etc, etc without their permission
because they are in a public space is simply wrong.

The free-speech-chilling nature of this technology should be clear.
