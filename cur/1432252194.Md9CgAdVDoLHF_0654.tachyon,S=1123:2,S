Hello Emilio

How about buying yourself a two Emporio Armani watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks

Get two deeply discounted watches and take an extra 15% discount.

Our Emporio Armani have Weights/feels and looks exactly same as original.

Sincerely,
Mr Armstrong
