bootstrapping is hard, particularly when you must include a robust
reputation metric.  "anonymous digital gold tokens" is really too
narrow, as what you seek is exactly a robust reputation / trust metric
tied to the economy of peer interaction.  digital cash is attractive
because the reputation it embodies is fungible, but other forms of
reputation are useful and may prove more effective in certain
contexts, particularly when your adversary is well funded (think
"creeping death attacks"). [0]

oh, if it were so simple!  payment alone is not sufficient, this
[dark|anonymous|private]net requires robust reputation and usability
too.  payment is part of that equation, but other incentives to
participate and contribute must be addressed.  remember mojonation /
mnet? [1]

heheh, it's going to be a fun ride.  this also points to the
"incentive" for big government to crush with extreme prejudice any
such crypto-anarcho-capitalist digital economies.  a robust and
private economy of that sort would be popular, efficient, and a clear
threat to fiat money control.  decentralized, robust reputation
metrics capable of defending against such adversaries are difficult,
to put it mildly.

i wish i could have been there; sounds like an interesting talk.
there is a lot more i'd like to discuss regarding digital bearer
settlement, blinded digital cash, reputation metrics, and incentives
for privacy preserving networks and services, but i'll have to save
that for later, as the incentive of continued employment has overcome
the incentive for enjoyable and enlightening conversation... ;)
