  Online gambling to become part of defense bill?

  Frist trying to piggyback credit card ban on military funding authorization

  The Associated Press

  Updated: 8:07 p.m. ET Sept 13, 2006

  WASHINGTON - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is trying use a bill
  authorizing U.S. military operations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan, to
  prohibit people from using credit cards to settle Internet gambling debts.

  Frist, R-Tenn., and his aides have been meeting with other lawmakers and
  officials in both the House and Senate to get the measure attached to a
  compromise Defense Department authorization bill, according to a Senate GOP
  leadership aide.

  The House passed a version of the Internet gambling measure in July, but
  the Senate has taken no action on similar legislation. Neither of the
  defense bills passed by the House and Senate mention it.

  Frist is pushing for an approach that isn't quite as sweeping as the House
  measure, said the leadership aide and lobbyists following the issue. All
  spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing negotiations.

  Frist, eyeing a 2008 presidential bid, recently discussed the online
  gambling measure in the politically important state of Iowa. He also called
  it a legislative priority in a recent speech on the Senate floor.

  The measure's supporters include the National Football League as well as
  conservative and antigambling groups. Some banking groups are lobbying
  against it.

  Federal officials have made recent arrests involving offshore companies
  operating Internet gambling sites. The Internet gambling industry is
  headquartered almost entirely outside the United States although many of
  its customers live in the U.S.

  The bills authorizing defense programs are: S.2507 and H.R.5122.
