Research in geosynchronous power satellites is still being funded.  One 
program, started in Japan but which is now also funded by NASA, uses 5.7 
GHz transmission to a ground based RECifying anTENNAs.  Another project 
intends to use IR lasers.  My understanding is these projects are receiving 
serious funding and prototypes should fly soon.
