As a person who holds a physics degree you should know the best guess 
number of dimenions is somewhere in the 20+ range (ie Super Symmetry).
Some of those dimensions are linear (ie x-axis) and some have very little 
'lenght' at all, and others are 'twisted' back upon themselves.

You should also know better than to try to seperate the time from the
space dimensions. It's hard to discuss concepts like 'phase space' without
a time dimension (especially in the context of a network).
