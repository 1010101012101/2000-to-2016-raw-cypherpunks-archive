By this same Inchoate "logic," no one is free because, by our nature, we
cannot fly like a bird.  Political freedom means the opportunity to make
choices within the context of our circumstances.  Yeah, the "sweatshop"
workers' choices are lousy, but they have, in fact, made their choice to
improve their lives by working in the "sweatshops" as opposed to starving on
their own retched little plots of land.  Good for them.
