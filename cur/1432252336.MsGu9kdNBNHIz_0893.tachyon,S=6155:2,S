His example was pretty far-fetched, though. Getting all the ISPs to log
all their mail so that all remailer users could be identified would be
quite a feat, and then compromising all of them with Magic Lantern would
be rather difficult as well.

Magic Lantern works if you have a meat-space suspect in mind. If all you
have to go on is an anonymous email, it won't help much, unless it were
designed to target the remailers themselves (bringing us to your next
point).

According to current laws? I admit I haven't read Patriot all the way
through, but it seems to me that an LEA would still need a warrant to
black bag a remailer, if the operator wasn't under suspicion of being a
terrorist. (Not that I would expect such warrants to be denied, nor would
I be surprised if Son of Patriot permitted warrantless sneak and peek jobs
on service providers.)

Yes, and we see them now with Carnivore, etc.

I agree completely.

I suppose the question lingering in the back of my mind is "how hard would
it be for the FBI to create such a monitoring system?"

Correlation analysis can't offer much after the fact for a one-time
communication through a remailer. The system would need to be in place
and collecting data prior to the message being sent.

I suppose it wouldn't be too difficult to deploy something along those
lines, though, in US-friendly countries at least. Place a sniffer directly
upstream of each remailer (at most 50?) and you'll know the real headers
for the accounts each and every remailer user sends mail from. That's
within the FBI's ability, I think. Then the problem of what to do with the
remailers in countries where getting Carnivore or similar installed
wouldn't be so easy. Sniffers on the US border routers probably isn't
practical.

How much of an increase in dummy-messages could the remailer network
withstand? I'm trying to think of interesting ways to create more
widespread dummy traffic coming from many different origins, but that
could get out of hand rather quickly.
