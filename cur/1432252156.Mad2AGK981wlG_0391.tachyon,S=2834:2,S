Hacker Defaces Pro-Israel Web Site

By JOHN SCHWARTZ

The Web site for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying
group, was defaced Wednesday with anti-Israeli commentary - an
increasingly common occurrence as the escalating conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians has spilled over into cyberspace.

But this time the intruders also downloaded some 3,500 e-mail addresses
and 700 credit card numbers from the site, sent anti-Israeli diatribes
to the mailing list and published the credit card data on the Internet.

"This hack is to protest against the atrocities in Palestine by the
barbarian Israeli soldiers and their constant support by the U.S.
government," said a manifesto that the attackers put in place of the
lobbying group's home page.
