Yes, I basically agree. But on the other hand, a bootleg in the old days 
meant braking laws regarding illicit recording of an event. (As I remember) 
you also broke a law regarding the copyright of the performance. Cassette 
copies of vinyl were a tiny bit tricky, and the "gap" allowed for copying 
for home use and maybe for a few friends.

Basically, this was what I was wondering. When we move from the analog 
domain to the digital, how does one identify the data? It's no longer a 
series of 1s and 0s, because I can change the 1s in 0s in a non-correctable 
way (which is what happens with lossy compression) and still go to jail for 
transmitting that bitstream.

Without a doubt, the courts have not bothered to give precise definitions to 
what a "copy" truly is in the digital domain. Even samples count as full 
copies, apparently. This means, then, that even a small sample (ie, the 
bitstream 0101110111) is a "sample" from something somewhere (probably 
practically everything) and hence could land me in jail.

Unlike some Cypherpunks, I'm more litely anti-statist: One can only claim 
legitimacy for a state if the laws are well defined enough so as to allow 
for nonarbitrary enforcement (and I only said "claim", so I don't need 
killin...yet).

Of course, there are probably legal arguments made somewhere that refer to 
the perceived identity of a track or sample, so I guess what I'm really 
asking is if anyone knows what they are and if they make any sense (aside 
from giving big corporates the ability to whack any college student they 
want to make an example of).
