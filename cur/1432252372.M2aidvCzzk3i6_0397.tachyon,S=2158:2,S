In related news, Homeland Security reported that there have been
sightings of a Big Scary Wolf near the edges of Your Village.
"These aren't the usual Wolf reports - there's serious chatter
among shepherd sources and we've interrogated a bunch of sheep lately
who've confirmed that the Wolf is out there and identified a
bunch of different parts of the village where the wolf may strike next."

I'm getting really tired of the irresponsibility of the
American press reporting this stuff uncritically.
