Stratfor Hacked, 200GB Of Emails, Credit Cards Stolen, Client List Released,
Includes MF Global, Rockefeller Foundation

Submitted by Tyler Durden on 12/24/2011 21:10 -0500

This Christmas will not be a happy one for George Friedman (who incidentally
was the focus of John Mauldin's latest book promotion email blast) and his
Stratfor Global Intelligence service, because as of a few hours ago, hacking
collective Anonymous disclosed that not only has it hacked the Stratfor
website (since confirmed by Friedman himself), but has also obtained the full
client list of over 4000 individuals and corporations, including their credit
cards (which supposedly have been used to make $1 million in "donations"), as
well as over 200 GB of email correspondence. And since the leaked client list
is the who is who of intelligence, and capital management, including such
names as Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller Foundation and, yep, MF Global, we
are certain that not only Stratfor and its clients will be waiting with bated
breath to see just what additional troves of information are unleashed, but
virtually everyone else, in this very sensitive time from a geopolitical
point of view. And incidentally, we can't help but notice that Anonymous may
have finally ventured into the foreign relations arena. We can only assume,
for now, that this is not a formal (or informal) statement of allegiance with
any specific ideology as otherwise the wargames in the Straits of Hormuz may
soon be very inappropriately named (or halfway so).

Chronology of releases from AnonymousIRC starting early this afternoon:

    #AnonSanta just told us: "Currently rm -rf'n targets and shredding logs"
#LulzXmas #Antisec

    We just hear that #AnonSanta battle-sleigh plundered 200gb of emails and
other booty before he started to deliver his presents. #LulzXmas

    From IRC: "** Are you all ready to witness the rm -rf /* of a major
intelligence corporation, live on IRC and twitter?" #LulzXmas

    5 minutes and counting. #AnonSanta won't disappoint you. Get on IRC now
for the whole spirit of #LulzXmas.

    FUCK IT, HE'LL DO IT LIVE! FUCKING THING SUCKS, HE'LL DO IT LIVE! |
http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23anonops&server=irc.anonops.li | #LulzXmas

    A wild rm -rf /* appears: http://www.stratfor.com/ | #LulzXmas from
#AnonSanta | #AntiSec plundered 200gb of their mails and more booty.

    #Stratfor #LulzXmas takedown mirrored forever: zone-h.org/mirror/id/1641b&

    "You do realize how preposterous it is to suggest that #stratfor simply

    shutdown completely for 2 days, right?" ~ Frank Ginac (IT manager)

    Merry #LulzXmas to everyone http://imagebin.org/190224 Stratfor rooted.
All your base are belong to us. <3 #Anonymous

    http://bit.ly/ulWECe | #Anonymous/#AntiSec Attack #STRATFOR | #LulzXmas
#AntiSec

And the kicker:

    The private (and secret) client list of #Stratfor:
http://pastebin.com/8MtFze0s | Not so private and secret anymore. #Antisec
#LulzXmas

Anon promises that much more is coming:

    #Antisec has enough targets lined up to extend the fun fun fun of
#LulzXmas throught the entire next week.

How the Stratfor site looked minutes after the hack:

Full letter from George Friemdan to clients as of an hour ago:

The full client list as released in a pastebin by Anonymous of all the
alleged clients sorted by company name, can be found here. As this is merely
an extracted column from a far larger database, we are confident much more
very sensitive information, as the bulk of the companies are either in the
intelligence or money management business, will be released shortly.
