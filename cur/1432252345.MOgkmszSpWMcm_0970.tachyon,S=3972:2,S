Tim has become so proprietary about cypherpunks it's strange
that he's never operated a node himself, or underwritten all of
them in the generous spirit of John Gilmore. Maybe Tim has
been underwriting them quietly and that accounts for his 
obnoxious bitching when the discourse doesn't go the way
he wants it -- he being a believer in getting good head for
his money, or else, plonk the hoes.

Drug dealers work the same model, as do pimps, and
bandits, and big-shit right-wing thugs CEOs, none of whom 
love the urchins who drain their pickles, generate their wealth, 
instead they yarp the Calvinist creed that economic success 
equates with superior human value, that if you're not wealthy
you're not of much account, rather than admit the evidence 
that the opposite is most often true, that wealthy people are
some of the dumbest people on earth, fountainheads of
blather, and got to have obsequious minions -- usually (low)
paid, but if not then brainwashed -- on hand at all times to 
listen to their cantankerous tommyrot fantasies ever-generated 
to avoid pondering the consequences of their brutish exploitation.

Tim repeatedly abandons cyperpunks when one of his spews
gets dissed. Goes elsewhere looking for admirers or newbies
to pound, and if pounded back, comes back to cypherpunks
to plead to ye old tyme succor, parading his past accomplishments
to see who'll applaud.

Same same same comes out of idlers worldwide, the wealthy
ones the most so. But even welfare cheats talk Tim's talk,
rather Tim whines like welfare cheats, both sharing contempt 
for people like themselves, but hoping by blaming others their
own shiftlessness will be overlooked.

There are wealthy people who don't suffer Tim's conceited warped
negativizing narcissism. Some of them have supported cypherpunks
with far more than derivative, endlessly recycled opinions and
braggardy. True, these goodhearts are the exception among typically
vile "successful" assholes, but they save the whole rotten barrel 
of the rich from getting what it deserves.

That is why Tim fears Gilmore's courage, envy.
