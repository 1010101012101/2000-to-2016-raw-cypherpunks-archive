It's more that I'm not willing to take my nice new thinkpad and satphone and 
other stuff into the desert, as it would either be left unattended, or 
carried around while distinctly non-sober.  Plus, it's a bit hot out for
electronics stored in a tent all day; without a car, it's a bit more difficult.
And the salt...

Next year, an RV, but I don't have a drivers license yet.  Camping is nice,
but not around other people; I'd rather be in a very small group hiking
and camping, or in a 4+ star hotel; an RV would be good enough for a week.
Also, way too many of my bay area friends are broke this year, actively
searching for jobs, and thus can't show up -- hopefully next year.

I think people actually have 802.11b working pretty extensively, with 
a Tachyon-based uplink (originally provided by John Gilmore; not sure about
this year); I have a spare tachyon setup which I'd take if I had a nice
vehicle on which to mount it, and in which to mount the indoor unit, 
generator, etc. 

HAL2001 was 100x better than burningman anyway, and had gigabit connectivity.

Just going off into the desert to do experimental rocket launches is probably
even better.
