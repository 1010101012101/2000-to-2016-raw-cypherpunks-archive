WTF is a "lone terrorist"?

http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-ussena093214085apr09,0,3864424.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines

"A bill to expand the ability of the government to conduct wiretaps
and other surveillance on suspected lone terrorists has attracted
controversial amendments that have stalled its advance to the full Senate.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has circulated one
amendment that would eliminate the sunset provision in the anti-terror
Patriot Act that passed in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks and greatly expanded the government's law enforcement powers.
"

Reading down it looks like a "lone terrorist" is someone
that the government can't even prove is a "terrorist"
to the secret FISA rubberstamp court.  So this is presumeably
an attempt to bypass FISA entirely.
