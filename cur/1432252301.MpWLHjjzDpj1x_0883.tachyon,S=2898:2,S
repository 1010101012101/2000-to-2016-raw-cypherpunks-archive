As I recall the basic purpose was to make it slow in software meaning 
that software cracking apps were/are at a severe disadvantage vs. 
hardware implementations.  It would be interesting to see how much 
longer that extended DES's effective lifetime.   I would consider the 
initial permutations to be in the same category as Blowfish's (and 
derivative algorithm's) time consuming key expansion phase- a neat 
"trick" that does not improve theoretical security but significantly 
increases the difficulty of real world attacks.
