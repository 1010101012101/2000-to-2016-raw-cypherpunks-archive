"don't even take human form" ???? Well I guess that rules out inflatable 
dates?  Are you boinking (non-third mudball) aliens (not that there's 
anything wrong with that I guess) or am I a clueless sot with a level of 
imagination that could only be spotted with an electron microsocope?




))       Not in the slightest, note that I said "both the above, *or 
((perhaps* the
))reverse. I'm a goddess worshiper -- and some of the feminine spirits I 
((commune
))and commingle with don't even take human form, let alone "beautiful,
((unclothed".   8-)  I do like to nibble tho.
