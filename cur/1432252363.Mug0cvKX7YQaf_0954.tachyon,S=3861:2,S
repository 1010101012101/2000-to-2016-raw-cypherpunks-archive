This seems to hinge on two points. The first being that 'speech/print' is
equivalent in some sense to 'read/hear'. The second being the
non-enumeracy clause of the 9th.

Clearly being able to speek/publish is worthless unless the audience has
free and unhindered access. Note as an aside this conflicts with aspects
of IP as currently practiced.

Another aspect that isn't clearly covered IMO is the role of 'consent' in
anonymous communications. After all we are talking about a right, the
right to make the choice based on personal beliefs. That clearly has to
also protect those people who don't want to receive material anonymously.

After all, your rights extend only until they interfere with anothers.
