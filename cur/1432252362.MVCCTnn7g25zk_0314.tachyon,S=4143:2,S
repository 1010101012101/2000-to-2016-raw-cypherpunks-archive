I would be indeed very surprised if Redmondware wasn't backdoored. It
would be trivial to slip several hard-to-detect buffer overruns by putting
a programmer mole on the team. It would be about as easy to slip such
backdoors into an open source system, and be it in application layer.

If h4x0r d00dz can do it

why can't feds do it? Given that NSA allegedly hires top of the crop,
especially.

This would be rather reserved for *rare* cases involving heavy artillery,
as stray packets leaking out would be intercepted by a smart firewall.

Anyone knows to put sensitive materials on an air-gap protected
low-emission machine (LCD instead of CRT, preferably a wearable with a
private eye type of display), right?
