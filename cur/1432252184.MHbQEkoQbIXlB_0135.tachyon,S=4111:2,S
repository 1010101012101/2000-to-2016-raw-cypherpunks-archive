Well, the libsodium developers not only told me how to do it, it was
their idea. However, it's of course very simple to generate them
separate.

That's the way curve25519 works. It would be possible to use one time
keys but for this there has to be some kind of key exchange process
before. But since pcp runs in offline mode, I'm not sure how to do this
in a user friendly way.

No, it doesn't. In order to decrypt a message one needs the recipient
secret key and the sender public key.

Because?

While I don't know how stef does it in pbp, I only add the key id to the
cipher so that the recipient knows which key has to be used to decrypt.
I'm not sure how it is bad to publish a key id. That's daily business
with pgp as well.

Again, this is how curve25519 is designed.

The sender needs a public key from the recipient anyways. And to be able
to decrypt the message, the recipient has to retain her secret key.

Funny, but neither I nor stef invented anything. DJB did.
