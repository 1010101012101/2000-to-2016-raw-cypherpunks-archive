Yeah, kinda bizarre.

There's also an ambiguity that prevents one from saying Q is associative. Is 
the table defined for both directions of *? In other words, is the table 
meant to imply values for both x*y (ie, left*top) as well as y*x (top*left)? 
For most objects x*y will not equal y*x (indeed, one may be undefined as in 
the case of matrix multiplication). Anyone remember the group theoretic term 
for these kinds of groups?
