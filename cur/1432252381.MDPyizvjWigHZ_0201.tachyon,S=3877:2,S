These are two infamous, passages, from two very different but equally 
infamous documents.  I tend to foolishly assume that everyone is as 
familiar with these endlessly repeated Chomsky debates as I am and will 
recognize these infamous quotes on sight.  One document is Chomsky 
conforming to the post 1979 Soviet orthodoxy on Cambodia, one is Chomsky, 
with equal veracity, conforming to the pre 1979 Soviet orthodoxy on Cambodia.

The latter quote comes from Chomsky's infamous Nation article, quoted in 
full at http://www.jim.com/jamesd/chomsdis.htm

It serves my purpose of demonizing anarcho socialists better than the 
former quote, since the pre 1979 orthodoxy is now so wonderfully 
politically incorrect.
