Not true.  Look at the sources:

   ... Bitcoin can be considered to be another variety of cash,
   i.e. digital cash. ... and cash can also be used for tax evasion
   purposes. [1] [2]

   Bitcoin prevents inflation and helps tax evation [sic] (the system
   itself is hard to regulate) [3]

States describe their pronouncements as "law" in an effort make them
respectable.

Are you suggesting that there is something unkind or thoughtless about
promoting a free market?

Seems to be on-topic.  From the liberationtech Info Page:

   The Program on Liberation Technology "Liberationtech" seeks to
   understand how information technology can be used to defend human
   rights, improve governance, empower the poor, promote economic
   development, and pursue a variety of other social goods. [4]

By these criteria, Bitcoin discussion qualifies.

Resource starvation?  Anonymous markets have thrived throughout
history, and probably before.

[2] "tax evasion" is their euphemism for successful defense against
their extortion.
