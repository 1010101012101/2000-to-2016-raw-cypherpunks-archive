When I have seen stuff like this printed in the past it has generally been over the top catastrophizing of an issue in order to inflame emotions.  I sure hope that's the case here.  Otherwise my impression of Canadians has sunk to a new low.  Why would it be in anyone's interest to sign such an agreement?

It seems to be real -- see http://communications.uwo.ca/western_news/stories/2012/February/copyright_deal_struck.html

I asked a Canadian friend of mine (who has serious privacy and security expertise) about it.  She said "Yes - we were discussing this vile decision in my Technopolicy law class...  I have no idea what they were thinking! Idiots."
