All good choices. Add "Ender's Shadow" for an interesting twist on the 
original story. Terry Pratchett's stuff for a lighter satirical look, 
although he tends to be cynical about all sides of the debate rather than 
just one side.

And, of course, the classics as well - Gibbon, for example.

Interesting question. Are they permitted to ask that we appreciate their 
vocabulary and literature? In reality, I suspect most people here have 
already read "their" literature, and rejected it as not logical or otherwise 
flawed. I did. And that makes it harder to respect the majority of them, 
because it's not really about their disagreement but simply that they're 
*wrong*.

The challenge is to prove this and convince them, not to drive them away with 
the metaphorical equivalent of sticks.
