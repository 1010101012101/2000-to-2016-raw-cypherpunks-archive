Technology industry lobbyists have so thoroughly hijacked the Commerce
Department process for developing a voluntary code of conduct for the
use of facial recognition technology that nine privacy advocates
involved withdrew in protest on Monday.

“At a base minimum, people should be able to walk down a public street
without fear that companies they’ve never heard of are tracking their
every movement ... Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain
agreement even with that basic, specific premise.

Ever notice the shiny new door, camera and register systems at Walmart?
Wonder if retail is Stingray'ing patrons IMEI's into such databases?
See the boxes popping up on roadsides, cameras and antenna arrays
on poles and buildings at every intersection? All the pointless info and
blood you have to give? In order to simply move and live and talk?
For what, exactly, in return?
Disgusting.
Cypherpunks... when / where will it all end?
