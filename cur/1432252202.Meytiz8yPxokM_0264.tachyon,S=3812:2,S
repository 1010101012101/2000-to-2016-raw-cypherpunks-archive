WAKE UP! IT'S YER ALWAYS AFTER SUMMIT...
SchNEWS APOCALYPSE SOON? "It should now be crystal clear that the South 
African government is hell-bent on smashing legitimate dissent by whatever 
means they deem appropriate, including attacking peaceful marchers and 
terrorising children. The ghosts of the South African past are returning 
with a vengeance." Johannesburg demonstrator, outside the Earth Summit, 
this week. Tanks in townships, tooled up riot cops firing teargas and stun 
grenades into crowds of people, mass arrests, threats of deportation, laws 
against group assembly, the secret police spying on people...South Africa 
ten years ago?? Try South Africa this week
MORE ON.
