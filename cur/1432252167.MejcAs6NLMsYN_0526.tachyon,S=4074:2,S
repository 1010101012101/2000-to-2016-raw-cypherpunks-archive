  Suspicious objects found throughout Boston after morning bomb scare

  By John R. Ellement, Globe Staff

  Investigators found a device on the BU Bridge today "similar to the
  Sullivan Square" package that forced the closure this morning of northbound
  Interstate 93, said Jennifer Mieth, spokeswoman for State Fire Marshal
  Stephen Coan, whose office oversees the State Police Bomb Squad.

  Like the item found at the Sullivan Square station, the BU package was
  attached to the underpinnings of the bridge.

  "It was not an explosive device," she said of the suspicious item found on
  the BU Bridge.

  Mieth said State Police bomb experts are now examining a another suspicious
  item -- similar in construction to the items found at Sullivan station and
  on the BU Bridge -- that has been discovered attached to the Longfellow
  Bridge, which spans the Charles River from Boston to Cambridge.

  Boston police are separately investigating suspicious items at Columbus and
  Stuart streets and near the New England Medical Center, Boston police said.

  Storrow drive has been is closed, and traffic on the Longfellow Bridge has
  been cut down to one lane, according to Boston police. Charles Street in
  downtown Boston is also closed while several agencies investigate
  suspicious packages discovered there this afternoon.

  Storrow drive was closed at 2 p.m., according to State Police. Thirty
  minutes later police opened one eastbound lane to traffic.

  According to Boston police, Charles Street is also closed while several
  agencies investigate suspicious packages discovered there this afternoon.
