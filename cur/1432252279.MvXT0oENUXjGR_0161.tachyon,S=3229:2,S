Ha ha.

Just why is it that "we" should post "up" our thoughts when it is 
now the norm to ignore such thoughts if they (a) come from the
'wrong' source, or (b) if said thoughts do not mesh in the 
approved fashion with the agendas of the moment?
 

I've recently come to a realisation that the reason why most
people are accepting of the current environment of highly 
tuned and structured radio/television media and news content 
is that the common themes underlying most such input gives 
people a false sense of inclusion and belonging.  Sure, the 
cognitive neural structures that become trained and tuned to
one broad class of input leverage some of the basic and 
flexable architecture of the human mind, and this leads to 
what some would consider a higher commonality of performance
in communication and interaction with like others, but the 
loss of fundamental flexability in thought and debate in
public spaces is an unacceptable compromise in so far as
I am concerned.

Excuses that in turn leverage the idea that the present status-
quo is the best we've got at the moment, in terms of fostering
a community of purpose among people of a single culture, and
also in terms of avoiding an `unproductive' factionalisation
of the citizenry, strike me as being without sustainable merit.

Am I making sense here, or is this merely superficially
obfuscated surplus verbiage?  You decide.  In the meantime
I will further consider, in my few moments of quiet and 
solitude, the negative aspects of the current state in which
civil and human rights are selectively applied only to those
who kiss ass in the 'approved' fashion.  


Regards,

Steve
