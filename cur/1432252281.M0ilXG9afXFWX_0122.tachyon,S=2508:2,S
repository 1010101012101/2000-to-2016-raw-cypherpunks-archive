Airport-Screening Rules Are Eased

By a WALL STREET JOURNAL Staff Reporter
December 10, 2004; Page A5


WASHINGTON -- Bowing to passenger outrage over pat-down procedures at
airport checkpoints, the Transportation Security Administration will alter
its rules beginning Monday to allow passengers to lower their arms during
screening.

The change is minor and TSA officials say they have no plans to rescind
pat-down procedures that require screeners to touch passengers' chest and
groin areas while checking for weapons or explosives. Nevertheless, it
represents an attempt by the TSA to improve its image among travelers.

The agency also backed off a plan announced in late November that would
require airports to immediately report any suspicious activities, even
routine problems such as unruly or drunken passengers, to TSA headquarters.
That reporting now will be optional.
