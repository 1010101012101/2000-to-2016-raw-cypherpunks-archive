It is peculiar timing, but they are looking harder for stuff like this 
now, too. Probably some mis- or undiagnosed cases have gone unreported. 
The CDC bulletin does mention a case in Texas earlier in the year.

I'm just outside the largest military installation on the East Coast. It 
went on a major security tightening a month or so before the WTC attack, 
  so it looks like somebody had reason to expect something..

Still don't feel the need for a gas mask.
