Actually, the law is about to be changed rather soon, making it
legal (such intent today has been announced by the Grand Coalition).
Given that the recent 5 years have shown a truly appaling trend, it
would not be surprising.

I could see how a snoop API could be eventually demanded
in routers and mainstream operating systems, with noncertified
systems being eventually barred from going online.
