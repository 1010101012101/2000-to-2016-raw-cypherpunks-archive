Dear James,

Jay Wherley is the head tech guy at e-gold.com so
wwe can rely on his views below.  The incentive
payments and the payment receive fee are not
counted as "spends" for the statistics on the
e-gold.com/stats.html page.

One correspondent suggested to me that there may
be one or more "spread spectrum" accounts.  The
way such an account would work is that a 'bot
would create 10,000 e-gold accounts.  Other
software for bulk payments would be used to
spend one ten thousandth of each payment from
each of these accounts to the intended recipient.
Why do so?  Doing so would diversify the risk of
any one account being closed, make the process
of tracking the account history data much harder
for prosecutors and others with court orders,
and generally enhance privacy to some extent.

Of course, this idea was indicated as a chimera,
something that has been discussed but no one
knows if anyone has ever implemented it.

Meanwhile, I suggest a few games of poker at
  http://8715605.thegoldcasino.com

I hope this message has been helpful.  Jay's
detailed response below.

Regards,

Jim

then hopefully this post is a paroxysm of joy for you JP! ;) :

the deduction of the e-gold spend fee is not included in velocity 
numbers.
the distribution of any incentive payments per
http://www.e-gold.com/unsecure/incentive.htm
is not included in velocity numbers. the *only* thing counting as a 
"spend"
in "e-metal spends" is an e-metal spend (aka payment) from one account 
to
another initiated by a user doing one of:
a) manually signing into his account and performing a "Spend"
b) checking out at a merchant using e-gold SCI
c) using phone access to make a spend
d) using a program and the e-gold Automation Interface to make a spend

those velocity numbers are totals for the amounts users are spending
to other users. they do not include any other thing like fees, storage
charges, or incentive payments.

http://stats.e-gold.com

possibly the most informative, accurate and timely economic statistics
on earth - possibly the universe!! ;)
