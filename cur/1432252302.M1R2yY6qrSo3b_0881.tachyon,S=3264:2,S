not nearly as much as the fed or congress.  NSA has big ears for spear
fishing the shiny little targets; when you have the power to shift the
foundation upon which the market(s) sit, you don't even need to aim
that blunt force trauma instrument.

reserve currency status can't buffer the sheer magnitude of fiat
spewing forth in debt and circulation...

nassim taleb has an informative explanation.  for every james simons
there are two bear stearns.
