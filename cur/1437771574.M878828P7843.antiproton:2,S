Just checked my e-mail and saw confirmation from keybase that
@grazestorm still exists (yay) and that we are following each other
(keybase's "cryptographic utopia" message), so that's good news.

On the other hand I saw some messages from cryptostorm_is on twitter
that (as of about 4 hours ago)

"Our anchor node in Canada - 'maple' - appears to have been offlined
by content oligarchy pressure. Rolling to failover capacity for cluster.
"

additionally,

"We'll update today as we learn more; as w/ all cstorm nodes, no data
nor logs are stored & FDE-subversion attacks are a fruitless exercise."

Cryptostorm is resilient and will quickly bounce right back, this
"maple" node is just one of many, but it was alarming to see the staff
being mistreated (I assumed, temporarily detained) by an increasingly
belligerent Canadian government.
