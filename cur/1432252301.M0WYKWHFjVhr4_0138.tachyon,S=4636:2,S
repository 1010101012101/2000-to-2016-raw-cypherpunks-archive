Dave, the trend is toward laws that penalize refusal to cooperate
with demands for decryption keys.  This concept can work in various
ways.  In the border case, for example, a person might be refused
entry -- or perhaps suffer confiscation of related property in some
cases -- if they declined to provide the keys.

In the case of criminal convictions, additional sentence and fine
penalties can be imposed for uncooperative attitudes in this regard.

Keep in mind that in the eyes of some in government, only people
with something to hide would bother using encryption in the first
place.  From that assumption flows a sea of potential abuses.
