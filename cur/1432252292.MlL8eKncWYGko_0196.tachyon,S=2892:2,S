 >>I vaguely remember a door-strengthening prohibition somewhere in Europe
being mentioned here in the past.<<

At least in one part of Europe fortifications are going up with local 
council approval.In checko the 1st ghetto wall since ww2 was recently built 
to enforce a curfew in a romany section of an old town.
Also in au the authoritarians in port Augusta have proposed a curfew for 
young people.

"spewing nemesis" (?) Only for dumbshit anarcho-crapitalists.The issue is 
not that "allowing" it is good, but that "banning" it would require drastic 
and draconian enforcement measures.) We are nearly always 5-10 years behind 
youse.
