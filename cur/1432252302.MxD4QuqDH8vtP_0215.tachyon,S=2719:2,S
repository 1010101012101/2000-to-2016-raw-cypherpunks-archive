Gigabit Ethernet board for TCP/IP security

SDC Systems offers a range of Gigabit Ethernet single board computers
designed by ADI Engineering and based on Intel XScale and Intel IXA
technologies.

 

Designed for network security devices such as TCP/IP Offload Engines (TOE),
firewalls, VPN equipment, IPSec and SSL accelerators, intrusion detection,
and cryptography equipment, Shadwell supports line wire speed in both
single and dual port versions. The board features an Intel 80200 processor,
running at 733MHz, 256MB SDRAM (128Mbyte in the single mode), Intel
82545/82546 fourth-generation GbE MAC/PHY, and Intel 21555 PCI-PCI bridge.

 

The board is implemented in a half size PCI form factor, and only
dissipates 6W of power in the single port version.

A Virtex-II FPGA can be used to offload of time-critical tasks including
cryptography, firewall filtering, and virus scanning.
