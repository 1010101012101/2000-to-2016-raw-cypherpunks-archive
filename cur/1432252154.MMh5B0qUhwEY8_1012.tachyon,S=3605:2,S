Not all women are golddiggers. I happen to think any woman who marries
for money or sleeps around for gifts and dinners is worse than a whore.
As the old saw goes, at least real prostitutes are honest about what they're
doing. 

The only "abstracted value" I find really intriguing is the quality of
a man's mind. Everything else is entirely beside the point. You have no idea
how often I get hit on by so-called "attractive" men--and I'm quite proud to say
I've never dated even one of them. I'd prefer a fat cranky old genius over a
rich businessman or male model anyday! 

But if sleeping with golddiggers is good enough for you, to each his own.
Though it must totally unsatisfying to know that your golddigger-du-jour will
stop valuing you when your cash flow dries up. A shame you couldn't have found
someone better instead.
