It is a compaq armada m700, with 128M memory and 6G 
hard drive.  It got kiped in San Francisco, on the 
western edge of a neighborhood known as hunter's point.
It has already been reported to the appropriate police, 
but that's mainly pro forma; in the recovery of such 
items they are nearly useless.

The application is called "Neuroserver".  It exists in 
a full GUI development environment/compiler (NSAE) and 
a windows service (NSRE) with associated runtime admin 
tools. There's also a solaris version, but that wasn't 
on the machine she had. 

If you want to know more about the application, you can 
ask it about itself - go to http://www.nativeminds.com, 
turn on cookies and javascript, and follow the "talk 
to nicole" link. It won't understand you if you get too 
far outside its subject matter or use sentences too long 
for it to figure out, but that's par for the course for 
this moment in time.

That's an interesting collection of words.  Do you 
suppose it's a sentence?
