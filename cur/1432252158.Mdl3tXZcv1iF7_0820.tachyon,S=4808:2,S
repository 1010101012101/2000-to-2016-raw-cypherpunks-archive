Declan, if you meet this bitch at some journalist's party or whatever, 
tell her "Even in the bill of rights, the rights of the people to be
secure in their homes and papers against illegal searches is preceded by
the right of free speech" (if you stretch illegible speech=encryption)

There are plenty of true libertarians, even more during terrorist attacks.

FYI: Our building is now taking to airport style x-ray machines to check
bags with.  ugh!
