Pictures of children, unconscious people, even--GASP--the dead can be
perfectly ethical.  Indeed, in my view a journalist usually has the
*duty* to show their audience what they see, no matter how
heart-wrenching or gruesome.  Not to show the uncomfortable truth is the
true breach of journalistic ethics.

Should we censor thousands upon thousands of hours of war footage
because the dead soldiers and civilians didn't get a say in it?  Or does
the public interest outweigh that concern?  It's a balancing act, and
depends on the broader context.

Putting yourself in a shot is different territory, but can be ethical in
some cases.  One of those cases, in my opinion, is in a documentary
showing the journalist's journey.  This can be, and in the case of Dirty
Wars in my opinion is, as illuminating as the 'ground truth' itself.  It
gives a context to the images which is otherwise missing and very
difficult to understand on anything more than an abstract, cerebral level.
