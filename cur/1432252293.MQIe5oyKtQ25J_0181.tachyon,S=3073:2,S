| No, Adobe did not use ROT13. They were quite a bit better than that

My reading of the DMCA (and IANAL) is that any system that you use is
deemed effective if it works in normal circumstances to protect your
content.  As such, I believe that the use of rot-13 is a better
engineering choice than the use of AES.  rot-13 is smaller, faster,
less buggy and equally effective, given that the key is stored locally 
with the content.
