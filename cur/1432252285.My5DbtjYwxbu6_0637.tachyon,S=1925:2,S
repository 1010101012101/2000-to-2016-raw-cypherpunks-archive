The DL stays in the car, the only place it is needed.

I've heard that during voir dire you're asked if you know
about nullification.  If so, you're out.

I enjoy what Sakharov termed "reactance", ie, when compelled
I resist, if asked I may comply.  Where I come from the
constitutional ban on illegal taking, slavery, and the
trumping of the constitution over states (the 14th IIRC)
matter.  So I regard the nastygrams as offers to volunteer.

When I do volunteer, I'll bring a stack of fija.org info
to distribute anonymously.  Its the  patriotic thing to do.
