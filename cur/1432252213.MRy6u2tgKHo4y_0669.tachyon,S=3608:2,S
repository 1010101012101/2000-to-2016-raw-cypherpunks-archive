one quote really got me thinking:

"Will these problems that afflict me spread? You'd better hope 
your sorry ass they do! If they don't, we're all in for a very
rough ride, and not 50 years from now, but tomorrow and next
year. We're already well down the slippery slope. Personally,
though, I think we're in for a shitstorm. That's because
people are basically unprepared for the degree of evil that
has been refined and distilled in government."


we've only had this democracy thing for a short time on a global scale
(yes, I know some countries have a few centuries, I was saying "global
scale"). and it's already heavily degenerating. we may be in for
interesting times once it reaches the point where revolution sounds more
promising than setting up a party for your interest. and that point may
not be far off.



enough politics, back to our regular flamming and spamming.
