Subject: Programmer arrested for Defcon talk?


According to slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org/) a programmer was
arrested for (apparently -- details on the cited web sites are
sketchy) giving a talk at Defcon in Las Vegas describing how to break
the encryption in certain Adobe PDF files. It is (apparently) claimed
by Adobe that this was a violation of the DMCA.

See:

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/07/17/130226&mode=thread

I'm not a big fan of /. -- they aren't particularly good at the whole
fact checking thing -- but the story sounds intriguing. The real
details may very well be quite different from what is portrayed. If
anyone knows real details, I'd appreciate them.
