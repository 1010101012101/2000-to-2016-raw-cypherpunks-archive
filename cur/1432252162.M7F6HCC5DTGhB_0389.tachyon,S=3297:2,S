Which doesn't help, there are issues related to key control and exchange
that are not resolved. It further can be used as evidence against you if
you are committing a crime, it is used to raise the sentence. It may be
possible that you simply exchanging email (encryption speaks to
premeditation which also raises the stakes) with another party is enough
to tie you to the crime and find you guilty on other grounds.

I hope you enjoy cooked goose.
