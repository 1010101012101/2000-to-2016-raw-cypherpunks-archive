The problem with this argument is that despite the apparent religious 
agnosticism of the 1st, the moral basis upon which the SC has interpreted 
our laws is Judeo-Christian. Historically you've been protected from 
government intrusion unless your religion offends too many powerful people 
or presents political challenges. Consider the Mormons and shamanic drug 
rituals of the native Americans.  Didn't Mao say something about all 
politics being, eventually, dispensed from the end of gun?
