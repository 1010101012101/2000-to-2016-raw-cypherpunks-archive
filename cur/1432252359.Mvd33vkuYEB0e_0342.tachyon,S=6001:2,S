no doubt. i prefer my salty rants Aitel stylez! all of us in the game
have lineage to a tee... but i digress,

i asked a friend, Volatility, and they said "please to re state in
terms of cryptographic digest for code version and instruction
sequence in terms of exploitation method."

because every consideration they pose evaluates to a "as much as
possible" equivalent to zero. there was agreement from VM recording
and bus lane recording, as well.
