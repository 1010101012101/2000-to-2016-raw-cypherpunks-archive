When faced with force, you reply with force when you can.

Correct.  But the existence of technical means for playing with bits and

hiding from oppression does not change the ethics of the material world.

When the State's otherwise legitimate monopoly on force is abused
the appropriate response is not to hope the oppressors go away.

When the Jews were put in the ghettos, an abuse of State force,
the appropriate response was more than merely publishing anonymous
flyers
or mumbling in secret languages.  There are times when agents have
earned killing.

Blacknet is a robust archive for words, immune to force
(by State or private actors), but merely words.
