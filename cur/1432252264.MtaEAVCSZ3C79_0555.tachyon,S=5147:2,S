"First they came for the hackers. But I never did anything illegal with my 
computer, so I didn't speak up. Then they came for the pornographers. But I 
thought there was too much smut on the Internet anyway, so I didn't speak 
up. Then they came for the anonymous remailers. But a lot of nasty stuff 
gets sent from anon.penet.fi, so I didn't speak up. Then they came for the 
encryption users. But I could never figure out how to work pgp5 anyway, so 
I didn't speak up. Then they came for me. And by that time there was no one 
left to speak up."
