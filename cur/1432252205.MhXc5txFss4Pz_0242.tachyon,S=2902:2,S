Old news.  UK does this research too; not just poppies, but cannabis,
coca, etc.  Its current
research.

Of course, the US is *currently* engaged in biowar in Columbia, spraying
glyphosphate,
(which you can buy at home depot, and kills everything it touches, the
locals' food too).
But the folks with the Soviet Sub Surplus connections haven't taken it
personally yet.

The *real* fun would be the introduction of hoof and mouth disease into
the livestock regions of the country.  Auction sites would be
good as lots of flux, like sneezing variola in an airport.

What was that Terry Gilliam movie, 12 monkeys?
