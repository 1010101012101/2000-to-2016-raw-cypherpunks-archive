So. Why don't we see terrorist attacks in Sweden, or Switzerland, or Belgium 
or any other country that doesn't have any military or Imperliast presence 
in the middle east? Is this merely a coincidence?

What I strongly suspect is that if we were not dickin' around over there in 
their countries, the threat of terrorism on US soil would diminish to very 
nearly zero. In other words, we DO have a choice of peace, and our choice 
was to pass on it.
