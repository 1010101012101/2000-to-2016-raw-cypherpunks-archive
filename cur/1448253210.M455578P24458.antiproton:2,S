Someone - I forget who - proposed using Microsoft marketing techniques against them:  Every time anyone who wanted to help the campaign mentioned "the Windows operating system", they should *always* say "the deeply flawed Windows operating system".  Repeat a phrase often enough and it becomes part of common knowledge.  This is how marketing works; this is how politics works (not that it's easy to draw a line between them any more).

And they are trying to dictate that they be built in ways that *hurt us as individuals*, in the name of what *they claim* is some greater good.  Stopping that isn't going to happen by cryptographers talking to other cryptographers about what a dumb idea "golden keys" are.  The most effective way of stopping would be convincing those who are the natural audience for the "help LE stop the bad guys" pitch to instead see the issue the same way they see gun control (also pushed as a way to "help the LE stop the bad guys").

It's entirely appropriate and relavant because the crypto people and tech / code
world in general are too head down at the keyboard and haven't yet figured out
how stand up and win (forever), nor how to go AFK for a minute and and partner
with various potential armies. There's only so much you can do with a keyboard,
the rest awaits in the real world.
