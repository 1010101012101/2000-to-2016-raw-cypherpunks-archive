There's no way which can't be spoofed by a determined
opponent willing to send truly weird looking messages
(as I demonstrated in an earler post), but that's not the
point. I suggest that you just look for ascii-armouring - 
ie, long (>50 byte) printable character strings without 
embedded spaces. If the majority of the body has this 
format, then call it encrypted.

And/or look for the standard tag strings for smime or pgp
encrypted text, if you're worried about unencrypted but
uuencoded naughty pictures being sent.

You can't catch everything, but you can do reasonable due
diligence to stop spammers and filter out non-contrived 
unencrypted content.
