[A few years back, on this list, Lucky Green and I discussed the creation 
of a competition for low-cost self-guided planes.  We postulated that even 
back then it was a practical undertaking for advanced composite general 
aviation kit builders and radio control hobbyists.  To pass legal muster, 
the building and design of prototypes can be undertaken as single passenger 
experimental vehicles with the human payload replaced by other payloads 
when desired.  Save the construction plan page content before its purged.]]

A New Zealand home handyman's bid to construct a cruise missile in his shed 
has made global headlines, and the British media have dubbed him a threat 
to world security.
