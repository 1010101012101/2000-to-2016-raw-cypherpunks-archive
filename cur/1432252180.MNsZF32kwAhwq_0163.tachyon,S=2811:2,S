What this list needs is another space-cadet to answer him.
Yer one of them whacky left-handers, ain't cha?

The point at which you start peering into someone's castle
without a warrant is considered by some to be "too-far",
and deserving of constitution claims of protection.

It's no longer a human peering in, it's a cyborg.

A Thermal Imaging search of a home without a warrant
is a technological attack on privacy.

    Whitfield Diffie, Distinguished Engineer---Security at Sun Microsystems:

    "An essential element of freedom is the right to privacy, a right that
    cannot be expected to stand against an unremitting technological attack."

Therefore the issue of frequency is an issue.

    What's the frequency, Jimmy?
