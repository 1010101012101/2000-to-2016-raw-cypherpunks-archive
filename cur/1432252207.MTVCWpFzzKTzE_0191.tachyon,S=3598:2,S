MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters
Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat
Google Inc.

Abstract

 MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for
processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function
that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated
with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in
this model, as shown in the paper.

 Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized
and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system
takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the
program's execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures,
and managing the required inter-machine communication. This allows
programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to
easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.

 Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity
machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes
many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the
system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented
and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's
clusters every day.
