<http://thesaker.is/a-russian-warning/>*A Russian Warning

We, the undersigned, are Russians living and working in the USA. We have
been watching with increasing anxiety as the current US and NATO policies
have set us on an extremely dangerous collision course with the Russian
Federation, as well as with China. Many respected, patriotic Americans,
such as Paul Craig Roberts, Stephen Cohen, Philip Giraldi, Ray McGovern and
many others have been issuing warnings of a looming a Third World War. But
their voices have been all but lost among the din of a mass media that is
full of deceptive and inaccurate stories that characterize the Russian
economy as being in shambles and the Russian military as weak=E2=80=94all b=
ased on
no evidence. But we=E2=80=94knowing both Russian history and the current st=
ate of
Russian society and the Russian military, cannot swallow these lies. We now
feel that it is our duty, as Russians living in the US, to warn the
American people that they are being lied to, and to tell them the truth.
And the truth is simply this:


*If there is going to be a war with Russia, then the United Stateswill most
certainly be destroyed, and most of us will end up dead.*

Let us take a step back and put what is happening in a historical context.
Russia has suffered a great deal at the hands of foreign invaders, losing
22 million people in World War II. Most of the dead were civilians, because
the country was invaded, and the Russians have vowed to never let such a
disaster happen again. Each time Russia had been invaded, she emerged
victorious. In 1812 Nepoleon invaded Russia; in 1814 Russian cavalry rode
into Paris. On June 22, 1941, Hitler=E2=80=99s Luftwaffe bombed Kiev; On Ma=
y 8,
1945, Soviet troops rolled into Berlin.

But times have changed since then. If Hitler were to attack Russia today,
he would be dead 20 to 30 minutes later, his bunker reduced to glowing
rubble by a strike from a Kalibr supersonic cruise missile launched from a
small Russian navy ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea. The operational
abilities of the new Russian military have been most persuasively
demonstrated during the recent action against ISIS, Al Nusra and other
foreign-funded terrorist groups operating in Syria. A long time ago Russia
had to respond to provocations by fighting land battles on her own
territory, then launching a counter-invasion; but this is no longer
necessary. Russia=E2=80=99s new weapons make retaliation instant, undetecta=
ble,
unstoppable and perfectly lethal.

Thus, if tomorrow a war were to break out between the US and Russia, it is
guaranteed that the US would be obliterated. At a minimum, there would no
longer be an electric grid, no internet, no oil and gas pipelines, no
interstate highway system, no air transportation or GPS-based navigation.
Financial centers would lie in ruins. Government at every level would cease
to function. US armed forces, stationed all around the globe, would no
longer be resupplied. At a maximum, the entire landmass of the US would be
covered by a layer of radioactive ash. We tell you this not to be alarmist,
but because, based on everything we know, we are ourselves alarmed. If
attacked, Russia will not back down; she will retaliate, and she will
utterly annihilate the United States.

The US leadership has done everything it could to push the situation to the
brink of disaster. First, its anti-Russian policies have convinced the
Russian leadership that making concessions or negotiating with the West is
futile. It has become apparent that the West will always support any
individual, movement or government that is anti-Russian, be it tax-cheating
Russian oligarchs, convicted Ukrainian war criminals, Saudi-supported
Wahhabi terrorists in Chechnya or cathedral-desecrating punks in Moscow.
Now that NATO, in violation of its previous promises, has expanded right up
to the Russian border, with US forces deployed in the Baltic states, within
artillery range of St. Petersburg, Russia=E2=80=99s second-largest city, th=
e
Russians have nowhere left to retreat. They will not attack; nor will they
back down or surrender. The Russian leadership enjoys over 80% of popular
support; the remaining 20% seems to feel that it is being too soft in
opposing Western encroachment. But Russia will retaliate, and a provocation
or a simple mistake could trigger a sequence of events that will end with
millions of Americans dead and the US in ruins.

Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign
adventure, the Russians hate and fear war. But they are also ready for it,
and they have been preparing for war for several years now. Their
preparations have been most effective. Unlike the US, which squanders
untold billions on dubious overpriced arms programs such as the F-35 joint
task fighter, the Russians are extremely stingy with their defense rubles,
getting as much as 10 times the bang for the buck compared to the bloated
US defense industry. While it is true that the Russian economy has suffered
from low energy prices, it is far from being in shambles, and a return to
growth is expected as early as next year. Senator John McCain once called
Russia =E2=80=9CA gas station masquerading as a country.=E2=80=9D Well, he =
lied. Yes,
Russia is the world=E2=80=99s largest oil producer and second-largest oil e=
xporter,
but it is also world=E2=80=99s largest exporter of grain and nuclear power
technology. It is as advanced and sophisticated a society as the United
States. Russia=E2=80=99s armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, are n=
ow ready
to fight, and they are more than a match for the US and NATO, especially if
a war erupts anywhere near the Russian border.

But such a fight would be suicidal for all sides. We strongly believe that
a conventional war in Europe runs a strong chance of turning nuclear very
rapidly, and that any US/NATO nuclear strike on Russian forces or territory
will automatically trigger a retaliatory Russian nuclear strike on the
continental US. Contrary to irresponsible statements made by some American
propagandists, American antiballistic missile systems are incapable of
shielding the American people from a Russian nuclear strike. Russia has the
means to strike at targets in the USA with long-range nuclear as well as
conventional weapons.

The sole reason why the USA and Russia have found themselves on a collision
course, instead of defusing tensions and cooperating on a wide range of
international problems, is the stubborn refusal by the US leadership to
accept Russia as an equal partner: Washington is dead set on being the
=E2=80=9Cworld leader=E2=80=9D and the =E2=80=9Cindispensable nation,=E2=80=
=9D even as its influence
steadily dwindles in the wake of a string of foreign policy and military
disasters such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the Ukraine.
Continued American global leadership is something that neither Russia, nor
China, nor most of the other countries are willing to accept. This gradual
but apparent loss of power and influence has caused the US leadership to
become hysterical; and it is but a small step from hysterical to suicidal.
America=E2=80=99s political leaders need to be placed under suicide watch.

First and foremost, we are appealing to the commanders of the US Armed
Forces to follow the example of Admiral William Fallon, who, when asked
about a war with Iran, reportedly replied =E2=80=9Cnot on my watch.=E2=80=
=9D We know that
you are not suicidal, and that you do not wish to die for the sake of
out-of-touch imperial hubris. If possible, please tell your staff,
colleagues and, especially, your civilian superiors that a war with Russia
will not happen on your watch. At the very least, take that pledge
yourselves, and, should the day ever come when the suicidal order is
issued, refuse to execute it on the grounds that it is criminal. Remember
that according to the Nuremberg Tribunal =E2=80=9CTo initiate a war of aggr=
ession=E2=80=A6
is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole.=E2=80=9D Since Nuremberg, =E2=80=9CI was jus=
t following
orders=E2=80=9D is no longer a valid defense; please don=E2=80=99t be war c=
riminals.

We also appeal to the American people to take peaceful but forceful action
to oppose any politician or party that engages in irresponsible,
provocative Russia-baiting, and that condones and supports a policy of
needless confrontation with a nuclear superpower that is capable of
destroying America in about an hour. Speak up, break through the barrier of
mass media propaganda, and make your fellow Americans aware of the immense
danger of a confrontation between Russia and the US.

There is no objective reason why US and Russia should consider each other
adversaries. The current confrontation is entirely the result of the
extremist views of the neoconservative cult, whose members were allowed to
infiltrate the US Federal government under President Bill Clinton, and who
consider any country that refuses to obey their dictates as an enemy to be
crushed. Thanks to their tireless efforts, over a million innocent people
have already died in the former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Pakistan, the Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia and in many other
countries=E2=80=94all because of their maniacal insistence that the USA mus=
t be a
world empire, not a just a regular, normal country, and that every national
leader must either bow down before them, or be overthrown. In Russia, this
irresistible force has finally encountered an immovable object. They must
be forced to back down before they destroy us all.

We are absolutely and categorically certain that Russia will never attack
the US, nor any EU member state, that Russia is not at all interested in
recreating the USSR, and that there is no =E2=80=9CRussian threat=E2=80=9D =
or =E2=80=9CRussian
aggression.=E2=80=9D Much of Russia=E2=80=99s recent economic success has a=
 lot to do with
the shedding of former Soviet dependencies, allowing her to pursue a
=E2=80=9CRussia first=E2=80=9D policy. But we are just as certain that if R=
ussia is
attacked, or even threatened with attack, she will not back down, and that
the Russian leadership will not =E2=80=9Cblink.=E2=80=9D With great sadness=
 and a heavy
heart they will do their sworn duty and unleash a nuclear barrage from
which the United States will never recover. Even if the entire Russian
leadership is killed in a first strike, the so-called =E2=80=9CDead Hand=E2=
=80=9D (the
=E2=80=9CPerimetr=E2=80=9D system) will automatically launch enough nukes t=
o wipe the USA
off the political map. *We feel that it is our duty to do all we can to
prevent such a catastrophe.*
