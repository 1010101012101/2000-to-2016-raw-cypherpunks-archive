In order of increasing power consumption, Spot takes three kinds of
location fixes: a Venue Fix, a Tracking Fix, and a Fingerprint Fix.
Venue fixes have an entry time and a duration. For example, say you
were visiting a client’s office for an hour long meeting. Spot would
take a fix about 5-15 minutes into the meeting and a second fix
roughly 5-15 minutes after you’ve left the office to declare a venue
fix of your location, time and duration, perhaps for 67 minutes and 13
seconds. A Venue fix exploits Apple’s location database of both cell
towers and Wi-Fi access points. While these are not as precise as GPS
measurements, in practice, they are quite good. We believe that these
fixes alone are sufficient to handle most tax residency issues.
Consuming a bit more power are the optional Tracking fixes. These
fixes are calculated when the phone switches cell phone towers. While
they typically have an accuracy radius of about a kilometer, they are
also, in practice, quite accurate in showing the progress of your day.
Finally, a Fingerprint fix, which is taken by running the app and
pressing the fingerprint icon in the upper left corner, uses the GPS
to record your position with the highest resolution possible. When you
need to prove that you have crossed that state line before midnight,
the Fingerprint fix is what you want to use. Since its accuracy radius
can be as large as 65 meters, more than half a football field long,
make sure you are significantly past the state line when you take the
fix.
