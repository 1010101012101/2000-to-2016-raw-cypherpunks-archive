I don't think a virtual keyboard is necessarily a bad idea in this case. I 
live in a densely populated neighborhood in NYC. SOmeone is ALWAYS in my 
home, and in the rare cases nobody's here we turn on our alarm. This does 
not mean some visual surveillance of my keyboard is impossible, but it 
greatly reduces the number of parties with the desire and resources to 
attempt such a surveillance. And the reason this matters is because I can 
download such a virtual keyboard for pennies (thus causing the need for VERY 
costly forms of surveillance by nullifying keystroke loggers), and cause the 
cost of surveillance to rise probably far more than exponentially. This is a 
good thing (from my point of view!) in and of itself, but imagine if a large 
number of people thought this way, encrypting even the most trivial of 
communications.
