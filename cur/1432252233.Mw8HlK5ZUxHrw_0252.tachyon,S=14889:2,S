WHAT THEY KNOW

NOVEMBER 30, 2010

Race Is On to 'Fingerprint' Phones, PCs

By JULIA ANGWIN And JENNIFER VALENTINO-DEVRIES

IRVINE, Calif.bDavid Norris wants to collect the digital equivalent of
fingerprints from every computer, cellphone and TV set-top box in the world.

Companies are developing digital fingerprint technology to identify how we
use our computers, mobile devices and TV set-top boxes. WSJ's Simon Constable
talks to Senior Technology Editor Julia Angwin about the next generation of
tracking tools.

Listen: Jennifer Valentino-DeVries discusses the next generation of online
tracking tools.

He's off to a good start. So far, Mr. Norris's start-up company, BlueCava
Inc., has identified 200 million devices. By the end of next year, BlueCava
says it expects to have cataloged one billion of the world's estimated 10
billion devices.

Advertisers no longer want to just buy ads. They want to buy access to
specific people. So, Mr. Norris is building a "credit bureau for devices" in
which every computer or cellphone will have a "reputation" based on its
user's online behavior, shopping habits and demographics. He plans to sell
this information to advertisers willing to pay top dollar for granular data
about people's interests and activities.

Device fingerprinting is a powerful emerging tool in this trade. It's "the
next generation of online advertising," Mr. Norris says.

It might seem that one computer is pretty much like any other. Far from it:
Each has a different clock setting, different fonts, different software and
many other characteristics that make it unique.  Every time a typical
computer goes online, it broadcasts hundreds of such details as a calling
card to other computers it communicates with. Tracking companies can use this
data to uniquely identify computers, cellphones and other devices, and then
build profiles of the people who use them.

Until recently, fingerprinting was used mainly to prevent illegal copying of
computer software or to thwart credit-card fraud. BlueCava's own
fingerprinting technology traces its unlikely roots to an inventor who, in
the early 1990s, wanted to protect the software he used to program music
keyboards for the Australian pop band INXS.

How to Prevent Device Fingerprinting

A New Type of Tracking: Akamai's 'Pixel-Free' Technology

Tracking companies are now embracing fingerprinting partly because it is much
tougher to block than other common tools used to monitor people online, such
as browser "cookies," tiny text files on a computer that can be deleted.

As controversy grows over intrusive online tracking, regulators are looking
to rein it in. This week, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to release
a privacy report calling for a "do-not-track" tool for Web browsers.

Ad companies are constantly looking for new techniques to heighten their
surveillance of Internet users.

Deep packet inspection, a potentially intrusive method for peering closely
into the digital traffic that moves between people's computers and the
broader Internet, is being tested in the U.S. and Brazil as a future means to
deliver targeted advertising.

Akamai Technologies Inc., an Internet-infrastructure giant that says it
delivers 15% to 30% of all Web traffic, is marketing a technique to track
people's online movements in more detail than traditional tools easily can.

It's tough even for sophisticated Web surfers to tell if their gear is being
fingerprinted. Even if people modify their machinesbadding or deleting fonts,
or updating softwarebfingerprinters often can still recognize them. There's
not yet a way for people to delete fingerprints that have been collected. In
short, fingerprinting is largely invisible, tough to fend off and
semi-permanent.

How to 'Fingerprint' a Computer

A typical computer broadcasts hundreds of details about itself when a Web
browser connects to the Internet. Companies tracking people online can use
those details to 'fingerprint' browsers and follow their users.

Device fingerprinting is legal. U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D.,Ill.), proposed
legislation in July that would require companies that use persistent
identifiers, such as device fingerprints, to let people opt out of being
tracked online.

Fingerprinting companies are racing to meet the $23 billion U.S. online-ad
industry's appetite for detailed consumer behavior. Previously, the companies
focused on using device fingerprints to prevent software theft or to identify
computers making fraudulent transactions, in hopes of preventing future
attempts.

Mr. Norris's firm, BlueCava, this year spun off from anti-piracy company
Uniloc USA Inc. to start offering services to advertisers and others. One of
the leading e-commerce fraud-prevention firms, 41st Parameter Inc., has begun
testing its device-fingerprinting techniques with several online-ad
companies. Another anti-fraud company, iovation Inc. of Portland, Ore., says
it is exploring the use of device profiles to help websites customize their
content.

BlueCava says the information it collects about devices can't be traced back
to individuals and that it will offer people a way to opt out of being
tracked.

Still, Mr. Norris says it's tough to figure out how to alert people their
devices are being fingerprinted. "We don't have all the answers, but we're
just going to try to be really clear" about how the data is used, he says.

Neither BlueCava nor 41st Parameter explicitly notified the people whose
devices have been fingerprinted so far. Both companies say the data-gathering
is disclosed in the privacy policies of the companies they work with.
BlueCava says it doesn't collect personal information such as people's names.
Its privacy policy says it gathers "just boring stuff that most people
couldn't care less about."

Ori Eisen, founder of 41st Parameter, says using fingerprinting to track
devices is "fair game" because websites automatically get the data anyway.

Some advertisers are enthusiastic about fingerprinting. Steel House Inc., a
Los Angeles-based ad company, has been testing 41st Parameter's technology
for three months on websites of its clients, which include Cooking.com Inc.
and Toms Shoes Inc. (Clients weren't notified of the test, and fingerprints
weren't used to display ads.)

In its examination of 70 million website visits, 41st Parameter found it
could generate a fingerprint about 89% of the time. By comparison, Steel
House was able to use cookies for tracking on only about 78% of visits,
because some people blocked or deleted cookies.

"It's almost like a revolution," says Mark Douglas, founder and CEO of Steel
House. "Our intent is that it can completely replace the use of cookies."

Steel House offers people a way to opt out of its current cookie-based ads
and says it would do the same if it adopts fingerprints. "I definitely don't
want to be in the sights of the privacy people," Mr. Douglas says.

Computers need to broadcast details about their configuration in order to
interact smoothly with websites and with other computers. For example,
computers announce which specific Web browsers they use, along with their
screen resolution, to help websites display correctly.

There are hundreds of parameters. "We call them the 'toys on the table,'"
says Mr. Norris of BlueCava. "Everyone has the same toys on the table. It's
how you rearrange them or look at them that is the secret sauce" used to
fingerprint a specific computer.

BlueCava's secret sauce hails from Sydney, Australia, in the early 1990s.
Back then, inventor Ric Richardson was helping musicians including the band
INXS to use new software for playing their electronic keyboards.

"They'd say what sound they wanted, and I'd do it," says Mr. Richardson, who
today works out of a van parked near an Australia beach.

Mr. Richardson was frustrated when he tried to sell the music software,
because there was no way to let people test it before buying. So he designed
a "demonstration" version of the software that would let people test it, but
not copy it.

Ori Eisen, founder of 41st Parameter

His idea: Configure his software to work only after it was linked to a unique
computer. So, he developed a way to catalog each computer's individual
properties. He found many subtle variations, among even outwardly similar
machines.

"It was amazing how different they were," he says. "There are literally
hundreds of things you can measure."

In 1992, he borrowed $40,000 from his parents, filed a patent application for
a "system for software registration" and founded a company, Uniloc Corp.

This year, Uniloc started trying to broaden its business away from
software-piracy prevention. It recruited Mr. Norris, then running a company
that provided photos for advertisers, to seek new uses for its technology.
"What I saw was this different way of looking at things on the Web," Mr.
Norris says.

Mr. Norris became CEO and spun off BlueCava to market device fingerprinting
both to fraud-prevention and online-ad firms.  Eventually, he hopes Blue Cava
can fingerprint everything from automobiles to the electrical grid. In
October, Texas billionaire Mark Cuban led a group of investors who put $5
million into BlueCava.

BlueCava embeds its technology in websites, downloadable games and cellphone
apps. One of its first customers was Palo Alto, Calif.-based IMVU Inc., which
operates an online game where 55 million registered players can build virtual
identities and chat in 3-D. It wanted to combat fraudsters who were setting
up multiple accounts to buy virtual clothing and trinkets with stolen
credit-card numbers. Kevin Dasch, a vice president at IMVU, says BlueCava's
technology "has led to a significant decline in our fraud rates."

Later this year, BlueCava plans to launch its reputation exchange, which will
include all the fingerprints it has collected so far.

Unlike most other fraud-prevention companies, BlueCava plans to merge its
fraud data with its advertising data. Rivals say they don't mix the two types
of data.

Greg Pierson, chief executive of iovation, says the company will never
disclose specific information about people's Web-browsing behavior, "because
it's unnecessary and it's dangerous. It's close to spying."

Mr. Norris says collecting that data is "standard practice" in the online-ad
business.

Mr. Dasch of IMVU says he doesn't mind fingerprints of IMVU customers being
added to the exchange, provided that they don't contain personally
identifiable information such as user names, and that his company can use
other exchange data in return.

The idea behind BlueCava's exchange is to let advertisers build profiles of
the people using the devices it has identified. For instance, BlueCava will
know that an IMVU fingerprint is from someone who likes virtual-reality
games.

Other advertisers could then add information about that user. BlueCava also
plans to link the profiles of various devicesbcellphones, for instancebthat
also appear to be used by the same person.

Blue Cava also is seeking to use a controversial technique of matching online
data about people with catalogs of offline information about them, such as
property records, motor-vehicle registrations, income estimates and other
details. It works like this: An individual logs into a website using a name
or e-mail address.

The website shares those details with an offline-data company, which uses the
email address or name to look up its files about the person.

The data company then strips out the user's name and passes BlueCava
information from offline databases. BlueCava then adds those personal details
to its profile of that device.

As a result, BlueCava expects to have extremely detailed profiles of devices
that could be more useful to marketers. In its privacy policy, BlueCava says
it plans to hang onto device data "for the foreseeable future."

Advertisers are starting to test BlueCava's system. Mobext, the U.S.
cellphone-advertising unit of the French firm Havas SA, is evaluating
BlueCava's technology as a way to target users on mobile devices. "It's a
better level of tracking," says Rob Griffin, senior vice president at Havas
Digital.

Phuc Truong, managing director of Mobext, explains that tracking on
cellphones is difficult because cookies don't always work on them. By
comparison, he says, BlueCava's technology can work on all phones.

"I think cookies are a joke," Mr. Norris says. "The system is archaic and was
invented by accident. We've outgrown it, and it's time for the next thing."
