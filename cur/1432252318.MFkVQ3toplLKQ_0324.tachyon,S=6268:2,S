There are two types of windows on most American cars...  The first is the
front windshield.. It has a film in it that keeps it generally in one piece
unless enough force is put through it. As a firefighter we like this
windshield since it is easily removed with a sharp knife around the seal
(its gotta be removed before you can remove the top of the car).  The side
windows are another matter, they are made to shatter so that there are no
large shards that may seriously injure someone...

A model rocket does not really count as a good test on the strength of the
window since most model rockets do not have the weight needed to damage much
anything even with a D engine..

A .38 will bounce off water if shot at the right angle.. However it will not
bounce off a windows, at any fair distance, if shot perpendicular to the
winshield...

All that aside you are assuming that the Italian vehicles have the same type
glass we do in our American cars..

No that was not why safety glass was put in cars.. It was put in cars stop
flying glass....

I have probably seen all of the most popular ones.. I also have some videos
of emeregencies that I actually responded too.

How did the police really know it was a fire extinguisher.. It could have
been a bomb for all they knew.. However I can tell you this.. If someone was
coming at me with a 15lb metal object with the intent to hurl it at my head
and I had a gun in my hand I would not hesitate to shoot with intent to
kill...

These people went from being protestors to being criminals by their own
actions.....
