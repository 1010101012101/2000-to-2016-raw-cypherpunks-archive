A lesson not lost of The Founders, many who paid with their lives and their 
fortunes even if they did keep their sacred honor.  Even if you are 
non-violently demonstrating BU is correct that you still may pay a heavy 
price.  You need to decide before you demonstrate: how important this issue 
you're protesting is, how far you're willing to take your protests and what 
you may be risking in doing so.  Then make preparations accordingly.

All Western countries fear losing the support of their middle class, tax 
paying, citizens. To the extent that the Vietnam demonstrations succeeded 
it was because they were able to elicit "police riots" in response to what 
many felt were mostly non-violent (if not legal) demonstrations and swing 
public opinion.  Of course, the release of the Pentagon Papers, which 
credibly confirmed \what many of the demonstrators had been saying of U.S. 
goals and involvement in S.E. Asia, didn't hurt either.
