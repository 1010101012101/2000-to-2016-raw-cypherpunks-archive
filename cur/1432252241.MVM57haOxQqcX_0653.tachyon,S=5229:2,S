you are ignoring that "the nazis" is a far larger group than james is.
also, you're only arguing body count. the nazis were not arguing that
the jews were KILLING the "aryan race", at least not in the immediate
murder sense.

of course the comparison is flawed. to make it more equal, one would
have to compare two groups, say the jews and the nazis. both thought of
the other as the ultimate evil. the nazis went to kill the jews,
justifying their deeds with the fear that the jews would otherwise be
doing evil to them. according to james' definition, they (the nazis)
were actually the GOOD guys!
that's the point. you can use the "evil people are those who harm
others, good people are those who fight evil people" definition to
justify ANYTHING. now I definitely don't say the nazis are good (my
grandfather died in a nazi prison). I just say that even though I would
agree calling them "evil", that is still a subjective category, and I
don't demand that the rest of the universe agree with me.

the difference is that your "I say" are comments about actual,
observable events in the outside world. james' "I say" relate to
non-observable phenomena, where a "verification through observation"
approach isn't in the range of options.
