            University Inserts Black Student
            Among Whites in Photo 
            The Associated Press

            MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Hoping to illustrate its diverse
            enrollment, the University of Wisconsin at Madison says it
            doctored a photo on a brochure cover by inserting a black
            student in a crowd of white football fans. 

            "We did it in this one instance, and it really was an error in
            judgment," University publications director Al Friedman said
            Tuesday.
