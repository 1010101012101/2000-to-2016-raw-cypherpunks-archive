>Hi Jim,

>...  Trisys has recently announced Insight, a new software 
>application that monitors PC use by offsite and onsite employees. 
>Insight resides on individual workstations, tracking data such as 
>amount of time spent using specific applications, mouseclicks, Web 
>sites visited, time spent on Internet pages and more.
>
>It provides an accurate picture of employee PC use while the 
>employee is on company time, regardless of whether the worker is 
>telecommuting from home via a company computer, on the road using a 
>company laptop, or at his or her desk in the office.  Insight can 
>greatly increase the workplace effectiveness of employees while also 
>decreasing the risk of corporate liability due to inappropriate or 
>illegal use of computers on the job.
