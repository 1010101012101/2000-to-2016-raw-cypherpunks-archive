Well, fat chance. Do the liberals actually DO anything besides talk? At 
least the rabid Christian right can organize some painful activities. The 
liberal "left" only seem to try to make enough of a stink for someone else 
to do something. As the feds shut down their printing presses, they'll 
bemoan the loss of rights while handing over the keys without a fight.

OK, if this isn't true I'd be happy to be proven wrong.
