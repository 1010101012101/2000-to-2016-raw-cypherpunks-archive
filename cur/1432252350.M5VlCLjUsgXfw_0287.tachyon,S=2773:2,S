That is pretty funny, to let DNA determine which is which.

NYC has announced plans for a huge new DNA analysis center
as if calamity is to become a normal part of Fun City. Not that
that is news, heretofore Potter's Field took the anonymous
cadavers. Now Fresh Kills gets what is left over after DNA
ID.

FBI Tent City at Fresh Kills is the first rebuilding of New York,
the DNA Center the second.
