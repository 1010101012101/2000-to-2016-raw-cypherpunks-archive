Sure, that's harshing on infrastructure.  Bad hacker, no coffee.

But something like search-engine poisoning is not a crime.
Regular ole boycotts are not yet Conspiracies to Interfere
With Interstate Trade.  Hell, spamming with negative comments
is still legal; what if the spam seemed to come from Adobe?
What if the agit-spam seemed to come from, say, a near-name like
AdobeCo.com?  How about a little anonymous stock price rumor mongering?

Probably Adobe is resistant to change their course; they prefer to sleep
with
the likes of the Valenti Mafia...
