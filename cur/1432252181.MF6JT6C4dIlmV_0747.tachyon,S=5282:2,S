Jane, if this crew of folks, see above, can't do you justice, nobody can.

Everyone, Jane is about my favorite cryptography/"signature" lawyer, mostly
because she, like most people with sense, aren't sure they're "signatures"
at all...

Cheers,
RAH

Bob:

May I impose on you a second time and ask you to post this to your list of
DBS people?  I'm afraid I haven't had a chance to make much progress on the
encyclopedia article because, among other things, I had to finish this paper
first.  I hope to reply shortly to the many colleagues of yours who were
kind enough to send suggestions for innovative electronic payments I should
cover in that piece.

I've written an article arguing that digital signature may not be the next
big thing after all, the popular wisdom on this point notwithstanding.  If I
have my facts wrong, or my descriptions of the technology wrong, I'd be
grateful to have this pointed out to me before this appears in print.  I've
posted a draft at:

http://www.smu.edu/~jwinn/shocking-truth.htm

If any of your colleagues have any comments, I'd be grateful for the
feedback.

regards, jkw
