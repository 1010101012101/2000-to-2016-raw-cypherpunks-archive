Oooooo  Shows what happen when you post casually to the
cypherpunks list ;-)

You are right.  I should have said that he was a British lad.

Several authorities, eg the Cathoic Encyclopedia, say that St Patrick
became fluent in the language of the Irish while in slavery.  Some
claim that he was born in Scotland, some say in Wales.  None support
your suggestion that the language of his masters was his native
tongue.  

The real point here is that the Irish, generally portrayed as 
victims of the British, were sometimes victims, sometimes villians --
like most everybody else.  

PS.  I am immensely fond of Ireland; me mother is Irish, in fact ;-)
