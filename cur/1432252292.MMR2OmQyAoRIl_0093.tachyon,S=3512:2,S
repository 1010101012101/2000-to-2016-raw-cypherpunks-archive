"If I don't remember incorrectly, they said something about identifying him
by DNA testing."

Well, of course "Saddam" is going to test positive...he's apparently an 
actual CLONE.
Actually, from what I understand this is the 'original' Saddam (note how 
much older he seems than the Saddams we've been seeing in the press over the 
last few years), but he hasn't actually controlled things for a couple of 
decades. The Saddam we're really looking for is approximately Saddam #3, and 
he's still at large, and directing the insurgency.
