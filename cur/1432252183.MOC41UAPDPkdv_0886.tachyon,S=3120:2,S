 >>Hey, Protestantism gave us the "priesthood of all believers",
and if that's too much work, the ULC will ordain you for $20.
The Internet lets everybody be a journalist, or at least a political 
commentator.
Won't be a problem getting either of those jobs :-)
(However, as many people have discovered with acting or Internet startup,
 >>getting a job in the field is easy, but getting a *paying* job is 
tougher...)

I'm interested in the peyote priesthood.(Im already an entertainment 
journalist) I do want confessional box privileges.(20c?)
Who needs a paying job and why do *you* do *this*? Protwhateverthefuck 
sounds like a real drag Maaaaan.

 >>The Internet lets everybody be a journalist, or at least a political 
commentator.

You do love to smell your own farts ,dont you. Still it lets everybody be 
an assassin or at least a *predictor*.
Thanks bill,thanks a hell of a lot.
