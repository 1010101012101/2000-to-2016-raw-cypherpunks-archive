I asked you to provide some _basis_ for your claim, not to quibble 
about "not claiming to be stating facts."

Recall that your precise words were:

"IMHO, the NSA has enough expertise and technology to crack just about
any cipher out there."

This is a claim about _ciphers_, a claim often made by the clueless. 
("Any cipher can be broken...," "The NSA has more than enough 
computer power...," are the most common variants.)

You are a twit.
