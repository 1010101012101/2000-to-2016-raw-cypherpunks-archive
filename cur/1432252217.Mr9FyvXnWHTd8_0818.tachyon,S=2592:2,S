It would help to use a more anonymous terminal (than your college) 
and not to attack someplace where you've worked.  And not to
have the stock options in your real name.

Sounds like an act of desparation, not a carefully planned attack.

Of course, the dude couldn't have done the attack had he not worked
there before, and info-traffickers will learn to use better authentication.

Means, motivation, opportunity.
