This needs to be +1'ed, noted well, remembered, reminded and generally
proclaimed loudly.

The use cases of "benefit" are looking slim indeed, and in fact "you have
at most one month and even then a ~30% chance of being specifically
identified.

The metaphorical hit and run is the remaining use case, assuming you don't

your hope to be not detected arse.

Fill traffic overlay net, and hardware based "new mesh network" seem to be
the only sane approaches for sane future work named thus far...
