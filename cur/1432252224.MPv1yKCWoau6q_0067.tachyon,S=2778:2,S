Quantum crypto secrets from Japan
By: Lucy Sherriff
Posted: 26/09/2000 at 13:29 GMT

Mitsubishi and Hokkaido University have completed a latest round of experiments in quantum cryptography over optical fibres. The two
organisations say that their quantum cryptographic system is a success, and could have important implications for optical fibre
networks already in use.

The data was sent along 200 meters of optical fibre at a rate of one kbps. Not exactly fast, but there we go. The researchers
reported a quantum bit rate error of one percent, which was kept low by the ability of the system to compensate for fluctuations in
the phase and polarisation of the light.
