No, it's just a mistake.  AC's got more mistakes than a whore has crabs.
Never rely on it.  Always check the primary literature, or at least the
HAC, http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/.

Using R1 you're basically choosing from a parameterized family of hash
functions.  But that's not necessary for this; you can choose a fixed
hash, junk R1, and just use the single random value R2.
