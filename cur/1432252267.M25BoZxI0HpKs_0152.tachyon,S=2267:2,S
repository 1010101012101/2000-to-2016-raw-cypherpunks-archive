Read fisk's account: http://tinyurl.com/995f

Compare Fisk's account, with more mainstream accounts of the 
same events: http://tinyurl.com/9966

The problem is not that Fisk argued that Saddam should win, the 
problem is that he claimed that with his own eyes he saw 
decisive and irrefutable evidence that Saddam was winning, or 
at least not losing nearly as fast as was claimed. He claimed
"the Americans had been caught lying again", when as events
proved, they were speaking the truth.
