Ugh. Don't get me started. My fiance is Chinese, and has odd notions of 
delectability. Odd by American standards, anyway. Black eggs are 
probably the worst, but they had a lot of competition.

We've worked out a compromise on critters that leaves us both happy: 
I'll bring in a carcass and clean it. I get the muscle tissue and 
usually the liver, and she gets the skin, bones, fat, and miscellaneous 
organs. And the head. (Stewed rabbit head. With the fur still on. 
<shudder>)
