Writing certain types of code has long been criminalized. Look
at the export regs that made posting code on a website a felony.
Truly this is not new. Learn, adapt, consult a lawyer if you 
feel it's necessary and if you're in business and selling the stuff.

But writing code and exercising your free speech rights on a mailing
list are both (in general) protected activities.
