                            Call For Papers
                  New Security Paradigms Workshop 2001
                    An ACM/SIGSAC sponsored workshop
                         11 - 13 September 2001
                       Cloudcroft, New Mexico, USA
                           http://www.nspw.org
========================================================================

2001 is the tenth anniversary of the New Security Paradigms Workshop
(NSPW), which has provided a productive and highly interactive forum for
innovative new approaches to computer security. The workshop offers a
constructive environment where experienced researchers and practitioners
work alongside newer participants in the field.  The result is a unique
opportunity to exchange ideas. NSPW 2001 will take place September 11 -
13, 2001 at the Cloudcroft Lodge, Cloudcroft, New Mexico, 20 miles from
Alamogordo/White Sands.

In order to preserve the small, focused nature of the workshop,
participation is limited to authors of accepted papers and conference
organizers. Because we expect new paradigms we accept wide-ranging
topics in information security. Any paper that presents a significant
shift in thinking about difficult security issues or builds on a
previous shift is welcomed.

NSPW is highly interactive in nature. Authors are encouraged to present
ideas that might be considered risky in some other forum. All
participants are charged with providing feedback in a constructive
manner. The resulting brainstorming environment has proven to be an
excellent medium for furthering the development of these ideas. Many
authors have mentioned that they received more useful feedback and ideas
than from any other conference. The proceedings, published after the
workshop, have consistently benefited from the inclusion of workshop
feedback.

What makes a paper acceptable for NSPW? While we reject plenty of
excellent papers that would do very well at other venues, our eclectic
program committee particularly looks for new paradigms, innovative
approaches to older problems, early thinking on new topics that are not
necessarily fully polished, and controversial issues that might not make
it into other conferences but deserve to have their try at shaking and
breaking the mold. Conversely, a great paper that does not have a new
paradigm, does not challenge the status quo, or does not critique an
older paradigm will almost certainly get rejected.

To participate, please submit your paper, justification, and attendance
statement, preferably via e-mail, to both Program Chairs -- Brenda
Timmerman <btimmer@ecs.csun.edu> and Darrell Kienzle <DKienzle@NAI.com>
-- by Friday, March 30, 2001 (hardcopy submissions must be received by
Friday, March 23, 2001). Further details on the required format of
submissions follow.

1 - Your Paper
You should submit either a research paper, a 5 - 10 page position paper,
or a discussion topic proposal. Submissions of any type must not have
been published elsewhere. Discussion topic proposals should include an
in-depth description of the topic to be discussed, a convincing argument
that the topic will lead to a lively discussion, and any other
supporting materials.

Softcopy submissions should be in Postscript, PDF, Word/RTF or ASCII
format. Papers may be submitted as hardcopy. To submit hardcopy, please
mail 5 (five) copies to Program Co-chair Brenda Timmerman. Please allow
adequate time for delivery.

2 - Justification
You should describe, in one page or less, why your paper is appropriate
for the New Security Paradigms Workshop. A good justification will
describe the new paradigm being proposed, explain how it is a departure
from existing theory or practice, and identify those aspects of the
status quo it challenges or rejects.

3 - Attendance Statement
You should state how many authors wish to attend the workshop. Accepted
papers require the attendance of at least one author. In order to ensure
that all papers receive equally strong feedback, all attendees are
expected to stay for the entire duration of the workshop.

The program committee will referee the papers and notify the authors of
acceptance status by June 8, 2000. We expect to be able to offer a
limited amount of financial aid to those who require it. More
information will be provided on our web site <http://www.nspw.org> as it
becomes available.
