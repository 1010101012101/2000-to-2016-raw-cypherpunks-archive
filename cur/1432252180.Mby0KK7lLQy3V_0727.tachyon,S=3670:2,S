It takes no significant portion of the computing power of the world to
execute these transactions, asking them to dump to something like FINCEN
is trivial. The amount ($16T/day) is irrelevant. The exchanges aren't done
a penny at a time...

The reality is that the US Gov. (and probably most other western powers)
has the resources to track each and every eft or computerized data
transfer for each transaction each day. They've got the computing power
left over to then analyze it for traffic analysis.
