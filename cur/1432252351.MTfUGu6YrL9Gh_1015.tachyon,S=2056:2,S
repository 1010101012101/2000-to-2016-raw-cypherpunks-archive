Subject: Donald Knuth stops paying for errata


It seems that Donald Knuth had his bank accounts attacked not once but
three times using his checking account number off of checks he sent
out for bounties for flaws in his books and software, and is thus
ending a practice of nearly 40 years. Rather sad.

I mark this as another milestone in the slow destruction of the idea
that it is okay for an account number to be the secret used to effect
payment in a transaction system.
