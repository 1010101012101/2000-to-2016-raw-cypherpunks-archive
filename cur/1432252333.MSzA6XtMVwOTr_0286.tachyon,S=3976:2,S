Point well taken. But the same could be said of the "crimes and bad 
behavior" at Waco and Ruby Ridge; it might have been their fault, but
they sure as hell didn't deserve what ultimately happened to them any
more than the commies did. I'm not out to defend any ideology, only the
idea of government agents' accountability to the rule of law.
