During the possibly more radical 60s, some of us uttered "under Satan" 
during this sequence. One of my friends got a trip to the Principal's 
office for this, where he explained that he believed in Satan and that 
God was just a pretender, and if the Principal could demonstrate that 
the U.S. officially recognizes one deity over another he would 
reconsider.

I don't "pledge" to either a flag or a country. I just live here. And 
this is where the stuff I own is located. All I ask of government is 
that they stay out of my way.
