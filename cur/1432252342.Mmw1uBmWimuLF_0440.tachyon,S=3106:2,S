..which means that it still requires an OOB authentication.
(or blinding typing 'yes' and ignoring the consequences).
But that's another subject.

Verisign had for a number of years an email-only cert.
That is, they verified that the email address had someone
or something that answered email.  I beleive that they
called this a 'Class 1' cert.

X.509, PKIX et.al. allow a CA to insert a pointer
to a certificate practice statement, which can define
what the certificate certifies.

Thwate's making free certs difficult has nothing to do
with the usefulness of certs or X.509 or true names or
whatever, and everything to do with maximizing profit.

Since each cert carries a fixed risk of legal issues
(i.e being sued because they certified X who wasn't X)
Verisign/Thwate want to sell a comparatively few expensive
certs instead of a lot of cheap certs.
