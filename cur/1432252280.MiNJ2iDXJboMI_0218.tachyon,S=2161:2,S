Well it wasn't the point I was trying to make, which was comparing it to
predictions made by (the propaganda division of) another super-power in the
mid 1940s about winning an unwinnable war because God/righteousness/whatever
was on their side, and all they had to do was hold out a bit longer.  Compare
the general tone of the WSJ article to the one in e.g. the first half of
http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/documents/htestmnt.htm.
