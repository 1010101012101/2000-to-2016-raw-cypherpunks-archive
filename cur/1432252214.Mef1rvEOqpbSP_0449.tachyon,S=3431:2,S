Utter nonsense. A corporation paying 45% of its profits in tax (not to 
mention similar high tax rates on tens of thousands of its employees) 
gets little or nothing "back" from the state.

Contrast this to the growing number of "on disability" scams, 
"services" recipients, welfare of various sorts, and general incentives 
not to work or save.

My state, California, has very high income and investment taxes, and 
very high local and property taxes...and yet the taxes can't keep up 
with the giveaways to bums, winos, unwed mothers, queers, beggars, 
"disabled," and general layabouts. And the state even makes it illegal 
to hire people for day jobs (without filling out numerous forms, 
submitting reports to Cal-OSHA, SSA, etc.).

Meanwhile, in our many Mexican towns here in California, unwed Mexican 
mamas push their baby strollers down to La Famiglia and WICC to get 
their "benefits."

I've never taken a dime of "unemployment" or "welfare" or "Social 
Security" or any other money stolen from taxpayers to give to 
layabouts. Meanwhile, I've paid a vast amount of taxes.

I say feed the bums into incinerators. The vilest of them should be 
tortured first.
