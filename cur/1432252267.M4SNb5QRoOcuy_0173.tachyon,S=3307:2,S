The population of Revolutionary France (1793) was about 25 million.  The
death toll from The Terror, as I vaguely recall from reading it years ago,
was about 19,000.  Or, about 0.075% of the population, which is actually
quite small when you think about it.  The population of the US today is
about 260 million.  An equivalent per-capita death rate today would be
200,000 people:  This is, as I recall, substantially less than the number of
people who die early each year due to either alcoholism or tobacco-related
diseases.

It's probably not coincidence that the selective removal of 200,000 today
would likely "do the job", despite the vast difference in today's society
and 18th century France.
