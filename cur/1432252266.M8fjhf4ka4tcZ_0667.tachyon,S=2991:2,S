And there is nothing immoral in discussing the fact that actions may 
have consequences.

Take the work camps described in Solzhenitsyn's "One Day in the Life of 
Ivan Denisovitch." (Or, of course, the Nazi extermination camps. Or the 
U.S. concentration camps in Gitmo.) The camp management clearly sought 
a docile, "policeman inside," stoolie-oriented system where informers 
and "capos" (those who cooperate and act as de facto guards) see no 
reason NOT to be stoolies and capos.

But merely the threat that stoolies and capos will be found with their 
throats slit is often enough to deter such behaviors.

My point is that if librarians even think there is some small chance 
that someone they narc out to Big Brother will kill them or their 
families, such stoolie behavior may drop precipitously.
