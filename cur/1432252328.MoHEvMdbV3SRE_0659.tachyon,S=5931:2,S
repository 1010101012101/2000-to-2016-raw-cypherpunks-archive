The correct and accurate chronology is here:
http://www.politechbot.com/p-01870.html

The message you sent to UUNET complaining about my alleged spam is below. 
In your most recent response, you wrote:
"*NOWHERE* in the below complaint will you see *ANY* proof of your 
assertion that I "asked them to take action against *me* [McCullagh]".

To the contrary, in the below spam complaint sent to UUNET you brand me a 
"downstream spammer" and ask them to "please muzzle this idjit..."

I admit I may have been a little hasty in saying you were "censorhappy." 
"Apparently censorhappy" would have been better. But it is incorrect to say 
that I tried to attack you in my writeup. My full message is 5,202 
characters; the paragraph dealing with you was 338 characters. (Granted, 
you could snip headers, but the calculation would be similar.)

It would have been trivial to write an article that *was* aimed at you. I 
could have said:
>If there's one thing J.A. Terranson hates more than spam, it's a spammer. 
>With the regularity of a metronome and the cool calculation of a viper, 
>the vigilante sysadmin regularly reports spammers to their upstream providers.
>But Terranson's singleminded focus on spam has had one side effect: The 
>gradual but inevitable erosion of any sense of humor about the topic.
>When I posted a message to cypherpunks...

But I didn't write that.
