Worse yet, apparently the shopkeepers of Genoa were strongly encouraged
by the government to head out of town. Then the barricades went up
around the "red zone" and shops and businesses not inside it seem to 
be receiving minimal, if any, police protection.

In other words, the Europeans are disarmed, pressured to leave town,
and then they can watch CNN with us as their shops are looted and smashed
and the cops hunker down inside the red zone.
