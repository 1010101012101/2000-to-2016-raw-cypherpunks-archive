Yeah, how "recording" got into the picture is beyond me. The idea is to 
have several of the wireless cameras at various places, to monitor. 
Recording is not needed, except maybe for the trial or inquest.

In any case, there are various exemptions for videotaping:

1) People videotape others ALL THE TIME. Look at folks with camcorders. 
Are they getting releases from all those in the background of their 
shots at Disneyland?

2) Stores, gas stations, ATMs, all videotape. Sometimes they have a 
little notice at the front of the store, sometimes not.

3) I believe, but don't quote me, that image recording without _audio_ 
recording is exempt from the wiretap laws, anyway. (This came up during 
one of those "peeping tom cam" cases, where it was pointed out that no 
particular statute forbids such taping., (Specific laws since passed, of 
course.)
