you meant uploads your public key to some central server.

I think that the Joe Sixpacks who would care enough to install
"secure" email would like to have some sort of feedback
that it's working, i.e. they need to unlock the private key with
a password.  Of course they'll choose a lame one, but that's
besides the point.

There's two sub-species of Sixpack-- the one I describe, and
those who don't know and don't care about secure email, which
is who you're talking about.

It's the the "early adopter" Sixpacks I'm thinking of.  Once you get
enough of them, then the someone will declare it an industry standard
and all the Sixpacks will get it, whether they know it or not.

I wrote something like what you're describing long ago, for a large
workstation maker.
Only this was a hack on sendmail to automagically encrypt/decrypt
mail between offices in foreign countries whose security services
were known to snoop on technology companies.

How about an add-on to MSIE or Netscape?  Either one has a pile
of crypto junk to call on.  Making it work with S/MIME might
be an easy way to do it.
