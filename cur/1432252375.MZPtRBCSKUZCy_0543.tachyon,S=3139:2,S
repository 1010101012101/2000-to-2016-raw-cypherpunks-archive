During the Carnivore debate, I argued that mandatory placement of 
computer agents in systems was equivalent to quartering troops:

< http://www.mail-archive.com/cypherpunks@algebra.com/msg03198.html>

"The Third Amendment, about
quartering troops, is seldom-applied.

"But if I own a computer and I rent out accounts to others and the FBI
comes to me and says "We are putting a Carnivore computer in your
place," how else can this be interpreted _except_ as a violation of
the Third?"

This was from July, 2000. I believe it also came up in earlier 
discussions, including in a panel I was on with Michael Froomkin at a 
CFP in 1995.
