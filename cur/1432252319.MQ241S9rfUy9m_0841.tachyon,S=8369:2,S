Research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't
happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  I can think
of three researchers into automated methods for addressing
vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the
existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into a set requires that
you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and
that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test
predictions.

I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
admin's job would be a lot harder.

Clearly, people should not be restricted from doing what they want
with information.  However, if you are concerned about the state of
computer security, then I think encouraging more and better
communication amongst "white hats" is a good idea.

(An interesting question is 'Is there a difference between selling
information you know you have and information you expect to have?'
which is what many security companies have been doing for a while:
Hiring the people who find exploits to find them for their commercial
profit.  The difference is that those security companies paid salary,
not contracting rates.)
