...and MM/DD/YYYY is an antiquitated American format.

STANDARD time format is ISO-8601 compliant, YYYY-MM-DD.

Another acceptable way is DD MMM YYYY in any order, where the format of
the fields automatically and unambiguously determines meaning.

Peddlers of other formats should be slowly tortured on public TV as the
warning for the others. I'd be delighted to watch.

You won't believe how many people who should know what IT security is
about still live somewhere between 1900 and 1950.

And because the vendors aren't required to disclose the documentation nor
at least the interfaces, half[1] of the technology is a proprietary piece
of shit that nobody knows how it works, and - worse - nobody can expect
how it will fail.

True. And the cables are accessible to everyone who knows how to crawl
into a manhole. Not even talking about the atrocious security of wireless
links.

Why fractals?

One comment I would have is that the growing intelligence of equipment
should mandate fail-safe operation, refusal to perform commands that would
put the node and its surrounding area to dangerous situation. Eg, it's
better to cause traffic jam by setting all lights to red (or, even better,
blinking yellow, which means here that the traffic lights aren't
controlled) when a command comes to set greens in unsafe combination, than
to obey the command. This way, the growing CPU power will be at least used
to maintain sane behavior of the equipment in unpredictable cases and even
in case of an active hostile attack.
