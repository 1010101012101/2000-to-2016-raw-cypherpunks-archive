While I understand the rubber-hose vote-coercion problem, My own opinion
still remains that we need to solve the voting problem for *business*
reasons, and that's how we'll get to use it first. You need secure voting
protocols in order to control equity, after all, and, frankly, I'm not
nearly as skeptical as others are about it. Without any reasons for my
intuition here, I think that some of the problems some cryptographic
experts have about internet voting are mostly bugbears, like "perfect"
kidnapping scenarios for digital cash itself, for instance.

And, of course, I think that the "problem" of selling votes is more one
of attitude adjustment. After all we sell votes in corporations all the
time, and, sooner or later, we're going to treat our force-control
structures as non-monopolistic businesses instead of monopolistic
nation-states. In the same way that religious freedom gave us religious
denominations with democratic governance, sooner or later economic
freedom will give us force-control that can be sold just like any other
asset. Voteauction.com is a pointer to that, frankly.


So, workable solutions for voting will happen first in *corporate*
governance, in shareholder voting, proxies and so on. After we solve the
problem of voting about *money*, mere politics will be a piece of cake.

Financial cryptography is the only cryptography that matters. Political
cryptography is a mere sideshow by comparison.

Cheers,
RAH
