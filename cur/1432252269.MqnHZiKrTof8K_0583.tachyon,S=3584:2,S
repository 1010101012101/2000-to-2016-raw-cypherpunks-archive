All this may be true, but it fails to recognize that most
geek-protests (and I have covered many) don't result in high
turnouts. See this anti-DMCA protest, which drew eight marchers:
http://www.mccullagh.org/image/7/dmca-protesters-1.html

Perhaps 15 were marching in front of the Supreme Court when the CDA
was being heard.

Oh, this might be larger, and I suspect it will be. And it makes sense
to consider Adobe's mindset. But the Black Bloc (or the Black Panthers)
this isn't.
