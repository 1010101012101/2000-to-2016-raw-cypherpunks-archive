Let me know when you're in the Jasper, Georgia area and we'll have a 
few beers.  :-)

That about sums up my digital identity, yes.  The real Patrick is tied 
up in the cellar and I forced him to tell me his password.  As the de 
Vere and Marlowe scholars might say, the works of Shakespeare were not 
written by Shakespeare, but by somebody else using that name.  Not to 
compare myself with Shakespeare.  All too often my words are full of 
sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Like now.

Will do, thanks.  I have plenty of reading ahead of me.

Well said.  I find it utterly amazing that mere sequences of bits can 
accomplish this.

Oh God, so it's that obvious?  I'm devastated.

All this talk about meatspace suggests we should have some spare ribs 
with those beers.

Of course, writing style and personality can help expose private key 
hijacking and impersonation somewhat, though even that can be 
counterfeited.  I can recognize a post by JP May with my eyes squinted, 
just looking at the shapes of the letters and paragraphs.  But I bet I 
could do an utterly, mind-bogglingly good impersonation if I tried.

BE the bits.
