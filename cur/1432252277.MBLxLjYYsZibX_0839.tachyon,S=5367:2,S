Its Damaging;police chief.by andrew Webster.
Public confidence in the Victorian police was being damaged by continuing
allegations of corruption in the force,Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon
said yesterday.(sat)
Confirming reports that ongoing investigations into the drug squad had
spread to suburban and regional stations,Ms Nixon said increased resources
were being deployed to try and bring them to a rapid conclusion.
The Commissioner said investigators were looking at individuals who had
previously worked for the drug squad and had moved to other parts of the
Victoria police,some of whom had left the force.
But she said officers would not be suspended immediately allegations were
made against them."When we have sufficient evidence we will take that step,"
she said.
Problems with Victorias drug squad extend back many years.One former drug
squad senior detective was jailed for five years in May 2000 for stealing
seized chemicals;another serving officer has been charged with dealing
in ecstasy;a former drug squad detective has been charged with drug
trafficking;and in June last year one officer died from a drug overdose.
(I was raided and robbed on June 1 last June btw.Some stuff of mine went
missing.)
Commissioner Nixon said major changes had been made to the drug squad
but some of the recommendations by Police Ombudsman Dr Barry Perry had not
yet been implemented because of continuing negotiations with the Victorian
police association.Ms Nixon said she hoped to have an agreements in place
by next month.
But police Association secretary Paul Mullet denied the public had lost
faith in drug investigators.He said the Association was at an early stage
of discussions over drugs policy and had not yet been presented with the
chief commissioner's detailed position on negotiations.
Problems with corruption were also a matter of funding,according to Mr
Mullet,which could best be tackled by bringing the Ethical standards Dept.
up to strength.
Dr Perry is due to present a report to parliament detailing the extent of
current inquiry into drug squad corruption.
He said last week the reforms so far included renaming and restructuring
the Dept. but had not gone far enough.Dr Perry said the drug squad may have
to be disbanded.
