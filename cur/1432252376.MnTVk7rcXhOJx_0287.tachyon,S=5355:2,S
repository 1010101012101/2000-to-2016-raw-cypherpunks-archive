It was one of the worst places to hit; the offices were under construction 
and not everyone had moved in yet.

This is nonsense, and shows how seriously we should take the rest of the 
message. I was at the Pentagon yesterday; the plane did not hit the south 
side. (Photos at mccullagh.org).

I pulled a transcript from Lexis-Nexis. Here's what Armey said in response 
to the Pennsylvania question, (AUDIO GAP) in the original:

ARMEY: Well we learned some things about that.  At this point the information
is classified.  It is clear that we to have had a good investigation going
forward.  We are gathering information, there is a (AUDIO GAP) confidentiality
on what we know, but we do know that this is a serious premeditated crime, 
and I can say without any doubt or hesitation it's an international crime.

Did he 'fess up? I doubt it. Armey is a savvy political operator and gets 
classified briefings probably once a week or so. It's unlikely he'd cough 
up confidential material now (he hasn't before) -- it was ~12 hours after 
the attack happened, so he had time to reflect and digest it.

Nope.
