as in the case of SILK ROAD and the SR2 honeypot..

poor tradecraft = working for the NSA/FBI/IRS

same effect to the now busted..


your transactions EASILY are visible at blockchain.info and walking the chain back

again conspiracy to murder USG public officials will result in a worldwide manhunt
 WITH NSA assistance under EO 12333.. I am NOT saying dont do it.. I am saying be
