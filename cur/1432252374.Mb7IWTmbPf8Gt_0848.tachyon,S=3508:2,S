"Sure, unions are good" is not at all obvious to me. Why do you claim 
this?

Most labor unions are simply rent-seeking clubs designed to cement the 
status quo. Teacher's unions in the U.S. are a prime example: once the 
union got powerful enough, it fought for a tenure-type system which made 
it nearly impossible to remove those who taught poorly and to reward 
those who taught especially well.

I've never belonged to a labor union of any kind, and they are 
essentially absent from the chip and computer industries.

 From what I have seen, labor unions are a collectivist evil.
