No, it's Mutt users who don't play well with others.

Incorrect. There is no PGP/MIME support in Outlook, and the Eudora
PGP/MIME handling is less than perfect.

Oh really?

Gee, I thought it perhaps had something to do with the draconian export
regulations, the ease-of-use problems with crypto, or the fact that most
mail users "don't feel the need" for encryption. I had no idea that RSA's
"PKI patent" was to blame. Really, I can't think of any alternative public
key algorithms.

Not to mention that many companies had licenses to use BSAFE, and RSAREF
was available...

This will get you killfiled.

How long have you been using PGP/OpenPGP? You are exhibiting the typical
zeal of a new user, who has only become partially acquainted with the
issues at hand.

We're on an English-language mailing list.

That's an absurd analogy.

I'm halfway through this babbling diatribe, and I'm still not seeing *any*
compelling arguments for using PGP/MIME for mailing list mail (which is,
if I may remind you, the issue at hand.)

Actually, I'm on this particular list partially because of the MIME
stripping policy. I'm very happy with it, and I suspect many others are.
If you aren't happy with it, feel free to run your own node. Choate can
give you the details on that.

To be clear: RFC 3156 is useful. In particular, the multiple signatures
specification (an ID that adds to the 3156 functionality) could have a lot
of useful applications. But being standards compliant is worth little if
your application is the only one following that particular standard.

If you're on the Mutt mailing list, go ahead and use PGP/MIME. In the real
world, use what your readers can handle.
