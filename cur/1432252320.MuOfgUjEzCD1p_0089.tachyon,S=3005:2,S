Please  send messages to the following newspapers and ask them why they
haven't been following the trial of James Bell in federal court in Tacoma.
There will be extremely important testimony by James Bell on Monday.  
He needs your help.

It is an extreme emergency!  It is very important that a large number of
people contact these newspapers as soon as possible.  Thank you.
