All 75 WTC photos today were recovered, using a $30.00 
program called Photorescue from DataRescue, a Belgian 
company, grabbed online. Many thanks for quick pointers 
to a slew of such programs.

My panicky state and lack of Googling was due to learning
the photos had been deleted by Smokey only after getting home.
I had thought my obsequy had kept the camera and memory
chip from being confiscated. While being mesmerized by
a hypnotic Lady Smokey reading me Miranda, crimson nails
caressing her massive Beretta, luscious full lips mouthing 
me rights beyond ... Gent Smokey was deleting my reason for
obeying every command in the vicinity to escape losing the
data. Then at home I opened an empty directory, and the rest 
you know.

Thanks, thanks. Now to compress these 1 MB buggers into
transferrable size. They look fantastic in all senses, but
not due to any talent, it's all the camera and its amazing
memory chip.

Listen, if you don't have a digital camera with a maximum
size Compact Flash, you don't know what it is to get a
perfect picture every snap. With a 192MB chip you can
take a 150 or so high res images, and are they beautiful,
even to an idiot. The camera is a Nikon CoolPix 880, and
there are later, better models from Nikon and others.

The 192MB chip can also allow you to swallow all your secret
files, or use it to run your most secret programs and store 
invaluable files ready to flee the crime scene blasted naked 
with it up your pucker, which is not what occurred to me.
