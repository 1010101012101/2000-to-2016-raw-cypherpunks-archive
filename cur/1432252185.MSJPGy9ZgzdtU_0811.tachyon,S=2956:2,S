In *any* election other than the one we face this November, I would agree
with this 100%.  But this time, I just can't.   I fear the re-appointment
of Bush more than any other political event.  That the author of this is
willing to overlook that he is knowingly helping to keep Bush in office,
trampling those rights he claims to so cherish, totally negates his
argument.

Bush has never won an election.

Let's keep it that way.
