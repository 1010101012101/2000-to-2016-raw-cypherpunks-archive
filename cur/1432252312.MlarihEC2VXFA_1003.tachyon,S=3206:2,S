And about time! Don't keep us oblivious about your progress.

I agree - I actually tried to convince Thomas (author of Electrum) to do it
that way. Name, birthplace.... is not really a password, but it's a salt
that chages the situation of an attacker. Instead of trying out a
passphrase and checking if *any* address matches, he needs to target
specifically you. But Thomas doesn't see the difference. Prefixing a good
password with an unknown, but guessable salt "R|diger Koch - Anu -
Haidelberga - 19121965" is making life of an attacker really miserable -
particularly if you add deliberate spelling errors in.

The beauty of JS from your POV is that you can shift the responsibility
100% to the user. And there is no point to hack your server, because you
hold no user data on your server if the wallet is re-created from the
passphrase every time the user "logs in". So you don't need to back-up
anything and you can't be taken legally responsible for data loss.
