	Given the following:

	(1) That the phone calls are made at given times of day.

	(2) Last a specifc length--i.e. always a multiple of 5 minutes etc.

	(3) All packets in/out are encrypted.

	Would it really matter? If traffic bound for a specific node 
were simply encrypted with that *nodes* public key, and every packet 
encrypted to with the next nodes key, would (2) Be enough?
