Here's a better question, Tim.

Why are you upset about it?

I mean, there are two possibilities. Either this mailing list is for useful 
discussion, or it's not.

If it *is*, then you should *welcome* the statists, the communists, the 
apologists, the Klansmen, feminists, nazis, Libertarians of any sort, 
Democrats, Greens, Republicans... anyone with the intelligence to write a 
coherent statement. (One could even argue against *that* limitation, but I 
won't.) Certainly, you have your views, and you should be expressing them, 
and you should encourage and support others who agree with you. But if this 
list is to be in any way useful, then you have to actually do this where 
people who *disagree* can read it. Preaching to the choir makes you feel warm 
and fuzzy, perhaps, and it makes for a smooth sermon, but it doesn't do a 
whole lot of good.

Besides - what's the fucking point of supporting freedom of speech if you keep 
telling people to shut up? You're dangerously close to sounding like those 
cranks who claim they're being patriotic by attacking the Dixie Chicks for 
their speech.

If it's not for useful discussion, just let us know. We'll all leave, and you 
can continue spreading the good word to precisely nobody.

One of the worst things about this wonderful invention we call the Internet is 
that so many people choose to listen only to those they already agree with.
