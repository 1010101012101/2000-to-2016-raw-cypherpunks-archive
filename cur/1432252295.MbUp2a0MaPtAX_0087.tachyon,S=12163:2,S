Tim May wrote (and fairly cogently, I might add)...

"If a person thought he was not being paid enough, it was his option to go 
elsewhere, to start his own business, etc. If a business wanted to raise or 
lower prices, their option. Customers were free to purchase or not."

This is an idealization, of course, and to the extent that it was true I 
agree with some of the main conclusions here. Another idealization is that, 
once in a while, someone will get caught in a downsizing or without a job 
for a while. Knowing that some small cushion existed allowed those with 
fairly minimal capital to take the kinds of risks implicit in what you're 
talking about.


"The meme which Tyler Durden and John Young--not surprising to me that both 
are Manhattanites, representing the East Coast view of capitalism--are 
popularizing is the one that says that what made companies successful was 
*government spending*, not this compact which needed little or no government 
role, and that this makes government intervention in business justifiable. 
Even more mendacious is the claim that those who worked hard and risked 
their capital by investing in companies are profiting at the expense of the 
"less privileged." "

Well. I wasn't exactly trying to say that. At least, "Intel was successful 
because the government gave it tax breaks..."...that's what I'm NOT saying. 
However, add my point above to the notion that the whole American social 
fabric probably can not be separated into small discete chunks, and you get 
my point. Or at least, the logic that compels one to conclude that the 
murder of 40 million African Americans is justifiable should somehow make 
one take those notions with a grain of salt.

Intel or National Semiconductor doesn't and never did exist in a vacuum. 
They were started by great engineers and physicsts that were educated in 
places like Stanford, or that worked in Bell Labs. And this isn't an 
argument for tax-and-spend 'statism' per se, but simply that there's a 
social/political/economic environment that can't be diced and sliced. You'd 
dice and slice an African American population, but then again it's from 
these inner cities that much of popular American culture has arisen (ie, 
between pro sports, various forms of music and so on...). Who knows the 
impact these people have had in terms of providing 'content' for the chips 
and TV screens and so on.

Am I therefore arguing that this justifies US tax policies? Hell no. I might 
bother trying if I thought $$$-towards-blacks amounted to anything more than 
mere mollification and storage. (Hell, my household probably pays more than 
the whole rest of the Cypherpunks list in annual taxes...including May, I'd 
bet.)

No, blacks aren't the enemy. I'm not even convinced that the basic notion of 
the "state" is the enemy. But those who currently adminster the state and 
utilize it for various ends have morphed themselves, and (most likely) the 
American State into the defacto enemy that billions of people throughout the 
world are starting to resent. For that reason I'd like to cut out the cancer 
that eats my hard-earned resources and utlizes them to benefit a preselected 
few.

PS: Is there any comment that Mr May would like to profer on the issue of 
having been rejected by some hot black tail back in the day? (ie, aside from 
"I'd like to see you are your infant children stripped of epidermis and 
dipped in seasalt")
