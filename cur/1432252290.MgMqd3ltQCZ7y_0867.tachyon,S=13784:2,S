     NOSEND="1"></TD>           <TD width="61%">How does this sound? Your
bank borrows your money at              3% and uses that money to purchase
tax lien certificates at 24%.              That is a spread of 21% or
$2100.00 per ten thousand dollars that is              invested. In short,
you get $300.00 and they get $2100.00 profit per              ten thousand
dollars. That is a profit to the bank of over 700% on              your
money. What a great way for the rich banks to get richer. Up             
until now, this was a secret known only to a select         
few.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>       <P>So what is this product? And why
is it such a lucrative investment        vehicle? We call it TDP, Tax
Defaulted Paper. It's simple and        straightforward. Local governments
are in the business of running their        government. They have to pay
their government employees, police, fire,        school teachers, pave
the<BR>roads, fix the sewers, run the hospitals and        public
transportation, collect the garbage, etc. The money they use does       
not grow on trees. The money they spend is raised from your local real    
   estate taxes. As we all know not everyone pays their taxes. There are
over        3000 counties across the United States in need of real estate
tax revenue.        When they can't collect they start getting serious
about getting it        collected. This creates a great opportunity for
serious investors in the        know.</P>       <P>Hard to believe this is
true? In just one day, we bought approximately        $80,000 in tax lien
certificates paying 18% and we are currently        researching tens of
thousands of dollars in additional TDP that we are        planning to
purchase.<BR><BR>What kind of owner doesn't pay their taxes        and
what kind of property is this? These properties include everything       
from single-family homes to large commercial properties. For example, we  
     researched a tax lien on a commercial property with a $23,000.00 tax
lien        levied against it. The property was a Walgreen's drug
store!!!</P>       <P>Not only does the investor earn 18% on that money
till Walgreen's pays        off, but, he or she gets a crack at the
underlying real estate worth over        $1,200,000. That's the
possibility of owning real estate for just pennies        on the dollar.
That investor could be you.</P><IMG align=right height=95

NOSEND="1">        <P>Why don't we own it? Someone beat us to it.Timing is
everything and in        this business, time is money. Getting started
tomorrow instead of today,        costs you money. Spending months or even
years trying to learn it        yourself, instead of letting an expert
teach you, costs you money.<BR></P>       <P>This is why our customers buy
our programs. We provide turnkey programs        for the serious
entrepreneur and investor, with advice and guidance on how        to take
full advantage of this high yielding and very profitable industry.       
Without a doubt, this is a multi-billion dollar industry of which the     
  true<BR>potential has not been tapped. Yes, there are other people who  
     know how it works but they can't help you get the job done 
effectively.</P>       <P>On February 21, 2002, we sent one of our
students to his second auction        with one of our regional fund
managers. Jim had obtained a list of        properties and rules of the
sale, just as we taught him. He had gone down        the list, just as we
showed him, and narrowed it down to 16 properties        upon which to
bid. By the end of the day, he had purchased 6 propeties        with our
help. We estimated the market value of the properties he bought        to
be in excess of $400K. That's a profit of $321K -- not a bad day's       
work.<BR><BR><IMG align=left height=121

NOSEND="1">I know that so far it sounds too good to be true. But, it gets 
      even better because investing your money our way is risk free. There
is        virtually no risk of losing your money. Your money is secured by
the        underlying real estate.How does that work? It's simple, you
give the local        government your money for someone's past due
property taxes. Then, when        the property owner pays the back taxes,
the county pays you back your        money plus interest so high you will
be upset that you didn't know how to        do this before you lost all
that money in the stock market. What if the        tax lien is not paid
off? Simple, you get the property. Once again owning        the underlying
real estate for just pennies on the dollar.<BR></P>       <P>Who joins our
programs? They are people from all walks of life with a        burning
desire for something better for themselves and their family. They       
are using our programs as a means to get there.</P>       <P>And now, that
we have added the missing link to the puzzle; we have        made it an
even a more fool-proof program. We have many individuals who        love
the program and all it has to offer but simply do not have the       
capital to execute substantial investment in TDP.</P>       <P><IMG

  capital, we have created a special program. If you join us as a serious
