By default, Android, Thunderbird and Mozilla report your geographic 
location to Google, using gps if available, nearest wifi networks otherwise.

This appears to have enabled google's supercomputer, the planet's most 
powerful AI, to detect that David Petraeus was overnighting where he 
should not.

The official story being that this non standard overnighting raised a 
flag that his equipment might have been stolen, hence the need to report 
to friends of Obama.  Yeah, right.

I wonder if the rape charges against Julian Assange had a similar origin 
- did one of his numerous groupies spontaneously file false rape charges 
on her own initiative on discovering that other people in her circle 
were also having sex with Assange, or was she put up to it by people 
seeking to extradite Julian Assange, who proceeded to track who was 
sharing his bed.

I would expect that Julian Assange would assiduously turn off the 
tracking, but his playmates probably would not.
