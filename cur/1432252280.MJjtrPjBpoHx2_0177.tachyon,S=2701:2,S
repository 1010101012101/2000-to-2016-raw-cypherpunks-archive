Actually, if we ever managed to kill the culture of prohibition,
I suspect that crystal meth would be about as popular is bathtub
gin is today. It's terrible stuff.

I'd expect the big pharmas to start 'recreational drug' wings,
which would bring real research power to the problem of finding
highs which are fun, safe, affordable, and with minimal physical 
addiction.
