Once it works, I'll happily do that, but...

ben@scuzzy:~/tmp/multisign$ ./ringver pubring.pkr < testwhole
ERROR: Bad signature

(Incidentally, this was the procedure I followed in the first place, 
except I manually broke the file into parts, rather than using ringver).

I still suggest sending the relevant file as an attachment, so it 
doesn't get mangled in transit.

I wonder how many people are now convinced I didn't write this code? ;-)

Cheers,

Ben.
