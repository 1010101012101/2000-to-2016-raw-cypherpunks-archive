I've seen you quote this several times.

Since it's a generality ("the literate") and not just a statement about 
your own personal view of prison, I dispute it. I'm literate, but prison 
would indeed be punishment for me. For all of the usual reasons.

Being thrown in a jail cell and having reading material is no substitute 
for liberty.

have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to 
make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive?"
