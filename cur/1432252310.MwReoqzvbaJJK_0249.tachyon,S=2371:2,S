That's all nice and good, but why should it be on cypherpunks?  Where's
the relevance to this list?  Why is Ken, or his addres or helipad an
interest to the cypherpunks?  Why is PG&E's monopolistic's actions against
him relevant to the topics of this list?

What's next?  The Cypherpunk Equirer?

IMHO, neither he, nor the Streisand creature have any relevance here -
there perhaps was some relevance in terms of that lawsuit the bitch
started, but, who gives a shit who your neighbors are?

Should I start spamming this list with details about my neighbors?
