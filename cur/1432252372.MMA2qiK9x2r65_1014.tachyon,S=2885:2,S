If you want to have "enormous influence" on policy, you'd be well advised
to spend your time flirting with a member of the appropriate sex in
the administration, or perhaps the Senate leadership, offering the
appropriate sexual favors, then vie for a position as a policy aide
somewhere. A law degree will be a big help.

Not entirely joking,
