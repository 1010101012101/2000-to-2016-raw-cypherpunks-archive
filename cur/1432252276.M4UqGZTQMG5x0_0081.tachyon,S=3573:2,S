Price discovery is hard, and reputation systems are hard.

Nonetheless, we need price discovery, and we need reputation systems.  I

with a solution to a problem that no one has yet adequately solved.

I would say Mojo drowned of insufficient ambition, rather than excessive 
ambition.

Xanadu failed of excessive ambition
