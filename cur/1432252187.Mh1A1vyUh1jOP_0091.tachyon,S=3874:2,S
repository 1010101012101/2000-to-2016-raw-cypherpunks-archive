Consistency with last time.

Whats wrong with PGP sigs is that going on 9 full years after I
generated my first pgp key, my mom still can't use the stuff.

Sure, you and I can use PGP, but by and large, people don't bother.
So lets look at a technology that's getting accepted, and improve it
slowly.
