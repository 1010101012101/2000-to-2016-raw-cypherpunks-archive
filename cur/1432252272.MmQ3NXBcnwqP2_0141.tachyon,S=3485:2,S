I found this incredible service called HOSTING MATTERS.

Hosting Matters is a fantastic way to host adult and bulk email-friendly sites with NO WORRIES about getting shut down as they are only out to try and make money. The service is VERY CHEAP and I reccomend it for the following types of sites:

- Bulk emailing
- Adult content & services
- Controversial/Hate sites

As far as I know, they have NEVER shut down above-mentioned types of sites!
