I'm glad someone else knows of him.  He's actually relevent to this
list, viz.:
There exists a "King Crimson collector's club" wherein, for $$ up front,
you
receive CDs in the future which are put together from concert tapes,
which he judges to be
not worth releasing otherwise.  (Some have *awful* audio quality but of
interest
to fans, some are as high quality as modern studio work but are live
performances.)
This is different from the Foobar Record Club where the albums already
exist.  The KCCC is based entirely on reputation.

He also leaves the copyrights with the artists, rather than publishers,
and has written several rants on this :-)
"Contrary to common practice within the music and record industry, both
artists own
the copyright in their work. " in his own words.  (Albeit this is a mere
biz model choice,
and all are free to implement their own policies, although RF frames it
morally.)
