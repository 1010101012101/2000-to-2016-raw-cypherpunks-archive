I have noticed CloudFlare CAPTCHA screens before I can access some sites =
via Tor. This begs the question of how much data is CloudFlare gathering =
from Tor exit nodes and who are they selling it to? Due to links with =
the US Intelligence community and possibly receiving NSLs, they are in a =
great position to provide information about what people use Tor for. =
Perhaps thwarting spammers is a great cover for keeping track of traffic =
to and from alleged terrorist IPs/Net blocks. Since they also help =
mitigate DDoS attacks, they can also keep track of alleged Anonymous =
pwned hosts used for originating DDoS campaigns.=20

They are a great =93in the trenches=94 company that can be very =
versatile for keeping track of the Bad Guys(tm).

Thank you,
Scott
