Hi.  The last couple days I've gotten a lot of mail bounces from cpunks
subscribers who are blocking lne.com because it's on the osirusoft spam
"blacklist".  There is no way to get off this list; in fact the site
appears to be down.  Lne.com doesn't send spam; I don't know why we are on
this list.  My guess is that it's becase we're listed on a couple other
"extreme" blacklists that blacklist entire networks that are owned by
ISPs that the list operator does not like.

If you or your ISP uses this blacklist, I have no choice but to drop
you from the lne cdr lest my mailbox drown in reject messages.

I have mixed feelings about blacklists-- I've had to implement one
here so we didn't drown in spam and it seems to work reasonably well.
But lists that 1) don't let you get off and 2) list sites to pressure
them to change ISPs don't get much respect from me, and neither do the
ISPs that blindly use them.

Eric
