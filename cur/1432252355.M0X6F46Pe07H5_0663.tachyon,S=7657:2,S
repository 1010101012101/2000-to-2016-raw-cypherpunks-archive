 Examples of well written subpoenas
 Child Pornography
 Available Information
 The Security Technical Analyst Team

Botched userids - they were
probably forged anyway. Please provide address, phone number, billing
information, and connection records for the
userid john a peterson @u s west. net for 7/ 23
- 7/ 30/ 2000.
 Legitimate userid formats would be:
john. peterson@ uswest. net or
john_ peterson@ uswest. net.

information, and connection records for the
userid h@ ckez 133 @u s west. net for
8/ 19/ 2000. Can not have two @ symbols in an

Occasionally it makes sense to issue a
subpoena with a userid as evidence.
 Please provide connection records and caller- id
for the userid larryboy@ qwest. net for 12: 01
a. m. on 9/ 17/ 2000 through 11: 59 p. m. on
9/ 17/ 2000 MDT.
 The criminals had stolen a car that contained
computer equipment and used one of the laptops
to connect to the Internet. The police were
looking for the caller- id of the accounts
connections on 9/ 17.
Stolen car with a laptop in it.

Send me everything for the last
millenium.
 Please provide all subscriber information from
1995 through the present for IP address
216. xxx. xx. 227; also referred to as

kitchen sink. Please provide all subscriber information for
candigirl, including, but not limited to, true
name, date of birth, SSN, address, all phone
numbers, credit card numbers, connection logs,
e- mails, chat sessions, web sites visited, and
connections to other ISPs.
 We have the customers account information but
not everything theyve ever done on the Internet.

Send me the kitchen sink too!
Preservation of Evidence Request
This letter is to request that Qwest Communications

and any other evidence in its possession pending the
issuance of a court order or other legal process in
regard to all telephone and Internet conference

8 pm through 4 am Pacific Standard Time (PST). This
request also covers preservation of all records,
including call details, for the Qwest connection
telephone number (111) 222- 9999 during the above
period of time.

Typo the IP address and we can
start an international
investigation!
 The IP address 63.14.69.108 is for a qwest. net
connection.
 The IP address 63.147.69.108 trace routes
through a uu. net connection.
 The IP address 163.14.69.108 trace routes
through an att. net connection.
 The IP address 263.14.69.108 does not exist.
No IP numbers go over 255.

A very well written subpoena.
information about the subscriber to IP address
216.161.69. xxx, account holders name, address,
phone number, and connection records for this
ISP account. The intrusion occurred on Sat. 12
Aug. 2000 at 22: 54: 59 hrs. to Sat. 12 Aug.

I dont have to play guessing games with
any of this data.

Another good subpoena.
Please provide all available account information
for IP address 63.1xx. 69. xxx on 8/ 16/ 2000 from
11: 56 a. m. to 12: 18 p. m. MST including any
and all screen names and E- mail addresses along
with telephone numbers of the account holder,
any caller ID information maintained for any
connection made from this account including
true names and addresses.

but I can provide the rest of the data.
