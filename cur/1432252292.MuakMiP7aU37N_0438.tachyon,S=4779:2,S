Like we have "rule of law" now, with Shrub telling us to pass laws he
wants, or have them installed anyway via executive order.

I've long wavered over whether to fight these things or encourage them, as
the encouraging may prove to be the more useful (i.e., be sufficiently
infuriating to wake some sheeple up).  I think Shrub and Friends have
provided the perfect vehicle to help us return the US to it's
*Constitutional* roots.  We just give them *everything* they ask for, then
sit back and see how long it takes for some "recently awoken" to provide a
little high velocity lead poisoning party - bringing his beer-gut buddies
of course (revolution wouldn't be any fun without beer and bullets,
right?).

Long live the Reich!  Hail <murmur>whoeverthefuck</murmer>!

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
