Hmmm.  It seems unfair to slap a huge tax on something if there 
are *laws* in place requiring people to have and use it.  I'm 
thinking specifically of clothes, since you mentioned them.  Is 
clothing particularly heavily taxed?

In the presence of laws against public nudity, that would be 
roughly equivalent to a "head tax"...  

Since there are no laws requiring people to use gasoline/petrol, 
taxing it seems more fair to me - it at least presents people 
with a choice so they can pay up front (for an EV) or during
the vehicle's lifetime (for taxes).  Or if they are smart and 
fortune smiles upon them they can arrange their lives so they 
don't need cars.
