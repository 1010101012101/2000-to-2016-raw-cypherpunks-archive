At some point you draw a line for yourself. All tech you make can and will
be used in murders, directly or indirectly. If you think denying
a monetary gift as a sacrifice to try and prevent people-killing-research
from maybe happening, you're taking quite an indirect turn to preventing
the inevitable. Werner likely chose to accept the generous offer to have
him build awesome rocket engines, worst he could do is help his country. We
don't blame Turing for his work even though it helps millions of
computer-guided missiles even today.

I'm saying it's okay to develop something you really want to build. Doing
so when you know it'll help in anything unethical, more so than it will
anything ethical, you don't. You can neither stop DARPA from developing
weapons, some really believe what they do is for the good of all, nor can
you prevent progress. Stop trying. Don't do anything unethical. Convince
others to feel about it the same way you do.

Atom bombs really did inspire so much awe and horror that we're closer to
world peace than we ever were. It's always just the way you look at things.

TL;DR: offers to give you money for free, don't be an idiot. Just be sure
it's really free.
