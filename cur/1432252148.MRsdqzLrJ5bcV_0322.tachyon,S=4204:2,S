Remailers aren't for falsifying email transmission information -
they're for concealing and deleting that information.
You're not pretending that your mail originates at foo.remailer.net,
you're just not telling anybody how it got there.
Even a nymserver doesn't do that - joepseudonym@foo.nymserver.net
isn't claiming to really live inside that mail server,
just to have an address on that server.
The features in Netscape and Eudora that let you pick your From: info
might count, and of course Fakemail and similar programs definitely would.

A more interesting issue is how this applies to AOL screen names,
and also how involved AOL was in the creation of the law,
since they're largely a Virginia-based company.
