Cypherpunk:
While I respect your forthrightness you are unfortunately wrong. Read the 
chapters on Randon Mumber generation from "Numerical Recipes in C" and you 
get just a small glimpse of how sticky the issue is, particularly when it 
comes to computers (which are innately non-random, by the way).

As a very simple example, imagine that after 10 billion digits we found that 
the "average" value was actually 5.000000001. This would make it, in your 
book, not random at all, but I suspect that for almost many uses it would be 
random enough.

And then, imagine that the cumulative average of the digits of pi oscillated 
around 5 (to one part in a zillion) with a period of 100 Billion...is this 
random enough for you?

Let us remember, of course, that the digits of "pi" are not random 
whatsoever: they are the digits of pi! "Random is in the eye of the 
beholder."

I was hoping Cordian would grumpily reply...he's a number theorist or 
something.
