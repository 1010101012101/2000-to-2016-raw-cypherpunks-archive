Put the crack pipe down, Michael.

Colonial empires need fatherland security when the conquered start
sending feedback.   Moral states bordered by Mexico, Canada and oceans
don't even need a standing army a tenth of the size of the US's at any
point
in the last 100 years.

And strict libertarians do accept taxation for police & defense, little
else.
Not progressively increasing taxes, not punitive taxes, but the (only)
legit function of government is protecting against coercion (incl. fraud

& pollution).  Some (currently small) fraction of police work / law
actually does this.
