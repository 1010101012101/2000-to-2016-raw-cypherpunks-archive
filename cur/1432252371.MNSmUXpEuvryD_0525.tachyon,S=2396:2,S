Cypherpunks should be the last place to disclose a protection
methodology except, perhaps, only perhaps, as a ploy to deceive.

Recall repeated warnings here to never disclose in a public
forum an ultimate protection scheme. Spread copious FUD,
hope it sticks. Could be that is what this thread is about.

It might be impossible to have anonymity and reputation outside
your skull and even the brain has evolved its separate agenda to
survive the body's fuck-ups. That is why mind was invented,
to escape into corporeal nothingness.

Can mind win over matter, hard to prove, but proof is a mind's
ploy to assure victory, and triumphy serves as an intoxicating
possibility.

Consider like those drunk on moneygrubbing that wealth is
what mind has invented to buy avoidance of pain and suffering
by overloading that on the unwealthy condemned to servitude.

The wealthy are condemned to try to hide their resources and
insist on more privacy for them and less for others.

Governments have learned that rewarding lesson: secrecy
above all for it but not for the taxpayers. Yes, there are
rewards for reporting to secretkeepers what is revealed here.
