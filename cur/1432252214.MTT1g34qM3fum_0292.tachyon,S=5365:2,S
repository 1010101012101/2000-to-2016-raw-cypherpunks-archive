Police fear anarchist attack on Queen's Jubilee
By Jenny Booth and David Bamber
(Filed: 30/12/2001)
The Torygraph (UK)
SPECIAL Branch detectives are investigating anarchist plans
for the violent disruption of the thanksgiving service at St
Paul's Cathedral attended by the Queen to celebrate her
Golden Jubilee next year.
Hundreds of activists from the Movement Against the Monarchy
(Ma'm) and other radical groups intend to target the service
on June 4, which is the focal point of four days of official
jubilee celebrations.
They plan a big demonstration outside the cathedral, which
police fear will turn violent. On a website for members,
"Ma'm" says: "The 'thanksgiving' service at St Paul's will
have laughing gas pumped through the air vents, and machine
gun bullets playing on a hidden loudspeaker system and on
our ghetto blasters."
One Special Branch officer said: "We have seen in Britain
that anarchists are capable of mounting mass violent
confrontations. Last May, they almost brought the centre of
London to a standstill with their anti-capitalist protests
on Oxford Street.
"A demonstration of similar ferocity in a smaller place has
the capacity to wreak far greater damage and endanger life."
The anarchist group also plans to set up a guillotine
outside for effigies of the Royal Family.
"Ma'm" has threatened to disrupt the Queen's three-month
tour of the country next summer with regional protests and
to hold anti-royal street parties on June 3, the day
designated for local celebrations of the jubilee.
It claims that its actions are revenge for official attempts
to clamp down on Mayday demonstrations. Republic, another
anti-monarchist group, has declared June 4 as Republic Day
and is encouraging members to organise demonstrations.
Special Branch officers based at New Scotland Yard have been
closely monitoring "Ma'm" and several other anarchist groups
in Britain and abroad, which they suspect of intending to
disrupt the royal celebrations.
Detectives from the anti-terrorist squad believe that the
greatest threat to the Royal Family will come at a series of
regional walkabouts which are being publicised on the "Ma'm"
site.
The police are determined to thwart any violent protests by
careful intelligence gathering. The royal schedule will
remain flexible and any hint of trouble will be taken into
account. But one day that cannot be cancelled is the service
of thanksgiving.
A "Ma'm" spokesman in east London denied that the group was
planning mass action but said: "We might have one or two
little stunts here and there."
And in further laughing gas news,an entire ward of midwifes are under a 
cloud of suspicion for enjoying nitrous oxide parties at woolongong 
hospital,NSW.Prince charlie big ears had a starters pistol fired at him 
once in Sydney and an egg thrown at him (by yours truly) in Melb.His 
demented dad copped a tomato in tassie and PM keating once grabbed the 
royal elbow.The fag ends of the aristocracy are always welcome down under.M.A.M.
