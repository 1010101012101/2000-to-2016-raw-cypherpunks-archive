What?
These spies have sacrificed their everything for YOU, My Young. Sure they've 
lied numerous times, subverted foriegn governments, framed dissidents, 
assasinated people while making it look like a heart attack or other natural 
cause, rendered and tortured foreign threats, overturned elections and 
gotten the democratically elected tossed out...
And all of it for YOU and for the sake of freedom everywhere.
Think about how much that very pretty and photogenic Valerie Plame has 
suffered all over the world, protecting your freedom in the furthest parts 
of the Globe. And what thanks does she get? She get's outed, cover blown, 
and all she wanted to do was her job, for YOU. Forgive me for getting a 
little worked up here, my eyes are getting misty...
