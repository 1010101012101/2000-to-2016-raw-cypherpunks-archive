The attachment NIEGPINI.EXE from Sender: owner-cypherpunks@EINSTEIN.ssz.com 
(didn't someone just say SSZ is open relay?) is infected with the 
Win-CIH virus (hope you had anti-virus software).

Win-CIH is particularly nasty in that you don't have to run an 
infected .EXE to catch it. Browsing a folder in windows explorer will 
look inside the infected .EXE for an icon to display, which is enough 
to start the viral code. Full Outlook (no experience with Express) 
calls up such icons (barf!)

List members should be aware of this new attack on the CDR. 

The infected program is also in both archives. Do they want to know 
or have they abdicated responsibility for the contents of the archives?


Anonymous Whistleblower.
