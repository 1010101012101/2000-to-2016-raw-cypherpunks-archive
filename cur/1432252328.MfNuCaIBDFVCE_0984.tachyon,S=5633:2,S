Wrong. Having russian background I guess I have more clear understanding
what these guys are trying to say: The government is definetely
ineffective in protecting its citizen, providing the social wealthfare
to them and such, but on the other hand the government corruption, deep
involvement with crimilal circles and udertable deals with big foreign
corporations bring the country into the situation when the rulling top
of the country is having/sharing a huge amount (can't bring any number) of
all the profits, while the rest of population (especially pensioners in
russia (people of age of 50 and above, who are brought up in
post-socialist environment and are totally incapable to adopt to new
environment)) are thrown and maintained in poverty.

not all are vodka drinking idiots. but your statement makes sense. :-)
What's worse, is that it's been observed in some country side areas,
when one guy is managing to do good on his land, the others get jealous
or something, and his house could get burnt eventually with no reason..
happened a few times a few years ago.

Come on. Keep in mind that this statement was written by 'a party of
pensioners'. Which means by people in age of 50 and above with strong
socialist background. They are trying to find a solution to the problem,
the only problem here, is that they still apply old patterns to it.

Union? Which Union? I doubt russia is welcomed to European Union (update
me if I am wrong) and there's no former Soviet Union either. More over
the Union of Idependent Countries, seems to be getting gone piece by
piece, at least now you need to proper visa if you want to visit Russia
from one of the 'former' republics.

Quality is usually good. ;-) (you can use a pocket radio to hitch nails
f.e. ;-)) Design is scarey, but that's a postsequence of post-socialism
way of working. Noone cares if something looks good as long as it is
practical ;-)

whatever.. hope my comments are helpful ;-)
