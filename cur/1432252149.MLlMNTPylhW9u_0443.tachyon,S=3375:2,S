Well, still ruminating...

The kind of regulations that regulatory bodies have made in the past are in 
their nature different from these secret rules I still believe. This is of 
course aside from their secret nature.

Previously, if a regulatory body such as the FCC enacted some kind of 
policy, they could fine companies that did not comply. From my naive 
perspective, I didn't view these regs as really having a direct impact on 
private citizen units/individuals, apart from their organization, but then 
again I could probably think of exceptions.

Hum. I wonder. Do you think these secret regulations are communicated via 
secure channels? What would happen if someone decided to send their own 
regulations out to all of the local airline security offices rescinding any 
private regs, particularly if one used official-looking letterhead?
