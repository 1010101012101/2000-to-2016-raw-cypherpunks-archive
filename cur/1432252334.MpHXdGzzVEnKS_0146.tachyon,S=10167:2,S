"We have taken a real national
resource, our youth, and trained them to act as mindless droids, devoid of
even the minimum reasoning powers possessed by small insects, and I am,
inexplicably, astounded."

Hence the photo on the first page of today's NY Times.

>Submitted for your inevitable nodding of heads, and grumbling of "well, of

>Breakfast was kind of cool actually - thanks for asking.  We trotted off to
>the local Ameristar casino's Open Trough, er, "Buffet".  The food was
>universally overcooked, sometimes to the point of knife-resistance, but the
>great dessert bar more than made up for it.  And it's relatively
>inexpensive.  Recommended for when lots of food at a low price is all you
>care about.  Not recommended for impressing anyone with your gastronomic

>After breakfast however, we decided to spend some time, and likely the

>I've been to *this* casino, but it's nowhere *near* my first time in *any*
>casino.  This is far, far, FAR from the norms I'm used to.

>Like good little state-sponsored-units, we stood in line for a few minutes,

>I'm getting ready for the SWAT team to make their entrance at this point.

>"Sir, Where's your Amerstar Winners Card"?
>"Huh?"
>"Don't you have a Winners Card?"
>"I don't do loyalty cards. Thank you for thinking of me though."
>"Sir, you can't get in without a Winners Card"
>
>So much for a day at the casino.  Thank you Ameristar!  You saved me about
>$300.00 today.
>
>For those of you who are wondering, yes, you need detailed ID to get one of

>standing in line, it looks like they track you table by table with these

>So, being $300.00 richer, and having worked for over two weeks without a
>break, *and* being 250 miles over my oil-change limit, I figured, aw, you
>know what I figured!
>
>Now, let me start off with some background here.  I've gone to the same
>mechanic for almost 6 years now - for tires, oil, you name it.  The only
>thing he doesn't get is the brakes, and then only cause my Subaru has some
>kind of brakes-from-hell that even he says can't be serviced safely without

>This mechanic, who runs the shop for the local Dobb's chain, is great.  
>Never

>likes
>me or not, he just takes the money, and gets my business.  And he gets a
>*lot* of it.  His business is thriving, and he recently added 4 new bays to
>his shop, and started taking Sundays off - hence, my problem.
>
>So, we took the scenic route home, figuring there would have to be a
>oilchange shop somewhere along the way.  And there were several.  The first
>two were closed, but finally, we found a JiffyLube open and waiting.  With

>*need* the damn oil change, so in we go.
>
>"Good Afternoon Sir.  What can we help you with today?"
>"Hi. Oil change please.  Synthetic blend please.  No extras, just an oil
>change"
>"Sure, leave the keys in the car, and step over to the counter, and John 
>will
>be right with you".
>
>When I got out of the car, the kid who was going to do the actual work 
>wanted
>to know if I had a loyalty card he could punch/swipe/whatever.  Nope.
>
>"Well sir, just give me your name and address, and I'll get you a card".
>"Thanks, but I don't want a card."
>"They're absolutely free sir!"
>"I know.  Thanks, but I don't want a card"
>"I can't change your oil without a card"
>"You're kidding.  Aren't you?"
>"Sir, I need a card."
>"John Smith.  123 Anywhere Street.  Anycity, Arkasas.  12345".

>
>"314-555-1234"
>
>"Thank you sir.  If you care to have a seat in the waiting room, we'll call

>
>Into the waiting room we go.  With the little 8 inch TV mounted 12 feet in
>the air, where nobody can actually see it, even though we have to listen to

>we were waiting.  Thank god I threw out the television in '90.
>
>Finally, a guy comes out from the shop.
>
>"Sir, if you'll follow me, we can go over your car for a minute."
>
>This is the upsell - I can just see it coming.  Wipers?  Air filter?
>
>We walk over to a monitor sitting in this big red box made up to look like 
>a

>sporting some pretty pictures of the products this guy is trying to talk 
>you
>into buying.
>
>"Sir, would you like some engine cleaner?  You should have it once a year."
>"No, I just want the oil change.  no wipers.  No engine cleaners.  Nothing
>but an oil change"
>"Sir.  I'm just doing my job - I have to ask you all these questions, since 
>I
>can't check you out and close out your ticket without asking."
>
>Yes, he is an automaton.  He just can't take a blanket "no" and punch that
>into each request, so we went down the whole list of radiator flushes,
>transmission fluid checks and replacements, hoses, filters, etc.  Finally,
>*thankfully*, we're done: he tells me I can go to the register to pay.
>
>"Sir.  The total comes to $46.00".  As he says this, he notices that the
>screen hasn't filled in my name, address, etc., from the swipe of the 
>loyalty
>card.
>"Sir, I need your last name."
>"Terranson."
>"Your first name?"
>"Whatever makes you happy.  Pick one."
>
>He looks lost.  So lost.
>
>"John?"
>"That's a nice name.  Use it."
>"Address?"
>"123 Anywhere St."
>He dutifully types it in...
>"City?"
>"Pick one."
>
>We wait.  He looks at me waiting, looking even more lost and

>"New Caledonia."
>"State?"
