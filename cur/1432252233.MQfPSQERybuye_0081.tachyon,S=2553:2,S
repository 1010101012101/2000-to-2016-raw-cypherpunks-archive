Actually Nomen misprepresents. Lots of people complain about Tim. that
doesn't justify them in actually doing anything about stopping him from
spewing. As much as I find is dribble dribble I'd be one of the first to
stand up to stop anyone from limiting his access to the list or his
expression of ideas irrespective of his word choice. This is one of the
reasons that SSZ remains one of the few completely unmoderated nodes left
on the CDR (Hi Igor you fascist fucking pig).

Fuck that noise.
