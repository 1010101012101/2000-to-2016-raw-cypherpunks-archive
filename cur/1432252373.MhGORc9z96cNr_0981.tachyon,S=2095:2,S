It's also known as a "wiretap insertion point"...

"Practical" implies that there's a crossover point between
cost and benefit and that implementation is on the "benefit" side.

Implementation may now be possible, and the costs may be lower
than their previous infinite value, but the main benefits I see are
public relations hype to impress the rubes and protect against
zero-day exploits against Diffie-Hellman or Cisco IOS.
But you could protect against the Cisco exploits just as easily
with a conventional-key encryption hardware box,
and you wouldn't need contiguous fiber.
