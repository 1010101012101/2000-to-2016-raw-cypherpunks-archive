David,

	You still don't get it. 'Read my book' is not a valid move in a debate. If
you were to stand up in front of the Oxford Union and say 'my book proves
the case entirely' then sat down with no further elaboration you lose the
debate.

	You introduced the motion, you try to defend it. Nothing in any of the
references I have followed advances your claim in my view. Moreover since
you have not addressed my counter thesis or any of the specific objections
raised so far I don't see how raising further factual points would advance
the argument.

	At the moment the debate has moved onto what could be quite an interesting
digression on the counter-strategies employed to avoid lock-in.

	My principal objection however, as with Andrew is your apparent belief that
those who attempt to influence public policy do not have to justify their
theories to the public. Restating your conclusions does not constitute a
justification of them.

		Phill
