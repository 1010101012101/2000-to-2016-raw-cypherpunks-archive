Hi,

Based on conversations and ideas due to Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir, I've
prepared a manuscript proposing some of the parameter and algorithm choices
for an actual implementation of their Micromint scheme.

The manuscript is still more of a preliminary design spec as many issues
associated with a Micromint implementation are not addressed (though a good
number of the issues are).

The manuscript was prepared with the sponsorship of the Internet Bearer
Underwriting Corporation (http://www.ibuc.com).

It is available at:

http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~zulfikar/papers/mm-spec-outline.pdf

and a pointer to it can be found from:

http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~zulfikar/MyResearch/homepage.html

Comments and criticisms are welcome.

Thanks,
--
