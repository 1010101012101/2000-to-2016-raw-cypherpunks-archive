"cypherpunks is an "unprecedented, according to law enforcement sources, 
alliance of left and right extremist hate groups." Declans:
Left wing,right wing,same bird.Watch for claws and droppings.While trad 
anarchists had a bad run with the left authoritarians theres zero evidence 
of them running into the arms of the right.Its interesting how many 
libertarians have outed themselves as facists recently.From my distance an 
alliance of city communes and country militia seems the best shot you have 
to overthrow the totalitarian coup.This could mean an exchange of hostages 
and some basic rules on the inevitable incidents.Theres a lot to learn from 
the collapse of communist totalitarianism,the coup should be discredited 
quite soon.Like jim said it doesnt have to be 'wild in the streets'.South 
africa and east germany were 2 of the most fantasticly bad regimes on 
earth,yet they fell,as will this one.Keep cool,minimise violence and set 
limits.LETS ROCK and ROLL!

"Anarchy is not some fanciful idea, something for philosophers and mystics 
to ponder. Anarchy only has meaning when it is lived."
