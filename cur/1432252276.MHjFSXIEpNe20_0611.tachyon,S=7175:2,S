Someone comes to me and says: "the Internet is a tree".  Then he points me
at a graph of inter-AS (Autonomous System) connections to illustrate his
point.  That graph includes all of those seemingly redundant connections
that make it _not_ a tree.  These seemingly redundant connections are in
fact a high proportion of all connections.  That is to say, the graph is
accurate and his statement wasn't.

You can see the Internet in many ways.  You can run a single traceroute
and see it as a line.  You can ping broadcast on your LAN and see it as a
chorus line.

If you understand what you are looking at, you can run traceroutes and see
stable rings: hot potato routing at work, where the packets go out one way
and come back another.

Then again, I have spoken to hundreds? thousands? of people who think that
the Internet _is_ the World Wide Web.

You don't understand and you are quite wrong.

If one AS has more than one link to another AS, there are often very good
reasons for it, and both links are used.  If network A peers with network
B in both Paris and New York, both will generally dump traffic for the
other network at the nearest connection. Why?  Well, on the one hand,
there is no reason to carry packets originating in Paris and destined for
a host in Paris all the way to New York.  On the other hand, many or most
networks employ hot potato routing, meaning that if network A picks up a
packet for network B in Paris, it dumps it on network B as soon as it can,
to minimize costs, wherever the destination might be.  Some networks,
concerned with quality of service, adopt the opposite strategy, and carry
packets as far as possible within their own network.

I don't think that you have any evidence for this assertion about what
characterizes 'most' backup agreements.  I do know that most networks
regard this sort of statistical information as highly confidential.

The world is more complicated than this.  Much more.

There are tens of thousands of machines on the Internet that don't have
a default gateway.

Machines that participate in backbone routing have multiple connections
and aren't the root of a tree in any normal sense of the word.  There is
no parent-child relationship between such routers: they are peers.
These peers participate in a highly complex graph which dances
continuously.  The result is that routing has a large stochastic
component: if you can understand what you are looking at, you often see
traceroutes involving packets jumping sometimes one way, sometimes
another.

To make things even more difficult to understand, an increasing amount of
traffic flows through MPLS tunnels, which are invisible to traceroutes.

This just isn't true.  Hot potato routing is the most easily understood
example: traffic goes out one way and back another.  It does this because
the ASs involved have set their policy that way.

Backbone routers have lots of knobs to configure traffic flow.  Some of
these allow you to throttle it, some allow you to split flows according to
traffic type, some allow to to split flows statistically, some allow you
to drop packets statistically.  And some allow you to ignore pings and
traceroutes ;-)

Sorry.  I have spent too many long hours probing the Internet from
single hosts to accept this.  If you understand what you are looking
at, you see something much more complicated than a tree.

There are different types of trees.  Most discussions of 'trees' are
about rooted trees, which are directed acyclic graphs with one and only
one root.  However, all trees are acyclic.  The Internet isn't.

Of course, most of this discussion revolves around one word: "is". If you
said "the Internet _can be seen_ as a tree", few would disagree with you,
especially if you allowed for the fact that that tree is continuously
changing its shape.  But "the Internet _is_ a tree"?  That's simply an
error.
