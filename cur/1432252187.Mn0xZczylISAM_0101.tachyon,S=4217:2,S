Contact our legislators before it's too late?

What, and deprive us of targets of opportunity?

As far as I'm concerned, and I think the Law supports me in this, if 
I happen to find someone skulking around in my house I can blow them 
away at will.

Besides, if the police and narcs take to sneaking into folks' homes 
at night, without a warrant, then obviously their hives deserve to be 
mcveighed. Even if they've installed some rugrats as human shields. 
Eggs breaking and all that.

Nothing surprises me anymore. They all need killing. Tens of 
thousands of them at the very least.
