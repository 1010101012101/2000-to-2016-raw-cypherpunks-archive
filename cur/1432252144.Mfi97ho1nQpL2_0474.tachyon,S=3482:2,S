Eh...for email you may have a point, but I'm not 100% convinced. In other 
words, say they want to monitor your email account. Do you really believe 
they are going to tap all major nodes and then filter all the traffic just 
to get your email? This is that whole, "The TLAs are infinitely powerful so 
you might as well do nothing" philosophy. And even though I might be willing 
to concede that they get all that traffic, one hand doesn't always talk to 
the other. there may be smaller branches on fishing trips accessing your 
email if they want. if one were able to monitor the email account for 
access, you'll at least force your TLA phisher into going through proper 
internal channels. He might actually get a "no", depending on the cost vs 
risk.

Look..."they" aren't some super-Orwellian hyperorganized hive-mind. They're 
a big, fat bureaucracy full of big, fat bureaucrats. That's why they don't 
get real jobs!

Look...a little tiny yap yap dog can often scare off a bigger dog or animal 
by making it clear that any interaction's going to suck. This isn't because 
the big dog couldn't ultimately kill the little dog, but because the big dog 
will realize it's just not worth it.
