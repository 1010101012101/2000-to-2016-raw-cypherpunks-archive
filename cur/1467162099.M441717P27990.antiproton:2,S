So, it seems that, maybe, perhaps, Litvinenko wasn't directly
assassinated by the FSB (or whatever the Russian security service
calls itself these days...). I mean, maybe he wasn't, but who gives
a fuck?

Even if the polonium didn't originate in Russia (I think they were
able to pin-point which reactor it came out of, but setting that
aside..), I still can't understand cheerleading for ANY of the major
nation-states out there... they are all some twist on the same
corrupt, nepotic, oligarchic/plutocratic template.  Even if Putin
is the fucking hero of the world (because he didnt kill Litvinenko,
makes good speeches, doesn't take bribes), there's still all sorts of
absurd shit going on in that country and in EVERY OTHER country in=20
the world.

Do you really think Putin wants to destroy American hegemony
without utterly replacing it?
