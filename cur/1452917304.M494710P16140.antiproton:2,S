Excerpts from the Kindle edition, description from Amazon.com.

In =E2=80=9CHow to Get Away with Murder in America,=E2=80=9D Evan Wright re=
veals the story
of Enrique =E2=80=9CRicky=E2=80=9D Prado, an alleged killer for a major Mia=
mi drug
trafficker who was recruited into the CIA. Despite a grand jury subpoena
and a mountain of evidence unearthed by a federal task force, Prado was
promoted into the agency=E2=80=99s highest echelons and charged with implem=
enting
some of the country=E2=80=99s most sensitive post-9/11 counterterrorist ope=
rations,
including the agency=E2=80=99s secret =E2=80=9Ctargeted assassination unit.=
=E2=80=9D All while
staying in close touch with his cocaine-trafficking boss and, evidence
suggests, taking part in additional killings for him.

After Prado retired in 2004 at the rank of SIS-2=E2=80=94the CIA equivalent=
 of a
two-star general=E2=80=94he moved to a senior position at Blackwater, the p=
rivate
military contractor, where he continued to run the same, now-outsourced
=E2=80=9Cdeath squad.=E2=80=9D Contrary to government assurances that it wa=
s never actually
activated, Wright reveals testimony from one of the Blackwater assassins
that Prado=E2=80=99s unit was indeed carrying out assigned killings. As a f=
ormer
military intelligence officer told Wright in 2011, =E2=80=9CPrivate contrac=
tors are
whacking people like crazy over in Afghanistan for the CIA.=E2=80=9D

-

Unfortunately, while this book contains many tantalizing seeds it doesn't
provide context for many events. Further muddying the book's account is the
fact that it follows the investigation chronologically, and not the events
being investigated. Additional research is needed to build on what this
book began.
