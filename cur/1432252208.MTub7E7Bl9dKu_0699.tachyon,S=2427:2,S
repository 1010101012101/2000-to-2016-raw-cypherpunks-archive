A new policy takes effect on Sept. 24. PayPal will start fining both the
seller and *the buyer* up to US$500 if pay for uses related to gambling,
adult content or services, and buying or selling prescription drugs from
noncertified sellers.

Which is really interesting given that eBay, PayPal's parent corporation,
has an entire adult category.

I guess PayPal found another way to keep the black ink flowing.
