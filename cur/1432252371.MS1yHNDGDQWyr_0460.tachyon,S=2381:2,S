If cops ask local neighborhood members to report any suspicious 
activity, the folks know that any benefits they gain from acting as 
informants tend to be a lot smaller than the danger of being beat up or 
even killed by the Mafia.

When the cost of acting as an informant is zero, no risk, more people 
act as informants.

I think restoring some risk to being a rat is a good thing.
