Amongst the things I think will work, is an open source Skype style VoIP
+ IM + click to pay system. Reputation can be added to this, but if you
are my buddy and I hear your voice, I will certainly be willing to click
you some money. Major commercial companies will not care for the
anonymity and can identify themselves to accept money.

Usability? Think Skype.

Again, think Skype. Its the best thing out there in the wild that
demonstrates that crypto can be user friendly and invisible.

Unfortunately since its closed source, /I/ certainly won't trust it. And
I don't see why it has to be closed source, an open source equivalent
that provides quality service and charges for it, will work better and
spread faster (make money selling your bandwidth while your computer is
idle).

I think that the time is now finally getting ripe for selling secure
computers into the market. There was zero interest for many years and
Linux was not usable... Ubuntu Linux (including Mozilla FF and
Openoffice.org) has changed this quite a bit.

Mnet looks cool, although I never tried it.
