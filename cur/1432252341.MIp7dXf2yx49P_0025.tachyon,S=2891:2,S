I'm trying to remember details (author, title) of a short story that I
read once.  Its main feature, or the one that's standing out in my
mind, is the obsessive hacker who studies a target to figure out his
password, at which he only has one guess.  The zinger is that the very
security concious target has selected that password as a booby trap,
and there's a second password which our hacker doesn't have.

Does this ring a bell for anyone?

Adam
