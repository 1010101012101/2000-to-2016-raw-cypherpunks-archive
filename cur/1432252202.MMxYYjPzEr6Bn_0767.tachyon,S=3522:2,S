SWISS ISPS MUST LOG AND STORE CONSUMERS' EMAIL DATA
As of April 1, Swiss ISPs will have to keep a log for six
months of all the emails sent by their customers.  Experts
criticize the measure, saying it will be both difficult and
costly to implement.
http://www.statewatch.org/news/2003/apr/01switz.htm

=====
The law was passed in January 2002, and ISPs had until April 1 to implement.

Does anybody know if this only applies to email providers,
or exactly what kinds of email providers,
or if it also requires ISPs who provide IP transport to eavesdrop it?
What about businesses providing email for their employees and other users?
How much of the Swiss email business will be driven out of the country,
either to US email providers or European providers like Wanadoo and Tiscali?

And does anybody know if they have to keep _all_ the spam?
Or is keeping one copy of each enough?
Or can they give their customers _some_ privacy protection by
always giving the authorities all of the spam in addition to
whatever they really wanted?
