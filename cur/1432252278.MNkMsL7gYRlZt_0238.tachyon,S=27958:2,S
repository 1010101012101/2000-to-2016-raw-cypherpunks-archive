Jim, I'm really surprised that you forwarded this spam to the list.
I received it directly also.

While he does have some useful comments about political organizing,
some of what he says about liberal/conservative differences is a pure crock.
We're in the middle of a radically activist right-wing statist 
administration -
they're doing far more than the Reaganites ever accomplished as far as
building up the political power of the military, reducing civil liberties for
citizens as well as non-citizen residents and travelers, strengthening the 
police agencies,
and moving power away from Congress and into the Executive Branch.

And yet this spammer Martin talks about conservatives not being activists.
To the extent that he's talking about the public rather than the
party activists and the elected and appointed officials,
conservatives today are less activist than during the Reagan/Bush 
administration
and the early Clinton administration, but the new Administration
is the most activist we've seen in ages, whether or not they
were actually elected.  One of the technologies for getting
grassroots and astroturf support that both big parties developed extensively
over the 80s/90s is the use of direct mail for fundraising and
generating letters to politicians - the conservatives
and particularly the Religious Right Wing were probably more effective
than the various sets of liberals.  This looks like an attempt to
do similar things on the net.]
