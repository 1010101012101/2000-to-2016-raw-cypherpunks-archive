The SF Bay Guardian, 11/1/00, pg.23, has a big ad for 
Green senatorial candidate Medea Benjamin, paid for by
"Philip H. Wilkie and the Green Party of California"
"Not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee".

Friends, this is _soft_money_, right here in San Francisco,
and it's a good example of the kind of thing many 
campaign finance "reform" proposals would ban -
and why the First Amendment is a better campaign finance law
that the ones we're using today.  

I highly respect Medea - she's strong, principled, and has guts.
She's done a lot of election monitoring around the world.
She needs to learn some reality about economics,
and why economic rights are critical parts of human rights,
but that's the usual Green problem. :-)
I happened to catch the news the other night,
where the bipartisan debate between Dianne Feinstein (boo, hiss!)
and Republican Tom Campbell (who opposes the Drug War)
got upstaged by Medea's protests outside KRON 
(or whichever TV-monopoly station it was).
It was a class act, particularly when she and Campbell
hugged each other after both talking to the crowd.
				Thanks!
