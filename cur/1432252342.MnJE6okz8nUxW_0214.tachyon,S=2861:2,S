I'm not sure the relevance.  Both seem to have originated in areas not
exactly devoid of a variety of common disease vectors.  What's selecting
[HIV and SARS] viruses for ability to jump directly from primary carrier
to humans?  All sorts of insects and rodents in Africa could serve as
vectors, and China's probably even worse since they've largely screwed
up their ecosystem through overpopulation.

It's had thousands, probably tens of thousands of years.  What are the
chances it'll adapt to use a better vector before genetics advances past
the point where nature can compete with technology?  After that, the
only threats will be from biowarfare programs or from greens who think
up schemes like "let's create a tyrannosaur-pterosaur hybrid and release
thousands to see if they'll 'fix' the food chain."
