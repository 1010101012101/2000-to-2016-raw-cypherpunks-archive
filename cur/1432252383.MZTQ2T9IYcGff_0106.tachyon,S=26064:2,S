"In 1968, the New Jersey Senate decreed the town of Franklin a geological
wonder: "The Fluorescent Mineral Capital of the World." Over 350 different
minerals have been found in the area, ninety of which glow brilliantly
under ultraviolet light. There are two mineral museums devoted to
fluorescing rocks, the region's unusual geology and its zinc mining
history."

--- on rings ---

recently mentioned data exchange between electromagnetic ring and symbolic
device...

once visited the Intel Museum which had a gift shop that sold jewelry made
from unusable pentium chips; cufflinks, necklaces, earrings, and presumably
rings (though do not remember seeing them).

Intel CPU Chip Jewelry & Pins
http://www.chipsetc.com/intel-jewelry--pins.html

so any such key-exchange or other interaction between ring and device, in a
data mood ring or other informational approach, is going to have circuitry
built into it, issues of energy and power, and involve transistors,
capacitors, resisters, protocols, etc. so in some sense there is a depth to
the circuitry, it is not just an image of a ring but a complexity hidden
beyond the boudary of what is immediately visable- whereas the Intel
jewelry was itself this circuitry on display, as if a future data ring
would involve these aesthetic dimensions, inherently. note also the issue
of toxins in manufacturing if a diy approach with repurposed circuitboards
and components, highly toxic to skin, eyes, etc. including chemical
offgasing, related to toxic waste sites of discarded electronics, this
leaking into groundwater, poisoning populations.

the concept of a data ring that is an IC or computer that then interacts
with the environment, say in a crypto context, that it carries passwords,
synced as a paired identity device validating ID or providing
authentication or whatever. and so this functionality is just not an issue
of taking an IC or processor, memory, and storage and having 'data' on the
ring. it would need to be secured, have its own perimeter security, ways of
allowing and preventing access, etc.

the following rings visualize this greater involvement in the aesthetics
beyond just what the device would look like, and into its multilayered
in-depth construction, in dimensions that may also be internal and unseen.
thus a parallel between the chip as structure and building as structure,
and similarity of issues of detailing and design, issues of foundation, &
so on...

[image search] architecture rings
https://www.google.com/search?q=3Dbague&client=3Dfirefox-a&hs=3D7GZ&rls=3Do=
rg.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=3Drcs&source=3Dlnms&tbm=3Disch&sa=3DX&ei=

rcs&q=3Dbague+archit&rls=3Dorg.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&tbm=3Disch&imgdii=
=3D_

the larger context for this is the parallel between the circuitboard and
the city (plug-in city, Archigram) and again issues of relations of
building types and electronic components that have interrelated structures,
functioning, and programming of circuitry at the larger scale. in this way,
modularity into a larger entity, say 'crypto' and 'comms' (NFC) and
'processor' and 'memory' and 'storage'; likewise- stadium, highways, bank,
tv station, school, dwellings.

what would the foundation be, what would the walls be, roof, how many
buildings, how are they arranged, what is the interior and exterior
relation and dynamic, what is the perimeter, what is the functionality and
purpose, what can it do and why. rings and sensors, modules, ecosystem
relations, programmability, display or opaque, indicating feedback, etc.
what is potential for, sans LCD, micro- or nano-leds as ultra-low power
matrix. beyond conventions. how many different typological relations in
larger ecological context: ring-computer, ring-phone, ring-signage,
ring-symbolic.device (orb), ring-POS.device, ring-ATM machine, etc.

<br>the larger context for this is the parallel between the circuitboard an=

ing types and electronic components that have interrelated structures, func=
tioning, and programming of circuitry at the larger scale. in this way, mod=
