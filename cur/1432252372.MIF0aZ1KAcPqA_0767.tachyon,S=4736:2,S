If he was using PGP to encrypt this letter for a deaddrop then having his 
private key would do no good.  Only the recipiant's private key would make 
any difference.  (Unless he had "encrypt to self" set on- which seems rather 
silly).  I rather doubt that the Russian Secret Services would use PGP anyhow 
for encoding dead-drop messages.  No, likely it was either something of 
(clearly inferior) Russian design, or it is a misleading quote. 

I suspect the latter.

Why would the FBI allow to leak (much less leak themselves) the fact that 
they could decrypt whatever cipher the Russian handlers were using to give 
to their agents for dead drops?  Quite the reverse.  That's just basic OpSec. 
 They would have invented some other plausable way to have obtained the 
information.
