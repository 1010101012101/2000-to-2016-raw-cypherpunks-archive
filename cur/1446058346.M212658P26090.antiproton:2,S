Truecost one or two dead 24 year old foxconn/Bangladeshi sweatshop
worker's body into that equation when you do that cost comparison. Even
if it doesn't affect you directly now, it will in the future in the form
of terrorism, because terrorist come from societies and cultures being
destroyed, typically in this day and age for someone else's profit.

The Zapatistas are a collectivist society and they've far from 'lost'.
Other example must exist but they're not coming to mind, and certainly
'scalability' IS a problem. The homeless in the US spontaneously form
self-supporting collectives that are also highly individualistic. The
only real social structures are 'fuzzy'. The quest for purity, of
thought, political structure, culture, drug, whatever, is a disease.=20
But my basic stand is, by it's very design, Capitalism is murderous, and
predatory. There is no such thing as 'kinder and gentler' capitalism and
there never will be.
