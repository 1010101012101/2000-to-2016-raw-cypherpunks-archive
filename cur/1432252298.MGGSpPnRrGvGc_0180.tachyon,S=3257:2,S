Akamai isn't a DoubleClick type of service -
it's a distributed caching system that allows web sites
to get better performance by caching static web content
on large ISPs and other sites likely to be nearer to readers
than the content owner's web site.

Akamai _could_ do detailed who's-reading-what tracking if they
wanted to  (I don't know if they do), but their basic objective
is to ship pages fast and bill the page owners for bandwidth.
