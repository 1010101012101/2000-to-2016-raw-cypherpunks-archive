"In other news, the Senate Select Committee on Children's and Workplace 
Safety met today to consider the Total Safety Awareness Bill. 
Newly-appointed Commissioner of Child Safety, John Poindexter, declared

dismissed any concern that this bill is just a rehashing of the failed 
Total Information Awareness program."
