Yeah, it's disappointing to read comments like:

"I have just read his paper on Assassination Politics, at
http://www.jya.com/ap.htm. "

(from Ray Dillinger)

Our mailing list has now dwindled down to a handful of active 
posters. (Many drawn off by the siren call of "no politics" on other 
lists...until those lists start talking about politics, as 
cross-posts are showing!)

Folks should be "up to speed" on the "classics" before expounding.

As to the specifics of Bell's case, I find that those who comment too 
much get invited by the cops and narcs to come and help their cases 
in court. So I avoid commenting.

Anything I have said to Bell is not directly traceable to me.
