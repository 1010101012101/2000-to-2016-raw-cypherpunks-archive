Meanwhile there was a legal conference here at Harvard recently on the
day-care "child-abuse" witch hunt hysteria that got JR her first bones as a
DA, and, eventually, the AGUS job. They had the younger Ms. Amerault there,
recently out of stir awaiting a probably-never-to-be-held retrial -- her
70-something year old mother having recently died of terminal
claustrophobia from said prison visit -- whose brother is still in jail
begging for a parole-board commutation for a "crime" he didn't commit.

Meanwhile JR quite literally burns a score or two of children in Waco and
goes around headlining "its for the children" conferences like the above.

The irony meter pegs.

It takes a village to hang a witch and burn a child, I guess.

Cheers,
RAH
