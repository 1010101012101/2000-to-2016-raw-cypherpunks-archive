There are two obvious ways to defend Sklyarov:

* This person is a great guy, wife, two kids, smart, grad student,
academic, researcher, programmer, cryptologist, etc. He didn't do
anything except piss off Adobe, and the DMCA is unconstitional anyway,
so let him go free.

* Okay, Sklyarov may be a spamware writer and we may worry about his
poor sense of ethics and in fact he's not someone we'd want to spend
any time with in person, but he should go free since the DMCA is
unconstitutional and spamware, though we hate it, is 1A-protected.

I think the antispammers are taking position #2. Nobody I have read
says he should be locked up because of writing spamware.
