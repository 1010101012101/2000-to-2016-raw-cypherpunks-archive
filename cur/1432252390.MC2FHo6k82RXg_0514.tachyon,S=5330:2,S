Allow me to re-quote the end of my paragraph, and following
paragraph which was the one I really cared about:

> ... In fact the scanners
could be designed without removable storage or
communications links:  after a few days they would erase
their records unless they were read out after a hijacking.

> This last point is crucial.  Most of the debate about
personal identification assumes there is a fundamental
trade-off between being insecure and becoming a police
state; therefore democracies have to settle for some
compromise that is only halfway secure and only halfway
free.  This is not true today.  Electronic and cryptographic
technology like David Chaum's "blind signature" and
"personal representative" lets us design systems with both
strong security and strong protection of privacy and
individual freedom.  (See his August, 1992 _Scientific
American_ article, "Achieving Electronic Privacy".)


My point was that we should sell crypto as a way to achieve
security.  That's a product people are buying this week. 
Cryptographic protocols can square the circle; provide both
privacy and security.  So let's be imaginative and sell,
sell, sell!

These smart cards don't need to be connectable to your
identity; just your body and a responsible party's
signature.  American Airlines and Lloyds put $1B behind my
biometrics being one of an authorised class of pilots or
plane cleaners.  Who I am isn't necessary.  Biometric
scanners can be open source as well as unconnected.  The
signature on the card can be blind (albeit after a
mind-boggling number of Chaumian challenges.)  Databases of
biometrics can be separated from identity and accessed
through remailers.  If we can get the bandwagon rolling our
way, we have a chance to steer it.  If not -- well, you're
better at those metaphors.

Take care!
