May's ghost haunts and trolls lesser boards (and as an upper bound I admit 
CP ain't super-hot these days), where he is banished for all eternity, and 
where he is viewed as merely an old, crazy kook.

I don't miss his racism and love of mass murder, but I sure miss his 
brilliant, destabilising ideas.
