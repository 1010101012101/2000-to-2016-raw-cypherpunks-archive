Sure the evidence existed, it just wasn't written to another file, you
routinely spoliate the primary source data UNLESS you turn logging on.
Intentionaly turning off logging certainly shows 'intent' which is all
that the cites you've provided require. Now 'conspiracy' would require a
second (or more) parties to be involved to be relevent.

Watch that rock, there's a hard place on the other side...
