   You'd probably be surprised then, because I'd bet it has been
computerized. In WI and MN at least, even the tiniest libraries are on line. It
came about because of laws mandating that all public libraries belong to a
library consortium, and the consortiums run the centralized databases. If they
don't join the consortium, they can't get state funding, and since most
libraries are strapped for cash, they join. And the computer revolution has been
going on in libraries for a decade now -- I can recall libraries where the staff
was terrified of computers, but most of those people either got on board or
retired. I'm sure there are non-computerized libraries in backwards states like
AL or MS, where they don't even fund the public schools, let alone libraries,
but NJ? Hardly.

   It's a matter of policy not to keep records, that, and the fact that library
software comes with that turned off by default. In some cases I think it would
take custom programming to turn it on. And in most cases, since most systems
librarians are not really computer gurus and rely heavily on outside
consultants, they would have to call the software manufacturer or an outside
consultant to help them figure out how to turn on the retention of patron
records after the books is checked back in. And then explain to them *why* they
would want to do such a nasty thing. And, as I said, there would be immediate
outrage on the part of the other librarians with much shouting and wailing and
demands for explanations, and demands that it be turned off.

   I think most people don't realize what strong civil libertarians most
librarians are -- and how much privacy and freedom of speech is stressed in
library administration and library schools.
