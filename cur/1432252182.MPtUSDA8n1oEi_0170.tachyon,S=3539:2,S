About half of my friends who died of a terminal illness were apparently quite healthy when told they had joined the "nearly departed".

Isn't it depressing than some have been living their lives in a way that such an 11th hour changes of heart are necessary or desired?

Who mentioned random?  Who mentioned dynamite?

What I'm suggesting is no more random than soldiers killing other soldiers in war. "The purpose is to get the other poor dumb bastard to die for their ideology."  Besides, there is no need for these operations to be a suicide.  The lack of fear gives one a decided edge in dangerous situations which may actually increase survival rates.

That's their problem.  From my prespective its like Hollywood: as long as you still being talked about you're 'alive'.  It doen't matter what they are saying.  Better to be infamous down through history than unknown.
