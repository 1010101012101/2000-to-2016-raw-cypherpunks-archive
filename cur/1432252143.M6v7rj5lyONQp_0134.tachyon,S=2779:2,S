The US government wants to intervene to request dismissal of EFF's
lawsuit against AT&T -- the one alleging that it violated federal law
by permitting warrantless wiretapping.

http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004612.php

One wonders what sort of state secret could still be secret here now
that the basics of the story have been revealed. Everyone knows that
if they're tapping phones they have to be doing it *somewhere*. The
most interesting thing, though, is the intervention itself, which
implies that EFF is right and AT&T *was* allowing the NSA to put in
equipment wherever it liked.

The New York Times is also covering the story:

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/us/29nsa.html

Though sadly that link will stop working soon as part of the
New York Times's effort to lose market share.
