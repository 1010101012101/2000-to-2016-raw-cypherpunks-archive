	Oh, the liberal* ideals  that those politicians talked about

	Here's a bit more cynism : If we want to carry a coup d'etat
	against the british monarchy, what kind of rhetoric should we 
	use? Well, the choice seems kinda obvious. We're against
	tyranny and for freedom. (what does 'freedom' mean exactly,
	well, you'll learn the details in the plantations)

	Well, yes, a political system based on real, individual consent
	is the only system that can claim 'moral superiority'. 

	Funnily enough, western political rhetoric/propaganda is based
	on the ideas of 'government by consent', 'self-government'
	'social contract' and the like. All that stuff logically takes
	political anarchy (the abilty for individuals to *actually*
	'govern' themselves) for granted. And of course, the members of
	the western political mafia/state don't believe or apply a
	single word of their own propaganda. Which makes them so morally
	un-superior...

	Well, that would be at least more interesing and honest than
	the system we currently have. The problem remains though, some
	people seem to believe that whatever a majority votes for is
	automatically good or legitimate.

	I suppose  if we look at the current state of human societies
	the conclusion is warranted...

	I think the two words are mostly synonyms. Also, in the past
	people used to talk on one hand about "natural philosophy" (now
	called 'physics' and related scientific disciplines) and on the
	other hand about "moral philosophy" which dealt with
