What expanded capability for ego-surfing!
What expanded ability for better-forgotten posts to rise 
from the dead!

Seriously, this is neat. My earliest listed posting is from
28 November '82. The first mention of the cypherpunks list 
appears to be a post from Eric Hughes on 25 September '92, 
which refers to the list as 'recently formed'.

It's nostalgic to see all the bang!path addresses and .arpa
hosts.
