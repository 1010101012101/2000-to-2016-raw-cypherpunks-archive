At 11:04 AM 11/29/00 -0800, Steve Schear wrote a message that was
in some HTML format that Eudora badly choked over when trying to reply.
It was possible to save it with all the random font change garbage
and funny characters, but not to just send a text reply.

Steve, or whoever The Blue Writer is, says 
"Correction. He was declared the winner by the fact that he has received 
271 of the needed 270 electoral votes."

Bush hasn't received them.  Not only have the Electors not voted yet,
but Florida hasn't selected their electors yet.  They're still
haggling about whether the votes should all be counted,
and the Republicans have done a good job of preventing any 
recounts from being finished (or used), to the extent of organizing
riots outside the Miami/Dade election office.
They're also trying to decide what to do about the 19000 double-punch ballots
(probably unfixable), and the 15000 absentee ballot applications that
were allegedly criminally altered by the Republicans
(10000 were voted for Bush, 5000 for Gore).
Then there were the 12000 mainly black voters whose registrations were
disqualified incorrectly because they were allegedly felons, based on a 
database provided by a company whose parent company gave a 
six-figure contribution to the Republican Party - about 8000 of those
people got back on the voter rolls, and probably not all of the
other 4000 would have voted, but they were much more likely to
have voted Democrat.

I'm not saying the double-punched ballots were Republican fraud;
it looks a lot more like Democrat incompetence in the ballot design,
though it's been suggested that they could also have been from
Democrat attempts at fraud (punch a spike through the Gore hole,
and it won't invalidate any ballots already marked for Gore,
but will invalidate any ballots voting for other candidates.)

The "bunch of elementary school kids had no trouble" press release
is fun, but bogus.  If the teacher had told the kids
"Vote for Gore and Lieberman" instead of "Vote for Gore",
they'd have been much more likely to make a mistake.



				Thanks!
