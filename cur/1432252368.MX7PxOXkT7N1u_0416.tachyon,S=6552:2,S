Interesting, but a little more data to move beyond the hype to what we really
have to worry about would be helpful. From the data below, looks like
purchasing your own chlorine and learning additional water purification
techniques is a small investment in time and money that might really pay off,
and sure beats solely relying on someone else to do it for you.

People focus so much on antibiotics and getting a mask--but it's the other
little things, like DEET, flea and tick powder for the yard, citronella
buckets, gatorade or other rehydration salts, etc. that will put you in a
better place for dealing with a wider variety of potential bioattacks. I
haven't seen a list anywhere, but if you do some reading, use common sense, and
think about it for five minutes it shouldn't be too difficult to come up with
your own.

Coleman's Surplus would be a good place to look for equipment: they still have
reasonably-priced NBC suits for sale too, last time I checked.
