Because the law is still unclear and ambiguous, and the government likes to 
keep it that way.

A plausible interpretation of current legislation, court decisions, 
regulations, and observed practice by enforcement agencies, is that code 
with public source code may be freely exported, and code with secret source 
code may be exported provided the government first gets to know all the 
weaknesses you are hiding from the public.

However the government could decide tomorrow that what we thought the law 
is, is not actually the law, and we are all going to jail.
