If they are, search engines will very likely have indexed them.

I would do the search for you, but your retainer has expired.

Some of the primary papers are:

David Chaum. Showing credentials without identification: Signatures 
transferred between unconditionally unlinkable pseudonyms. In Advances 
in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '85, pages 241--244, New York, 1985. 
Springer-Verlag.

Chaum, D. and J.H. Evertse, Showing credentials without identification: 
signatures transferred between unconditionally unlinkable pseudonyms, 
Proceedings of Crypto '86, Springer-Verlag, 1987.


There is much discussion on the Cypherpunks list, and even reference in 
the Cyphernomicon.
