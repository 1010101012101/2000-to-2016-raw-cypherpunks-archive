Interesting, because in Calif some hacker-discovered kiddy prawns were
tossed out on 4th violations.  Perhaps this will go to higher courts.

Evidence Barred in Ex-O.C. Judge's Child-Porn Case
Writings and photos were illegally obtained from Ronald Kline's
computer, court rules.

By Christine Hanley, Times Staff Writer

A federal judge on Tuesday threw out most of the key evidence in a
high-profile child pornography case against a former Orange County
judge,
ruling that sexually explicit diary entries and photos were discovered
after
illegal computer searches by a Canadian hacker who was working for
police.

The ruling could undermine much of the case against Ronald C. Kline,
whose
arrest drew national attention and ultimately resulted in the judge
dropping his
bid for reelection.
