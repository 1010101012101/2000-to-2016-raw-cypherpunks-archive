great question; let us know if you find them!

my favorite slides from the book are the ones that are nearly all
redacted except for one sentence at the end. lulz!

NO SPOILERS!

my take on the interesting bits:

regarding the phones in the fridge, this was done to muffle sound, not
provide EMSEC protection. a fridge is not a faraday cage! (there has
been some speculation, now definitively squashed.)

regarding the scope of surveillance and exploitation, it is
interesting to see how far Alexander really pushed things beyond
normative for the agency.  i knew he was a "spy cowboy", yet this book
presents a clearer picture of how significant Alexander escalated
Hayden's already aggressive agenda.

regarding the intimidation and maligning of leak reporters, it was
interesting to see how egregious some of the efforts to thwart and
discredit reporting on this story were.

last but not least, i learned that Snowden tried but failed to obtain
a copy of the legend mapping CODENAMES with their corporate partners
(the telecoms, not the Internet companies which they don't give two
shits about naming publicly as collaborators.)  i'm looking at you,
level3!
