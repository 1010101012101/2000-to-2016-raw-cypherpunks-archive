Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

=22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable production=20on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World Trade=20System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local=20resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)
