Welcome to the eleventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what is happening in the taut Tor community.

tor 0.2.4.17-rc is out
----------------------

There are now confirmations=C2=A0[1] that the sudden influx of Tor clients
which started mid-August=C2=A0[2] is indeed coming from a botnet. =E2=80=9C=
I guess
all that work we=E2=80=99ve been doing on scalability was a good idea,=E2=
=80=9D wrote
Roger Dingledine in a blog post about =E2=80=9Chow to handle millions of
new Tor clients=E2=80=9D=C2=A0[3].

On September 5th, Roger Dingledine announced the release of the third
release candidate for the tor 0.2.4 series=C2=A0[4]. This is an emergency
release =E2=80=9Cto help us tolerate the massive influx of users: 0.2.4 cli=
ents
using the new (faster and safer) =E2=80=98NTor=E2=80=99 circuit-level hands=
hakes now
effectively jump the queue compared to the 0.2.3 clients using =E2=80=98TAP=
=E2=80=99
handshakes=E2=80=9D=C2=A0[5].

It also contains several minor bugfixes and some new status messages for
better monitoring of the current situation.

Roger asked relay operators to upgrade to 0.2.4.17-rc=C2=A0[6]: =E2=80=9Cth=
e more
relays that upgrade to 0.2.4.17-rc, the more stable and fast Tor will be
for 0.2.4 users, despite the huge circuit overload that the network is
seeing.=E2=80=9D

For relays running Debian or Ubuntu, upgrading to the development branch
can be done using the Tor project=E2=80=99s package repository=C2=A0[7]. Ne=
w versions
of the beta branch of the Tor Browser Bundle are also available=C2=A0[8]
since September 6th. The next Tails release, scheduled for September
19th=C2=A0[9] will also contain tor 0.2.4.17-rc=C2=A0[10].

Hopefully, this will be the last release candidate. What looks missing
at this point to declare the 0.2.4.x series stable is simply enough time
to finish the release notes.

The future of Tor cryptography
------------------------------

After the last round of revelations from Edward Snowden, described as
=E2=80=9Cexplosive=E2=80=9D by Bruce Schneier=C2=A0[11], several threads st=
arted on the
tor-talk mailing list to discuss Tor cryptography.

A lot of what has been written is speculative at this point. But some
have raised concerns=C2=A0[12] about 1024 bit Diffie=E2=80=93Hellman key
exchange=C2=A0[13]. This has already been addressed with the introduction of
the =E2=80=9Cntor=E2=80=9D handshake=C2=A0[14] in 0.2.4 and Nick Mathewson =
encourages
everybody to upgrade=C2=A0[15].

Another thread=C2=A0[16] prompted Nick to summarize=C2=A0[17] his views on =
the
future of Tor cryptography. Regarding public keys, =E2=80=9Cwith Tor 0.2.4,
forward secrecy uses 256-bit ECC, which is certainly better, but
RSA-1024 is still used in some places for signatures.  I want to fix all
that in 0.2.5 =E2=80=94 see proposal 220=C2=A0[18], and George Kadianakis=
=E2=80=99 draft
hidden service improvements=C2=A0[19,20], and so forth.=E2=80=9D Regarding =
symmetric
keys, Nick wrote: =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re using AES128. I=E2=80=99m hoping t=
o move to XSalsa20 or
something like it.=E2=80=9D In response to a query, Nick clarifies that he
doesn=E2=80=99t think AES is broken: only hard to implement right, and only
provided in TLS in concert with modes that are somewhat (GCM) or
fairly=C2=A0(CBC) problematic.

The effort to design better cryptography for the Tor protocols is not
new. More than a year ago, Nick Mathewson presented proposal 202=C2=A0[21]
outlining two possible new relay encryption protocols for Tor cells.
Nick mentioned that he=E2=80=99s waiting for a promising paper to get finis=
hed
here before implementation.

A third question was raised=C2=A0[22] regarding the trust in algorithms
certified by the US NIST=C2=A0[23]. Nick=E2=80=99s speculations put aside, =
he also
emphasized that several NIST algorithms were =E2=80=9Chard to implement
correctly=E2=80=9D=C2=A0[24].

Nick also plans to change more algorithms=C2=A0[25]: =E2=80=9COver the 0.2.=
5 series,
I want to move even more things (including hidden services) to
curve25519 and its allies for public key crypto. I also want to add more
hard-to-implement-wrong protocols to our mix: Salsa20 is looking like a
much better choice to me than AES nowadays, for instance.=E2=80=9D

Nick concluded one of his emails with the words: =E2=80=9Cthese are interes=
ting
times for crypto=E2=80=9D, which sounds like a good way to put it.

Toward a better performance measurement tool
--------------------------------------------

=E2=80=9CI just finished [=E2=80=A6] sketching out the requirements and a s=
oftware
design for a new Torperf implementation=E2=80=9C announced Karsten Loesing=
=C2=A0[26]
on the tor-dev mailing list.

The report begins with: =E2=80=9CFour years ago, we presented a simple tool=
 to
measure performance of the Tor network. This tool, called Torperf,
requests static files of three different sizes over the Tor network and
logs timestamps of various request substeps. These data turned out to be
quite useful to observe user-perceived network performance over
time=C2=A0[27]. However, static file downloads are not the typical use case
of a user browsing the web using Tor, so absolute numbers are not very
meaningful. Also, Torperf consists of a bunch of shell scripts which
makes it neither very user-friendly to set up and run, nor extensible to
cover new use cases.=E2=80=9D

The specification lays out the various requirements for the new tool,
and details several experiments like visiting high profile websites with
an automated graphical web browser, downloading static files, crafting a
canonical web page, measuring hidden service performance, and checking
on upload capacity.

Karsten added =E2=80=9Cneither the requirements nor the software design are=
 set
in stone, and the implementation, well, does not exist yet. Plenty of
options for giving feedback and helping out, and most parts don=E2=80=99t e=
ven
require specific experience with hacking on Tor. Just in case somebody=E2=
=80=99s
looking for an introductory Tor project to hack on.=E2=80=9D

Saytha already wrote that this was enough material to get the
implementation started=C2=A0[28]. The project needs enough work that anyone
interested should get involved. Feel free to join him!

Tor Help Desk roundup
---------------------

The Tor help desk had a number of emails this week asking about the
recent stories in the New York Times, the Guardian, and ProPublica
regarding NSA=E2=80=99s cryptographic capabilities. Some users asked whether
there was a backdoor in Tor. Others asked if Tor=E2=80=99s crypto was broke=
n.

There is absolutely no backdoor in Tor. Tor project members have been
vocal in the past about how tremendously irresponsible it would be to
backdoor our users=C2=A0[67]. As it is a frequently-asked question, users
have been encouraged to read how the project would respond to
institutional pressure=C2=A0[68].

The Tor project does not have any more facts about NSA=E2=80=99s cryptanaly=
sis
capabilities than what has been published in newspapers. Even if there
is no actual evidence that Tor encryption is actually broken, the idea
is to remain on the safe side by using more trusted algorithms for the
Tor protocols. See above for a more detailed write-up.

Help the Tor community!
-----------------------

Tor is about protecting everyone=E2=80=99s freedom and privacy. There are m=
any
ways to help=C2=A0[69] but getting involved in such a busy community can be
daunting. Here=E2=80=99s a selection of tasks on which one could get starte=
d:

Get tor to log the source of control port connections=C2=A0[70]. It would
help in developing controller applications or libraries (like Stem=C2=A0[71=
])
to know which program is responsible for a given access to the control
facilities of the tor daemon. Knowledge required: C programming, basic
understanding of network sockets.

Diagnose what is currently wrong with Tor Cloud images=C2=A0[72]. Tor
Cloud=C2=A0[73] is an easy way to deploy bridges and it looks like the
automatic upgrade procedure caused problems. Let=E2=80=99s make these virtu=
al
machines useful again for censored users. Knowledge required: basic
understanding of Ubuntu system administration.
