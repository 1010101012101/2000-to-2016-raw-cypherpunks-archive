If your talking "the NSA" I doubt anyone would tell you.  That being
said: it would mean the US gov't breaking Canadian law I suspect.  Now
in Canada it is quite possible that the Canadian Fed gov't monitors
traffic but I would also say no one would tell you because telling you
would also be in violation in wiretap laws.

Best advice, assume they do and hope they don't. :)
