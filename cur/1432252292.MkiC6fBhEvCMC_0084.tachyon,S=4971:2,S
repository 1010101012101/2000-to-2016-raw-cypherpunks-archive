An open platform would be a combined cell phone and palm top
computer.  Lots of people are trying to move this -- so far
without wide acceptance.

Paypal's original vision was that people would use palm pilots
with IR.   If phones developed palm pilot capabilities, this
vision would become more useful.  I think combining the palm
pilot with the cell phone is more feasible once we develop a
good voice controlled computer, after the fashion of startrek,
which may be some time off.
