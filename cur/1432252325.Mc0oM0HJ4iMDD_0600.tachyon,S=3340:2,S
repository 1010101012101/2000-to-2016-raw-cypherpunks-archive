Saw it last night.  s/Bin Laden/Goldstein/g would have run without error.

Not sure how to react to that.  I thought CBS was trying very hard to cast
Phil in a bad light, and his answer was the only one he could have given

Concur.  MICROS~1 is moving steadily toward a secured platform that gives
them full control of what will and won't run.  Were it up to them, there
would be no third-party development.  Ironic, considering third-party
