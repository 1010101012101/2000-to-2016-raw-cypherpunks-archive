Well, they are original. I do not recall any other instance when
a government said "we will not snoop."

---

"Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has no longer any
influence on the police and army force in the country, and all phone
taps, both fixed and mobile in Serbia have stopped, stated Zoran
Djindjic, one of the leaders of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia
(DOS), in an interview for B2-92."

"Djindjic also said that the first step toward change is that all
telephone tapping has been stopped in Serbia."
