That's funny - the post had your return address in the header. Somebody
trying to make you look bad? Superfluous, if so.

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
