You obviously have to consider not just the known unknowns, but also
unknown unknowns. FWIW, I much doubt they can factor large numbers 
with QC (if you want to make sure, do a lit review on QC,
pull up the list of names, and see whether some of them suddenly
stopped publishing, or greatly reduced their publishing rate), 
but public key cryptosystems do have a slight smell about them lately.

We definitely need more diversity in cryptosystems, and should revert
to systems which are more well-understood, and focus on future systems
that are simple to analyze.
