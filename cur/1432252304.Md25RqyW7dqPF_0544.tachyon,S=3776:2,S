"I wonder how quickly one could incinerate a memory card in the field
with high success rate?   Destroy the data and the passphrases don't
help."

Well, what if there were 3 passwords:

1) One for Fake data, for amatuers (very few of the MwG will actually be 
smart enough to look beyond this...that's why they have guns)
2)One for real data...this is what you're hiding
3) One for plausible real data, BUT when this one's used, it also destroys 
the real data as it opens the plausible real data.

Of course, some really really smart MwG (or the cool suits standing behind 
them) will be able to detect that data is being destroyed, but statistically 
speaking that will be much rarer.
