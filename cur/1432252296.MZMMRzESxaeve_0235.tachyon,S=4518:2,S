right.  tap all the interesting fibers, feed to narus.

the narus is there specifically so they don't have to backhaul a
mirror of the traffic.  it does all the inspection to isolate
interesting information, then sends back that interesting information
to aggregation points, before that in turn is sent on to NSA.

the bridgeton center att noc is a good example.  there is a room
controlled by multi-factor biometric authentication (print, retinal)
with man trap doors.  this is probably the room used for distributing
configuration to the remote monitoring points (it's unlikely they
store much of interest at the remote sites, since the security is much
lower at these places) as well as aggregation of the feeds for
backhaul to NSA.

see also the new NSA facilities being built in denver, CO.  this is an
ideal place to aggregate traffic across the country...

from the sounds of it, the taps did introduce some problems which were
resolved quickly.  probably not from signal loss, but who knows.

in any case, i don't think powering an optical amplifier is difficult
in the facilities in question.  for transoceanic cables it becomes a
bigger problem  :)
