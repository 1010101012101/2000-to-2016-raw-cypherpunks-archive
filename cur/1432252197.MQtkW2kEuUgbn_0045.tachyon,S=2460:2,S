I think this is right. I would not claim that a purely capitalist
state is most efficient at producing technology with warfighting
capabilities; I'd argue only that it's best at maximizing the
happiness (and therefore the total economic output) of people who
lived there. That could lead to technology with military applications
or it could just be some pretty funky immersion sim. :)
