The Gentleman's Guide To Forum Spies is no doubt disinformation. It is
seemingly complete, as if to extinguish further analysis on the subject.
But it seems to exclude methods which cannot be noticed, and seems to play
to the fears of the paranoid. No doubt the psychologist who prepared the
document is a threat to humanity itself and ought to be subject to summary
execution.

Afterall, a lack of interest in a topic should not be confused with forum
sliding. Naturally if one is to bring up forum sliding in a forum, one
would be dismissed as a troll and banned, perhaps rightly so.

Through methods pioneered by Freud, I believe I have uncovered the methods
in which the elites manipulate and stifle discussion to benefit their own
interests.

It is important to troll undesirable activists. It creates a low-grade
trauma (which may increase social withdrawal and increased sensitivity to
threats), makes them distrust certain common aspects of the trolls (through
mental association), and wastes their time.

It is also important to shift the internal Overton window of a group. While
greater society has an Overton window over certain subjects, it's
subcultures too have Overton windows. You don't see libertarians talk too
much about nationalization now, do you? For conspiracy theorists, it is
important to make it very difficult for new people to accept any conspiracy
theory. Afterall, there's no clear line as to how the idea that the elites
are conspiring is all that different then all the elites are lizard people
(well, maybe have lizard brains, but that's different). Thus one must shift
the direction of discussion to that of which is absurd so that additional
individuals are unlikely to do anything more than outright dismiss the
theories.

Upon watching a propaganda video by North Korea targeted toward the
conspiracy theorist members of the English-speaking population (
https://youtu.be/WEGMJE6I_Q4?t=28s ), it is evident that the video is
targeting individuals with heightened responses to threats. It talks more
about dangers without focusing on the logic of those dangers or alternative
explanations. It's possible the video did not come from North Korea, but to
make consumerist culture seem to exist by design, when it is quite likely
it will exist anyway but could be promoted to serve the ends of the elites.

These are self-serving individuals who are very good at what they do.
