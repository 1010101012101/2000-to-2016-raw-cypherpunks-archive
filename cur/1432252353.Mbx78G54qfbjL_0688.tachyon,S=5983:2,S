Point taken.

One reason Iraq has not inflamed most adult and the media is, unlike Vietnam, their kids are not going.  Our volunteer army means little politcal consequence to a constant stream of bodybags (no longer ever shown on TV) and walking wounded returning home.  The soaring deficit hasn't yet had consequences affecting the average Joe so why care?

There is no credible "left' in the U.S., just as there are credible libertarians.  The young are so focused on materialsim that they won't hear the door swing shut on the last of their constitutional liberties while searching for the TV remote to select the newest "reality" show.
