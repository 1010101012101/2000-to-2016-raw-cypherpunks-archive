Geek 'Vigilantes' Monitor Border

By Michelle Delio  |   Also by this reporter  Page 1 of 1


02:00 AM Nov. 22, 2002 PT

A group of tech-savvy ranchers in Arizona is using military technology
to monitor and apprehend illegal immigrants crossing the border from
Mexico
into the United States.

Members of the group have spiked their land with thousands of motion
sensors. They also use infrared tracking devices, global positioning
systems,
night vision goggles, radar and other gear to survey movement near the
border.
