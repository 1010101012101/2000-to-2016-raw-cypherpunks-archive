Well I'd have to bow since I couldn't find a lat/long on Sealand or
Havenco and I'm not sure of their exact location other than N. Sea.

Bullshit, We're talking AMATEUR ROCKETS here folks. Beside, irrespective
of the actual size of the rocket it will be in LEO way before it gets to
CCCP.

Clearly you folks have no clue to the distinction between government,
commercial, amateur.

Russia, I agree. Europe is uncool. Hell the Germans outlawed amateur
rocketry in the late 30's and haven't looked back once.

The Gulf is deeper than the North Sea and I'd bet the rigs we got out here
are just as big.

No, you need a boat. Sealand is more than sufficient for putting a Amateur
rocket up. Hell, I could fire one from my back yard as far as that goes.
Though I think the launch tower might give somebody a clue.

While the rest of you folks sit around telling yourself the same old
matra, "It can't be done. It can't be done. It can't be done." We're going
to do it.
