Disposable clothes don't have to be bunny suits.   Latex dishwashing
gloves
and a rain poncho.  Painter's masks, hats.  Duct tape for sealing seams.

Home Depot has plenty to offer.

You can always go out to the desert or forest.  Worths for meth labs
and they're messier than nitration lab.  Buying lots of ice to keep your

newly synthesized product cool is not suspicious.    And you keep
your apartment clean, working outside.  (Some freedom fighting chemists
have been busted from nitric acid stains on the walls, for allah's
sake!)  Plus
you can test your stuff on a small scale.

Its a measurement arms race, and a false positive vs false negative
detection game.

If the shoebomber had had half a clue there'd be one less airplane.
Lighting
up on a non-smoking flight is a bit clueless... that's why they have
bathrooms..

And PS: some plastic explosives do not have the volitile tracers added
to them
that make them so easy to detect.  A little harder to get ahold of, but
if you
know the right people..
