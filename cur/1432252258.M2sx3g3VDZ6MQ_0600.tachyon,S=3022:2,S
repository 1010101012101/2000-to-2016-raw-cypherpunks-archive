I really like Carla - hope she does well.  You'll probably also have
a lot of Greens and liberal Democrats voting for Nader, which would be
good except they're partly doing it for the campaign finance porkbarrel.

Massachusetts looks like the kind of state that has 
more pot smokers than registered Republicans.
Somebody ought to be able to use that....
