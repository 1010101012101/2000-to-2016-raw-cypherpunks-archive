See the last sentence in para 1 above.

You are in fact saying if I can resolve one NP -> P then I can resovle ALL
NP as P. Yet in your earlier email you said the opposite, that you didn't
believe that saying the solution of one NP in a P format meant that all NP
could be solved in a P format.

You are in effect saying that primality, travelling salesman, etc. are
reducible to a single algorithm with respect to resolution.

To word the assertion differently,

"All problems can be reduced to a sum of products such that no single
monomial has a factor more complicated than a power."

I really doubt reality is that simple.

As to Cooks assertion, it is possible to create logical statements which
are irresolvable, irrespective of time or algorithm. So it is clear that
there are in fact statements which can't be resolved so there must be at
least some class of NP that are not resolvable to P.

But you're welcome to your own opinion.
