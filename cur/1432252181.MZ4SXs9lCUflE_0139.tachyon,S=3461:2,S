Pardon, you're so right.

Now that I reflect on it, I am positive that the free voting, free
dealing citizens who democratically elected Perves Musharraf,
Robert Mugabe, Kim Jong-Il and Mullah Omar to wisely govern
their free market economies feel they owe a great deal to dear
Mr. Reagan. Almost as much as I feel towards our own 
democratically elected (7 to 2) Curious George.
