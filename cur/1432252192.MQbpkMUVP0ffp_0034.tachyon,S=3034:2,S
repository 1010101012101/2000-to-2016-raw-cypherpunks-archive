Actually, I don't know if they are still adding jitter.  The original thread
was started by someone else who proposed using jitter.  I believe the
commercial GPS systems are currently limited to 30ft resolutions (the
resolution can be improved futher by processing the output of several gps
receivers).

Are you sure they are still adding jitter to GPS?
