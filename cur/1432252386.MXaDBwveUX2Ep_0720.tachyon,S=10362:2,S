Many people are curious about the 40GB Fin Fisher dump, which is mostly
comprised of GPG encrypted files.
Could be an interesting application of raw compute power.

Hello Guys from metzdowd,<br>
<br>
I really like your mailing list and following it longer time now.<br>
Since I think the posts there are really of high quality and the<br>
people participating really know what they are talking about I would<br>
love to ask a specific question that could be really interesting for<br>
everyone there.<br>
<br>
I come from a company that is doing cryptocurrency mining in large<br>
scale and currently we are thinking about a use case for our 1300 high<br>
end GPU farm that is not necessarily profit oriented, but most<br>
importantly interesting and exciting. I asked a lot of people till now<br>
and also people from chaos computer club in germany, where I received<br>
especially ideas pointing to using the farm to decrypt emails or other<br>
decryption services. Also I was suggested to use it to decrypt the<br>
NSA_KEY, but that is obviously not doable in human time even if the<br>
farm would be 1000x bigger.<br>
Do you have any interesting idea what to do with the farm? If we like<br>
the project it we wouldn&#39;t hesitate to start directly!<br>
<br>
I would really appreciate if you could ask this to the mailing list<br>
and I am really excited about the answers. What do you think?<br>
<br>
Greetings,<br>
Marco<br>
