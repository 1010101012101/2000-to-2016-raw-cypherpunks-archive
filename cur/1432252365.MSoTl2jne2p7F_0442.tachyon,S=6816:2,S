You might get a reasonable level of protection implementing the core
of the crypto operations in a hardware security module (HSM) using
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or Complex Programmable Logic
Device (CPLD). There is an open source set of tools for programming
these beasts based on Python called MyHDL <www.myhdl.org>. The EFF DES
cracker may have some useful ideas too.

The largest of these devices are also pressing the current chip
limits. There isn't a lot of extra space for Trojans. In addition,
knowing what to look at is somewhat difficult if pin assignments etc
are changed from chip to chip at random.

As with any system, there are tool chain issues. Open source helps,
but there is always the Key Thompson attack. The best solution I can
think of is to audit the output. Look very carefully at the output of
the tool chain, and at the final piece that loads the configuration
data into the device.

Cheers - Bill
