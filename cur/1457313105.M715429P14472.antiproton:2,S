As used today, with many people using services like GMail, Hotmail, etc
it could be considered centralized. However, in the sense that I can set
up my own email server, and have someone email me at a given address
without having to get approved by a central authority first, it is
decentralized. Email doesn't even strictly require DNS to work, as there
is an email address syntax (rarely used these days, but still
technically valid) for addressing email directly to a given userid at a
specific IP address by dotted quad.
