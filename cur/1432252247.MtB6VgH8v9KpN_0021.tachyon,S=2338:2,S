I've said this before, but I'll say it again:

Spooks don't get AOL CDs too?

If you were going to go about blowing up someone's computer, would
you *really* do it in a traceable way? Wouldn't IP spoofing and
throwaway connections just be SOP at that point?

Do you expect a government so obviously disinterested in its
citizens' privacy to openly disclose their source IP address? C'mon.

Or do you just think that they'll be stupid enough not to know to
bother? Certainly, your first retaliation would get their attention,
and they have plenty of clout to hire smart people to deal with this
"correctly".
