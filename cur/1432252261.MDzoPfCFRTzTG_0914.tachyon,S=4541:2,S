"Basically they say things like "If you think the government can't break all
the encryption schemes that we have, you're nuts."  This guy was a math 
major
too, so he understands the principles of crypto."

Basically, the answer was hinted at by another poster.

For anyone who doesn't trust the government, the point to make is that 
crypto use is currently a red flag. Last year I went through great pains on 
this list to point out that right now the gubmint probably doesn't even need 
to break most encrypted messages in order to know something's up. This is 
only possible because outside of a coporate context few individuals use 
encryption.

If everybody uses encryption, then it matters MUCH less if the government 
can break any one message. What costs us pennies to encrypt may cost them 
thousands to break. That's the assymmetry we asyms can exploit. That's where 
we need to depart from a Tim May lone wolf approach to your friendly, 
smiling America-loving flag-waving cypherpunks: "If you don't use encryption 
then you help the terrorists win".

This statement has the added irony of being objectively true, according to 
more international definitions of 'terrorism'.
