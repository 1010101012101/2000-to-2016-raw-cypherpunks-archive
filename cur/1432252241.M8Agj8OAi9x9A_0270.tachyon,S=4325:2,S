I think this is actually the tip of an iceberg that extends in a lot of
directions.

What about Sarbannes-Oxley? This is complied to overseas. And we now have the
US "DoJ" in effect creating laws by ordering disposal holds on all documents,
digital or not, in case they want to make a query or two. So the US is already
pwn-ing the international financial community. Oddly, however, the confidence
in the dollar is sinking, so perhaps that same international financial
community is developing antibodies...
