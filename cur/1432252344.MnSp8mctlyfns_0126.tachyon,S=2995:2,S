The cypherpunks list collapsed in 1992 after a few weeks when the
three anti-social founders had a falling out, there was blood and spit 
teeth, then The Thing was rejiggered to came back for a couple of years, 
staggered around from its many bantam cock fights gazed by lurking 
hooters by the thousands not sure WTF was going on but WTH it beat 
The Narcissitic Well and Venal Wired and the Guttenberg Didactic
Project and Tim B-L's honey pimp for hard-on hardware producers, 
spayed advertisers and info liberation machiavellians. 

The four or five best and brightest left in disgust to go to law school
or The Marines or prison or set up vulgar moneypits hawking crypto 
and crypto-crackers and anonymizers and anonymous-trappers to 
occult beasts with very large tax-cash dispensers. 

The Thing matured is what. Petered out, talked about the glory
day. Rotted.

CJ wrote a song about it: 

What it is is many-used, 
shaggered sheath 
in a dried-up cum bucket

Nota bene: for anyone who remembers CJ's sis Alia who
doted on the linguistic genius, she died recently.
