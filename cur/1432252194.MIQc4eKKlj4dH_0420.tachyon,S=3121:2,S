it is different people each time.

That virus replicates by sending itself out to everyone in a victim's
Outlook address book.  It forges the "From:" address to
"HaHaHa@sexyfun.net".

It is a pain, but nothing can be done until the underlying problem is
resolved in Outlook.  (And that won't happen any time soon. Microsoft has
absolved themselves of all blame in regards to macro viruses.)
