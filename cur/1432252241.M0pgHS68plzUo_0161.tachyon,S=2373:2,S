Thanks, I sent a note to the folks who are -supposedly- taking care of
DNS....;(

Just another reason to change the current setup on this end.

If all works well I'll be changeing the SSZ feed from this ISDN we've had
since '94 and taking it to SDSL. I'll also take back all the DNS and
related services as well. It's amazing how many people find DNS hard to
manage.

The change should take place sometime in the June/July time frame.
