Not just modems.  Some Cisco routers, even at megabit rates.  2002
publication, although the research was over the previous couple of
years.

And (for instance) the Paradyne Infolock 2811-11 DES encryptor, which
has an LED on the plaintext data.

How we laughed.

The paper also covers using LEDs (such as keyboard LEDs) as covert
data channels.  And yes, it cites Cryptonomicon.

I'm not sure whether this was more or less cool than Marcus Kuhn's
work on reconstructing CRT displays from reflected light, by reverse
convolution with the impulse-response curves of the various phosphors.
Both papers are fantastic reads, very accessible, very stimulating.
