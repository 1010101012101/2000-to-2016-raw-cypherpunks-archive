I think this is a bit short-sighted.

Assume there is an anonymous seller who has established reputation capital 
over time for small transactions on the order of pennies. I may be willing 
to risk a ten-cent transaction (to purchase an illicit MP3 or somesuch) if 
the perceived reward is sufficient. If I am successful and word spreads 
that the seller is to be trusted, the amount people will be willing to risk 
larger amounts will presumably increase.

Obviously there is the possibility for the seller to cut and run when the 
trust factor gets sufficiently high and transactions increase accordingly, 
but buyers aren't entirely dumb, so a rational buyer will take that into 
account. One factor is how many people at once are entering into 
transactions with the seller -- and that may not be knowable. If the seller 
goes bad, what is the time delay before the bad actor status can be known 
and published?

Escrow agents and bonds posted by the seller can accelerate this process 
substantially.

Not so. You can grow it quickly, organically, in a much shorter time. You'd 
be right if you're talking about an entirely new economy, but not if you're 
talking about the more likely prospect: a system that gradually supplements 
the existing economy. It won't replace it, of course.

Remember, one still buys a loaf of bread in meatspace.
