The distinction is crypto is applied. The axioms and rules don't require
belief or faith - applied crypto has shown time and time again to require
belief and faith.

Crypto is opaque - but open.

DES was once thought to be secure.
RSA was once thought to be secure.
PKI was once thought to be secure.

it describes a world where farmers figure out they can make more<br>
