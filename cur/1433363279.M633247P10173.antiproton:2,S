_The NSA provides data to the FBI and DEA, among others. Although it was
known previously, this is part of what Snowden released with
corroborating documentation. That it hasn't gotten more attention, by
Greenwald, Snowden, et al, is one of the major credible complaints since
the releases began in June 2013. _

Thanks M373, this was what I couldn't put my finger on, it's all been NSA, NSA so far... if the FBI has its own capacity to monitor phone, email, chats, etc., in addition to whatever NSA shares with them, that's a whole other data-sucking structure that needs attention.
