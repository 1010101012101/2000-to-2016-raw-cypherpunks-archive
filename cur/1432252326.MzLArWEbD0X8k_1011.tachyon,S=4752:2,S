the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
ful|-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $12O
mi|li0n in development expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 17O,O0O Mw of electricity annual|y for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,0O0 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 17O,OO0 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
electric sales over a 2O-year period are estimated at over $45O mi||i0n for a
project this size.

development of renewable energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of

its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
