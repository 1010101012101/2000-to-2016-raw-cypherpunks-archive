Second-generation?  Man, do I feel old!

Detweiler's rantings may not be fully accurate, but they do serve to 
outline the basic ideas of pseudonymity.  They're worth a visit, if only 
for some historical perspective.

http://sattlers.org/mickey/culture/humor/items/Geekish/theoryOfNymity.html

As well, Tim May's Cyphernomicon has some good info about reputation 
capital.

https://www.cypherpunks.to/faq/cyphernomicron/chapter15.html

Cory Docterow calls reputation capital "Whuffie", and goes into some 
detail on how it might work (assuming a slightly sci-fi infrastructure 
in the bargain).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie

Even without Docterow's Whuffie meter, repcap exists today. There are 
quite a few nyms that I trust to be reputable, even though I've never 
met them in person and don't know their True Names.

Welcome to the Other Plane.
