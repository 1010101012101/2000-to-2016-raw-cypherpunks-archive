I watched on TV a guided missile hit the second tower; this was
replayed again and again.

Then I saw Kallstrom on TV saying there was no missile,
but that "we knew it was not if but when." Though he
said "we didn't foresee it exactly this way."

I changed my TV-eye-witness testimony immediately, never saw 
a missile exploding inside the tower. What I saw were two tall buildings 
collapsing exactly the way intended, without identifiable cause. CIA
is working on reenactment that will show there was no lack of
intelligence, no reason to suspect anything other than an
accident, despite the ususal paranoid ravings.

Why, for example, would jet-qualified pilots become involved in
terrorist actions? Bin Laden had a jet pilot, trained in the US,
who ferried bin Laden's jet from the US to Sudan. After 
a while he tried to quit the job but a Bin Laden aide
threatened the pilot's family. The pilot pondered that
then went to the US Embassy to cut a deal to confess what
he knew in exchange for getting a new life in the US.

We know from the Egypt air crash that some pilots are
cooperatively suicidal when their families are at risk.
