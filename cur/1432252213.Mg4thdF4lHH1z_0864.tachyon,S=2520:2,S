Here's a link I saw on free-market.net to an article about this.

I'm pretty confident they fell for a hoax.  The article claims
"65% of all Brazilians with income more than US$ 2000 always walks 
equipped with gun",  whereas I believe in fact Brazilian civilians are all 
forbidden from owning guns.
