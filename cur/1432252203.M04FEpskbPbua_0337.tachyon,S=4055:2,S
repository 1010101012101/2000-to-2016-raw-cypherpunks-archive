8-bit-alphabet plaintext looks like plaintext.
It's easier to recognize popular languages - short bunches of 
letters separated by spaces.  Less popular languages that use
8-bit alphabets still have easily detected statistics that
are much different from uniformly-distributed cyphertext.

Languages with N-byte characters are much harder -
you have to decide whether to look at Unicode,
(2-byte's bad enough; variable-byte is worse),
otherwise you'll get totally hosed on your chi-squares.

Things that start with popular magic numbers like gif89 
also look like plaintext (though they may in fact be stego.)
