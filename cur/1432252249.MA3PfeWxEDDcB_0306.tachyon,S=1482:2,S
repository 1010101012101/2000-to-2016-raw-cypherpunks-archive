After further review upon receiving your application,
your current mortgage qualifies for a 3% lower rate!

We have tried to contact you on several occasions
and time is running out!

This is our last attempt.

Let me explain,
--------------------------------------------------------
!! U.S MORTGAGE RATES HAVE SIMPLY NEVER BEEN LOWER! !!
--------------------------------------------------------
This is no lie.
This is reality.

8 Millions of Americans have alr`ea`dy re-financed this month alone!

So why not you?

Refinancing just makes sense.
