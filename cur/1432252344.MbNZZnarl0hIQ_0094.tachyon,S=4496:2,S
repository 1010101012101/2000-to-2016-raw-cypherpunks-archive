Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petro|eum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
full-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi||i0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of e|ectricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mil|i0n for a
project this size.

of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of

its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
