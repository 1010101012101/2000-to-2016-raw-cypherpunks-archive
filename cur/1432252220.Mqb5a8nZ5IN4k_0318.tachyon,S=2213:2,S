Well, yes, but this would be a very significant step forward from the 
current situation. As t-->infinity the vast majority of non-payments are 
going to be for the purpose of greed. If the payment is already 'gone', then 
you need a whole different set of motives for wanting to screw somebody even 
if you get nothing out of it. So in other words, you have at least solved 
the payment problem "to the first order", with no 3rd party. With fancier 
mechanisms I would think you can solve it to 2nd order too.
