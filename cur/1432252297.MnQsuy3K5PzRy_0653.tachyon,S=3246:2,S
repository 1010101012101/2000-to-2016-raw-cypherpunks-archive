Supposedly tens of thousands turned up, forty two thousand in 
San Francisco

Yet oddly, the photos of marches that I see look more like 
forty in San Francisco, and four hundred in Washington.

Perhaps there were a lot more out of frame, but that is an odd 
way to photograph a demonstration.

Does anyone know the truth from his own eyes, or a more 
complete set of images?  At least some newspapers are reporting 
"hundreds" or four hundred in Washington, while others are 
reporting eighty thousand, an number curiously different from 
four hundred.  However it seems that all papers are reporting 
forty two thousand in San Francisco.

The inconsistency in the reports from Washington incline me to 
doubt the reports from San Francisco, but of course there is a 
plentiful supply of liars on both sides of the fence.
