I wasn't arguing, I was quipping.

I find the many meanings of the word privacy to be fascinating.  So
when someone commented that the car's tattle-box is or isn't a privacy
invasion, I thought I'd offer up a definition under which it is.
Its a definition that lots of people use, as John points out.

Perhaps better than 'right' would be 'ability,' 'The ability to lie
and get away with it.'
