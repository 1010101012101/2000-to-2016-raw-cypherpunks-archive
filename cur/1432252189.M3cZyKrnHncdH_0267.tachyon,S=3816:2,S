It looks like it is "all of the above."  These are the specific
interventions I have seen mention of so far:

* weakened algorithms/protocols for big players (e.g., GSM, Cisco)
* weakening of RNGs
* inside access by 'covert agents' to hand over secrets (e.g., big 4)
* corruption of the standards process (NIST 2006?)
* corruption of certification process (CSC)
* crunching of poor passwords
* black ops to steal keys
* black ops to pervert systems

Which makes sense.  Why would the biggest player just do "one thing" ?
No, they are going to do everything within their power.  They'll try
all the tricks.  Why not, they've got the money...

What is perhaps more interesting is how these tricks interplay with
each other.  That's something that we'll have trouble seeing and
imagining.
