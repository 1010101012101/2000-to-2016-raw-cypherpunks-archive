Hash: SHA1

yes, I did sign their key,  Apple  generated a new key and didn't
sign it with the old one
or have anyone continue it's trust path.. It would be a good thing if
someone else signed it and
sent notice to Product Security <product-security@apple.com>, you can
contact them there and
ask them to verify the fingerprint or use their website..

either way, isn't it funny that they use a PGP key to verify their
security updates and yet
with all the CDSA code they have on X, none of it supports the PGP
key infrastucture.
actually I am not sure what the Security framework is used for,  I
suspect  encrypting
passwords on keychain and now System update.. but not ssh/scp or
mail.app.

too bad.
