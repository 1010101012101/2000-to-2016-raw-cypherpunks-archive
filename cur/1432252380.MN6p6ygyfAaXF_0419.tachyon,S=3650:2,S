The technology to identify transmitters from the "keying" characteristics 
of the transmitter was commercially made available by Corsair 
Communications http://www.corsair.com/ (now merged with Lightbridge) using 
PhonePrint technology licensed from TRW's Avionics & Surveillance 
Group.  They claim it was successful in preventing over 250 million 
fraudulent cloned handset call. It appears PhonePrint is no longer being 
actively marketed by Lightbridge.
