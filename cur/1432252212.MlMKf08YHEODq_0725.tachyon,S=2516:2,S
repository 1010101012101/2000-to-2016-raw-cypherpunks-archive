C'punks,

I haven't had much luck in researching something.  Several years back,
Donald Trump proposed a high-rise complex for New York City that would
feature a kilometer-high skyscraper.  Does anyone have a URL about that
plan?

I'd love to see the WTC replaced with a building over twice as tall as the
twin towers, the irrefutable tallest building in the world.  Something like
Trump's kilometer tower would be a great symbol of recovery and
transcendence.
