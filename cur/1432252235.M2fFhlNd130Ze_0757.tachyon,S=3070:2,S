Well, yes there are counterexamples I guess. The kind of retardation I'm 
talking about seems to happen when the influence in through covert, 
destabilising channels.

Taiwan is a particularly odd example...it definitely has started forming a 
modern economy, but then again it had many decades of oppression. It also 
had swiped billions upon billions of dollars of gold and other substances 
that backed the Chinese monetary system prior to 1949, so arguably that 
money had to go somewhere.
