Yes, ten subscribers left and none not a rat.

New York Times today has at least three articles about online
spying, two in the back of the business section, one as the
principal piece in the Sunday Magazine, unusually long.

The magazine piece describes encouragement of people
to put everything out there as if a marvelous way to socialize.
Some coverage of the delirium of advertisers, such as the
Times, at this oil spill of free data.

One of the business articles focuses on Twitter giving all its
messages to the Library of Congress, and the delirium of
scholars at getting this oil spill of data unmediated by
authoritatives like the Times and greeders themselves.

Twitter claims it strongly emphasizes to its users about the
public nature of their data. Says it thinks its privacy policy
should be called a public policy, but that California requires
a privacy policy so it keeps the deception going to comply
with law.

All is online spying is lawful, and the data snatchers are
delirious with pleasure about it. Marc Rotenberg at EPIC
is the sole source quoted as saying US privacy policy is
totally fucked up. The article implies the EU approach is
better, despite there being no other governments on earth
that spy on its people more than the EU, and which blames
the US and China and Russia and anybody else handy for
being the threat.

Finally, a Times editorial today praises Google for its recent
disclosure of government requests for data. Says Google
intends to turn over the actual requests to an unnamed
non-profit for publication. Still no answer to what Google
does with the planetary-grade stuff it gathers, that's deeply
salt-mined.

And nothing about the general online and offline spying
practices now endemic under guise of beneficial data
gathering and lawful compliance for what else the security
of users and nations and economies.

On to the hot shit handhelds, climate friendly vehicular
black boxes, monitors of kitchen appliances and crib-killer
and homicidal students and maturbating parents, and
automatic upgrades and renewals sucking your privates.

The Times chief editor says also today that the use of
anonymous sources is essential to check government
abuse, and while there are occasional abuses of the
practice that is why ombudspersons are there to keep
the Times authoritatively trustworthy. Nothing about
Times ads being composed of cancerous waste.
