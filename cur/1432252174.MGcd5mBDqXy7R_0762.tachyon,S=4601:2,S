1976 -- Jamesd, a goose that lived to 49 years
8 months, dies returning from the evening meal.
His last mortal
words: "I'm stuffed."
1983 -- Columnist Lars-Erik Nelson after checking the
citations on all 434 Congressional Medal of
Honor awarded during World War II, reveals that not one
of them matches the story acting
President Reagan told the other day. "It's not true,"
writes Nelson.
Responds Reagan's man, Larry Speakes,
"If you tell the same story five times, it's true."
1998 -- Author William Gaddis dies.
The day on which a libidinal American President,
counting the hours before his impeachment, launched
yet another series of bomb attacks on an Iraqi population
already unconscionably squeezed & starved, America's
most proficient satirist died....

2000 -- US: The president of the Florida Holocaust
Museum recently noted that George W. Bush's
grandfather derived a portion of his personal fortune
through his affiliation with a Nazi-controlled bank.
John Loftus, a former prosecutor in the Justice
Department's Nazi War Crimes Unit, said
his research found that Bush's grandfather
was a principal in the Union Banking Corp.
in the late 1930s & the 1940s.
That money flows into American politics today,
he said, from "a series of multinational corporations
behaving like pirates. They don't care about ideology;
they care about money."
"That's where the Bush family fortune came from:
It came from the Third Reich," Loftus said.
