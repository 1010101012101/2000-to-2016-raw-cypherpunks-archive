In some sense, we have enough code.  Code exists that can be deployed.  It
may have to go thru the same evolutionary stages the P2P software is going
thru (Napster to Kazza to ???) as security problems become serious, but it
is deployed now.

What we don't have is:

* Patent licenses
* Easy to use code
* Users

Techies can work on the ease of use issue, but patent licenses take time
and/or money, and users take marketing and sales.

Cheers - Bill
