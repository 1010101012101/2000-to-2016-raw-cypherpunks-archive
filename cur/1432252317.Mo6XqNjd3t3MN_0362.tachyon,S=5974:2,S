note the misdirection and switcharoo here:
"""
“N.S.A.'s activities are focused and specifically deployed against —
and only against — valid foreign intelligence targets in response to
intelligence requirements,” Vanee Vines, an agency spokeswoman, said
in a statement. “We do not use foreign intelligence capabilities to
steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of — or give
intelligence we collect to — U.S. companies to enhance their
international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.”
"""

these systems have been deployed domestically, albeit under the guise
of "valid foreign intelligence targets"... and those a suspiciously
close number of hops from same.

But the program, code-named Quantum, has also been successful in
inserting software into Russian military networks and systems used by
the Mexican police and drug cartels, trade institutions inside the
European Union, and sometime partners against terrorism like Saudi
Arabia, India and Pakistan, according to officials and an N.S.A. map
that indicates sites of what the agency calls “computer network
exploitation.”

“What’s new here is the scale and the sophistication of the
intelligence agency’s ability to get into computers and networks to
which no one has ever had access before,” said James Andrew Lewis, the
cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. “Some of these capabilities have been around
for a while, but the combination of learning how to penetrate systems
to insert software and learning how to do that using radio frequencies
has given the U.S. a window it’s never had before.”...

There is no evidence that the N.S.A. has implanted its software or
used its radio frequency technology inside the United States. While
refusing to comment on the scope of the Quantum program, the N.S.A.
said its actions were not comparable to China’s.

“N.S.A.'s activities are focused and specifically deployed against —
and only against — valid foreign intelligence targets in response to
intelligence requirements,” Vanee Vines, an agency spokeswoman, said
in a statement. “We do not use foreign intelligence capabilities to
steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of — or give
intelligence we collect to — U.S. companies to enhance their
international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.”

Over the past two months, parts of the program have been disclosed in
documents from the trove leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former
N.S.A. contractor. A Dutch newspaper published the map of areas where
the United States has inserted spy software, sometimes in cooperation
with local authorities, often covertly. Der Spiegel, a German
newsmagazine, published the N.S.A.'s catalog of hardware products that
can secretly transmit and receive digital signals from computers, a
program called ANT. The New York Times withheld some of those details,
at the request of American intelligence officials, when it reported,
in the summer of 2012, on American cyberattacks on Iran.
