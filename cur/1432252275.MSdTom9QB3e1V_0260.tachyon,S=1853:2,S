         The axiom "honest men have nothing to fear from the police" is 
currently under review at the Axiom Review Board. Thank you Terry 
Pratchett! If trolls like you weren't so easy to respond to, I'd just move 
on, but...
         Information about the software I'm running isn't anyone else's 
business. If someone wants to know about it, they can ask me, and under no 
circumstances am I obligated to tell them anything, much less what they 
want to hear.
         End of story.
