1971 -- An angry Vietnam soldier, George Mellendorf
sends letter to Richard Nixon complaining about slow
delivery of mail to soldiers:
"It seems as if nobody cares
if we get our mail."
Nixon may have responded quickly
with his letter of denial, but Mellendorf didn't
get it until 1978 -- seven years after it was sent.(on this day;the daily 
bleed)

  Freudian Uniform Slip (ta pug)
The man appointed by the governor of Texas as the state's director of 
homeland security in the U.S. war on terrorism, David Dewhurst, is also a 
candidate for lieutenant governor, and his recent patriot-themed campaign 
ad featured a large U.S. flag with a smartly dressed soldier standing in 
front of it. However, it was later discovered that the soldier in the 
photograph was not an American but a German soldier in a Luftwaffe uniform.
