The gem industry was helping the militant Afghans raise money
back when they were US allies.  In the bios below, helping
the Mujahideen is listed as a cool thing, for both locals
and US folks.

Anwar Pacha was born in Nuristan. He and his father, Fazel Manan Pacha,
joined the
                             Jihad in 1979. Together they organized the
tribes, established hospitals and assigned
                             doctors to care for the Mujahideen. From
his great grandfather to present, his family
                             has maintained leadership and a friendly
relationship with other tribes in Northeastern
                             Afghanistan. He has many followers in
Mohamand, Safi, Salarzi, Mahmoond, Gujur,
                             Shinwari tribes. Without these peoples,
mining of gemstones is not possible.


Mr. Aref Hanifi was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. He has been involved in
the Import-Export Business
                between the US, Europe, China, India, and Hong Kong.
After this he was involved in helping the
                Mujahideen, in particular, Khalil Nuristani and
Ubydullah Niazi of Northern Afghanistan (Kapisa).


Mr. Bowersox received his BBA degree from Western Michigan University
where
                                  he continued his post-graduate studies
in the field of finance and investments.
                                  After graduation he joined the United
States Army and obtained the rank of Major
                                  during the Viet Nam war. After his
honorable discharge from the US Army, he
                                  worked in the gem industry in Brazil,
Burma, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and
  Thailand. In 1973 he began working and surveying the gem mines of
Afghanistan. During 1976 he was awarded the
  exclusive rights for the export of lapis to the United States. After
the Russian invasion, Mr. Bowersox worked with
  the Mujahideen in developing the gem mines in Afghanistan. This
entailed many potentially dangerous trips into
  Afghanistan during the war. In 1997, he was appointed as consultant to
the Minister of Mines and
  Industry-Government of Afghanistan.
