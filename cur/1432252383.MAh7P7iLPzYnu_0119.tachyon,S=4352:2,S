California's energy crisis (cough) could be solved overnight if dynamos 
could be attached to the Founders spinning in their graves.

Item: California is seeking to collect taxes on a transaction which did 
not occur in California. Sounds like a tariff on goods entering 
California. Sounds like what the commerce clause was designed explicitly 
to stop.

Item: The Warren court ruled that a rib joint in the deep south 
somewhere could not choose its customers as it wished because turning 
away certain people might discourage them from travelling to that 
region, which might lessen the business of bus companies and other 
restaurants and gas stations and all, and so that was some kind of 
interference in interstate commerce. The commerce clause was invoked to 
interfere with a person doing with his property as he wishes.

And there are the restrictions on what _crops_ a person may grow, even 
if never sells a single bushel, even a single peanut, on the alleged 
grounds that his act of growing a crop will affect what he and his 
family buy...and thus this affects the local Safeway store's business! 
Call it the "Suppression of Competition and Protection of Special 
Interests Ruling." (The usual sources, like Findlaw, have scads of 
references. This one is "Wickard v. Filburn.")

(So, does this "open the door" for regulations on books which urge 
people to travel to New York instead of Iowa, on the grounds that these 
kinds of books "influence interstate commerce"? The mind boggles at what 
lawyers have done to these united states. Time to fire up the ovens and 
send them to the showers.)
