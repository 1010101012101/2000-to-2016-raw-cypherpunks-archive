This is the stance pushed by lawyer vermin, who are more interested in
their fees than in right and wrong.  To knuckle under to it is to act
without honor, and to lose - completely - any respect your peers may have
had for you.

If more people would see these things through as issues of right and
wrong, and then sue the opposing scumfuck lawyers on the other side, there
would be a LOT less of this.

Interesting.  My named.confs are authoritative for MAPS and it's ilk.

They should refuse to have anything to do with this company -period.

These are people who should have known better _already_.  What makes you
think they'll be any more serious about their due diligence in the future?

Not any more...

*Now*, it's a product.

Assuming for a second that it _is_ possible, what makes you think this
pussy wouldn't knuckle under the next time CRC came knocking?

Not at all: the more copies they _don't_ sell, the more this idjit will
contribute to them in cash!  He has insured that they will *always* make
money on this, even if they execute their own project - on purpose!

Peace my ass.  To put it in May-Speak, these assholes have most definitely
earned killing, along with those insects they refer to as "lawyers".

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
