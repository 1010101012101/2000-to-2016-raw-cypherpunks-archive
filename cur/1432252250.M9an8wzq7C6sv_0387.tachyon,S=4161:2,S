Ah, but now you've used a court to justify a courts action. Which is
exactly my point. You're arguing in circles.

ALL law in the US is common law (see Amiee's def's of the distinction).

What phrase does the Constitution start with?

Really? Where did the framers direct us to do that? Jefferson ways the
earth (and it follows the laws we derive from our existance) follow from
the living not the dead?

You're just arguing in circles and demonstrating my point about
'predecence'.

         If the law is based on precedence, why is the Constitution
         not the final precedence since it's the primary authority?
