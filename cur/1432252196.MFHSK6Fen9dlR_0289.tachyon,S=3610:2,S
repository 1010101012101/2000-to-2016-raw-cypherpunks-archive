I'm no expert on this -- in fact, I've studiously avoided becoming one
on this -- but my understanding is that under the Quill decision,
California can't force PennsylvaniaBooks.com to collect sales taxes on
shipments to SF and remit it to the Calif tax collectors.  (Without
nexus, that is.)

Ideally the guvs would like federal law to modify the Quill ruling.
