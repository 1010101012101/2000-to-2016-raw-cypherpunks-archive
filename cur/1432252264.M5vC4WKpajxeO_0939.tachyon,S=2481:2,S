Perhaps, but I worked at Cylink, a AG Crypto competitor, during those years 
and my second-hand information (I wasn't the product manager of any of 
these boxes) was that NSA did approach us to compromise certain boxes to be 
supplied to narco terrorists, etc. independent sales agent to Cylink (I 
think operating out of Miami).  The compromises, from what I understand, 
were to made to the random number generator.  As some on the list 
understand, with subsequent whitening compromised random number generators 
can be very difficult to directly detect even by experts.  Other methods, 
such as intentional leaks which are a part of every good 
counter-surveillance operation, would need to be used to out bogus boxes.
