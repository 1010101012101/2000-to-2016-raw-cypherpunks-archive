Ah, these unreasonable critics, revelling in pure paranoia. It's, of course,
entirely clear the vendors are emanating pure milk of human kindness. Having
only the
best interests of their customers at heart. Sure, we've forgotten all about
the true intents, the leaked documents. Every iteration is a clean slate,
no one is remembering the past lies. Cypherpunks have no clue about the
importance of a trust track. Right. We're all just babes in the woods.

No, that'd be you. The usual FUD & lies channel. Thankfully, your views stink
so much it takes only a periodic reminder on which payroll you are.

Such as using ISP sevices. All of them. Obligate authentication to just go
online.

Some people? Traitors, and terrorists! Criminals and pedophiles, the sundry
lot.

Like routable TCP/IP. No shoes, no cert, no service. Like accessing the basic
Elsevier information, keyed to your cert. Limited life-time eyes-only
documents, to make whistleblowing harder.

It takes a broken P2P service to be brought down by a few unkosher binaries.
Trust accounting and agoric load levelling don't take Pd hardware.
A palladium-plated turd is still a turd at its heart.

Put a smartcard reader into the keyboard. Define a crypto hardware standard,
and bundle a card with each motherboard and PC. That would be a good thing.

Let those who want a limit on their choice pay for and insert the card
themselves.

Look at concentration in scientific publishing. Tell me how Palladium will
reduce the monopolist stranglehold, reduce the prices and make scientific
information available to the largerst possible audience.

A manipulated market is no longer a competitive market. Producers and
consumers do not have equivalent leverage. The invisible hand is flipping
us the bird. Of course you know that, TCPA
troll.

Rejoice everybody. Halleluja!

There is no such thing as a weak DRM. Either I do have the raw bits of an
open format and the according transducer to render it into direct
monkey-consumables, or not. The rights are volatile, and subject to change.
Everything enforcible will be enforced, and a good hardened Palladium makes a
great many evils possible.

Such as sharing that content freely? That'd be a cold day in hell, Palladium
troll.

What's your problem with music industry getting out of business? What's your
problem with a greatly diminished copyright enforcement, and free sharing of
information?

Paint the worst picture you can. (Of course you've avoided answering so far,
because that'd be exposing your views as the corporate-financed lies they
are).

Oh yes, now you're suggesting to ignore the history of what has already
happened. What the educated, active, intelligent consumers have let happen.

Bullcrap. The majority has no clue, and never had. It's the reason we're
having the current debacle.

Go ask a fucking consumer what Palladium, TCPA, or whatever it's name happens
to be today (funny they keep changing the names, huh?) is. Most top end
notebooks already ship with Pd onboard, not widely advertised, though. I
wonder about that, now that's it's such a nice feature.

Now you're asking us to trust lawyers and feds, as well as corporate
interests. This is just getting better and better by the moment.

Users don't CHOOSE, you Palladium troll. They didn't knew an open format if
it bit them in the ass. Their bosses choose, the monopolist choses for them
via default-bundle and lock-in.

Blow me. I have better things to do with my Saturday than to post token
refutations. Let somebody else deconstruct your drivel.

Yes, and new forms of abuses and controls not possible today. Let the lobbies
fight this out. The educated, intelligent, choosing consumer will swallow
either result.
