[Any Politechnicals going? I'm teaching a graduate public policy course
this semester -- the last class meets on April 16, so I'm not sure if
I'm going to be able to make it to Seattle. It would have to be a quick
trip, at least for me. --Declan]

Hi Declan,

Would you post this to your list.  I'd like to remind everyone to book
early for the conference while we still have the good rates and
discounts!  I've also highlighted a few of the panels that will take
place at this year's conference.

Thanks,
Deborah Pierce
PrivacyActivism
Chair, CFP2005

A _detailed program_ for the 15th annual ACM Conference on Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy is available on the _CFP2005 website_. CFP2005 will
be held at the Westin Hotel in Seattle, WA, April 12-15, 2005.

Discounted registration, and special conference rates at the Seattle
Westin  remain available through March 21, register before that date in
order to get the advance discounts.

This year's theme is _Panopticon_:

Over time, and particularly recently, surveillance of ordinary citizens
has increased to dramatic levels. Not only are governments watching more
aspects of their citizens' lives, but those in the private sector are
increasing surveillance of people as well. Often lost in the race to
"increase intelligence" are discussions about different approaches to
address problems like the threat of terrorism that are equally or more
effective, but do not involve extensive and constant surveillance.

The opening plenary debate focuses on "Sousveillance in the Panopticon?.
Panel members include _Dr. Steve Mann_, Director of the eyeTap Personal
Imaging Lab at the University of Toronto, known for his work in wearable
cameras and computing; _Dr. Latanya Sweeney_, Director of the _Data
Privacy Lab_ at Carnegie Mellon University; and _David Brin_, author of
/_The Transparent Society_/.
Some of the other sessions closely related to the Panopticon theme
include Terrorizing Privacy? European Developments and Counter
Strategies; Intelligent Video Surveillance; Observing Hidden
Surveillance Structures; and Art, Surveillance and the Internet.
Some of the other important topics include the role of blogging and
other nascent communications technology in promoting free speech,
explored in the session Unstoppable Speech (or, The Revolution Will Be
Podcast); a discussion of Economics of Privacy: Market or Regulation;
and The Accountable Internet: Establishing Trust While Preserving
Values. In addition to the plenary and breakout sessions, evening "Birds
of Feather" cover a wide range of topics.

As is traditional at CFP, Tuesday is dedicated to longer sessions. A
full-day Workshop on Vanishing Anonymity features over a dozen academic,
NGO, and private sector experts discussing authentication techniques,
customer, student, traveller and racial profiling, the implications of
new technologies such as sousveillance cameras and wearable computing,
RFIDs, biometrics, and internet protocols. Tutorials include Biometric
Basics, Identity Theft in 2005, International Copyright Law (featuring
participants from at least four continents), and _Mike Godwin_'s
legendary Constitutional Law in Cyberspace.

For those unable to attend in person, most sessions will be blogged, and
presentation materials will be available on the web soon after the
conference.
