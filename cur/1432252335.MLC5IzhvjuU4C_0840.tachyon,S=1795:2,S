There is other possibility how to "beat" interrogation - suitable only for
some subsets of situations, when the organization design is prepared for
this.

Tell them all. Tell them the truth. Make sure in advance that you can
afford to do it without telling them what they need/want to know - design
the system the way you won't be *able* to know the information that could
endanger the "important" parts of your system/organization.
