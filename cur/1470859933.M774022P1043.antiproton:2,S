I respect you and like your posts, Zen, but this one really feels like
grasping at straws, perhaps not on your part, but certainly on the part of
Christoforou and Durden (who has been predicting the end of the world for
his entire career AFAICT). I had a longer "blackout" than that when I lost
my train of thought giving closing arguments in mock trial when I was in
high school, to the extent that the judge had to say "You may continue, Mr.
Lynch."

There are plenty of legitimate criticisms of Clinton. This is not one of
them. This is literal FUD.
