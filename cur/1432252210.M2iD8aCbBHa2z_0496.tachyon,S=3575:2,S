Why has no one mentioned '1984'? I've only seen the
1956 version with Edmond O'Brien, not the 1984 version
with John Hurt.

If we're going to proceed down the 'state as evil' axis, 
there's a rich vein of content, such as 'Brazil', 'The
President's Analyst' (very funny, and highly 
reccomended), and many others.
