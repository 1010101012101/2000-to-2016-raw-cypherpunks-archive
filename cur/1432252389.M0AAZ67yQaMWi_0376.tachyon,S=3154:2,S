Not my problem. If the Viet Cong wanted to free themselves from Ho or 
Thieu or Diem or Lyndon, not my problem.

And anyone using force to take my money to pay for such a war is 
aggressing against me.

Crapola about "just wars" is just statist nonsense.

Not my problem. The Jews in Germany and Poland should have fought their 
oppressors instead of twirling their sidelocks and rocking and 
spinning...that they were slaughtered is, repeat after me, NOT MY 
PROBLEM.

Your proposal in this thread and others to fight "just wars" means you 
are still the socialist you said you were in your earlier years, albeit 
now worshipping Rand and Reagan instead of Ho and Che and Mao.

There has not been a "just war" involving America since 1776. And maybe 
1812, though that was really just a minor skirmish.

Stop yammering about using force to take my money and my time to 
support your "just causes" and "just wars."

Better yet, why don't you just _ENLIST_ in the U.S. Army and go to 
Baghdad to implement your principles?
