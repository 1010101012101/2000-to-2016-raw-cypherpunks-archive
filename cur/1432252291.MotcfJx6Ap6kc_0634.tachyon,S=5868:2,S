	I didn't say limitless. If it sounded that way, let me rephrase to : 

	Governments can spend a lot more money than a 'for-profit' enterprise in a
(hypothetical) free market. Private firms go bankrupt. Governments and
their 'agencies' usually don't.
	
	I'd be surprised if you disagreed too much with that =P

	I didn't say it's direct proof. I do say they are (highly) suspect. But
that was an aside. 


	My point here is that the assertion (paraphrasing) 

	"the nsa doesn't play the global passive adversary game against tor" is
unfounded. 

	Schneier flatly said "they can't break tor" - which is something you don't
even agree as far as I can tell, but you regard as too costly (rather than
impossible)

	Yes, I want to write a one time pad for an arm microcontroller (in
assembler) - OK, that doesn't fix the traffic analysis problem that  tor is
supposed to address, but seems to be a nice solution for encryption that
even the NSA can't break =P
