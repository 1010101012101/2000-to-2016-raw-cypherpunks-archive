One of the most frequent sights on kuro5hin is that of one user or group of 
users complaining, often loudly and viciously, about another. One need not 
look very hard in order to find scores upon scores of users who absolutely 
loathe each other. Thanks to this pre-existing community of people who hate 
each other passionately, I believe that we stand on a potentially lucrative 
and far-reaching social experiment: the Distributed Denial of Existence.

A foolish Constitutional inconsistency is the hobgoblin of freedom, adored 
by judges and demagogue statesmen.
