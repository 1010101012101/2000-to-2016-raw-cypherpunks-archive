Excerpt:

In addition, Aimster is attempting to shield itself behind the very law
the entertainment industry has used to
                go after file-swapping company Napster. The Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a controversial law
                backed by music companies and other large copyright
holders, prohibits anyone from cracking code
                designed to protect copyrights. Aimster, which
incorporated an encryption scheme into a new version
                released Wednesday, hopes that provision applies to it
as well.

                Aimster spokesman Johnny Deep said the new encryption
plan was created to protect the service and its
                members from anyone who wants to monitor the network.

                "The encryption technology makes it a federal crime to
spam or monitor the network," Deep said, adding
                that it could affect record companies. "We didn't do it
to shut them out, but I don't think there will be any
                way to distinguish between" spammers and record labels.
