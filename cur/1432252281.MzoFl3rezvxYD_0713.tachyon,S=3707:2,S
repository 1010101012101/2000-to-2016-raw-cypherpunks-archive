May the farce be with you
August 27 2002

More than 70,000 Australians identified their religion as Jedi, Jedi Knight 
or Jedi-related in last year's national census.
The high number of Jedi-related religions was a response to an email 
published before the census calling on Star Wars fans to state Jedi as 
their religion.
"If there are enough people in the country, about 10,000, who put down the 
same religion, it becomes a fully recognised and legal religion," the email 
said.

Faith based vouchers anyone?
