Yes, Incognito is correct. But what you need for experiencing
the real thing is this little bag of rainbows which Guiliani and
Pataki and Bush hand out to special visitors. I grabbed a bunch
of these grandiloquenizers from Red Cross which freely 
dispenses them to the cadaver bits mongerers.

The NY Times reports today how hard it is to get on the WTC
site if you are not a celebrity, a friend of the Mayor or Governor,
or a source of funds to rebuild the profanely sacred site. Not 
even the press can break the embargo, unless a press celeb.

The terrorism nuttiness extends to the American Institute of 
Architects who, the Times reports today, is issuing a warning 
to its members not to disclose building information. I don't
belong to that fruitcake-cartel which is about as courageous
as City and State and Federal officials when it comes to
guarding its nearly worthless information. AIA does only
what it takes to get its members jobs. I tried to do volunteer
work for the local AIA chapter surveying buildings around 
WTC, but later learned that its program is open only to 
members seeking paid work at the disaster. 

I was at the WTC site following a volunteer inspection of
a local terrified office renter who called the AIA for assistance 
and was given a list of expensive architects whose fees 
have jumped, and told no volunteers available. Word of
mouth got me. And I got to the WTC for excellent payment.
