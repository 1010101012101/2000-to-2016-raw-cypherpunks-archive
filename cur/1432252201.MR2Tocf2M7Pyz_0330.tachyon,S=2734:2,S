What's wrong with these things?   They're not fraud.

Which trivially eliminates your objections to the user thinking
something
is wrong.

Yes.  The company *should* swap scratched originals to preserve this
backup right,
but I don't think they're legally required to.  And the company won't be
around forever,
whereas backups can, so the swapping plan is inferior.

*However*, as incrementally clever as this scheme is, it is succeptible
to a CD dupe program that is bit for bit correct, no?

And since the protected software *checks* the CD for the errors, than a
CD bit-for-bit
copier *must* be able to be written, no?   Or is there a problem writing
intentional-errors
on consumer-grade CD burners?   (If so, this is a good marketing tool;
if not, this is going
to be cracked.)
