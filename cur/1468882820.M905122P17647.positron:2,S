The Chinese are pro-China, but they recognize that the US is a very large
market for Chinese goods, and for now their economy is built on exports.
Whatever they may think of the US or Europe, our fortunes are tied together
by trade unless/until they decide to become "self-sufficient," which works
both ways. When this starts to happen, war may not be too far behind.

Exactly. But yeah, 7%. They may be the largest FOREIGN debt holder, which
I'm pretty sure is what Trump actually means.

Yep, just bookkeeping tricks. But yeah, didn't protect the banks back in
the days (1990s) when they weren't allowed to branch across state lines,
were required to hold a large fraction of their debt in their own state's
bonds, and states kept defaulting. And it means a US government "default"
will have interesting consequences.

Not even really stealing. The Chinese people already paid for it by keeping
their goods cheap for us 'muricans. They're basically American taxpayers
for all intents and purposes.

It's hard to blame Trump for believing that the problem with the national
debt is that the US owes a bunch of people money, and therefore the
solution is to negotiate some sort of settlement whereby the US pays less
than face value on its debt. But not blaming him and thinking he's
qualified to be President with such a view are completely separate things.

The problem is not that the US has too much debt. The problem is that the
US is running out of credit. And by "credit" I mean generically *trust.* No
negotiated settlement can recover lost credit. Quite the contrary; if the
US is going to saber-rattle in order to avoid paying what it's promised to
pay despite having its debts denominated in its own currency, that can only
hurt the US's credit with other countries.

Debt is also not the only promise the US federal government, to say nothing
of state and local governments, have made that they are going to have
trouble keeping. There's a bunch of other mandatory spending that's growing
every year faster than GDP with no plan to reduce it: pension obligations,
social security, medicare, welfare. 2/3 of the Federal budget is mandatory
spending. Half of discretionary spending would have to be cut in order to
balance the budget. Half of discretionary spending goes to the military.
And of course, huge cuts like that will also cut into revenue, at least in
the short term, while doing nothing to actually reduce the governments'
unfunded liabilities.

That said, the US is actually in fantastic shape compared to most of the
"developed" world. So interest rates remain low for the US because it's the
nicest house in a really shitty neighborhood. Dark times are ahead for the
entire developed world unless economic growth rates come up quite a bit.
