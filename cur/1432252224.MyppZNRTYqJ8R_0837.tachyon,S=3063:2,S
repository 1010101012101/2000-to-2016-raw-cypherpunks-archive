Hitler wasn't the only one who thought he was a good guy. He was a
Catholic in good standing throughout his life, and viewed extermination
of Jews as holy work. After the failed assassination attempt in 1939,
when Hitler's views on and plans for Jews were widely known, the Pope
send him congratulations, and several cardinals and bishops were also
pleased.

Nor are they transitive. See above.
