http://www.terry.uga.edu/~selgin/#free_banking Better looking than 
Faustines fat apologist for the NWO of corporate fascism.Also some 
interesting reading for e-cash minded C/punks.Reminded me of a bank that

"The claim that monetary systems can function smoothly in the absence of 
government regulations sometimes raises the question, Why do governments 
intervene in money? Although economic misunderstanding and pressure from 
special interests within the banking industry account for many observed 
forms of intervention, Lawrence White and I suggest, in our forthcoming 
Economic Inquiry paper, "A Fiscal Theory of Government's Role in Money," 
that government intervention in the money industry has largely been a 
result of fiscal pressures to extract revenue from money holders. "

They cant tax the web so I guess crypto-anarchy is not a question of 
if,now,but when.BUMs on seats.
Throughout the Western world,

period of continuous merrymaking & zerowork.
