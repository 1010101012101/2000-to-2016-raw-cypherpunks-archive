The Talent Myth
Interesting article on the disconnect between performance and performance 
analysis
( Malcolm Gladwell via New Yorker )

They don't like it up 'em
Article about the US media's 'sinister' reaction to John Pilger's recent 
commentaries in the Daily Mirror
( Roy Greenslade via Guardian )
See also this Independent article from yesterday, and this Pilger article 
from earlier this month

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies
Article about the Terrorism Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a US 
Justice Dept initiative which aims to recruit millions of US citizens - 
'primarily from among those whose work provides access to homes, businesses 
or transport systems' - to act as a volunteer network of informants
( Ritt Goldstein via Sydney Morning Herald )
Goldstein has an unusual background - in 1997, following a campaign of 
police harassment, he fled to Sweden, becoming 'the only American in the 
world seeking political asylum'; see this Guardian article from 2000, and 
this Guardian article from last year

Bush recount troops land plum DC jobs
Article about the high number of campaign workers who received posts in the 
Bush administration following their participation in the Florida recount
