Previously I whined that USA.net was changing the URLs
in received email to proxy through their server, meaning
they had logs of all URLs you visited when clicking on
hyperlinks while reading your personal email.

That this violates their own privacy policy.

For some reason Declan failed to report it. ;-)
Analog film chemicals must be affecting his judgement.

New note: if you bookmark the URL in the personal email someone
sent you, it bookmarks it at the USA.net address.

----

Here is the resulting URL in the new window USA.net opens
when you click on an URL in your email:

http://www.netaddress.com/tpl/Info/Popup?hidden___url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F

I just tried scooping it and using it directly, trying amazon here.

It worked.

Anyone have direct access to their own server logs?
What cookies/referrals/misc is logged on the receiving system?

Continue clicking, and it's still via USA.net.

It looks like a free "anonymizer" to me.
