Sorry about that.

I don't think that works very well. When you send some hop by hop
padding, every node downstream would be able to tell that some delay
occured somewhere upstream in the connection. So if either the receiver
(the last node) or the next to last node is compromised, the attacker
would be able to trace the caller by correlating between delays in the
network and where hop by hop padding occurs.
