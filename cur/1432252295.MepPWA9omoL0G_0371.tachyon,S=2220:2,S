https is like a strong fortress wall that only goes half way
around the fortress.

The most expensive and inconvenient part of https, getting
certificates from verisign, is fairly useless.

The useful part of https is that it has stopped password
sniffing from networks, but the PKI part, where the server, but
not the client, is supposedly authenticated, does not do much
good.
