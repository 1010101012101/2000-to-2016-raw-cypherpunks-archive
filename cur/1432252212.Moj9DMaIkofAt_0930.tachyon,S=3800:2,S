Overkill is a rational and appropriate response to recent revelations.  
NIST is actually out to get you, so you might as well put on a tinfoil 
hat to be on the safe side.  Yes, there really is a gigantic government 
conspiracy, no kidding.

While I am pretty sure AES and SHA 256 is perfectly safe, in view of 
recent events, I would follow the lead of the highly competent 
cryptographer Jon Callas, 
http://www.mail-archive.com/infowarrior@attrition.org/msg10926.html and 
use non NIST algorithms:

Use Twofish in place of AES if convenient to do so, and Skein hash in 
place of SHA hash.
