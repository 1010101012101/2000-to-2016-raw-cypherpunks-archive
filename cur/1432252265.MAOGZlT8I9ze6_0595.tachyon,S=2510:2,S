Clarke confirms disappearance, and reappearance, of ID cards
By John Oates (john.oates at theregister.co.uk)
Published Wednesday 6th April 2005 15:15 GMT

Home Secretary Charles Clarke has confirmed that controversial legislation
to introduce ID cards has been shelved.

But he said the ID card bill would be included in the Labour Party's
manifesto, published early next week, and would be an early priority for
the next Parliament should Labour win the election.

Clarke blamed the Tories for the failure of the bill. He said their lack of
support forced him to ditch the bill. The Tories rejected this and pointed
out that the government chose how much legislation to include in the
Queen's speech as well as the date of the General Election..
