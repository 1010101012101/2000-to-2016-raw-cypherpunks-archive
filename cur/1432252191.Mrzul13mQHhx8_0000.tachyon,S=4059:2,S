That's actually a misrepresentation. What you are proposing is nothing
more than more 'freedom for me, not for thee'. Why?

Simply, your argument is,

-	It's personaly inconvenient, I want it thusly.

-	Because it's inconvenient then it should conform
	(too much ST perhaps?)

-	So, let's move the 'inconvenience' off on another party so
	I'm not bothered.

-	Never mind the effect on them.

It's a bullshit line of reasoning. It's self-absorbed, rude, and
socialist (in the sense of coerced monotonic behaviour).

As to those who threaten to kill-file such participants, this says more
about the kill-filer than the kill-filee.

The only requirement ANY participant in this community or any other should
have is to be fair and considerate of others and a willingness to
participate in a dialectic. Conformity or consensus are not required (and
are really detrimental). Whether a particular post conforms to some
'format' is really a moot point.

This is supposed to be an anarchy, yet the leaders of the 'conformity
clique' are supposedly anarchist themselves. How odd...
