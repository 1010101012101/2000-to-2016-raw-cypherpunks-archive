This just shifting the issue without actually solving it - instead of mint
visibility now we have credential issuer visibility. There goes credential
issuer.

The basic point here is that:

a) most "public" (including me and the few that I talked with) will not "trust"
money that is pure math, without actual *people* (who can be pulped if
something goes wrong) behind it. Pulpability (in this special meaning) is a key
ingredient in trust - you trust someone that agrees to be hurt if she misuses
the trust. Fuck the math, new advances happen and most do not understand it any
way.

b) The competition (government) will pulp the pulpable mint.

So, n-way blind e-cash will never happen. It may be a nice thing to bullshit
about and to do PhD thesis and patents on and thus attract chicks, but it will
never happen.
