Nice attempt at satire.

However, Afghanistan is almost the only country left
in the world where international copyright laws 
essentially don't apply.

They're not signatories to ANY treaties I could find
administered by WIPO, including the Berne and Paris 
conventions.  They're not part of the WTO or World 
Bank or NATO, or even the League of Arab States.  

In short, RIAA can take their legalese and shove
it up their intellectually protected arse, as
far as Afghanistan is concerned.

See http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/okbooks.html
for more on copyright and different laws in different
countries.  

For an extract of Afghanistan's 1950 copyright
law, see UNESCO's content at:
http://www.unesco.org/culture/copy/copyright/afghanistan/sommaire.html

I'd say the chances of even their law (which is very
slack by modern standards) still being enforced by
whomever is in charge in AF are slim to nil.
  -- Greg

PS: If you think this means AF is a "music haven"
where the rest of the world could go to host,
republish or redistribute content that's under
copyright elsewhere, sorry.  This would only apply
if you wanted to spend the rest of your life there,
because as soon as you left and arrived at, say,
a signatory to the new WIPO copyright treaty, you'd
find yourself Skylarov'd.

PPS:  Number of .af hosts listed at Netcraft = 1 (http://www.nic.af)

PPPS: Number of functional .af hosts listed at Netcraft = 0
