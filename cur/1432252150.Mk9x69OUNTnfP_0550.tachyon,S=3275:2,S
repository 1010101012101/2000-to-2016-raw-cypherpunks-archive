 >>...Think of a combination of Fama/Black, et. al's early 1980's notion of 
"new"
monetary economics coupled with an index of (bearer-held :-)) assets in
transit and in wearhouses, along with commodities, plus the usual equity
and debt mixture. Pretty much what the fed does now, only the index will be
sold, just like the S&P is now. When IBUC's site's back up, I'll point to 
an essay I did on it a couple of
years ago... Cheers,

Extract.

If Barter Units Money or BUMs take off and are pegged to the 
Dollar/Euro/Yen,then sooner or later Something like this will be necessary 
as State sanctioned currencies wither away.Thanks RAH.Kill the President 
and VIVA Argentina LIBRE!

Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.
