Nah!!!! Just pure old fashioned incompetence...

Running all the way for "Bagdad" Rumsfeld on sleep inibition drugs takes it's 
toll...

Take for example this small news:
A group of looters tried to loot a small shop. The shopkeeper's son armed with 
a kalachnikov made them run away.
What they did next? Well, went to a platoon of marines and told they knew 
where was a a Fedahin Militia with a Kalachnikov...

The kid was shot with automatic weapon fire at sight without even been 
questioned or the information confirmed.

The marines are so tired that they don't even think right...

(Just being cynical, people..)

Now that they are at target, they just want a good night's sleep... No time 
for civilian patrol...

But you could be right. But it also seems to me that this is the perfect 
oportunity to ramsack the ministries of all information, dossiers and 
contacts related to terrorism and arab nations and still leave the doubt to 
those people that all your references in the iraqui system were lost and out 
of american hands, during the ministry and public fires...

Creating doubt to the ennemy in an inteligence operation sometimes gives you 
the edge you need to achieve your goals...
