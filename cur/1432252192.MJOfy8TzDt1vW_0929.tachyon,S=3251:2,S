Think of gun ownership as innoculation.  Highly-vaccinated populations are
not as succeptible to plagues as unvaccinated populations.  There is a slight
risk in getting innoculated, but (because of decreased populatiton
permeability)
there is also a network ('fax') effect where the more innoculated, the better
for all (even the unvaccinated).  Gun:Criminal::Vaccine:Pathogen
