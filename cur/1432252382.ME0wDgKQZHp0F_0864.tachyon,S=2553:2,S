An authoring disc can be played like a regular disc and it has the
extra information that is needed to create a CSS disc, but it does not
actually have the CSS information in the place where standard DVD
players will read it.  To create an actual CSS-encrypted disc you need
to have a glass master created and DVDs pressed.

See:

"It should be noted, however, that CSS encryption cannot be used with
either type of DVD-R media."
