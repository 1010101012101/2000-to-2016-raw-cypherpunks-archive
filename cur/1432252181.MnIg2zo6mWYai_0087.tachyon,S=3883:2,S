Subject: Re:  coderpunks spam


I'm willing to host a new list, or a companion list.  I can serve as
moderator of the new list, if no one else wants the job or objects.
I'm also willing to run a companion web site with an archive and a
copy of advogato if people are interested in that.

I proposed once before that mlm software be put in place so that
coderpunks would only accept PGP signed messages from subscribers
and messages from anonymous remailers.  I'm still interested in
working cryptography into the mlm that the list runs on at some
time, although not in the immediate future.

I have benefited greatly from technical discussion lists on
cryptography implementation while working on my own projects.
I'm about to start working rather heavily in PKI and would
like to enjoy the benefits I saw from coderpunks and other
technical forms continued and expanded.

If no one objects, let's move ahead with this.  I've been thinking
of unsubscribing myself from coderpunks because of all the spam.

I intend to run the lists from my personal web site, cryptnet.net,
which has T1 bandwidth (burstable to more than) and runs on a
linux machine running sendmail which has adequate process power
to deliver mail in a reasonable amount of time to > 1000 people.

Should the lists be separate or joined?
