Chidanand Rajghatta muses about the Indian legacy in mathematics following=
=20
the latest number crunching feat from Kanpur
On the subject of mathematics, there are two kinds of people =96 the number=
=20
crunchers and the number crunchees i.e., those who can crunch numbers with=
=20
great facility, and those who get crunched by numbers.
There are those of you who love to develop your quadriceps with quadratic=20
equations and have binomial theorem for breakfast. Then there are those of=
=20
us, who, faced with simple multiplication tables, have to lie down with a=20
cold wet towel on our forehead.
Where do you think you belong?
There is a widespread belief that we Indians have a yen for numbers. It=20
might not entirely be true. There are plenty of people even in Bharatvarsh=
=20
who will subscribe to Bill Clinton=92s jocular admonition that folks across=
=20
the world would have been perfectly happy if Bhaskara and Brahmagupta had=20
kept their works to themselves.
Still, in the same spirit that contrived the number zero and the value pi,=
=20
it turns out that Indians are still contributing significantly to the world=
=20
of numbers even now, odd exceptions notwithstanding.
The announcement this week that three mathematicians from the Indian=20
Institute of Technology, Kanpur, have devised a method (or arrived as a=20
algorithm , in mathematese) to determine whether a number is prime or not=20
has created quite a flutter (or a quiet flutter) in the world of numbers.
Prime numbers, for those of us mathematically challenged, are those that=20
are divisible only by itself or by one. Although it sounds simple enough,=20
it=92s quite a task to determine what mathematicians call the =93primality=
=94 of=20
a number. For instance, is 4958372640287988786544 a prime number?
Of course, the more facetious among us can say -- does it really matter?=20
Apparently it does in ways that we may not immediately comprehend, like for=
=20
instance, in determining whether the bristles on the toothbrush hurts our=20
gums. That=92s a joke. But you get the point.
Some applications are not immediately apparent to the matho-phobics. One of=
=20
the applications of prime numbers is in the world of cryptography i.e=20
encryption and code breaking, which may be evident if you read the secret=20
passage hidden in the preceding paragraph. That=92s another joke. Read on.
For years then, mathematicians have wrestled with ways to determine the=20
primality of numbers. There are established methods, but they pose=20
problems. One method can determine with absolute accuracy whether a number=
=20
if prime or not, but it is a laborious process.
Another method can determine the primality of a number far more quickly,=20
but with a small probability of error, leading to what Prof Krishnaswami=20
Alladi, a leading US-based mathematician calls, =93industrial grade prime=20
number.=94
What Messrs Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena of the IIT=20
Kanpur did was to arrive at a algorithm that helped determine the primality=
=20
of a number accurately and quickly. But more of that later.
Prof Alladi is one of the legatees of India=92s great tradition in the field=
=20
of numbers that begins with Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. Currently Chairman=20
of the Department of Maths at the University of Florida in Gainesville, he=
=20
is an authority on the works of Ramanujan, and he edits a publication=20
called The Ramanujam Journal that deals with the areas the great man worked=
=20
in and influenced.
Prof Alladi=92s grandfather was part of the group that gave India another=20
remarkable document: the Indian Constitution.
Like Prof Alladi, several other illustrious mathematicians of Indian origin=
=20
live in America, none more renowned than Prof Harish Chandra, who had a=20
distinguished career at Princeton before his death in 1996. The current=20
heads of the mathematics department at the University of Minnesota (Prof=20
Naresh Jain) and McGill University (Prof K.N.Gowrisankaran) are also=20
Indians, and there are numerous others crunching away quietly in other=20
groves of academia.
But what the latest feat illustrates is that you don=92t have to be in=20
America to hit the bull=92s eye. Having devised their primality test, the=20
three Indians put their algorithm up on the IIT Kanpur website and e-mailed=
=20
last Sunday it to well-known mathematicians across the world. Among the=20
recipients of this e-mail was Prof Carl Pomerance at Bell Labs, an=20
authority on prime numbers.
No sooner had he seen the algorithm , Prof Pomerance discussed the draft=20
with colleagues over lunch, and arranged an impromptu seminar on the=20
subject the same afternoon. Within hours, the gathering validated the=20
algorithm . =93We were all quite excited about it,=94 Prof Pomerance told=
 this=20
correspondent in an interview on Thursday. =93They had solved the problem=20
quite elegantly and arrived at beautiful result.=94
The remarks were typical of math aficionados, who see beauty and elegance=20
in numbers and equations that we number =93crunchees=94 see in words and=
 phrases.
Mathematicians can also be delightfully quirky. We of course know the=20
famous episode how Ramanujan, receiving Prof Hardy by his hospital bed,=20
startled him by analysing impromptu the properties of his taxi cab number.
Prof Pomerance is a mathematician in the same vein. One of his papers,=20
published in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics, revolves around the=20
interesting properties of the numbers 714 and 715, which was the number of=
=20
home runs scored by Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron respectively.
But to return to the story, there are two striking aspects to the IIT-ians=
=20
prime numbers saga. One is how quickly the algorithm was shared across the=
=20
world and validated by peers, thanks to the Internet. (Ironically, the=20
so-called primality testing plays a crucial role in the widely used RSA=20
algorithm, which is used to secure transactions over the Internet).
In fact, attending Prof Pomerance seminar on Monday was Anupam Gupta, a=20
computer scientist at Bell Labs who happens to work just down the corridor=
=20
from the mathematician. Gupta is also from IIT-Kanpur, but he did not know=
=20
the prime numbers trio. What he did recognise was the beauty of their=20
algorithm . =93It was so simple and elegant that even I, more a computer=20
scientist than a mathematician, could understand and appreciate it,=94 he=
 said.
The second aspect of course is the longevity of the Indian legacy. Whether=
=20
in India or in the United States, our mathematical bequest is alive and=20
ticking (or clicking), and thanks to the Internet, the boundaries are even=
=20
fewer than when Ramanujan shared his genius with the west.
So now we know and can rest assured: Some day, there will be a paper on the=
=20
properties of Tendulkar=92s final tally. India still has the number on math.
HALlo!
