   I suppose the repression shit will really
hit the fan now, so, are all the good little
cyber scouts prepared to do their duty? 
  Recall previous threads on non-internet
dependant messaging systems. Work on the
"parasitic wireless network", revive Fidonet
in a new, digital format. And in the old
string and tin can format if need be. Get
that remailer code intertwinned with mojo,
create a virus version, modify code red
to spread remailers everywhere. 
   I hope no one here is silly enough
to think the BOR will survive this. Who
knows -- the US gov maybe engineered the
whole thing. Remember the Pentagon plan
to shoot down an airliner. Go watch
"Wag the Dog" also be sure to watch
the director's commentary on the dvd
version of that.
