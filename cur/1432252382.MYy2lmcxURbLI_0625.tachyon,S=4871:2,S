Genetically modified crops may pass helpful traits to weeds, study finds
'For the first time, researchers have shown that a gene artificially 
inserted into crop plants to fend off pests can migrate to weeds in a 
natural environment and make the weeds stronger. Scientists studied 
genetically engineered sunflowers - those modified with a gene that 
produces a chemical toxic to certain insects - to see what happened when 
these foreign genes, called transgenes, were inadvertently passed along to 
weedy relatives' ( Ohio State )
