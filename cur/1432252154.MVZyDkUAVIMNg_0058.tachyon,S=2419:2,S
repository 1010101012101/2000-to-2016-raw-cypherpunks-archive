That thread bores me to tears.

I miss technical content. Or, at least, a few pointers of where the action
is. I'm tinkering with Nehemiah's RNG (/dev/hw_random is next to useless
without a patch), and about to start using PadLock patches, once C5P hardware
arrives. I'm also going to look into OpenBSD, once 3.6 is up on mirrors.

What is happening in TCP/IP level traffic remixing? P2P apps? Can someone in
the know provide a boilerplate, or at least a list of raw URLs?
