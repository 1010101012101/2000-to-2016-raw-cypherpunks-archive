you don't have to use this feature.  i just sent some coin back to
originating wallet on command line some hours ago, in fact. (and many
wallet services, as much as i hate them, can also do this for you as
transfer option.)

the issue is that anonymity loves company. so those that need it badly
also need those who care less to use it for best effectiveness.  e.g.
NSA may be hacking Tor users, but NSA is also a Tor user!   the bomb
hoax debacle, etc.

that said, the rest of your argument i am in agreement with.  the
existing techniques suck, privacy is too expensive, and myriad well
intention-ed idiots are pissing in the pool already filled with IC
dookie.



best regards,
