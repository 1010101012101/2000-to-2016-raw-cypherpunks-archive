if  terrorists used compression instead of
cryptography,it is not possible to determine that they
are terrorists in the first place. If some one knows
that,the given person is a terrorist,you can bust him
whether or not he uses cryptography.Just because 
terrorist uses cryptograhy, doesn't allow others to
identify him as a terrorist and if you cant identify a
terrorist,it is immaterial that he uses crypto or not.

This never should be the reason for govt. to moderate
cryotography in the future.
