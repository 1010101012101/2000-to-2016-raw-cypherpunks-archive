This doesn't follow.

Can someone explain how finding regularity in the distribution of primes

would affect any modexp() system?   Suppose that you have a function
F(i) which gives you the i-th prime.  Since the PK systems (eg RSA, DH)
use *randomness* to pick primes, how does being able to generate
the i-th prime help?

Methinks the "expert" du Sautoy is an expert in number theory, not
crypto...

Most managers don't understand crypto.

I think this latter indicates the cluelessness of the author.
