 | DNSBL for known intelligence community IPs? Sure they rotate a lot, but
 | if we can make the cost of doing business higher and higher with no real
 | benefit, someone should eventually cut the funding. Start tracking what
 | companies are providing IP services via contract and then blacklist the
 | IP blocks of those companies. I really don't care if I ever get an
 | email from Stratfor or they ever visit any of my sites.

 | Had the idea all of about 60 seconds before trying to write it down, so
 | I am sure I am forgetting something (or somethings).
