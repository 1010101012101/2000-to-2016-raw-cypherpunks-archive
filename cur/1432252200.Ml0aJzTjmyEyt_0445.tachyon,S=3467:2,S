Please remove my name or identifying information if forwarding this to
IP or elsewhere.  I work closely enough to this industry to fear
repercussions.

Yes.  This is one of the technologies used on the Pentium D:

http://www.intel.com/standards/case/case_dtcp.htm

It embeds a private key in each CPU.  The key cannot be directly
extracted, only used for signature and decryption operations.  The
idea is that your computer receives encrypted data from the set-top
box, and can route it to a variety of other targets---but it's always
encrypted when it leaves.  So that might include other PCs in your
home, or a television, or a monitor, or a storage device.  It even
works over IP, counting hops to ensure it doesn't leave your home.

There is a similar technology by Macrovision which appears to also be
supported.

So does it *contain* DRM?  Well, if DRM is policy, no.  Does it
contain content-protection technology?  Absolutely.  Does it contain
technology to help restrict you from using media you purchased in
accordance in fair and legal ways?  Yes.
