Sony loses appeal in PlayStation copyright fight 
By Bloomberg News October 2, 2000, 9:15 a.m. PT 

WASHINGTON--Sony today lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to limit rivals from using reverse engineering to create competing products. 

The justices, without comment, refused to consider Sony's appeal of a decision rejecting its copyright claims against Connectix,
whose Virtual Game Station competes with Sony's top-selling PlayStation game console. 

<SNIP>

Heh - apparently the judge decided that it's okay to allow reverse 
engineering in this case.  Wonder how this will affect DeCSS...
