I've had a Sima SCC for over six months.  It works flawlessly on every DVD I've thrown at it.

works out there. 

I tried DivX but later changed to sVCD.  At the higher bit rates its virtually broadcast quality, much better than VHS (even S-VHS), and you can cut CDs to play on many home theater DVDs and on any Windows laptop using PowerDVD.  Great for time shifting your DVD rentals ;-)
