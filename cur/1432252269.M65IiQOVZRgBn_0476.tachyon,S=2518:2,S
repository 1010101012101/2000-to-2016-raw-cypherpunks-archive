There ya go, conflating academic subjects with physical phenomena, again.
Physics, physical phenomena, causes ideas, not the other way around.

Because the code didn't work. That's why.

Syntactically it compiled, semantically, it failed in the "usefulness" step.

So. Again. Sue everyone you want. Pass all the laws you want. Send all the
people to jail you want.

If someone writes code (physics), and it makes enough money (finance), then
the laws will change (legislation, politics), and people will change their
minds (philosophy, ethics, religion).

Physics causes Finance, which causes Philosophy.

Got it?

Cheers,
