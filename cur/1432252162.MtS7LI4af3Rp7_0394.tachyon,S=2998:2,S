deal with encryption: by breaking into a suspect's home or office, 
implanting keystroke-logging software, and spying on what happens from afar.

An agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration persuaded a federal 
judge to authorize him to sneak into an Escondido, Calif., office 
believed to be a front for manufacturing the drug MDMA, or Ecstasy. The 
DEA received permission to copy the hard drives' contents and inject a 
keystroke logger into the computers.

That was necessary, according to DEA Agent Greg Coffey, because the 
suspects were using PGP and the encrypted Web e-mail service 
Hushmail.com. Coffey asserted that the DEA needed "real-time and 
meaningful access" to "monitor the keystrokes" for PGP and Hushmail 
passphrases.
