Checking the first 20 bytes just means the spammer will just add 20 bytes of
junk to the start of their message.

Spammers unfortunately, can be pretty smart, look at all the work they will
do to cull addresses from newsgroups and mail lists, even looking for
"mailto:fred@NOSPAM.fff.com (Remove NOSPAM to send me a message)" type
addresses.

Better to have it run the message through the encryption program (PGP or
Mix) somehow to see if it is a well formed (contains valid packets).

Of course that means restricting users to PGP or other standard encryption
systems

(I can see it now, all SPAM will arrive starting with "------ BEGIN PGP
ENCRYPTED MESSAGE ----")

:)

I always liked the proposal of using crypto to force users pay money to have
the message sent, then be refunded if the recipient feels the message was
worthwhile.
