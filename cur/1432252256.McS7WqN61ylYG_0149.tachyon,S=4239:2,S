I've looked at that, but I'm unsure about it...  the problem is that 
if not enough people have it you're out of range - but if too many 
people have it, you're choked for bandwidth and get interference 
problems.  

With a range of a few hundred feet to a few miles, routing can also 
become problematic. 

It would be nice though: a $100 'packet box' for each station, that 
allows you to set up independent IP connections with your neighbors. 
If you can get them common enough, it would be impossible to cut 
someone off by cutting their ISP access -- 'cause out in the wild, 
a packet is a packet is a packet, and if all the stations run IP 
protocol, even if every ISP in the world rejects a packet, it could 
still make its way across any continent in short hops from station 
to station. 

And this is not just an anti-censorship thing, either; this is 
more properly a tool for 24/7 uptime for people who can't afford 
t3's and can't get PacBell's attention to fix their damn line in 
the first minute after it goes down. I can picture that sales 
pitch appealing to a lot of home businesses who get cut off from 
their DSL connection for a week at a time while PacBell pulls its 
head out of its collective ass. Or Cinci Bell, or Southern Bell, 
or NTT, or Deutsche Telecomm, or whoever serves their area. 

I like it.  Every station an ISP.
