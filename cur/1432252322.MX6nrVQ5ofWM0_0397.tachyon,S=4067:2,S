Nice thought, but I'll bet it wouldn't happen in a million years. 

And speaking generally on the subject of various people "concealing 
actions", could I just say that I think any company working in this sector 
would be well-advised to take good, hard second look at their internal 
security practices. "Insider threat mitigation" should be every bit as much 
of a concern to you as it is to the DoD. Maybe more so. Their unholy 
quartet of "maliciousness, disdain for security procedures, carelessness, 
and ignorance" applies to your insiders too. It wouldn't hurt anything to 
run a tighter ship, either: what are you doing to get to know who you're 
really working with? What are you doing to ensure you aren't trusting your 
trade secrets to shitheels who'll sell out crucial elements of your design 
to the first person who waves a few dollar bills under their nose? Not 
making any claims about who's doing the selling, who's doing the buying or 
why. But something seriously reeks in Denmark and as a community you really 
need to think about it a little harder.
