Accoring to Snowden, Greenwald, et al, Snowden has nothing to
trade for asylum:  Everyone in a position to know says that he
gave the whole works to Greenwald & co., to use as he sees fit.
That does not make their assertion true, but as far as I know, no
evidence contradicts it.

Other than Cryptome's blanket warning that /all/ leaked documents
should be treated as disinformation, limited hangouts, etc. until
or unless proven otherwise.

Whether Snowden intended to do that, or was conned into doing so
by his press contacts, remains an open question.

Calling evidence based analysis of the Snowden Affair "conspiracy
theory" does not make it go away.  Least of all, when the audience
understands that propagandists created the Conspiracy Theory meme
for 'name calling' purposes, to stain inconvenient information as
delusional nonsense.

Greenwald converted the Snowden documents from State secrets owned
by the U.S. government, to commercial trade secrets owned by
billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  Their new owners have published a
fraction of those documents for financial profit and, of course,
political propaganda.  I do not expect anything in those documents
that would have an unfavorable impact on billionaires in general
or Omidyar in particular to be published.

When is a leak not a leak?  I'm not sure, but the Snowden Affair
looks like an example.
