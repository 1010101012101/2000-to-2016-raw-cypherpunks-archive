re Goker (w32.goker.a@mm)

How it works

Goker arrives as e-mail with one of the following subject
lines:

                                  If I were God and didn't belive in
myself would it be
                                  blasphemy
                                  The A-Team VS KnightRider...who would
win?
                                  Just one kiss, will make it better.
just one kiss, and we
                                  will be alright.
                                  I can't help this longing, comfort me.

                                  And I miss you most of all, my
darling...
                                  ...When autumn leaves start to fall
                                  It's dark in here, you can feel it all
around. The
                                  underground.
                                  I will always be with you sometimes
black sometimes
                                  white ...
                                  ...and there's no need to be scared,
you re always on
                                  my mind.
                                  You just take a giant step, one step
higher.
                                  The air will hold you if you try,
trust my wings of
                                  desire. Glory, Glorified...

The body of the e-mail contains one or more of the following:

             Happy Birthday
             Yeah ok, so it's not yours it's mine :)
             The horizons lean forward, offering us space to place new
steps of change.
             I like this calm, moments before the storm
             Darling, when did you fall...when was it over?
             Will you meet me...and we'll fly away?!
             You should like this, it could have been made for you
             speak to you later
             They say love is blind...well, the attachment probably
proves it.
             Pretty good either way though, isn't it?
             still cause for a celebration though, check out the details
I attached
             This made me laugh
             Got some more stuff to tell you later but I can't stop
right now
             so I'll email you later or give you a ring if thats ok?!
             Speak to you later
