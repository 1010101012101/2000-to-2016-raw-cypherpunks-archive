"Privacy questions remain

As for the chief privacy concern, that Carnivore can easily be misused by overzealous Feds examining more data than their court
orders permit, the IITRI report offers little in the way of reassurance. Basically, we have to trust the Feds not to abuse it."


...

"In other words, the Bureau's geeks are going to provide the primary fail-safe against abuse, motivated by their natural civic piety
and concerns that the collection of excess information would jeopardise a prosecution."

...

"Carnivore operators are anonymous to the system," the report says. "All users are logged in as 'administrator' and no audit trail
of actions is maintained."
