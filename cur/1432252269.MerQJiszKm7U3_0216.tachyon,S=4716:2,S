    It depends a lot on the size of the city, of course. For most 
smaller cities, none of that is needed. In the smaller cities around 
here, for example (50K-100K) the gardens are on the outskirts and there 
are no fences, etc. And the fees *should* be adequate to cover any admin 
costs. The Oshkosh community garden, for instance, is located on the 
grounds of the county work-farm, the plowing (which isn't needed, and, 
in fact, is counter-productive) and other minimal maintenance is done by 
prisoners.

     I think as Tyler has pointed out in NYC, it is the local people who 
do this themselves, it's not the gov't.

       Yes, but it doesn't have to be this way.

      Yes, there are many ways these can be set up, there's no reason it 
has to cost tax monies. OTOH, public parks and gardens are one of the 
few things that gov't does that is worthwhile, along with libraries and 
museums.
