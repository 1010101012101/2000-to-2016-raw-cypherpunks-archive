Slashdot pointed to this story of a man indicted via
his *relative's* DNA sample:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3044282.stm

But an interesting, unmentioned issue is this: in population
DNA surveys you find that a lot of purported fathers *aren't*.
So the possibility of indicting a cuckolded man on the basis
of nominal (only) relatives is quite real.
