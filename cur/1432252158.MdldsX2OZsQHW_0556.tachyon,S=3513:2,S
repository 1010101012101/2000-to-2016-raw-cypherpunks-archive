Unlikely to make CNN. A couple of raids I know about in other 
California towns, including Modesto and Taft, never got any attention 
from the national press. It takes a "high visibility" case, like the 
black actor blown away in L.A., or the black Haitian blown away in 
NYC, to generate national interest. A white guy getting shot by cops 
is just part of the business of getting rid of right wing extremists.

Amerika--obey it or leave it.
