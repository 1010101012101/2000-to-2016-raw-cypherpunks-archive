Ms Banks has confessed that her son:
* manufactures and distributes criminal DOS tools
* uses them against commercial establishments, probably across state
lines
* has broken into other computers, probably inserted and deleted
information
* has used crypto in the commission of these crimes

We are sure Ms. Banks will let our officers examine her son's computer
without the warrant she has supported.  When are you home, Ms. Banks?
Are there any firearms in the house?
