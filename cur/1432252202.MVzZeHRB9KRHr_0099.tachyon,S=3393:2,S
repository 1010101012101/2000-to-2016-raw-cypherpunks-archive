And just like Iran, it seems to be all about dead dinosaurs

It had somehow slipped my mind how 'theoildrum.com' went away, and
everyone seems to have forgotten $12/MMBTU natural gas. But now we
have a global power play that involves exporting every MMBTU that 
can be fracked and liquified to choke off Russia's economic air 
supply. Expect $15/mmbtu gas if we have another polar vortex and
$8 corn in 2015 or 2016 if this holds.

When I ran across http://oilgascoin.do.am/ (oilgascoin crypto coin)
I thought it was a sad attempt at a copycatcoin, but it's looking
more like the first sign of a cryptocurrency psy-ops arms race.
