Well, there's still the problem of private information on the server being 
leaked to the publically-accessible side. In other words, let's say I want 
to store my income on the server and then release it to certain other users 
in exchange for a payment. Of course, I could store such private information 
on my own machine, but this is problematic for several reasons (including 
the fact that I may want some of this information to be automatically 
released to anyone willing to pay the $ for it, meaaning I don't want to 
have to initiate a Tor session every few seconds).

But I definitely don't want a user to be able to extract private info 
without paying for it, and perhaps there's some info I never want released 
publically.

Now, having my admin not know who I am (or which reputation belongs to me) 
is even better, and hopefully would be solved via the same mechanism.
