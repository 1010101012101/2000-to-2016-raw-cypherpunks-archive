More great moments in civil forfeiture.  Cops entrap person.  Person kills
himself in jail, or at least, that's what the cops are reporting.  Cops
make profit of $750,000 by seizing estate using civil forfeiture laws.

No messy trial.  Cash for everyone.  Grieving parents in no mood to
quibble.

-----

NEW YORK (AP) -- The estate of a man who committed suicide in jail while
being held on drug charges has been ordered to pay $750,000 to the Nassau
County district attorney's office.
   
The ruling, part of a settlement in a civil forfeiture case, was the first
in the state in which a prosecutor sought assets from a dead person,
Newsday reported Tuesday.
   
State law allows prosecutors to seize money from convicted felons if it
can be established that the money was obtained illegally, said Rick
Henshaw, spokesman for District Attorney Denis Dillon.
   
Robert Vorbeck, 38, was arrested July 2, 1999, for allegedly selling
cocaine to undercover officers, and committed suicide in his county jail
cell 11 days later. He had faced life in prison if convicted of felony
drug charges.
   
The attorney for his estate, Steven Kessler, said Vorbeck's parents wanted
to settle.
   
''They just wanted to put this behind them, move on and grieve,'' Kessler
said.
