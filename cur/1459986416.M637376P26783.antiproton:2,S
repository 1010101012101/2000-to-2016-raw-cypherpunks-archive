Ahh, those American police, fighting for justice like the rest of us
should be. What great examples they set.

Male or female police?

Just as well you've clarified the basis of such MASTERY WITH
CAPITALISATIONS, MAKES IT REALLY CLEAR FOR ME AT LEAST, PROBABLY FOR
OTHERS TOO.

I agree with you, but it can be bloody tough getting to the point of
remaining in one's center in the face of the blatant corruption and
psychological attacks of a Magistrate or "judge".

Very good, perhaps would be useful to share some of your successes
with the rest of us. Yes, there's a whole movement which can be
googled, but I'm responding to you raising specific and personal
events - many of us are interested in actual events, in particular
successes, not hearsay.
