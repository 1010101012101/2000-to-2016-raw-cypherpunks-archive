I think its easily (if crudely) simulated thusly:

All you need is another kidbot which is 1. not controlled
by the adversary 2. eventually uses keywords that trigger the
adversary's
kidbot.  (Maybe the adversary waits for pictures before triggering?)

All in all, fine AI games one can contemplate.

One could also set up IRCs with kidbots and pedobots, in a
highly verbal and abstract game of Spot the Feds.
Robowars for counter-intel folks :-)
