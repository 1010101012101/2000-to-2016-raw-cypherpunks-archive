That's fine.  The Satisfiability problem, and in particular 3-SAT,
doesn't claim to be complete or universal.  It's just a very large and
versatile class of Booleans, but it doesn't pretend to contain
Booleans that describe encodings of their own truth values
(unlike this discussion :-)   Just things of the form
	(A1 or A2 or A3...) AND (B1 or B2 or B3...) AND ....
