I'm getting sick of calling *legal bypass* "circumvention" as if
this were a dirty word.  If I lose a key to my house it is not 
illegal to circumvent the lock.  If I need to make a backup of 
licensed data its not illegal to bypass obstacles.

"Circumvention", literally "to go around", is not illegal.  
Only unlicensed copying is.  Period.  Any prohibition on this
is "overbroad" to the point of being dead at birth.

(Not picking on Declan.  Mostly venting.)

So who arbitrates who gets to be called a "researcher"??
