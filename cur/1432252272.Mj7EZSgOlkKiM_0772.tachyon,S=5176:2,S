According to the Theorem page at:
http://www.personal.psu.edu/staff/m/j/mjd1/arrowimpossibilitytheorem.htm

I think I did not draw parallels to my writings below. The theorm seems to apply for democratic systems, but here I write about systems in general. I think we had referred to different versions of Godel's Theorem, where I use this version : "No system of rules can have both completeness and consistency (including social systems applied to humans)".

I do wish to eloborate on, concerning this Theorm (which I did know of earlier but did not write about). This shows the limitations of democratic decision making and should wake up some of those who firmly believe in democracy to the Godel's Theorem's Limitations. Hence, I hope these people will consider alternative systems which apply only selectively, such as the one I advocate (in Project Sociologistics).

Thanks for sharing this information with me anyway. I know I still have a lot to learn from all of you here.
