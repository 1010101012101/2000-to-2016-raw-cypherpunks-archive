No I did not omit this little bit. This is not the question.

Guilt or not guilt is not (supposely) decided when captured but in a 
court of law. You remember, "Justice" the thing the US supposely is 
standing for?

Whatever he did before, it does not matter at this point. At this very 
moment the people who have to abide are the victors and that means the 
US Government (and thus the US Military).

Two wrongs still don't make a right.
