I'm willing to bet that ATM machines are more wide spread and distribute
more cash now than ever before.  Anybody got real numbers for the past
few years?  A lot of those "electronic transactions" are cash advances on
credit cards.  How much cash is exchanged every day?  It must be in the
billions.  Yes, there are a lot of electronic transactions moving lots of
money.  But cash is still far more important to most people.

Patience, persistence, truth,
