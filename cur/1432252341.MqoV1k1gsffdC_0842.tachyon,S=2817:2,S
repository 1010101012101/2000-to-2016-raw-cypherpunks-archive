A covert network must meet three competing goals...

       1.Establish efficient communication and information flow within
and between many cooperating cells by minimizing path
          length throughout the network.
       2.Limit discovery and monitoring of the network from outsiders by
minimizing the number of communication links in the
          network.
       3.Limit damage when a node is discovered or removed from the
network by minimizing the number of direct ties each
          node has.

     Because of these constraints, covert networks have a different
topology than normal social networks. Illegal networks tend to
exchange efficiency for secrecy.
