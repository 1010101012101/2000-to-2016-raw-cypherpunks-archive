Subject: [liberationtech] REVIEWERS NEEDED - Safer satellite phone guide
	nearing completion

Hi all,

You may recall before the holidays I posted some questions about research
around the use of satellite phones, best security practices, etc.

I have been working on a guide providing an overview about what steps users
can take to provide a modicum of protection when using satellite phones. I
would greatly appreciate it if a few of you would offer to review the
draft, I hope to have it together by midday tomorrow, and get feedback
before the end of the week.

Do let me know if you can assist, when the final is published on our site
I'll be sure to let everyone know here.
