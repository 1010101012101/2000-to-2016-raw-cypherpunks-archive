I assume you mean "conscience," though many voters are indeed close 
to unconscious.

Anyway, where did you ever get the idea that voting is about "conscience"?

A vote is a chance to minimize damage, financial or in terms of 
freedoms, as far as I'm concerned. Voting has never been about 
"voting for the best man." It's been about evaluating the 
alternatives, estimating the rewards, payoffs, costs, and then voting.

Needless to say, any single person's vote is hardly worth spending 4 
minutes evaluating the issues.

(Beware the logical fallacy of "If _everyone_ thought that way..." 
What one person actually does in the voting booth will affect no 
other person. This is separable from what people may say on 
television that they plan to do, or say here, etc.)
