What technologies currently exist for receiving a/psuedononymous message?
With Mixmaster, sending mail, posting news, and even blog posting are
possible, However, receiving replies securely or, better, holding a private
conversation is difficult or impossible. Best bet seems is to encrypt and
spam somewhere very public? Ugly, ugly. No technological method, just a few
"trust me" remailers. Other options?
