I spent perhaps half an hour on the phone with Austin Hill this afternoon. 
Here's what we discussed.

* I suggested that Freedom had been somewhat less than successful in the 
marketplace. (Out of 3,500 cypherpunks messages I have stored here, only 
one nym appears, and this is presumably one of the target audiences.) I 
suggested that this is a change of strategy for ZKS in an era where 
investors want profitability. Austin denied it, and said that over 100 
engineers "right now" were still working on Freedom.

* I suggested the model they were moving toward was Andersen Consulting. 
Austin said no, "Verisign is the better analogy." He said one difference 
was that he anticipated ongoing licensing/fee arrangements between ZKS and 
clients after original work is complete.

* ZKS will offer to store keys. "That includes us holding encryption keys." 
Austin described the key-splitting the same way Adam has here. He refused 
to say whether or not a third-party (Joe's Escrow Service) would ever hold 
keys.

* ZKS appears to be targeting heavily-regulated areas like medical and 
financial sectors. They will come in, set up a privacy-protective system, 
perhaps provide some ongoing service, and (if so) collect ongoing fees. In 
those cases, "a consumer solution like Freedom allowing anonymity doesn't 
fit that market."

* Austin mentioned cell phones/wireless as a major area. He envisions 
services such as if you call 911, your info is revealed, but not when 
phoning other numbers.

* Tim below suggests that "Wouldn't a better approach be for Alice to 
protect her own privacy?" The answer, generally, is yes. I suspect the 
Brands patents can do much to that end. But Austin seems to be envisioning 
a market in which *some* third party in the transaction, be it a business, 
intermediary, or ZKS, possesses personal info about customers and only 
receives what is necessary.

I welcome responses.
