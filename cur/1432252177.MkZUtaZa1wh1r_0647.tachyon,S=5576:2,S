One other project to review. Back in November, one of my students at NYU ITP led the technical effort of a project called the "L Train Notwork", a temporary pirate wifi network with custom LAN-based social apps and content, that ran for a time on the New York City subway. It was a big conceptual success, and people on the train during the hours it was deployed actually used their wifi enabled devices to access content that was not otherwise available on the public internet, out of reach of censors, loggers and filters.

The happening itself was widely covered, but what was not shared widely enough, was that the code and design specs for how to build your own were also released. You can find everything you need to know at http://www.boxysean.com/projects/l-train-notwork.html and get in touch with the very talented Sean there.
