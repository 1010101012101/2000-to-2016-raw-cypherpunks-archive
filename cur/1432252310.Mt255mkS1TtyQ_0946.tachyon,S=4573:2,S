Not answering the door makes them _at least_ wait until one has to leave.

Oh, and they can't wait _on_ your property, now can they? That would be 
trespassing.

I have about a 200-foot driveway from my house to the semi-public road 
serving our hill. They can't wait _on_ my property, without trespassing. 
This means I can get in my car and get out without being served. (There 
is no requirement that a car window be rolled down to receive papers.)

(If I see someone skulking around on my property, I would be morally 
justified in shooting them, of course. Demanding that they leave, from a 
window, and threatening to shoot is probably not actionable even in 
today's weird legal climate. Actually shooting them, while morally 
justified, is proably not wise.)

None. You are not obligated to make serving papers convenient. You can 
be out of the country, you can leave by limousine from an underground 
garage, you can crawl out you bathroom window. This is, as the lawyers 
say, "black letter law."

(I hope we don't get the drivel about how "Happy Fun Court is not 
amused.")
