Open and secure does not preclude any of these things.

What is your potential when you're chained to a wall?
With open, possibility is a right of others, with closed,
you forclose it upon them, and likely to serve yourself.
That may be part of the potential.

iOS/Android haven't even hit 10 years old and neither
they nor their underlying platforms truly have openness in
their core ethos so they can't really be contrasted against
each other in the suggested way.

> What you're suggesting is impossible. There is no way any of us

The general reply is that the overall model of open and all
these related things simply hasn't had enough time to develop,
execute, and be evaluated in a world that has only known closed.

However one thing is of absolute certainty: believing that getting
off the rock is impossible... will never get you off the rock.
