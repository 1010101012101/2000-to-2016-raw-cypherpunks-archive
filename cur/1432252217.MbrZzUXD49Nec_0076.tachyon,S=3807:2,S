 >>Why should I feel guilt over what previous generations have done? 
Insects do it, birds do it, mammals do it and people do it. Even dolphins, 
the breeding heart liberals favourite, kill their competitors. Cro-Magnon 
man displaced Neanderthal man, where do we draw the line? My Romanian 
relatives had their land taken from them by Ukranian imperialists, within 
the last 100 years, why can't I make a claim? <<

Guilts not called for,blacknet (and other) direct action is called for.You 
could make a claim with APster against paticular Imperialists,Ill 
contribute.Dolphins rape and Kill,so what? We draw the line with 
crypto-friggen-anarchy,blacknet and APster (see the Cyphernomicon and 
http://www.infoshop.org/faq/index.html

 >>The Canadian government abuses all of their citizens, why should 
aboriginal people of today get special treatment? The Canadian government 
doesn't appear to be any worse than the US or Australian governments, or 
for that matter any other government. <<

Govts days are numbered,Crypto-anarchy is coming,haven't you heard? REAL 
Anarchy.(see assassination politics)

 >>I never thought this list was a home for the bleeding heart liberal tree 
hugger crowd. <<

It aint,goose.I was a tree climber/feller for 15 years.I never thought this 
list was a home for the lunar right.Left wing or right wing its the same 
dirty bird,watch for claws and droppings.
