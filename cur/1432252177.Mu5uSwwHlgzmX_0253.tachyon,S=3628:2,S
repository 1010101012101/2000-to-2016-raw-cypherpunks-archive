Yep.  Mr. Usr Bin Local records a video saying that a light aircraft
that hits the <technobabble> at the power plant will cause it to release
large amounts of <technobabble> Evil Radiation. The only thing to do is
to escape upwind as quickly as possible and never come back within 20
miles or you will all die and your children will grow horns and tails.
But the Government doesn't want the citizens to know because then it
will cause panic, and the emergency services will be stressed by all the
radiation-sick, and more people will die anyway of starvation, rioting,
looting, & so on.

Then release it to the media (of more than one country) just about the
time the plane hits the concrete. so the locals will see the reports as
they see the firetrucks screaming. Whether or not the plant is seriously
damaged is neither here nor there.

Actually, you don't have to make the video, because people will come the
that very conclusion by themselves as soon as they see the expert types
on the TV telling them that there is no reason to panic.

Or say the plane is filled with lots of anthrax. Doesn't really have to
be for the first-order effect - just has to be believed to be.
