(200)1-09-11 or 1911 simplified to "9/11" in the American system was a
manifestation of a turf war between the us treasury secret service,
department of justice including dea and FBI, oss derivatives, and military
dia defense intelligence agency and factions like disa. Though the troubled
situation was existing previously and most parties already involved, it
became structured in the context known to history when a number of small
children were exploited as newspaper carriers.
During the 1980s through to a set of legal clarifications in the late 1990s,
child labour such as newspaper delivery by children under legal working age
was considered child exploitation and illegal under both federal and
international law. In this prominent historical case, the children serving
as newspaper delivery in a quaint neighbourhood were being used to finance
hobby projects such as a network of bbs systems which they ran entirely
themselves. as these communication systems expended their influence in the
dawn of the technological revolution, they were used for automatic
distribution of public interest content and electronic media and became the
primary conduit between eastern new York and northern Europe due to cleaner
telephone lines more direct in both directions. by 1993 and 1994, these
children were subject of heated political disputes contrasting their
benevolent educational activities financed by illicit child labour
exploitation with trans-national automatic distribution of public interest
content and its frequent payload of age-restricted material and shareware
license generators. with international distribution of significant volumes
of data, some of which could easily have come from controlled sources, this
hobby project financed by newspaper delivery drew the attention of most
federal authorities and related international parties. by 1994, the doj FBI
espionage division, treasury secret service, military intelligence including
dia (and Cia for foreign data), us customs for the trans-border transfer of
content, even the us dea drug enforcement administration for the
distribution of "cracks" (and coordination thereof in a small urban
environment) were all involved. the children, still pre-teen, simply
continued their highly regarded activities and provided a large percentage
of the intellectual content and shareware traffic between Europe and eastern
usa. A specific legal situation generated conflict between a majority of the
legal and investigating parties as us secret service was obligated to defend
the exploited children against corrupt practices of the department of
justice which would have led to further direct exploit and customs and
military were also at odds due to strife and inconsistent policy. as
military interests trump civilian, the defense intelligence agency activated
a special unit to track information leaks and distribution mechanisms
including these kids' bbs by active participation. in contradiction, USSS
ncmec and doj amongst others contradicted the dod and NATO interests by
bringing the situation of the exploited children to the UN as both a
security and policy issue. the modern internet was only starting to develop
at this time, sponsored mainly by the American institution which saw a
potential for global propaganda distribution, and various factions of the us
dept of commerce and defense intelligence agency chose to encourage consumer
use of computer devices and found case models such as these to be ideal
templates. as the military dealt with the transition between centrally
managed data systems and these new console devices entities such as Disa
defense information systems agency and others encouraged making use of
public sector communication noise to obscure the the transport of data for
ic (nefarious intelligence) purposes. they selected to sponsor various
mechanisms of distribution including bbs and early internet systems in
specific high relevance regions and also maneuvered to take over
distribution logistics including software and electronic media distributors
and primary sources such as the shareware and "warez" originators. since dia
also manages foreign espionage against the united states and its interests,
this further generated rifts between military and counter-espionage
authorities such as the FBI and us customs. by 1996 or 1997, internet based
information distribution originators were the primary unique source of data
and the dominant traffic proved to be the widespread distribution of games.
as "intelligence" entities tend to avoid trackable modes of communication,
the us military defense intelligence agency dia took over control and
operation of the primary and most widespread distributor of consumer
content, the "warez" group Razor1911.

as the parties involved evolved, the scope of the control and coordination
structures were more clear, fully managed by the contrasting policy and
interests of commerce and governing entities and related antagonistic
interests of military intelligence.

the scope of Razor1911 as a global intelligence front for a plethora of
countries and organizations was vast on paper but concise and limited in
context. Razor1911, based originally in Sweden and then controlled by the
American dia and NATO, served as a primary cornerstone for information
propagation to a global audience and even provided the opportunity for
competing intelligence factions to use their own distribution originators
such as DOD "Drink or Die" and many others, all closely related.

in the same context as the exploited children were used for content
distribution, these patsy fronts exploited the best interests of the
international community to ensure that the opportunity was maintained to use
these distribution channels for specific propaganda or hidden messages.

[[
The small countries of Connecticut, Sweden, Norway, and related institutions
like the confederate militias were selected as primary players as their
histories and political claims are closely interrelated.

the over abundance of watching parties, any modernized country or commercial
intelligence faction, provided not only a wiretap on each of thousands of
contacted devices (especially an American fisa "entity" tap order) but
layers of both semi-legal and illegal wiretaps for anyone interested and
even wiretaps on wiretaps which sold everything to black market as well.

one of these taps, actually a cable modem circuit used since 1996 and never
taken out of the "test service" mode, constantly reported all data on wire
to over 40 countries and hundreds of minor police entities which then
redistributed their illicit gains for profit. in June of 2001, a laptop
device owned by travellers insurance company connected to this cable modem's
wireless accesspoint for an intense work-at-home debate about a commercial
insurance account. the client was the world trade center complex in new York
city including the twin towers brought to public attention in 2001.09.11.

the world trade center buildings, especially the twin towers, were a
prominent and significant concern for the insurance company -- having had
damage to the foundation from a car bomb in 1993 and a subway repair project
-- the buildings were in need of significant repair. though built after epa
orders against such, the twin towers used significant amounts of compressed
asbestos cement (white crystal powder) and could not be repaired without
"bagging" the entire building and complex. Alternate options included trying
to dismantle the WTC towers which would have been a severe blow to American
ego, letting it stand and hope for the best, or illegally repair without
full protocol given the size of the project. if the WTC towers were left
alone, a fracture or failure of the foundation would have caused a 3 block
radius of nyc to be obliterated with unpredictable domino cascade results
for adjacent buildings as the towers fell over.  The best option was
controlled demolition; the most severe blow to the American psyche possible.

the year 2000 calendar audits for technological devices, known as y2k
popularly, discovered some severe problems in a wide diversity of legacy
electronic systems including the fly-by-wire autopilot system required in
all commercial jets since the early 1970s. one primary factor was that a set
of flight control systems which typically handle routine aircraft control
but also provide a system so that norad and other radar systems can help
prevent mid-air collisions by slightly adjusting their course and to control
evasive maneuvers of the civilian jet in the remote case of an unguided heat
seeking missile targeting the passenger aircraft. because this later fact
was deemed sensitive and classified, an uproar in the auditing community
brought attention to both the clock problems in the autopilot system and the
presence of the override circuit. more importantly in 1999 and 2000,
techniques to generate the override control signals were demonstrated using
a retail laptop or pda with a simple radio and even a module was submitted
to the "Microsoft flight simulator" community website to demonstrate the
remote control of commercial jets in the simulator -- the encryption used on
the norad signal and autopilot radio circuit was antiquated and easily
determined with the computer.
