Hey Aimee, check out the ethics on *this* dude...




McVeigh's Former Attorney Willing to
               Testify Against Nichols

Jones said he believes usual attorney-client privilege - which
               prohibits attorneys from disclosing what defendants tell
them - no
               longer applies in the case.

               McVeigh had a falling-out with Jones after the 1997
federal trial
               and last year sought a new trial on grounds that Jones
was
               incompetent and unethical. Jones said McVeigh gave up the
right
               to confidentiality by making the attack.
