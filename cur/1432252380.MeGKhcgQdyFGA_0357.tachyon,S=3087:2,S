"Jim Bell would have made AP an underground comedy if he had hung out with 
the time-wasterists at MIT rather than with the techno-commercialists. But 
I think his techno-political potboiler succeeds by making a comical wrong 
turn into the pokey, not once but twice, and inspiring CJ to follow, and 
mattd, and surely more to come as the AP PR machine gains momentum."
jya.
Jim seems to have missed out on teenagerhood.CJ seems not to have left 
teenagerhood.The boiling pot is like darwins discovery of evolution,It 
turned out to be a rediscovery of the findings of an obscure scottish 
orchardist.No matter,the theory was required for us all to progress/catch 
up/evolve further.The basics of AP are out,like bio-warfare and cant be 
suppressed short of a global panopticon.1984.everywhere,forever.I think we 
should talk about crypto-anarchy now.
