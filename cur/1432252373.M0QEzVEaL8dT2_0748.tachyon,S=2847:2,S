Please.  Truth requires skepticism.  Be bold.

As cryptographers, we must assume this.

And how much *dark fiber* is there?  Lots and lots, thanks to irrational

exuberance.   Guess what?  SiO2 doesn't care which direction the beam
is pumped into.

Yawn.

You underestimate the Adversary.  Never ever do that.  Isn't there some
chink who wrote that?

Oh no, not pointers!  What next, MPLS?

Dark fiber.

Enjoy your childhood while it lasts.  Its a beautiful time.
