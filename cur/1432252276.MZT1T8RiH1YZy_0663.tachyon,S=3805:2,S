But they are not fully voluntary. The reality is that people must eat and
provide for themselves or die. That is what those people are doing. If
they had a realistic opportunity to change to a 8-5 job they would take
it. The character of 'persistance' of this problem alone damns the 'it's
their own fault' argument.

These people have jobs that suck. The thesis is that they should take
higher paying jobs. Assuming there are such jobs, why aren't they taking
them? Now, if the jobs aren't there, why not? Either line of reasoning
leads to one inescapable conslusion, there is at least one factor that is
not being accounted for in your model.
