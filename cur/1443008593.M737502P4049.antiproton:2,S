The data-leaking blog Anonymous International, also known as
Shaltai-Boltai (Humpty Dumpty), has published the Russian government’s
project proposal for creating a "national information platform," which
would serve as an alternative Russian Internet.

According to Anonymous International, the project was drawn up by
Russia’s Foreign Trade Bank cluster analysis and spatial development
director Sergey Ganzya, the IT director of the hydroelectricity company
RusHydro, Garald Bandurin, and several other people. The leaked content
includes email correspondence and a document about the project.

In the leaked emails, the authors of the project discuss the creation of
“an entirely custom IT platform that can expand globally.” The
development of such a platform can serve as “import substitution in the
IT sphere” and “create a secure national digital environment with lower
risks than in the global www-field.”

The document published by Anonymous International mentions Russia’s
direct dependence on “the goodwill and decency of global providers of IT
solutions.” The authors of the document believe that “there are no
objective guarantees that, in the event of a conflict, Western security
agencies won’t paralyze—or, worse, seize—direct control over elements of
the infrastructure.”

The leaked emails between the project’s authors refer to the “general
officers” of Russia’s “Oplot Rossii” party, which was tasked with
delivering the project proposal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The
correspondence dates to June 2015.
