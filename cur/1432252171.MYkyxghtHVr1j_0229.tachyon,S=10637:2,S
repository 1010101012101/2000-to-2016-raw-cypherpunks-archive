Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap Internationa| executing on its plan to 
become a |eading supplier of VoIP techno|ogy including the following 
milestones:

On November 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Persona| Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| prob|em that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any cellular or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap International announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2OO,O00 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a g|oba| scale. We expect our mi|estones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
