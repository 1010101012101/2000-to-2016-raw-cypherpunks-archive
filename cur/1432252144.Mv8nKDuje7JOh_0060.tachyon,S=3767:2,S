Definitely.  That's why any large computing facility makes sure to have
two or more physically separate cable connections, with dual building
entrances, minimum distances between cables, etc.  A nuke bunker probably
was built with the cable exits some distance from the main building,

with reusable technology (e.g. coax vs. conduit that you can run fiber in.)
