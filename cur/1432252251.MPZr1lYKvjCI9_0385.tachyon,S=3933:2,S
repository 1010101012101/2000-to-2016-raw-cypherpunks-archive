Golden Shields awards..."In a wounded PC market..."
http://news.com.com/2009-1001-948983.html?tag=fd_lede
BEIJING--It's one of the few PC companies today with profits and growth in 
market share. Its close allies on various projects--Microsoft, Intel, Texas 
Instruments, America Online--reads like high-technology's A-list.
But one important difference separates the company from the pack: It's 
based in China, one of the world's hottest markets for technology.
The Legend Group, which once existed only as a wholesale distributor for 
U.S. and European brands, has transformed itself into one of the world's 
fastest-growing technology conglomerates, with its hands on everything from 
desktops and servers to cell phones, retail franchises and information 
technology services. Many businesses in China that it's involved are 
expected to grow by double digits through 2006 and beyond.
