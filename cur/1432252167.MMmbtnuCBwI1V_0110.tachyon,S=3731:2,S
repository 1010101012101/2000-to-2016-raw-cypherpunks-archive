October 6th, letters section:

> SIR - Those about to invest in iris-scanning security technology
> will be disappointed to learn of recent developments in the
> treatment of glaucoma ("Watching you ", September
> 22nd). Prostaglandin analogues are rapidly gaining popularity in the
> treatment of this blinding eye condition that affects 1% of the
> population. An innocuous side-effect of this drug is to cause a
> change in both iris colour (a darkening) and morphology. This change
> in susceptible people, usually Europeans, occurs over one to two
> years. Apart from rendering iris scanning potentially useless for
> these people, unscrupulous types without glaucoma may be tempted to
> use the drugs to "change" identity.
