For catastrophic disasters, the insurance company often spends more
money on you than you paid to them.  Again, it's spreading the risk.

In theory, fine.  However, we live in a society where people are not
automatically given healthcare.  If you don't have insurance, and you
don't have the money to pay for treatment, you're shit out of luck.
If the insurance companies deny treatment to people who MAY develop a
disease later, they are setting these people up to die without
healthcare.

Maybe I view things differently than you do.  I just think that in a
country as rich as ours, we can afford to keep our population healthy.
