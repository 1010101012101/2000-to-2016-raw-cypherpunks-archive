You seem to do this a lot: shoot from the hip with some flaky and 
ill-presented ideas and then concede that others have raised points 
you haven't thought about.

While none of us expects others to share all or even most of our 
views, a certain minimum of knowledge in how government works is 
expected.

Please go find some high school-level textbooks on our federal 
republic system, on the electoral college, and on basic issues about 
why changing voting hours at the last minute, changing the voting 
rules, and allowing "do overs" are just not permissable.

Get some education.
