MEP Tiziano Motti want everything you do online is logged and saved -
for the sake of the children. A sort of black box to be installed in
all the world's computers, smartphones and e-readers.

A black box, similar to that found in an airplane, should be installed
in every one of the world's computers to record everything that
happens online. It considers the Italian MEP Tiziano Motti, who
introduced the idea in Brussels yesterday.

Tiziano Motti was a politician who just over a year ago managed to get
a majority of European Members of Parliament to support the proposal
to expand the data storage directive to the Google searches. The
purpose was to protect children from pedophiles - the same as his new
creation would do.

- - We politicians are often hypocrites. On the one hand, we say that
pedophilia is terrible and that it must be fought. On the other hand
we do not give police the necessary tools to combat it. With my
suggestion stop the hypocrisy, says Tiziano Motti.

Motti has merged their bags with an Italian "hackers", Fabio Ghioni,
who is the architect behind the new method to be able to collect
digital evidence "against forgery and not abused." The solution they
call Logbox. And just as with the aircraft's black boxes, this Logbox
installed in computers, laptops, smartphones, e-readers - yes, all
that can be connected to the internet.

There, box sign everything the user does online. The information is
stored and passed on to a so-called guarantor - a non-governmental
non-profit organization that saves the information, which will be
encrypted. Thereafter, only the user, the guarantor and the police be
able to access the data using a key for encryption.

"It allows the honest citizens to anonymously register their
activities on the Internet in a comprehensive, secure and neutral
manner that can not be abused. So, users can clearly demonstrate that
they have not committed criminal acts so that the police do not waste
time on the innocent in their investigations, "it sounds in the fact
sheet Motti wrote.

The idea is that the system will be connected to an "early warning
system" of criminal activity. Where are the details are unclear, but
is essentially that at any time material with sexually abused children
are detected, an alarm, go to the authorities to be able to see who
uploaded it.

Because the Internet is global, that does not mean that all citizens
of the world must join it to make it work?

- - Good question. That's right. We want to start with Europe, but hope
then that more and more join, says Fabio Ghioni to Europe Portal.

Tiziano Motti adds:

- - There will always be people who want to make people ill and who want
to go around the system. But for that we can not sit idly by and do
nothing.

Marcin de Kaminski, right sociologist at Lund University and is active
in the Julia Group with the ambition to defend an open Internet, have
looked at Mottis proposal and difficulties.

- - The proposal is based on users' rights are protected and that they
should feel safe and he writes at the beginning that he did not want
to create a new Big Brother Society. But then the whole document is
about just that, says Marcin de Kaminski.

the Kaminski says that Motti has not analyzed through its proposal
properly.

- - He shows no feeling for the expense he does so on. For him, the
Internet is a tool to "save the children". But he does not realize
that he might ruin the lot.

What?

- - There are discussions today about what protection value of the
internet has, who can be identified, as to who is entitled to
information about what. The debate must be resolved first before this
kind of initiative can be commenced.

Although Mottis current proposal is not directly linked to the Data
Retention Directive, which requires all Internet and telephone
operators to keep records of all income, emails and phone users do,
touching each other. But Motti believes that the new solution with
encryption is more secure than Internet service providers will save
the data. Marcin de Kaminski is skeptical.

- - There is no guarantee that the information stays where it should.
Whenever people are involved, there is a risk that people who should
not access information receive it and those who gain them access to
gain an insight into a person's life to an extent never before seen,
says Marcin de Kaminski.

Mottis proposal is still in its infancy and there is still no sign of
either the European Parliament or the European Commission will proceed
with the proposal. But when Motti presented his last proposal, it took
less than three months before a majority of its members supported it.

Christian Engstrom (PP) located in the Greens have their views clear.

- - If it were China, North Korea or Saudi Arabia who had proposed this,
what would we say then? It's scary in a democratic Europe that even
hear a politician suggest such a thing. It is so absurd that I really
hope we never have to discuss it seriously in Parliament, said
Christian Engstrom.

Only time will tell who gets right.
