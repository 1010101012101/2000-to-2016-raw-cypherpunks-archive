The original isn't likely written in the Latin alphabet. If you want to
work with this, see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unicode/message/8994 for
Unicode codepoints of "al-Qaida" in Arabic. You'd then need to try at
least those points encoded in ISO-8859-6, since few people use Unicode at
the present. OTOH, I dunno how to make Google understand anything besides
basic Latin-1.
