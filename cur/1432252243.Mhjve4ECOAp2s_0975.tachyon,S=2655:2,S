The planet sized processor stuff reminds me of Charlie Stross' sci-fi
short story "Scratch Monkey" which features nanotech, planet sized
processors which colonize space and build more planet-sized
processors.  The application is upload, real-time memory backup, and
afterlife in DreamTime (distributed simulation environment), and an
option of reincarnation.
