A non-good idea, as it goes against what Tor is all about.

The problem to be overcome here really has nothing to do with Tor, as such.

So Wikipedia understands that the transport layer isn't to blame, yet they
persist in asking for changes in the Tor transport to address the problem of
malicious users?  *groan*

That's not the perception they need to change.  They need to realize that if an
avenue for action without responsibility exists, someone will use it.  Wikis
get defaced all the time *without* AOL or Tor, because the philosophy allows
anyone to edit.  It is that philosophy that is in error, not the transport
layers used by the vandals.  Wiki, as someone mentioned to me in a private
mail, is the SMTP of web publishing; it doesn't scale well in the presence of
large concentrations of assholes.

Roger gets it.  The Wikipedians don't.
