Here's a funny story. In late 2006, I think, I came across Hillary
Clinton's campaign website. They wanted recommendations for a campaign
theme song. Feeling fey, I suggested "If I Was [sic] President" by
Wyclef Jean. That was before President Obama had become a leading
candidate. What a joke.

I'm not claiming that Wyclef Jean is an anarchist. But it's at least
arguable that he's a decent man. So it goes.
