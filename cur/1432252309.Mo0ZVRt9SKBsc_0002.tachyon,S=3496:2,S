And even if they tried, network security is too arcane of a subject
matter for them to care about. They just want that big dildo [or
whatever it is that they're ordering].

One online merchant I know put big padlock .gifs on the site to reassure
users that their transactions were secure. The padlocks on the browsers
were there, but they weren't as reassuring to the customers as the
images.
