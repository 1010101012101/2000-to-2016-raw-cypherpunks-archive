Those interested in taking the 3 day satellite seminar presented by USAMRIID
and USAMRICD go to biomedtraining.org and register for the FREE 3 day event.
  12:30pm-4:30pm Nov. 27, 28 & 29th.
There is no charge to view the broadcast and it is going to be presented at
downlink sites around the US, Southern Canada, Puerto Rico, Alaska and
Hawaii.
Those who wish to view online webcast, also register at that website. CME
credit available for the course.
A rebroadcast will take place in Dec., I believe around Dec. 9th.

I have taken the courses and find the material to be extremely accurate, and
timely.

Simply log onto biomedtraining.org, register for username and password, then
pick the site you choose to view the broadcast and register. After
registration, call or email site facilitator for confirmation of
registration. Simple as that. Last year we even got free luch, (sandwhichs
and soda) and text book.
Those who cannot attend the broadcast can still download program materials
on the biomedtraining.org site. pdf files available.

At this time in history, we do not want to let these learning opportunities
go by.
