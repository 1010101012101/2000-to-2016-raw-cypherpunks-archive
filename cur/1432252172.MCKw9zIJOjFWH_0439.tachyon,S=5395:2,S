I look forward to your defence of crypto-anarchy-libertarian ideals.

Is your premise that anarchy doesn't lead to a 'socialist' society? A
society in which the choices of the individual are made en masse? Consider
the congruency of world view a working anarchy requires? Then consider the
disparity of world views between any two people. How do you resolve this
obvious conflict? Anarchy has no answer other than everyone will do the
'right' thing because there isn't a 'government' there to coerce them
by force. Anarchy can't even tell you what a 'government' is. Read the FAQ
that is widely available on the web. Let's get rid of 'government' is
nothing more than a veil for getting rid of people who differ in point of
view. What is government? It's people who share some commen world view and
agree, to a wide variety of degree, at least in some minimalist way on how
it should be implimented. To get rid of government is to a priori restrict
this world view. Yet anarchy promises us a wider choice of world view,
apparently only so long as it's the approved one.

How does a working anarchy resolve real world disputes? I offer you the
example of a tree which is rooted in my back yard but has limbs impinging
on my neighbors roof. Is it his or my responsibility to cut the limbs back
to deter damage? Why? Whose responsiblity to pay for any damage that does
occur to the roof from limbs? Why? When the tree dies who is responsible
for the bill to remove the dead husk? Why? What happens if at any point
during this resolution phase one of the parties refuses to participate
further? Who do they go to for arbitration? What standards of arbitration
will be used? Who is responsible for assuring compliance? What are the
limits of compliance enforcement?

Now, let's assume we've a neighbor making bombs and his garage is 15 ft.
from your childs bedroom? Let's ask the same sorts of questions?

As we've discussed before on the list, in the cases of commen services
like fire fighting which are converted to profit making enterprises, how
is intentional fire starting to be prevented? Who is to review the
evidence and pursue the parties involved? How are they to be held
accountable?
