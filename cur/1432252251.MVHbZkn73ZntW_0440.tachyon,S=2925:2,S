>7/17. President Bush also touched on cyberterrorism in his speech on world 
>trade. He stated that "The United States and her allies will pursue a 
>balance of world power that favors human freedom. This requires a new 
>strategic framework that moves beyond Cold War doctrines and addresses the 
>threats of a new century such as cyberterrorism, weapons of mass 
>destruction, missiles in the hands of those for whom terror and blackmail 
>are a very way of life."
