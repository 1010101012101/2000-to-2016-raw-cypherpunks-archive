I think it is a workable argument that it is better to have such social
rules encoded in law instead of having people come up with them at will and
imposing them on others through shunning, lynching or whatever. In theory at
least you will then know in advance whether something you have done will be
'illegal'. Besides, current law in most countries holds precisely that sort
of stuff. Probably the best Finnish example is conscript duty. (No, I'm not
saying that isn't nightmarish.)

anarchy, injustice and immorality as long as the particular set of rules
leading to them is the one you approve of. This doesn't lead anywhere.

The dictionary definition is simply one end of a whole spectrum. Besides, if
I wanted to nitpick, the Webster definition, 'Exempt from subjection to the
will of others' strictly interpreted sort of rules out shunning and other
forms of extortion.

Let the part of population be those that own farming land. Let x be farming
it.

You agree, then?

Who said you had any in the first place? That is something you have to
justify separately.

Do the honors.

Which some people could consider odd in the extreme. I do not take such
things for granted.

>I don't consider the radio spectrum to be particularly scarce,

If we look at specific applications (like mobile data transfer), we would
like to use bands which are below 1-2 GHz because line-of-sight
communications limit the usability of any equipment. We would like to get by
with a minimum investment of physical resources, implying large coverage for
a single antenna installation. In metropolitan areas, this hardly suffices
for high bandwidth applications alone - nothing left over. This is what a
sane person would do provided no scarcity exists. Now consider what happens
when two independent parties do this in the same city. A mess. There is
considerable scarcity.

But if you acknowledge the existence of shared resources, you will have to
explain why, for instance, food, services, whatever really, aren't shared
but private.

Explain. This simply does not follow from the above. In the above situation
the existence of a right demands less than in your ideal universe.

>"Er, I really don't like to get too specific."

No. I mean what I say - the specific set of behaviors which have to be
tolerated even though they infringe on your rights is to a degree arbitrary 
and subject to change. It's a gray area and should be left as such. There
will always be such a gray area, though. E.g. you cannot expect to shut
people up based on the acoustics of their speech violating your right to be
left alone. Not even when you have no way to escape the sound.

A hypothetical: I own everything around you for some 100 miles. Let's say
that 100 miles happens to be desert. Your failure to comply with my wish of
transportation the hell out of there or sustain me is equivalent to killing
me. I call such incompliance oppression. Webster for oppression: 'To impose
excessive burdens upon; to overload; hence, to treat with unjust rigor or
with cruelty'.

>First "oppress", now "exploit".  You've been reading your Marx again,

>constitute "exploitation".

Webster for 'exploit': 'To utilize; to make available; to get the value or
usefulness out of; as, to exploit a mine or agricultural lands; to exploit
public opinion'. I'm not talking about satisfying whims, but basic needs. If
you have in your power to fulfill such a need, I cannot myself, and I will
be rid of a fundamental right (like the right to life) otherwise, you should
satisfy the need. If you take this as a premise, as I try to, not complying
fits the above description.

Who said anything about a government. Or all-powerful. Who said anything
about forcing (persuasion can have equivalent results, as the Drug War
demonstrates). What I'm talking about is oppression by majorities, which can
very well happen with or without a government.

>Certainly not I.  Liberty is another word you could stand to look up.

Webster: 'The state of a free person; exemption from subjection to the
will of another claiming ownership of the person or services; freedom; --
opposed to slavery, serfdom, bondage, or subjection.' Nothing here to
suggest certain limitations cannot be made.

In my books, freedom/liberty also does not equal the right to limit other's
respective freedoms/liberties. Both words are defined as the absence of a
condition which in all practical situations to so degree applies. They
cannot be interpreted absolutely.

You will also have a lot of explaining to do if you assume that those who
have automatically deserve to. I'm not going to turn Marxist on you, here,
but I consider inequality something that should be limited (though not
abolished).
