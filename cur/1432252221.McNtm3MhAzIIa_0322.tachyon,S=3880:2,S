> Some Berkeley people will be gathering on Sunday at about 4pm to make
> signs, and "miscellaneous props", for the Monday protest in San Jose.
> Anyone in the area is welcome to join us. The location is in the Wozniak
> Lounge of Soda Hall on the UC Berkeley Campus.
> 
> Bring your own materials, tools, and cool ideas (and certainly feel free
> to bring extra stuff). We plan on being there until about 8pm.
> 
> Directions to Soda Hall can be found at
> http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Campus/Directions/#soda. It's a big ugly
> greenish building at the intersection of Hearst and Le Roy. You'll need to
> approach the building from the Le Roy Ave side, and enter from the back
> (from the patio above the volleyball court).
> 
> Please drop me an email if you're planning on attending, just so I know
> how many people to expect.
> 
> This event is officially under the aegis of the Berkeley CSUA (Computer
> Science Undergraduate Association).
