      Also it's highly recommended to use dual cpu motherboards for
building clusters, which doubles your processing power w/o adding much
at all to the electric bill. But you probably are over estimating the
power needs -- you don't need the drives or video or soundcards, so you
dump those. When I build mine, I'm going to also get rid of the
individual PS as well, use DC/DC converters and a central PS running it
all off a 12v battery bank hopefully solar powered.
       Sure, for a university or business, clustering the already
available desktop boxes would be the way to go (at least if you had a
linux lab), but having even 4 dual 1ghz motherboards would be a fun toy.
