don't trust businesses nor governments with your private bits as much
as possible.  let your ISP freely share those encrypted payloads with
whoever they please.  end to end encryption has been advocated forever
but perhaps now people will be a little more willing to listen.  a
good time for crypto geeks to be a little more willing to look at
ease-of-use / HCI issues for secure decentralized networking.  lots of
failures to learn from...

do you have any infosec rent-a-fucks in mind?   choicepoint and the
other datamining privacy invasion businesses get my "fuck you buddy"
approval.

infosec sucked in 2005 but this is tangential to
NSA/$TLA/telecom/ISP/datareseller collusion.
