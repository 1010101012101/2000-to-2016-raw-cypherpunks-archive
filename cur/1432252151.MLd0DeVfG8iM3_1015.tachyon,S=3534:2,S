>From the story (which is only about 5 paragraphs):

--
PHILADELPHIA - Philadelphia Bomb Squad says the lack of a detonator
cap prevented the military explosive found Friday from destroying a
Greyhound bus terminal.

The suitcase containing a third of a pound of C-Four explosive and a
thousand feet of detonator cord was placed in a bus station locker on
September 29th. Since it was unclaimed, a bus station employee opened
it today in order to give any clothing inside to charity. Police were
called after the worker discovered a putty-like material.

How much damage could about 6 ounces of C4 do?

For the interested, here's a great recipe for composition 4
explosives: http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/tech/c4.html
