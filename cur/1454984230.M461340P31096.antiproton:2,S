Hi Ted,=C2=A0




Yes, I agree with you.=C2=A0




Supposedly, this list was for anarchists who wanted to advance strong crypt=
ography and individual liberty.=C2=A0




However, it seems like the large majority of postings here are unfortunatel=
y not about cryptography, nor anarchy. =C2=A0Agreed about the white fascism=
.=C2=A0




The ideal would be idea to have more code, more crypto.=C2=A0




However, as you said, it might be a lost cause. Which is quite sad, conside=
ring what it originally represented. But thanks for writing this nonetheles=
s :)=C2=A0

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * Filter these people out and try to maintain producti=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * This would be of limited=

 to do since it is optimal from
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 my time perspective.

I think this list is a lost cause at this point. Ever since around the
time it became more discoverable after the switch from al-qaeda.net to
cpunks.org, and some possibly overzealous cross-posting, the discourse
has shifted from actual cypherpunkery to white men complaining about
having their privilege eroded on other mailing lists. There are a number
of quality contributors that no longer post here, reducing the signal
and allowing more noise. I can't bring them back. But I can at least
remind anyone more moderate listening that the cypherpunks list wasn't
always a far-right discussion group, which I think is the reverence due
to the community that used to exist.

I'd appreciate any suggestions, onlist or offline, from anyone who
thinks similarly of the ideological drift of this list from generally
anti-authoritarian to crypto-white nationalism.

By my records, the word "sheeple" appears in 2% of all messages

posted on this list, making it demonstrably ironic that we are

even discussing a call for something other than meritocracy.
