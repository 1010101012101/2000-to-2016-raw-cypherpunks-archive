So far we have at least $450 in pledges, then.

I think the below is interesting, and makes it competitive, with an
85-97 safe harbor for Choate where he neither makes nor loses money.

We could have a cpunx escrow service hold the money while the
competition is taking place. Also, I'd want a way to verify with ETS
directly, but that's just quibbling over the details.

I've deprocmailed Choate for a while.
