The *chronology* was never in question Declan: why the straw?

Yes. The exact same message I just cited.

Using YOUR OWN copy of this complaint, go LOOK at it Declan.  It was sent
to BROADWING.NET.  That's  B-R-O-A-D-W-I-N-G.N-E-T.  It was sent to
broadwing and *CC'd* to UUnet.  This message is *obviously* aimed at
broadwing's subscriber.  And again, using *your* copy of the message, show
us where I brand *YOU* as the downstream spammer.  Or even "The
Idjit" himself for that matter!  Since I thought the message I was
forwarding had only The Idjit's scrawl, there was no *reason* to actually
*point out* anyone in particular - you have CHOSEN to paint this the way
you WANT to paint this, for whatever reason(s) you have.  It must make for
good copy, huh?

> you brand me a 
> "downstream spammer"

While I have never "branded [you] a downstream spammer", I *am* now
branding you a liar and an irresponsible, unethical, and untrustworthy
writer with an attitude problem and an ego problem.

And you know what?  After all this bullshit from you, I *still* don't
think you're in need of "muzzling".  Killfiling yes, but nothing more.

Playing with numbers now that playing with words has backfired?  

I am not going to play the game with you anymore: you have shown me, the
list, and everyone who ever runs across this thread in a web search what
*really* happened.  All the smoke, mirrors, and outright *bullshit* can't
change that Declan.

No, however you *did* clearly imply it.  And again, that was NOT THE
POINT.  The POINT is that you specifically used your "column" as a vehicle
for revenge and not for Truth, and you did it consciously, and with
malice.  The POINT is that when you were called on it you weren't man
enough to admit your mistakes, instead, you made a lot of noise  and tried
a lot of things to distract the world from your folly.  The POINT is that
you have not just sullied *your own* reputation with this infantile
bullshit, the POINT is that you have, by extension, sullied every magazine
that elects to give you a public voice.

You have failed to serve Truth.  

THAT is the point.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
