Hushmail is certainly under the same pressure for the same reason.

In addition to the above singular news reference, this plurality seems to
perhaps imply a further prism/verizon like all-data situation as well. Not
an unexpected thing these days.

The US first amendment... it's time more people started exercising it.
Excepting order of precedence as it may apply to the risk averse, the
permission of appeal, against that which would (or should, if that is
your politic) be struck down, isn't required to do so.

Remove the ability of services to see the data and this legacy problem
of entrusting cleartext goes away. Maybe at that point everything
becomes just node services for hidden applications.

Mail is a big one. Maintaining interoperation while integrating client side
encryption is a nice goal but fails to hide the @talkers. Whoever comes
up with a fully anonymous, encrypted, defined-persistance p2p strong
replacement that people actually use will get a lot of credit.
Recent news has opened people up such that a good window of adoption
opportunity will exist for a while. Same for storage/block services using
an open client side encryption API.

There's still plenty of room, need, and reason for people to make stands
with traditional mail services too.
