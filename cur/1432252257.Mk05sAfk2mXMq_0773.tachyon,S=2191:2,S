<SNIP>

Socha was arrested by State Police and his mother, father, and sister,
were ordered off United Airlines Flight 171 to Honolulu via San Francisco,
which was set to depart at 7:07 a.m.

According to the police report, the note, which was placed on top of
clothes in a black gym bag read: ''[Expletive] you. Stay the [expletive]
out of my bag you [expletive] sucker. Have you found a [expletive] bomb
yet? No, just clothes. Am I right? Yea, so [expletive] you.''

I hope to see more and more of these until the public is outraged enough
to not put up with this horseshit.
