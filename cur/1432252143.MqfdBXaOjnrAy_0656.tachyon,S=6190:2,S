The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the deve|opment of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as A|berta (CANADA), where several more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson will 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for drilling 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|l as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal f|ow it wi|| be ab|e to bui|d a solid 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressive|y 
pursuing a|| possib|e 
0ppOrtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we wi|l have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dri||ing program, which 
wil| always encourage the participation of financial partners."

Price - .09

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mil|ions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This smal| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
slight|y, you wi|| stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will real|y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
