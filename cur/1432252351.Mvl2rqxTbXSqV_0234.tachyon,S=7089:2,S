>(Washington, D.C., Thursday, Oct. 25, 2001)-Responding to the official 
>launch of Windows XP, two of the nation's leading consumer organizations 
>today reiterated their concerns about the anticompetitive and 
>anti-consumer aspects of Microsoft's new bundle of software and Internet 
>services. The groups concluded that it is an illegal extension of the 
>company's illegal monopoly, and which will cause significant harm to both 
>the nation's consumers and non-Microsoft-affiliated software firms and 
>Internet service vendors.
>Christopher Murray, CU's Internet and Telecommunications Counsel, said, 
>"We want to be clear that in contesting Microsoft's latest product we are 
>not taking an 'anti-innovation' position. It is precisely because we are 
>pro-innovation that we are disappointed with the way in which Microsoft is 
>telling users, 'If you want one-click convenience, we'll give it to you, 
>but only to our affiliates and commercial partners. Forget about one-click 
>convenience anywhere outside of our walled garden.'
>Mark Cooper, Director of Research for CFA, added, "The real issue with XP 
>is whether innovation will be driven by a vigorous competitive process or 
>managed by a single, dominant firm that can choose, at any moment and with 
>a vast and ever-expanding store of anti-competitive tactics, to protect 
>and promote its interest at the expense of consumers."
>
>The groups, following up on a report they released last month that 
>describes in detail continuing Microsoft anti-competitive practices, cited 
>the following central objections to Windows XP:
>
>   * Passport, Microsoft's payment and ID authentication service, should 
> not be bundled with XP. Users should have a choice of authentication 
> systems and Microsoft should provide customer support without users 
> having to sign up for a Passport;
>
>   * Microsoft should provide an "open" alternative to the world of 
> Microsoft-affiliated commercial partners. Users should be able to easily 
> reconfigure one-click features on Internet Explorer 6 (the browser 
> bundled with XP) such as "My Music," and "My Photos," to point to 
> non-Microsoft services;
>
>   * Windows Media Player, the music and video player bundled with XP, 
> should provide support for high-bitrate MP3 music, rather than eschewing 
> that format in favor of Microsoft's proprietary "Windows Media Audio" 
> format; and
>
>   * "pre-certification" of all software drivers, while helpful to 
> maintain platform stability, has enormous potential for anti-competitive abuse.
>
>Cooper concluded, "We are heartened to learn of the apparent decision by 
>some state prosecutors to hire a hard-nosed lawyer during settlement 
>talks. State and federal prosecutors need to vigorously pursue a strong 
>remedy to stop current and prevent future anti-competitive behavior. Any 
>remedy sanctioned by the courts needs to be closely monitored, and 
>Microsoft should be substantially penalized if it fails to comply, either 
>financially or even, as a last step measure, break up of the company."
>
>The Consumer Federation of America is the nation's largest consumer 
>advocacy group, composed of two hundred and eighty state and local 
>affiliates representing consumer, senior, citizen, low-income, labor, 
>farm, public power and cooperative organizations, with more than fifty 
>million individual members. CFA is online at http://www.consumerfed.org/.

>protect consumers. CU's income is derived solely from the sale of Consumer 
>Reports and its other services, and from noncommercial contributions,
