...anyone catch the quote on the back of Vernor Vinge's new book, Rainbow's 
End? Boing Boinger Cory Doctorow says something, "More paranoid than any 
Cypherpunk..."

Meanwhile, just a little idea popped into my head. Probably useless, but 
since I'm so tickled with my own cleverness I thought I'd mention it.

Cypherpunks, like a lot of lists, has several servers/feeders. IS IT 
POSSIBLE to cryptographically "split" posts between the servers so that only 
when the post appears is it legible? Is this useful? Seems to open up some 
slightly different avenues of anonymity (ie, such a list can be by default 
anonymous).
