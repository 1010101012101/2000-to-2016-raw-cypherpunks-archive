	Wanna bet? 

	Marxist, socialist and communist ideologies are bad because at some level they assume that society has a *right* to the output of my labour above and beyond the level that I consume from society. 

	That is slavery. 

	(To put this another way, it is legitimate for society to force me to pay for what I consume, it has a "right" (tho' this word is meaningless when it comes to an abstraction like "society") to my productive labour *ONLY* to the point where it pays for what I use. Marxist, Socialists, communists, Nazis and Fascists have the further problem of believing (for the most part) in massively centralized planning structures. In societies of about 100k people, these fail miserably, and don't work all that well in smaller groups.
