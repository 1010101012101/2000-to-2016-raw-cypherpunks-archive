The reply, sent off-list, was something like "You're running x86-32 code on an
x86-64 CPU in emulation mode, what do you expect?" :-).  In addition the
Itanium RSA demo code works by turning the CPU into a $1000 ASIC, so you'd
need to test it for SSL handshakes per second or something similar where the
CPU has to do some other work besides RSA crypto ops.
