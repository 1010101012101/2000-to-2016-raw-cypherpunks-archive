Hi Peter

He isn't subscribed through SSZ, no nihilist.com or another.com in the
bunch. If another alias comes to light please pass it along and I'll
delete it.

As an aside, I usually only let bounces from SSZ subscribers last about a
week. If it isn't fixed in that time I figure it isn't going to.
