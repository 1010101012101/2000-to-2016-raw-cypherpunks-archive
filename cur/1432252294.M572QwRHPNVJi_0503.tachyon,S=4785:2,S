chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are

With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and
