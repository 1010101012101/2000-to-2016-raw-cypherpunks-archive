Some quick research shows me that some states no longer make it
aggravated harassment to swear at a cop, though it's still an offense in
some states. I couldn't find Indiana's status on that, but it looks like
your method might be successful.

<shrug> I really thought I had come across that in Findlaw or somewhere.
Maybe it was a proposal that was shot down, maybe it's in other states,
maybe you're wrong. I don't see it in a Findlaw search just now, but I'm
not even sure what it would be called. Certainly not the "Citizen Bend
Over and Spread 'Em Act", but things like "Police Assistance Act" and
"Citizens Cooperation Act" didn't give any hits, either.

Heh. If you're referring to me, events of the past few days argue
against my intelligence.

More generally, it's probably a mixture of laziness, time pressure, the
value of the effort needed to check every "fact" before posting, and
"knowing" that something is true and therefore need not be checked.
Posters to mailing lists and Usenet could treat every post as a
submission to a refereed journal, but by the time the fact-checking was
done, the thread would have died out.
