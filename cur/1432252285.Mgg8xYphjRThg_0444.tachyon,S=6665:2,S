I think that there are a number of companies who would like to use a
warrant canary to protect their users but also do not want to be a
guinea pig of the courts. Even Apple, which had the biggest market cap
in the world so could afford to take on this fight, bowed down and
removed their warrant canary recently.

Sadly, until someone with a set of big brass ones goes all guns blazing
to specifically set precedent, everyone is going to sit on the sidelines
on this issue.

I guess the only real work around would be to relocate the company
(including all employees) to a more friendly jurisdiction.
