Ben,

Would you care to comment for publication on web logging 
described in these two files:

  http://cryptome.org/no-logs.htm

  http://cryptome.org/usage-logs.htm

Cryptome invites comments from others who know the capabilities 
of servers to log or not, and other means for protecting user privacy 
by users themselves rather than by reliance upon privacy policies 
of site operators and government regulation.

This relates to the data retention debate and current initiatives 
of law enforcement to subpoena, surveil, steal and manipulate
log data.

Thanks,

John
