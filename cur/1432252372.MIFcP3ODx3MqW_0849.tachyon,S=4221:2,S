Well, let's dig into this. It appears on the surface to harbour a lot of the 
common myths shared in the hallowed corridors of DC.

Most Cypherpunks would agree that free markets are a good thing. Basically, 
if you leave people alone, they'll figure out how to meet the needs that are 
out in there and, in the process, get a few of the goodies available to us 
as vapors on this world. I assume you would agree to this.

That said, the question is whether American interference abroad has helped 
or possibly greatly hindered the formation of free markets. And I think the 
verdict is beocmming increasingly clear that American interference hurts 
free markets. Of course, there are the arguable exceptions: Post-war Germany 
and Japan, but these countries not only had a strong history of free markets 
at the time they both ahd large corporations and a rapidly modernizing 
infrastrcture.

In developing markets the US track record is terrible. The more we interfere 
and set up puppet governments and petty dictators, the result has always 
been the near elimination of any kind of real modern economy.

More than that, some of the countries we've been kicked out or prevented 
from influencing have been modernizing rapidly, the most obvious example is 
China and Vietnam. Bolivia is interesting to watch.

One could in fact argue that the faster a country removes our shadowy 
"help", the sooner they can get on their own two feet and start developing. 
In this light, US influence starts to look like it's on some levels designed 
to quash the local development of modern industrialization and perhaps this 
is no suprise: We don't really want the competition.

In the long run this is unsustainable, and can only lead to even bigger 
September 11ths.  under there and examine the substance of what he's saying.
