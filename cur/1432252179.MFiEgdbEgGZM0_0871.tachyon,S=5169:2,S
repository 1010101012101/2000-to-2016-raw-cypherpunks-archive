(I am not on Exi-Chat so posting here)

It matters a great deal. The goal of building these models is deep
behavioral modeling and prediction. With sufficiently good models, you
can start steering outcomes of human behavior below the level of
discernible manipulation on a mass scale. First across the line that
feels like wielding that power wins. We are further down this path
than most people imagine (though not so far that the specifics are
foregone conclusions). It is a mathematics and computer science
problem.

This is very similar to "first to AI" games and the people that work
on it are cognizant of this aspect. If you are far enough ahead, you
can effectively manipulate the efforts of people chasing you.

Most people can't imagine how detailed a model of their behavior can
be constructed *today* from their data exhaust, nor the quantity of
data exhaust currently collected, without even scratching the surface
of what is theoretically possible. The best analogy I can think of is
compressive sampling/sensing. There is vast amounts of useful data
about individual behavior and it is almost unexploited compared to
what we know is possible theoretically with the right algorithms and
systems.

The reason no serious discussion can be had about privacy is that most
people do not grok the capabilities of the technology they face.
Ironically, it is in many ways more powerful and a lot more invisible
than anything Hollywood has portrayed. There is already quite a bit of
well-known art around camouflaging this type of manipulation that is
already deployed every day -- it is why few people notice.

It is a "first across the line" race. The first organization to gain a
material advantage and exploit it can only be caught if they allow
themselves to be caught. Many organizations are looking for that
advantage but the race favors those with very sharp minds and deep
pockets.
