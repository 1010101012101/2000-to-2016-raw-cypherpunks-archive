Yes, upon consideration I agreed, re critical dimensions.  That's why I
brought up uneconomically sized chips, and the tech of thinned wafers.
The point being (yes, if you
can cool them) that small = fast.   1 foot per nanosecond, remember?

And some of the neato-analog stuff one can do does *better* with big
honkin'
micron sized features, albeit on exotic materials, and the
large-area/thinned
argument still holds.
