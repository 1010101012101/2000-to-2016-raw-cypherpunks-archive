I bet that guy's kicking himself in the ass after that quote.
I'm sure what he meant to imply was "there's nothing you'll
see that makes you think we're turning the place into a police state"
rather than what it comes out as sounding like, "there's a police 
state, you just won't see it".

I'll feel right at home too...because I'll be staying home!

One of life's little ironies is that the reason that security
was so crappy at the 72 olympics was that Germany wanted to
announce to the world "we're not Nazis anymore!
See, no police state!"

There's probably a moral to the story, but I'm not learning anything.
