I need a reliable identifier to implement http://minco.me/ 

Now the next question is it mathematically possible to come up with a 
reliable and deterministic way of creating a public PII (identifier) with a
distributed system? What if, instead of government agencies, we had Notary
Publics sign a document with a 'secret' nonce to create the PII?
