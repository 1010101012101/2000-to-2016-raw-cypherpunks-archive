So students are shutting down their machines and Skype super nodes. Infact, it is safe to say that if the universities cracked down on Skype, there will not likely be enough super nodes to sustain the Skype network.

It is fairly common knowledge that many people running the current 
version of the Windows client experienced a crash last night at around 
the same time. This matches Skype's public message at 
http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/12/skype_downtime_today.html "many of 
them were taken offline by a problem affecting some versions of Skype". 
Not surprisingly, a whole lot of the nodes run Windows and thus the 
fraction of supernodes which are running Windows is also high.

More clients trying to reach supernodes than there is supernode capacity 
looks exactly like a DDOS against the supernode addresses, of course. 
This is a common restart failure mode for all types of network 
systems... one must always balance the reconnect backoff times between 
the risk of flooding the servers (in this case, distributed out to 
supernodes in a p2p system) and the user experience of taking forever to 
reconnect after a local network outage (which may be indistinguishable 
from a global server-side problem).

I'm not an official spokesperson for Skype, so I can't really say more 
than what's in the official blog... though it does say almost exactly 
what's above.
