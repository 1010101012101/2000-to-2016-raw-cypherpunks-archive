I do now. 

It's in the CERT advisory: 

http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-22.html
#
#    W32/Sircam includes its own SMTP client capabilities, which it
#    uses to propagate via email. It determines its recipient list
#    by recursively searching for email addresses contained in all
#    *.wab (Windows Address Book) files in the %SYSTEM% folder.
#
#    Additionally, it searches the folders referred to by
#
#    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
#       CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\Cache
#
#    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
#       CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\Desktop
#
#    for files containing email addresses. 

All they had to have done was pull up
a WWW page with your address on it. 

An NIPC computer, an FBI (NIPC) agent investigating "terrorists". 

Not too surprising Tim "they need killing" May was addressed. 

Tim has certainly gotten a lot of SirCams! 

It's like an HTML WWW bug gift to Tim,
to see all the companies who were pulling
him up.
