 From Ditherati:

YOU CAN'T FIRE ME, I SUBMIT

"I care more about this than getting myself fired, but the fact is that 
getting myself fired today would have hurt Hewlett-Packard's Linux program."

Open-source guru Bruce Perens, on his courageous decision to keep drawing a 
paycheck instead of teaching conference- goers how to hack a DVD player, 
Wired News, 26 July 2002

********

Insteard of going to a conference, you could go to your favorite 
Hypermarche in Belgium or France and buy a multi zone DVD player.  Course 
then you can't use your NSTC tv set to connect it to but that's another 
problem.
