	Yes, but Cecilia and I were talking about censorship in
	tor-talk. Although there may be parallels with linux
	distributions or private clubs, this case is purely a free
	speech case. 

	Cecilia said 'moderation' (that is censorship) was almost
	always bad, but sometimes 'justified'(or something like that).

	Given the 'context' and as far as I'm concerned, Cecilia was
	saying that banning all the people that tor-fascists banned was
	'justified' 'ok' or whatever. 
	
	By the way, Cecilia's 'argument'  is pretty much
	self-defeating. If censorship is OK 'sometimes', then she can't
	complain about being censored 'sometimes', like 'this' time.

	Yes.

	Yes.

	Well, if we had mechanisms for 'public' free speech  then
	private censorship might be more tolerable. But right now we
	have the worst of both worlds. Public and private censorship.

	As to the so called tor-project, it is a 'public' project in
	more than one sense. It's funded by 'public'(stolen) money, it's
	'open source', it can be used by anyone, and it's a MILITARY
	project of the US military, which happens to be invading and
	has military bases in tens of countries all over the world. All
	the people being attacked by the US military are an unwilling
	party to the United States Private Club.



> Juan, I'd like your thoughts on this proposition.
