Yada Yada blah blah blah...Let's take a closer look at the females in Harry 
Potter.
Let's compare Harry Potter, a kid's book, to Tom Clancy's macho war-porn 
books. Clancy's The Hunt for Red October doesn't have a single woman in it. 
It's men, submarines, and aircraft carriers. Boys and their toys. At some 
point, a woman reviewer complained that Clancy didn't have any women in his 
novels, so the next Clancy novel starts off with a woman. Within thirty 
pages, she manages to stand next to a car bomb and is literally vaporized 
out of the novel. That'll teach women to be in Tom Clancy novels!
So why do women get the same treatment in a children's book?
The women and girls in The Sorcerer's Stone are weak, whining, bitches. The 
boys Harry and his friend Ron are the central characters. The girl is the 
annoying Hermione, a prissy know-it-all who already read the entire year's 
schoolwork before school starts and knows all the answers in class. When 
the boys want to go exploring in the school at night, she warns them, but 
often ends up tagging along. She casts a spell, but can't do it right and 
hits the wrong person. After she answers classroom questions, Ron complains 
to Harry "It's no wonder no one can stand her. She's a nightmare, 
honestly." She overhears this and ends up crying alone in the bathroom and 
the boys "...quickly put Hermione out of their minds."
While she is weeping alone in the girls' bathroom, a dangerous troll 
enters(and he is dragging a long wooden club. The Freudians are going to 
extend their profession another ten years just with this scene.)
