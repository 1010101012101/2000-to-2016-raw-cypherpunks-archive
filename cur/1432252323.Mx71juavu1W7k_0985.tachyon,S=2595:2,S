There was an article on optical tempest based on reading modem-LEDs,
which are sometimes modulated with the data stream.  For Mhz rates it
works.

The idea of reading the *matte* reflection of the CRT beam is possible.
But its not *spatial* frequency, its using intensity vs. time.
At any one instant you have a single 1-D measurement.
This exploits the fact, as stated, that the phosphor is brightest under
the
(scanning) beam.  There is no spatial info present.  You simply need
a sensitive (contrast is low) and fast (raster rate) optical
measurement.
