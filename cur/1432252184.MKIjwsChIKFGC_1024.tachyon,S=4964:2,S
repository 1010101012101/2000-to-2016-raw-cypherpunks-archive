    WorldNetDaily Reports WTC Terrorists Used Encryption
    posted by admin on Friday September 21, @05:17PM

    There must be something about encryption and terrorists in
    the same graf that makes levelheaded journalists go nutty. Just take a
    compelling -- if only because it's so strange -- article posted
    Thursday on the conservative WorldNetDaily news site. It claims,
    implausibly, that Osama bin Laden "has the NSA beat on the employment
    front, hiring the best computer experts on the market." One allegedly
    is Nabil Khan Kani, a Syrian living in Barcelona. Kani's supposedly
    the author of some data-hiding steganography products that have been
    giving U.S. spies fits. An excerpt: "Computer and terrorism experts
    suggest that the missing Syrian computer whiz was the author of the
    technology known as steganography... This technology enables users to
    bypass electronic monitoring by hiding messages randomly in seemingly
    innocent digital files, such as music files, those of the popular
    online marketplace eBay, pornographic files or even e-mail headers...
    U.S. intelligence has been unable to trace their authors and
    recipients in the three years since first detecting evidence of their
    existence in the files of the bin Laden organization. U.S. agencies
    now believe that the attacks in New York and Washington were
    coordinated through those encrypted electronic messages, which were
    opened by 'key' holders. They also believe that terrorists are in
    possession of all or part of the codes used by the Drug Enforcement
    Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, Air Force
    Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Naval Intelligence, Marine Corps
    Intelligence and the intelligence offices of the State Department and
    Department of Energy." Watch for Sen. Judd "Anti-Crypto" Gregg to
    cite this report in a floor speech.
