And if we add local "intelligence" in the form of allowing airport screeners 
to act on their hunches, then there's one more step:

Airport Screener didn't get her child-support check from the ex and as a 
result is saving her crack for lunchtime...frisks well-heeled and arguably 
spolied white-guy with a little 'tude who proceeds to give said screener 
some 'feedback'...Airport screener figures she'll brighten up her own 
morning and prevents said white-guy from flying: "Hey, something told me 
this guy was trouble, so fire me and I'll work for Starbucks instead."

One day, I may be willing to subscribe to the commonly held cypherpunk 
belief that any law from a government is basically a bad thing, but AFAIC we 
don't need to get that far yet. When laws boil down the decision-in-a-vacuum 
and whim of the enforcer, Break out the Zombie patriots.
