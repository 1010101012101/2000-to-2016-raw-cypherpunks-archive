Make Your Computer Programs, Data Invisible to Everyone Except Yourself
with MyInvisibleDisk

 (PRLEAP.COM) MyInvisibleDisk uses an existing free space on your computer
drives and create a vault-like container to store all your secret programs
and data. It functions similarly to your C-drive on your computer. The
real-time encryption technology used is based on the Advanced Encryption
Standard with 256-bit keys, which was approved by the National Security
Agency (U.S.A.) to protect U.S. government top-level secrets in June 2003.
This
 is considerably stronger than the 112-bit Triple-Data Encryption Standard
technology used by local banks and governmental agencies.

 One of MyInvisibleDisk's unique features is being immune against all
hardware and software keystroke recorders which are the scourge of all
password-based security systems. By adopting a keyboard-free approach,
users can expect unrivaled security with a powerful, elegantly simple
click-and-use interface.

 MyInvisibleDisk also uses proprietary techniques to remove, safely and
silently, all possible traces of encryption usage on the user's computer
including the computer's page-file without any changes to the computer
registry. It also has the unique ability to morph into a harmless-looking
application tool in the absence of a genuine key or faced with a tampered
key.

 According to Bruce Schneier, a world-renown author, cryptography and
computer security expert, "In the real world, key management is the hardest
part of cryptography. Designing secure cryptographic algorithms and
protocols isn't easy, but you can rely on a large body of academic
research. Keeping the keys secret is much harder". MyInvisibleDisk is
unique, being probably the only publicly available product to emphasize on
its numerous key-management functionalities.

 MyInvisibleDisk is currently available in two versions, Professional and
Enterprise for computers using Windows XP. The Professional version is
suitable for single-computer users; the Enterprise version can protect up
to a maximum of eight computers with a single USB device. Companies can
purchase different combinations of these two products.

 MyInvisibleDisk prices starts at the special introductory offer of RM680
(US$179) per computer. Reseller and OEM enquiries are welcomed.
