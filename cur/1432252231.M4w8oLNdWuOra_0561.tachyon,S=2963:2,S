Prime Sinister Jim Choate says:

Oh Google, what were his exact words?

SCOTUS said it violates the "home is the castle" principle,
because there were no longer any walls. You could see inside.

What part of "see inside" don't you understand?

I quoted Diffie Whitfield:

    "An essential element of freedom is the right to privacy, a right that
    cannot be expected to stand against an unremitting technological attack."

To which you replied that Diffie was an idiot.

Who looks like an idiot now?
