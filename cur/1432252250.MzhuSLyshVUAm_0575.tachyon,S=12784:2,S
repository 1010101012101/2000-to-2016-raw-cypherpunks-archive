The reference to Glenn's "Create your own SSL certiiate" article is
weird; what he talks about in that Ars Technica piece not a replacement
for a VPN by any means, and I think the reference would just confuse
anyone who was not technical. 

I think these days you have to tie Forbes' (good) advice not to save
everything with an encouragement to use full disk encryption. We're in
an awkward space right now where we can't fully guarantee that data gets
deleted off a modern flash (SSD) drive, even with previously strong
deletion tools. And forensics software is good enough to pick up a lot
of local clues about what you've used your own computer for, even if you
think you've turned off all logs and removed the saving of sensitive
data. Minimize what you record, but also encrypt.

I'd be cautious about explicitly recommending Word's encryption as they
do -- if you save encrypted docs in 97/2000 mode, they're instantly
breakable, and there are dedicated tools out there to break later
versions. I don't know whether they exploit later weaknesses, or are
just fancy password crackers.

Usual provisos about Skype (and Silent Circle to a certain extent). 

It's *really* hard to permanently recommend particular products, without
at least making the statement "Keep an eye for news that the tools you
use are vulnerable, and keep the software updated." 

We really need to stop making this exclusively about the tools, and make
it more about the practices, and tools that can reinforce those
practices. This article isn't that bad at all about that -- but you want
to be able to get people to a point where they can tell themselves
whether a package looks like snake oil or not.
