If there is any insinuation that this implies to _computer_ OSes, I 
disagree completely.

My first OS was some OS I don't remember from an HP 9825 computer. Too 
trivial to remember.

(Actually, I used various BASIC machines prior to this, from 1968-74, 
but they rarely had OS names that were memorable.)

Then RT-11 on a DEC PDP-11/34A. Then RSX-11M on the same machine.

Then some exposure in 1978-79 to Unix, courtesy of some of my friends 
who were active in the Unix community.

Then VMS for the VAX.

Then PC-DOS for the first IBM PC.

Then the LISP-based OS for the Symbolics LISP Machine. This was a 
wonderful OS.

Then the Mac OS, starting with Finder 1.0/Chooser 1.0 in 1984 (and 
proceeding to every version).

Occasional use of Windows 1.0 (horrible) in 1984, Windows 2.0 around 
1986 (still unusable), and Windows 3.0/3.1 around 1990 (the first OS to 
catch up to where the Mac had been years earlier).

For the past couple of years I've had Mac OS X on all four of my Macs 
able to run it efficiently. It has bits and pieces of BSD Unix, a Mach 
kernel, and of course a wonderful graphics interface.

So, no, one's first OS is not always the best.
