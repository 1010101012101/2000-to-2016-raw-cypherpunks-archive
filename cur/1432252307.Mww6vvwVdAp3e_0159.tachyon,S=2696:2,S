Well, they could just tune in on Echelon, which really seems to be reality. 
There is no need for "infinite" resources to do such a thing.

Here is the fundamental misunderstanding. Your email is no "account". There 
are no place where your account is stored. The only thing that exists is an 
endpoint, where you receive your mail. Before the mail reaches that point, 
its's just TCP-packets on the wire. If the listener is on a mail router, 
you could possibly see a trace of it in the message header, but it's 
possible to rewrite that stuff to, so the only way to KNOW if someone reads 
your mail is to analyze the potential readers behaviour based on the 
information in your mail.
