Not sure why a sexist slur makes any difference.  Murderous?  Are all US =

Feel free to point out the propaganda.  There certainly have been untrue =

officials, and usually are followed up quickly by public dissection and c=

the very short term, this is sometimes propaganda, but usually it seems m=

We call it 'free press' and 'investigative journalism'.  Sure, there is a=
 little bias in what they decide to investigate.  But any
untruths would be quickly countered by another news organization somewher=
e in the Western world.  Or RT, which doesn't seem half bad
except for certain Russian-interest reporting.

Basic humanist principles.  If you think that allowing people to suffer a=
nd die in ignorance, from disease, starvation, and stone
age practices, is the only way to avoid fascism, then your argument is pr=
etty weak.  What is fascist about educating people about
science, sociology, psychology, etc.?

The US and the Western world have been dominating the world in the cultur=
al / technological / defense senses for a long, long time.=20
Usually, they studiously try to avoid direct domination now by enlightene=
d choice. To a large extent, the US doesn't want or need to
dominate the world except for security purposes.  Everyone sane wants peo=
ple everywhere to have better lives in every sense.  A few
of those people think that expanding religion is the answer; I'm complete=
ly opposed to that in all forms.  Most think that better
secular knowledge and training would produce a much better life, regardle=
ss of starting point.  Unfortunately, minimizing knowledge
is a key component is a key part of the survival meme set of many religio=
ns.  The truly educated tend to graduate from religion.

If you were to choose 1000, and maybe even only 100 competent individuals=
 with a good range of knowledge and skill from the US or a
number of Western countries, and placed them in a village anywhere in the=
 world, absent fundamentalist warfare, they would start a
growing evolution / revolution within a generation.  The differences betw=
een societies aren't geographic, genetic, or magic: poorly
educated people with broken culture will fail anywhere while the opposite=
 is generally true.  Nationalist fighting as if it were
equivalent sports teams or family feud squabbles with no right or wrong j=
ust obscures the real issues.  That tends to hurt everyone
not in the US and EU; on average, it hardly affects our lives.

For me, Russia is a Western country in this sense.  Metropolitan China, J=
apan, and India are too.  So, First World really, but most
of those are converging on Western values where it counts.

    We call it 'free press' and 'investigative journalism'.  Sure, there
    is a little bias in what they decide to investigate.  But any
    untruths would be quickly countered by another news organization
    somewhere in the Western world.  Or RT, which doesn't seem half bad
    except for certain Russian-interest reporting.<br>

    Basic humanist principles.  If you think that allowing people to

    practices, is the only way to avoid fascism, then your argument is
    pretty weak.  What is fascist about educating people about science,

    The US and the Western world have been dominating the world in the
    cultural / technological / defense senses for a long, long time. 
    Usually, they studiously try to avoid direct domination now by
    enlightened choice. To a large extent, the US doesn't want or need
    to dominate the world except for security purposes.  Everyone sane
    wants people everywhere to have better lives in every sense.  A few
    of those people think that expanding religion is the answer; I'm
    completely opposed to that in all forms.  Most think that better
    secular knowledge and training would produce a much better life,
    regardless of starting point.  Unfortunately, minimizing knowledge
    is a key component is a key part of the survival meme set of many
    religions.  The truly educated tend to graduate from religion.<br>
    <br>
    If you were to choose 1000, and maybe even only 100 competent
    individuals with a good range of knowledge and skill from the US or
    a number of Western countries, and placed them in a village anywhere
    in the world, absent fundamentalist warfare, they would start a
    growing evolution / revolution within a generation.  The differences
    between societies aren't geographic, genetic, or magic: poorly
    educated people with broken culture will fail anywhere while the
    opposite is generally true.  Nationalist fighting as if it were
    equivalent sports teams or family feud squabbles with no right or
    wrong just obscures the real issues.  That tends to hurt everyone
    not in the US and EU; on average, it hardly affects our lives.<br>
    <br>
    For me, Russia is a Western country in this sense.  Metropolitan
    China, Japan, and India are too.  So, First World really, but most
    of those are converging on Western values where it counts.<br>

The US has no need to try to make people like it; that should not
generally be a goal.  But the world, especially including the capable
Western world, both governments and populations, has a responsibility
to educate those with abject ignorance, poverty, and knowing nothing
but conflict that there are better ways of being, limitless
opportunities, and that they could effectively work to modernize and
become effective societies and cultures.  We need something similar
to 'genocide' to identify pathological ignorance, recognize that it
leads to the ruin of many lives, and determine how to take action to
stop it.  There is no need for each culture to be exactly like the
West or a particular form of government, but they should understand
the options, understand how things can work effectively and why, and
be able to incorporate elements in a local way to eventually make it
work.  We need to decide how hands off we should be in allowing large
areas to fumble about without making progress and even regress.  The
prime directive should only apply to societies that are functioning
to a reasonable degree.

An interesting question is whether and how poisoned thinking, i.e.
bad memes, are shared, instilled, and propagated to eventually create
terrorists and criminals:  What should we do to prevent spreading
poisonous ideas?  Should we be rooting out bad imams, literature,
religious leaders?  Ideally, our values and culture is an effective
answer to these sources, but, just like in the biological world,
eventually a successful defense will occur.  If you've read The
Selfish Gene, you know that truth, rightness, or goodness are not the
goals of particular genes or memes (ideas).  The only thing that
determines success is successful competition and replication.  Our
Western ideas can successfully compete and replicate against these
bad meme sets, but only if they are present.  We seem to be in a
situation where some of our allies are supporting the teaching of
memes that are directly opposed to modern knowledge, including social
and political knowledge.  What should we do about that?

All of this is crosscutting to security, encryption, communication,
publishing, and surveillance.  Distrust is healthy, and sometimes
prudent.  And, if we fail totally as a modern society, we may need it
to maintain a modern underground in our new dark ages.  In addition
to safe commerce and social connection, and balancing government and
keeping it healthy, we should even better organize and extend the
ways that we help enlighten the ignorant while combating meme cancer.

I imagine that soon we'll have universally available Internet (LEOs
for instance), ultra-inexpensive devices (smart phones are down to
$50 or less now), and organized, complete, and effective educational
material that is somehow available, safe, and effective for
everyone.  There should be some kind of support systems of various
kinds, to the extent possible.  We are failing for not working toward
these kind of things effectively enough.
