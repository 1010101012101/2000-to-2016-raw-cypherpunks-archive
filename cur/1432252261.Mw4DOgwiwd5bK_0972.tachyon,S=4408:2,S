And why not name who this researcher was, and why you think the cipher 
he was trying to break was Cypherpunks-interesting?

(Mere factors of 100 are not interesting, vis-a-vis good ciphers and 
large keys. Arguably, as we have discussed many times, not even 
"swimming pools full of Adleman DNA computers" make a difference.)

Fatuous nonsense, Beowulf clusters have been out for several years. The 
hard part is getting 50 Pentiums, not the software.

As for "50 gigaflops," big whoop. A readily-available dual G4 machine is 
rated at about 8-10 gigaflops. (Or "FLOPS," as you wish.)

Still not interesting for cracking ciphers, in the real world.

You need to get up to speed, so to speak.
