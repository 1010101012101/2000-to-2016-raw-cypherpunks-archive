I disagree.  A punk would assume any server not under their control
archives everything, as do all routers between said punk and the server.

We should use the service but only send encrypted mail :-)

The net never forgets.  BlackNet would support that behavior even in
the face of Men with Guns.

The LA riots were excellent reminders to the layfolk that guns are
important.  BlackNet's persistant-despite-your-guns behavior is
an excellent reminder to curb your info-promiscuity.

Yep.  It could still be useful for things like distributed data storage,

dead-man switches, etc.  where content is encrypted.  Much like
any other free service, only nominally with more storage.
