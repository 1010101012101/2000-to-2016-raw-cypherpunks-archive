Official secretkeepers of NATO, Russia and their fearsome enemies
know these kinds of stories are meant to reduce fear and defense
expenditures so should be applauded as tricks of the anti-war
industry which must be resisted with fearless slaughter of many
terrified civilians and a tiny few luckless warfighters who drive
drunk to the PTSD club and overshoot (over-drone) a construction
barrier of the crumbling National Defense Highway system to sink into
a toxic lake of endless war waste surrounding every military base
on the planet and rapidly growing throughout the universe with
application of war technology to invasion of the heavens for
peaceful, merely scientific, although top secret, purposes,
that is to erect intergalactic shields of protection of hapless
creatures being drained of their vital fluids for nourishing the
Great Gods of National and Environmental Security, now
blessed by Pope Francis for the benefit of Great Architecture
afficionados from St Peter to Pentagon to whereever Strangeloves
squat before vast Sony plasmas of roach-squashing, fail/safe
buttons neutered, flesh life as known and loathed by cryogenic
demigodly automatons aimed for extinction.
