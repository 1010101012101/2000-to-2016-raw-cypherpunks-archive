--------------------
Do the numbers:

The electoral college standings are currently:

Bush: 246
Gore: 255

Undecided states:
Florida 25
New Mexico 5
Oregon 7

Total 538

If Bush gets Florida, but not OR & NM, he gets 270 votes,
and Gore gets 268. 

One Bush elector defecting puts both at 269, a dead heat.
