America's Jews who are in politics are the new "trustys" (or is it 
"trustees"?).

They are like the Jews who helped load the furnaces with other Jews. 
They hoped for better treatment by the camp managers. Often they were 
sent to the furnaces when their usefulness was over...with new trustys 
doing the dirty work.

Something in the Jew makes him a sucker for following orders.

Feinstein, Schumer, Lieberman, all of the despicable Jews pushing police 
state measures...they hope that if they lick Big Brother's boot they'll 
be safe.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
