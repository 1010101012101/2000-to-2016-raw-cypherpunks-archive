Agree. I was just asking if there was any evidence that tech security
licensing was the intent.

Agree. And furthermore, you should erase all thoughts of this from their
minds. Especially since many of the best consultants have dark pasts. Yes, I
think you should be concerned. Crypto and "magickal knowledge" is a threat.
Be afraid, be very afraid...

Erroneous assumptions. I don't even like protection licenses in the states.
I understand the reasons for them, and think these reasons are valid, but
the "license" is no indication of ability. Indeed, some of the very best....

I'm most violently against any licensing scheme of the sort, and THIS ONE IN
PARTICULAR. Ya'll keep dialing the wrong damn number with me. I'm starting
to get miffed about it. Go beat your chest somewhere else, Declan. :)
