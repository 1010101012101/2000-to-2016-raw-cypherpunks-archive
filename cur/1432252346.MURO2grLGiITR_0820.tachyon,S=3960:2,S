Actually, that's an interesting point.

In places like downtown NYC, if the fiber doesn't actually go to the 
basement of a building, it will certainly go within a few 100 feet, so that 
last hop is trivial. (But the kind of companies this would be targeted for 
this would already have fiber to the premises or FTTP anyway....however, 
that fiber will only on occasion make it all the way to the telecom 
room...the internal building wiring will often be copper.)

However, it's not like you'd have a continuous piece of fiber all the way 
from Customer X Location A to Customer X Location B...you'd definitely go 
through at least one fiber distributing frame (FDF) aka an optical "patch 
panel". However, the connectors will almost certainly be at least slightly 
anisotropic, so you'd get a wavefunction collapse, or at least diminish the 
distance you can go.

So I imagine they actually perform a splice and remove the connectors...this 
will limit you of course to new, high quality fiber (which is extremely 
isotropic, and I know this for a fact having previously done a lot of 
testing for PMD, or Polarization Mode Dispersion.)

An interesting thing to think about is the fact that in dense metro areas, 
you pretty much have a "star" from the CO out to a premise (which is the 
cause of deployment of "Collapsed SONET Rings"). This means the other photon 
of your encrypted pair might easily pass through the same CO somewhere, 
which would make the system suscpetible to a sort of man in the middle 
attack. Or at least, your fancy quantum crypto system has defaulted back to 
standard crypto in terms of its un-hackability.

Moral of this story is, even if this thing is useful, you'll probably have a 
very hard time finding a place it can be deployed and still retain its 
"advantages".
