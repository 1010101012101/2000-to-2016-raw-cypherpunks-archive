Allow me to introduce myself: coi rodo mi'e stivn. (Lojban: Hey, all, 
I'm Steve.) I might have something to contribute to this subthread.

Lojban (not Logban; that's a conflation of the names Loglan and Lojban) 
isn't LALR-1. The grammar can be parsed by yacc only through creative 
use of the error-catching mechanism. It's a very impressive feat of 
yacc-hacking, don't get me wrong, but it's a hack nonetheless. And the 
grammar was indeed crafted to fit in a hacked yacc parser. A real 
parser which can properly handle grammatical errors in a chunk of 
Lojban text needs a more powerful language.

Given that, Bill's point is correct: Lojban's gammar has practically 
nothing in common with any natural language.

co'o rodo
stivn.
