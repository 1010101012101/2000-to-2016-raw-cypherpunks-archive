This brings to mind something which would be a very cool project: Have
a digital camera that public key encrypts the photos before storing
them.  Obviously the private key would be stored in some other safe
place, so if the camera is stolen, no one can see what the photographs
are.  I'm sure Canon will never add this feature, but someday soon
these things may be running Linux and may be hackable.

Anyway, I can't wait to see the photos.
