Apparently a new Crypto chip from nCipher.
What's the C-punks view on this standard--FIPS 140-2 Level 3? Anyone have a 
link to this document?





REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Ingrian Networks, the leader in Active Application 
Security solutions, announced it has extended its strategic relationship 
with nCipher Inc. (LSE:NCH), a leading provider of cryptographic IT security 
solutions, to empower customers with a new, unsurpassed level of protection 
for information delivered across the Internet. As a result of this 
collaboration, Ingrian now delivers the highest level of SSL security and 
private key protection available in a single security platform.

This breakthrough capability, now available in Ingrians i215 and i225 
secure networking platforms, is the result of collaborating with nCipher to 
ensure its cryptographic modules are compliant with the FIPS (Federal 
Information Processing Standards) 140-2 Level 3 specification for protection 
of private cryptographic keys. This new specification significantly enhances 
the security of SSL transactions and virtually eliminates the threat of 
cyber attacks via SSL tunnels.

Sensitive business data is only as secure as the private keys that protect 
that data, said Rod Murchison, VP of Product and Corporate Development at 
Ingrian Networks. If a cyber attacker gets the master key, it can unlock a 
lot of sensitive data and be very costly to businesses. This new 
FIPS-compliant technology offers customers the most advanced security 
available for private cryptographic keys and SSL transactions. Its the 
level of protection that a growing number of customers want and expect from 
Ingrian platforms.
