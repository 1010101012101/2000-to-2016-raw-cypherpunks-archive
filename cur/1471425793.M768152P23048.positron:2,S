I like comedy as much as you, but a joke does not take away from the
principle of a competitive market for systems, over the long term. The
DAO was not a single contract, nor a series of contracts. It was "a
contract in a competitive market for contracts" in the sense that it was
"a decentralised investment fund/ market maker" in the market for
"decentralized investment funds/ market makers".

But I assume you knew that..
