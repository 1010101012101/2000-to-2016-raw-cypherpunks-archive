DIY fingerprint idea thwarts ID thieves
By John Leyden (john.leyden at theregister.co.uk)

The Home Office is touting ID cards as a solution to ID theft in today's
Queen's Speech (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4034543.stm) but a
Yorkshire man has taken matters into his own hands. Jamie Jameson, a civil
servant from Scarborough in North Yorkshire, insists that credit can only
be extended in his name on production of a thumbprint.

Jameson hit on the idea of writing to the UK's three main credit reference
agencies - Equifax, Experian and Call Credit - and requesting that they put
a 'Notice of Correction' on his file stating that a print must be offered
with applications for loans or credit cards issued in his name. At the same
time he submitted his fingerprint.

This Notice of Correction of the first thing a prospective lender will see
when it calls up his records. Normally this facility provides a way for
individuals to explain why they have a county court judgement against their
name or other qualifications to their credit history. Jameson is using it
to do a cheap security check.

Although uncommon in the UK, thumbprints are often used as an audit
mechanism for people cashing cheques in US banks. A similar scheme was
trialled
(http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe_news_w/news_details.asp?newsid=169) in
Wales. Jameson takes a little ink pad similar to that used in US banks
around with him all the time just in case he might need it.

If an application for credit is accepted without a thumbprint - against
Jameson's express instructions - then he will not be liable for losses. If
a would-be fraudster gives a false print on an application then it makes it
easier for them to be traced by the police. "Lenders don't have to match
prints. Using prints just establishes an audit trail if anything goes
wrong," Jameson explained. "It's not so much me proving who I am as
preventing someone else being me."

Jameson has been using the idea successfully for over a year. He concedes
that the scheme isn't foolproof and that it's possible to fake
(http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/16/gummi_bears_defeat_fingerprint_sensors/)
fingerprints ("nothing's perfect," as he puts it). As far as Jameson knows
he's the only person who's using the technique in the UK. The scheme delays
the issuing of credit, which could be a problem with people who apply for
multiple accounts but this is a minor inconvenience for Jameson. "This is
driven by the individual so there are no data protection issues. It's a
real deterrent to ID theft," he told El Reg. .
