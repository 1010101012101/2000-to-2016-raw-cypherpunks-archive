Given the amount of unix knowledge involved I don't think that judges me at
all. Maybe you judge me for my lack of unix skills, which I would easily
admit are lacking.

I don't feel comfortable being put at the advanced PHP magic level. I doubt
it's fair to my skill. Ulbricht actually did pretty well. Bringing disaster
is also avoidable on many different levels.

Making games will not help you learn security at all. It might make you
learn coding fast and dirty. They're totally different styles.

Do or do not. There is no try.

It's most likely the lack of appeal of a security job.  It takes more than
learning actually, it takes inventing.
