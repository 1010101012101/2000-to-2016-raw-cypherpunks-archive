Here is the new painting I have been working on for the last five months. 
It is called the "The Forgotten Man." It makes a pretty bold statement as 
to what's happening in our country. Please pray for our family.

"Never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and public
plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to
the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always
be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by
predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty."

Joseph Pulitzer, 1907 Speech
