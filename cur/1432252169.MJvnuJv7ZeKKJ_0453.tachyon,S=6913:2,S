Bob,

The distinction between geometry, topology, and, presumably, homology, begs
the question.

You, following Huber, have used the word geodesic to refer to connections
of minimal cost. In the economic manifold (surface) this is presumably the
only important metric (local distance function).  The analogy is
mathematically precise in all respects, and therefore correct.

I'd have flogged you into submission long before this if it were not so.

Geodesics, or more properly, geodesic paths, are locally defined.  There is
not necessarily a geodesic between two specific points.  In a
differentiable manifold with a sufficiently smooth metric, there are
geodesic paths in every direction through every point, however.  Whether
there is one of those paths going to some other given point is a question
of connectivity and other topological issues.  Two separate spheres are a
single differential manifold.  No great circle path -- the geodesics of
each surface -- connects any point on one sphere with any point of the
other.

Unfortunately, geodesics may also be the longest paths between two points.
Just go the wrong way on the great circle determined by two ends of the
Mass Ave bridge.  It's a path of stationary length: slight variations in
the path make hardly any difference in its length.  Unfortunately its
length is maximum rather than minimum.

By the way, have I mentioned that I HATE it when I agree with Tim?

Topology is typically not concerned with distance metrics. Doughnuts
and coffee cups and all.

Geometry is what you're thinking of, presumably.

Not as sexy as saying something is "a topologically-invariant
geodesic fractally-cleared auction space," but that's what happens
when buzzwords are used carelessly.

By the way, one topological aspect of a geodesic dome, to go back to
that, is that each node is surrounded by some number of neighbors.
Applied to a "geodesic economy," this image/metaphor would strongly
suggest that economic agents are trading with their neighbors, who
then trade with other neighbors, and so on.

Tribes deep in the Amazon, who deal only with their neighbors, are
then the canonical "geodesic economy."

This is precisely the _opposite_ of the mulitiply-connected trading
situation which modern systems make possible.

So, aside from the cuteness of suggesting a connection with geodesic
domes, with buckybits as the currency perhaps?, this all creates
confusion rather than clarity.
