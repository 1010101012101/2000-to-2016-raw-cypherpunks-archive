We have moved beyond surveillance as a criminal deterrent to surveillance as
punishment. The Yoke in the Ye Ole' Commons. Sexual offender registration,
et. al. A private company has started an email service to notify you when an
offender moves into your area.

In contrast to your author, I think you would agree that we are
incorporating the criminal "spectacle," and an "overtly performative affair"
in various contexts. Many of these designs go beyond the necessities of
criminal monitoring and restraint.

Tim's comment about facial recognition ("Smart CCTV" on the signage) being a
social mindgame does bring to mind predictions of a surveillance caste
system and real-space criminal "blocks" or enclaves (i.e. Escape From New
York). "We're watching you" = "Don't come here," pragmatically forcing
undesirables outside legitimate transactional and social systems.
