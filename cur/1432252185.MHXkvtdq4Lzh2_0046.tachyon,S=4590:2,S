CALL FOR NOMINATIONS - 2006 PET AWARD

[Please forward and distribute]

You are invited to submit nominations to the 2006 PET Award.

The PET Award is presented annually to researchers who have made
an outstanding contribution to the theory, design, implementation,
or deployment of privacy enhancing technology. It is awarded at
the annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Workshop (PET). The PET
Award carries a prize of 3000 Euros thanks to the generous support
of Microsoft.

Any paper by any author written in the area of privacy enhancing
technologies is eligible for nomination. However, the paper must
have appeared in a refereed journal, conference, or workshop with
published proceedings in the period that goes from the end of the
penultimate PET Workshop (the PET workshop prior to the last PET
workshop that has already occurred: i.e. June 2004) until April
15th, 2006. The complete Award rules including eligibility
requirements can be found at http://petworkshop.org/award/.

    - A nomination statement of no more than 250 words.

All nominations must be submitted by April 15th, 2006. A
seven-member Award committee will select one or two winners among
the nominations received. Winners must be present at the PET
workshop in order to receive the Award. This requirement can be
waived only at the discretion of the PET Advisory board.
