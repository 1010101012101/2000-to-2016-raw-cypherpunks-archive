It has not stopped them in the past.  Here in Oregon, the local LEAs were
caught using illegal wiretaps to listen in on the local hydroponics
dealer.  (I never heard what became of that case. probably swept under the
carpet like so many others around here.)

Of course, this is the city that was sending information about
undesirables to the JDL.

They go after pot growers because few of them shoot back.  (Unlike dealers
in harder substances.)  With the seizure laws, these raids become a high
income - low risk form of fund raising for the department.

Of course, if you look at Oracle's license fees, they are going to be
lucky if they can buy bullets after Oracle's sales people get done with
them...
