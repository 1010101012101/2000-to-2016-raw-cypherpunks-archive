I have been giving a lot of thought to auction protocols that would work
using signed encrypted packets distributed by a Gnutella-style peer-to-peer
network.  Tim is absolutely right -- the world needs an online marketplace
that does not have a central administrative or corporate point of attack --
or rather, the world is getting one whether it needs it or not.

So far, all of the ideas I have come up would require a relatively stable
system for recording reputation capital and associating it with nyms.  I
haven't figured out a protocol for doing THAT without it becoming a point of
attack for the decentralized market system.

It would help a lot if someone figured out a way to set up an Ebay style
feedback system for nyms that received significant usage from many different
groups of traders of a type not readily susceptible of being demonized.
Then a decentralized auction system could outsource that function without
the function becoming a  vulnerable attack point.
