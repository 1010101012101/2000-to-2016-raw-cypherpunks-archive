Very interesting question.  I wonder if the engineers who make the
things
consider a transient that blows the diode, and fries your fovea too.
I'd
like to see the technical argument that it "can't happen".  99.999 %
still means a few cyclops a year.

The laypeoples' (albeit largely irrational) fear of ionizing radiation
keeps some
domestic body-scans from happening (though not at the borders).  There
might be more serious cause for concern from lasers in eyes.  A few
stray
lawsuits could obtain free publicity.  Maybe from folks taking meds that

make them photosensitive, folks with macular degeneration, or just plain

HAARP-makes-me-crazy folks.

Good question.
