You mean "Microsoft Corp" not "the author", right? :-) 

You aren't responsible for others' use of your creations.

Despite the idiotic recent lawsuits against gun makers, 
publishers of hit-man books, AOL for helping sell kitty prawn, 
tobacco manuf, etc.  The number of such lawsuits is a symptom
of the decline.

Besides, the author probably doesn't have the Deep Pockets that
motivates these abuses.
