Using cookies for maintaining state in applications like that
is what cookies were originally intended for; it's reasonable to
check and remind people to turn them on for those applications.
But in general, they won't be useful for determining whether
somebody's running a junk buster or not because lots of people
do turn them off.

If 10% of them run junkbusters, it's no real problem for you.
If 90% of them do, that'd be a different issue.
				Thanks!
