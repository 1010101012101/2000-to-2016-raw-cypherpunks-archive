When opportunity knocks, open the door ! Just see below on how to make this 
EXPLOSIVE program work for you!!!

            --------------------------------------------

            Here are instructions on how to make $10,000 US cash in the next few 
weeks:

            There are 4 addresses listed below.

            1.   Send the person at the top of the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces of 
paper (to securely hide it), along with a note that says: 
"Please add me to your mailing list".
           2.    Then delete that name, move the other 3 up, also sending them each a 
$5 dollar bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note 
that says: "Please add me to your mailing list", and put your name at the bottom.
            3. SEND $5 to ALL 4 people.
            4. THEN, delete the top person from the list,
                move #2 into the number 1 posistion, 
                move #3 into the #2 posistion and,
                move #4 into the #3 posistion, 
                then add your name and address in the # 4 posistion.

Now start sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. When 20            people 
receive it, those 20 people will move your name up to the             next position 
and they will each send out 20. That totals 400             people that will receive this 
letter with your name in the next posistion.            
Then, those 400 people will move your name up to the top and they            will 
each send out 20 E-mails. That totals 8,000 people that will            receive this E-
mail with your name at the top and they will each             send you a $5 bill.
8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill = $40,000 cash. That's if             everyone 
responds to this E-mail, but not everyone will, so you can            expect more 
realistically to receive about $10,000 cash in $5 bills            in your mailbox.
This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but            send 
only a US CASH $5 bill. NO CHECKS or MONEY ORDERS!!!
The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive. If             each 
person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people             that receive 
this letter when your name reaches the top. If only 1%             of those people 
respond, you will still get $50,000 cash.
Here is the list:

            ----------------------------------------------------------

1. Lisa Osnato
    1 Tomahawk Drive
    White Plains, N.Y.,    10603  

2. Lynn Vorhees
    PO Box 115
    Prattsville, N.Y.,   12468

3. Laurean Kile 
    3180 E.88th Ave. #82
    Thornton, CO.,   80229

4. Timothy M. Mclean
    105 Stokes Forrest Drive
    King, NC.,   27021


            THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. Once your name appears on the list, in a 
few days, you will start receiving $5 bills from other people just like yourself, who 
are willing to invest $20 to receive $10,000 cash.

            If you don't try it- you will never know. A $20 dollar investment             will 
make you thousands of dollars!!! Give it a try. Trust me, "You            Won't Be 
Sorry!" YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO MAKE MONEY!!!
                
            ---------------------------------------------------------- 
P/S:
There are two primary methods of building your downline EMAIL LIST: 
METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume 
you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume 
that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list the response could be 
much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs 
instead of 2,000. 
But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% 
response, that is  only 10 orders for POSISTION # 4. Those 10 people respond by 
sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 
people respond and order POSISTION # 3. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs 
each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that are 1,000 orders for 
POSISTION # 2. Those 1,000 send out 2,000  programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  
The 0.5% response to that are 10,000 orders for POSISTION # 1. 
That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this               example is 
$50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!
!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU 
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH  THIS PROGRAM! 
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR 
HALF  SENT OUT 100, 000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many 
people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to participate in this is 
practically nothing. You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail 
is FREE!!! 

                METHOD # 2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 
 Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive, and there          are 
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to             start 
small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to 
participate on your first level.  (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will 
EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR 
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.
 Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 
                1st level--your 10 members with 
                $5.......................................$50 
                2nd level--10 members from those 10 
                ($5 x 100)..................$500 
                3rd level--10 members from those 100 
                ($5 x 1,000)...........$5,000 
                4th level--10 members from those 1,000 
                ($5 x 10,000).....$50,000 
                THIS TOTALS ----------$55,550 
Notes:
1. ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) TO EACH POSISTION.
2. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED. 
3. ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL. 
4. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two         sheets of 
paper. On one of those sheets of paper, include: 
                (a) PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST
                (b) your name & postal address. 
SEND OUT THAT TWENT DOLLARS NOW AND JUST WAIT FOR THE CASH TO 
START ROLLING IN.
