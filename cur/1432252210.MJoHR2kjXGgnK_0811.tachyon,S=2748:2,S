Subject: Attacking a secure smartcard
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.929.2)

I've previously mentioned Flylogic as a company that does cool attacks  
on chip-level hardware protection.  In http://www.flylogic.net/blog/?p=18 
, they talk about attacking the ST16601 Smartcard - described by the  
vendor as offering "Very high security features including EEPROM flash  
erase (bulk-erase)".  The chip is covered by a metal mesh that, if cut  
or shorted, blocks operation.  However, Flylogic reports:

"Using our techniques we call, bmagicb (okay, itbs not magic but 
webre  not telling), we opened the bus and probed it keeping the chip 
alive.   We didnbt use any kind of expensive SEM or FIB.  The equipment 
used  was available back in the 90bs to the average hacker!  We didnbt 
even  need a university lab.  Everything we used was commonly available for  
under $100.00 USD.
This is pretty scary when you think that they are certifying these  
devices under all kinds of certifications around the world."
