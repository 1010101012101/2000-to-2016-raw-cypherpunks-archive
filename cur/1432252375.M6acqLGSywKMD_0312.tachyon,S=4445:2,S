I just had a Cypherpunks numbskull (who was also actively on the 
wrong side in the Elian debate) send me private mail asking why I 
would object to this. His exact words were:

"It's hard to imagine that someone quite disgusted with our
pseudo-democratic government will argue against ensuring
that everyone has a chance to vote ..."

Sometimes I despair.

We may need to make a list of the Cypherpunks idiots here and "mark 
them for deletion" during the next GC.
