Hello everybody,
it would be my pleasure to invite you to cypherpunk conference Parallel Pol=
is=20
Congress 2015 that will take place during 2-4.10.2015 in Prague / Central
Europe.

Don't hesitate and join this great and unique event (more information below=
).=20

Last year we had more than 1000 visitors from different countries, see the
schedule
http://www.paralelnipolis.cz/308/hackers-congress-paralelni-polis-2014-sche=
dule/

* Parallel Polis in theory

Parallel Polis is a theoretical concept developed by Czech dissident Vaclav=
=20
Benda (1942=E2=80=931999) during the height of communist domination in Czec=
hoslovakia=20
in the 1970s. It was translated into English in 1978.
Benda argues that in a repressed state, it is impossible to overturn corrup=
t=20
social, economic and political institutions. Such efforts are futile.
Instead, he suggests the creation of new "parallel institutions" that are m=
ore=20
responsible to human needs.

* Parallel Polis in practice

We were impressed by the concept of Vaclav Benda=E2=80=99s Parallel Polis a=
nd=20
Timothy C May=E2=80=99s Crypto Anarchistic Manifesto and Cyphernomicon.=20

Embracing the current crypto-technologies we have realized a practical=20
feasibility of these utopian theories and started a unique freedom think ta=
nk=20
focused on the promotion of digital freedom, cryptocurrencies, anonymizatio=
n=20
networks and free markets.

For this purpose we decided to rent a big 3-floor house (with almost 1000m2=
)=20
in the center of Prague (Hole=C5=A1ovice) - one floor dedicated to Bitcoin=
=20
coffee-house, hub and hackerspace called Institute of Cryptoanarchy. :)

* Founders of Parallel Polis

Parallel polis is 100% state-free project, based on voluntary contributions=
=20
only of our members and donors.
Founding members are people from Czech contemporary-art group Ztohoven=20
(http://ztohoven.com/) and group of cryptoanarchists from Czech and Slovak=
=20
hackerspaces, see their recent projects Moral Reform (hack of Czech=20
Parliament) http://juraj.bednar.sk/blog/2013/01/06/moral-reform-by-ztohoven=
-an-ultimate-hack/ and Citizen K ( http://artoftheprank.com/2010/06/19/ztoh=
oven-art-collective-launch-citizen-k-identity-swap/ )

* Parallel Polis Congress and why we need you!

Parallel Polis Congress is a 1-birthday party of a new era of our freedom.=
=20
For such a unique event, we decided to invite all speakers whom we have lov=
ed=20
and respected for a long time.

k=C3=A1 43,=20
