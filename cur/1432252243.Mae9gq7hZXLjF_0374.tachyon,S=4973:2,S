Besides the above points, a "rigorous and objective analysis" is work 
for bean counters...and is only interesting to other bean counters.

What got the Cypherpunks rolling was not "rigorous and objective 
analysis." Faustine has gradstudentitus. She or he will likely get his 
or her Masters or maybe even Ph.D. and will then vanish into the bowels 
of the Office of Implementational Policy Assessment, commuting to work 
each morning on the Metro, hoping to advance to GS-13 level before age 
40, and generally living a life of quiet desperation. But her or his 
analysis papers will be suitably dry and rigorous...and ignorable.

Two of our sessions at that Sierra retreat were vastly more useful than 
99% of the CATO and related "dry and rigorous" b.s. papers. One was a 
session on mapping the security holes in Bay Area government 
installations...most gubment sites are trivially accessible from 
wireless connections: sit in the parking lot a few buildings away and 
take down the Evil Empire!

Another interesting late night session was on ways to knock down 
airliners. The obvious approaches, but also a bunch of creative new 
ideas. Not for the faint of heart, of course, as a few pounds of Semtex 
up the butt is not exactly pleasant...but it's damned near undetectable 
by even their multimillion dollar scanners.

The thermite attack on bridge suspension cables also got discussed.  
Sarin, ricin, and India-1967 were covered in another session.

Meanwhile, grey burrowcrats are burrowing into their burrows in D.C., 
busily writing "rigorous and objective" reports on the benefits of 
welfare and why gun control is cost-effective. Feh. I hope to see the 
day when millions of them are gassed.
