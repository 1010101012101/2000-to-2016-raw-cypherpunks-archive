Right you are, in "security" context is everything.  My take on
the Cypherpunk Way is, start with design concepts for maximum
security (!= absolute security), then trim the security
constraints back just enough to permit useful work to be done on a
cost effective basis.

This is vs. industry standard security, where one starts with no
security considerations at all, then adds just enough security to
cover the largest perceived (!= actual) threats from potential
adversaries.

Compare UNIX style OS architecture to MS style.  :)

a big fan of password management, as a special case in the
category of "A failed data backup may cost more than a successful
break-in."  Lots of luck getting "normal" users to make and use
more than two weak passwords, though.
