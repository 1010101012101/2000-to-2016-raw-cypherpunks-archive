Probably wouldn't be you, the first time. Legal precedent would keep it
from happening again. See Friedman's Machinery of Freedom for details.

Sure. Why not? Again, see Friedman.

You don't need nations to have law.

like blind signatures point the way to this.

Write software, not laws. It's cheaper.
