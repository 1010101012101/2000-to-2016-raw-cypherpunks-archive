Someone sent me these:

microwave gun (1Kw directed HERF)

Appear to me they are more simple, using
just a cone for focusing.

Key components not shown in the linked article are a Q-switch, a pulse compression device most often used in lasers, that decreases pulse width and increases pulse amplitude (the explosive's detoniation isn't brief enough) and the microwave generator's design.

An advantage of the lightening method is the device is not destroyed (if you can safely retrieve it). Disadvantage, you must hide the device near a target (with high lightening activity) for extended periods.
