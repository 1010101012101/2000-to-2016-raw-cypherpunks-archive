AMERICAN VERSION

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his
house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's
a gool and laughs, dances, and plays the summer away. Come winter, the
ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter. So he
calls up his lawyer who drafts a bogus lawsuit. In the end, both the
lawyer and the grasshopper are feeding and the ant dies out in the cold.
