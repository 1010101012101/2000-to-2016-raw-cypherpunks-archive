   [1]Servo writes "Last month a man was arrested in New Hampshire after
   presenting evidence of a police officer being verbally abusive that
   [2]he had captured on his home security camera system. Now just
   recently in Philadelphia a 21 year old student was arrested on his
   property after he [3]took a photo of the police who were in the
   process of arresting a drug dealer down the street." From the article:
   "Cruz said that when he heard a commotion, he walked out of his back
   door with his cell phone to see what was happening. He said that when
   he saw the street lined with police cars, he decided to take a picture
   of the scene. 'I opened (the phone) and took a shot,' Cruz said.
   Moments later, Cruz said he got the shock of his life when an officer
   came to his back yard gate."
