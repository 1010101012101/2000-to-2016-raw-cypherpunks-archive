Yes, I'm looking at ideas like this for ecash gambling, but you have
a who-goes-first problem.  One side or the other has to "rip" their
own cash first, and then the other side can just go away and leave the
first side screwed.  The act of ripping cash is relatively atomic and
involves a transaction with the ecash mint, so they can't both do it at
the same time.

I guess the best fix is for each side to rip a little bit of cash at a
time, so that the guy who goes first only loses a trivial amount if the
other side aborts.  Then after a few rounds both sides are sunk pretty
deep and both have a strong incentive to complete the transaction.
