Actually under current law you're supposed to be paying tax on such
purchases (you ordering from PennsylvaniaBoks.com, in my example).
But almost nobody does pay taxes on their mail order purchases (that
lack nexus), so the states are peeved.

There are some bills in Congress that would give states the ability to
make these taxes mandatory. There's talk of multistate compacts and
all that, and tax simplificiation. Don't believe it, of course. I've
written about this; search Wired.com for taxes.
