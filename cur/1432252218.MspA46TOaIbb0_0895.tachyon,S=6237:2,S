TEST TUBE BABIES
----------------
TEST TUBE BABIES
BABY
MUTATION MACHINE
FEELS GOOD
HOME OF THE WHOPPER
BABY
FASTER FASTER
FEELS GOOD

OH I LOVE YOU
OH I LOVE YOU
OH I LOVE YOU
OH

RATS EAT GARBAGE
BABY
CHROMASOME CHANGE
FEELS GOOD

PLASMIC ERUPTION
BABY
EXPLODING MY BRAIN


PIG IS A PIG
------------
NOW THIS SONG IS DEDICATED
TO A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON
THE KIND OF PERSON THAT'S HIDING
UNDER ROCKS AND IN CLOSETS
WHEREVER YOU GO
HIDING
BEHIND A GUISE OF RESPECTABILITY
THE COWARDLY JOURNALIST
WHO HIDES BEHIND HIS TYPEWRITER
EXPLOITING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T FIGHT BACK
THE ASSASSIN
WHO STRIKES PEOPLE BY SURPRISE
THE SICKIE SADIST
WHO HIDES BEHIND HIS POLICE BADGE
TO COMMIT CRIMES OF VIOLENCE
AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE
WHATEVER ROLE THEY ARE PLAYING
THESE CREEPS
ARE ALWAYS THE SAME
BECAUSE
A PIG IS A PIG
AND THAT'S THAT

(ICHI NI SAN SHI)

YOUR STINKIN' LIES ARE SO LAME
YOUR STUPID IDEAS ARE THE SAME
A PIG IS A PIG
AND THAT'S THAT
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE

YOUR PHONEY POSE IS SO OLD
YOU'RE JUST A PRODUCT FROM THE MOLD
A PIG IS A PIG
AND THAT'S THAT
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
I CAN PREDICT WHAT YOU'LL DO
'CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS LIKE YOU
A PIG IS A PIG
AND THAT'S THAT
STUPID MEAN AND UGLY

DOWN IN THE DIRT WHERE YOU GO
LOWER THAN YOU YOU CAN'T GO
A PIG IS A PIG
AND THAT'S THAT
BIG BROTHER'S WATCHING YOU

YOU CAN DRESS UP IN DISGUISES
YOU CAN TRY TO MESMERIZE 'EM
YOU CAN SURROUND
 YOURSELF WITH FRIENDS
WHO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR
BUT IN THE END NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
YOU WILL COME SHINING THROUGH


12 NOON
-------
AS OF 12 NOON TOMORROW
SAY GOODBYE TO THE WORLD
AS YOU KNOW IT
SAY GOODBYE TO:

NEUTRON BOMBS
AND CHEMICAL FOOD
COWBOY POLITICS
MAN ON THE MOON
MURDER AND RAPE
AND CHEMICAL WASTE
POLLUTION AND DEATH
HOME OF THE BRAVE
RACISM TELEVISION
CORPORATE GOD
POLYURETHANE BREAKFAST
FORMICA LUNCH
INSIPID IDEAS
AND COMFORTING RULES
COLLAPSING CITIES
ARCHAIC SCHOOLS

SMALL MINDED PEOPLE
THEY KNOW IT ALL

BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING
THE KKK BALL
BHA
BHT
PROPYL GALLATE
MSG
DRIED CORN SYRUP
TBHO
DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE
WHOLESOME PRODUCTS FOR YOU
GUM ACACIA
HYDROGINATED OIL
POTATO STARCH
BRING TO THE BOIL


STOP
----
STOP WHILE YOU'VE STILL GOT
  THE TIME
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO
  YOURSELF
STOP WHILE YOU'VE STILL GOT
  THE TIME
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO
  YOURSELF
STOP WITH THE RAPE OF THE
  EARTH
YOU WERE NOT MADE FOR THIS
STOP WITH YOUR CAMPAIGN OF HATE
STOP BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
THE BELL TOLLS
THE BELL TOLLS
BRINGING THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
RINGING ITS WARNING
IT'S RINGING
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
WAKE-UP
WAKE-UP
WAKE-UP
WAKE-UP


JUST LIKE ON TV
---------------
BURNING FLAMES ON THE OCEAN
SOLDIERS MARCHING ON LOS
  ANGELES
GLACIERS COVER THE DESERT
MICRO-ORGANISMS IN THE BREEZE
GIANT APE-LIKE INVADERS
SWIM THE RIVER TO NEW YORK
MASSIVE GLOBAL ERUPTIONS
PANIC SPREADING IT WILL NOT STOP
HEY
AIN'T IT JUST LIKE ON TV
HEY
AIN'T IT WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE
HEY
NOW ALL YOUR DREAMS HAVE
  COME TRUE
HEY AND ALL YOUR NIGHTMARES TOO


THE DAMNED
----------
BLACK VISIONS FROM THE SATELLITE
  SKY
DEAF EARS HEAR NOT THEIR CRIES
FAT JACKALS HOWL AT THE MOON
FLIES BUZZING PLAYING DEATH'S
  TUNE
NIGHT ENDS BUT THE SUN IT
  DON'T RISE
TOMBS OPEN AND THE DEAD THEY
  WILL RISE
BLACK MARKET BUYS YOUR SOUL
  REAL CHEAP
NO ESCAPING WHAT YOU SOW YOU
  WILL REAP
PRISONERS OF THE DAMNED
FIND ANOTHER LAND
PLANET OF THE LOST
LAND OF FIRE AND FROST
PRISONERS OF THE DEAD
FEAR THE UNKNOWN DREAD
TIDAL WAVES AT SEA
SET THE SERPENTS FREE
COUP D'ETAT ON A GLOBAL SCALE
OPPOSITION LOCKED UP IN JAIL
DOMINATION THE GOONS ARE
  THE BOSS
HUMAN RACE NAILED TO A CROSS
