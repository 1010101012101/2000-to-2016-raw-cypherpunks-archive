First, is that what this spray is?  Any information on the chemical
composition?

Freon's pretty chemically inert.  That's among its advantages, though
it's a liability in the upper atmosphere.  Other options might be some
indicator that notes a rapid change in temperature (evaporating
refrigerant does a nice job of lowering temperature quickly), or
presence of a fluid.  Even a nonreactive chemical could float something
loosely applied to a letter.

Peace.
