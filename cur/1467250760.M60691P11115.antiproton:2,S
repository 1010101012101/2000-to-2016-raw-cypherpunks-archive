Ulbricht went down because associates fucked up, got busted, and
cooperated with investigators. Also, it seems that his OPSEC sucked.

It's not clear how Freedom Hosting got compromised. I don't believe that
it was a Tor exploit. And it was call-home malware that pwned users.
Which only affected idiots using Tor browser in Windows.

Agora owners never said exactly what flaws in Tor concerned them, as I
recall. And there are workarounds. Bigger problems, I think, are moving
large amounts of money anonymously, and explaining income.

I have no clue. But for some demographics, I bet that it's huge. Have

It's the best that's available, I believe.

It's not what I want, but it's what I'll accept.

Consider this thought experiment. Let's say that some cypherpunk, with
unimpeachable anarchist credentials, creates an anonymity system. One
that's not vulnerable to local adversaries or global adversaries. One,
perhaps, that uses covert channels, so ISPs can't even detect that it's
being used. Then they release the source, and fun begins.

So who would use it? I'm guessing that everyone who uses Tor, I2P, etc,
etc would use it. And so we'd be back to where we are now with Tor, with
just the exception that the new system isn't vulnerable to global
adversaries.

How would you keep statist criminals from using it?

There's still the criticism that Tor is intentionally vulnerable to
global adversaries. Maybe it was at first, by design. But it's an
open-source project. You'd need to argue that contributions which
increased resistance to global adversaries have been rejected or
discouraged. Is there evidence for that?

Both.

By providing freedom and privacy for state subjects.

Also, see the above thought experiment. It doesn't matter whose project
it is. The same people would end up using it.

Always :) Mostly caffeine, though. Modafinil too :)

It's not a zero-sum game.

As much as I sympathize for victims of criminal states, I believe that
anonymity systems are essential for protecting privacy and freedom. I
also believe that they may eventually reduce state power substantially.
Although that's seeming more and more like a dream.

Maybe not, but pedophiles are the goto example. Government criminals
fuck people at much larger scales, for sure. Maybe the crypter assholes
are a better example, but that's still small-scale.
