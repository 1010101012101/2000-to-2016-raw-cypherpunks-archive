A cheap shot, as James Donald has written more crypto code than most 
here, by a wide margin. Cf. his "Kong" program.

As for "list traffic," it has been very low by historical standards 
for the past year or so. Only a handful of names--perhaps a 
dozen--account for 80% or more of all posts. There are many possible 
reasons for this, but this is another subject.

The point being that most keyboards have a "Delete" key, but very few 
have a "Create" key: it is always much easier to delete unwanted 
traffic than to cause new traffic to be created.

"Cypherpunks write code" has a certain meaning, often misinterpreted 
by newbies and other careless types as a statement that words are not 
important, only C or Java code matters. In fact, it has meaning more 
along the lines of what Lessig was writing about in his "Code" book 
(regardless of what one thinks of his conclusions).

Many who have been posting here in the past year have apparently 
_missed_ the core ideas, hence their blathering about the need for 
privacy laws, about calls for collective action, about legitimate 
needs of law enforcement.

Which tells me we need words more than we need some chunk of C code.

(Not that 97% of the subscribers of this or any other similar list 
have ever written a single program with any conceivable crypto 
significance.)

As for Chomsky, I've been deleting all of the recent posts arguing 
pro- or con-Chomsky.
