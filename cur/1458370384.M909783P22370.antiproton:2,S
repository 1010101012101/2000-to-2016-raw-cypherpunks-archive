I doubt this.

m$ named their signing keys NSAKEY (look it up on wikipedia).

Have there been requests m$ to unlock phone/computer?

What if m$ gave to the NSA update signing certificate?

Heard rumors that the majority of m$ developers, developers!!! see
very small fraction of the source, so likely the potential backdoors are
kept very well.

As an aside, vaguely remember that someone leaked something of little
importance (likely screenshots or prerelease). They used _hotmail_ to send
the stuff to journos and as expected got caught.
