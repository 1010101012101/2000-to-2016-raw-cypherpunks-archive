As Declan says, and as many of us have said, there are _abundant_ 
reasons to try to stick to 7-bit ASCII on mailing lists and on Usenet. 
It's not surprising to me that it is Karsten M. Self, whom I had to 
killfile, is quoted above in this issue. He was always complaining that 
posts should be "formatted for legibility," via his nags and reposts, 
but then he has MIME encrustations on his posts.

As for the "degrees" issue, confusion about the symbol was one of the 
reasons the scientific community abandoned use of the symbol at least 30 
years ago. 212 F and 100 C are the accepted ways of reporting 
temperature...the degree symbol was redundant anyway and led to 
typesetting problems.
