  2008 [deadline: September 25]

 Dear Colleague,

 This is an advanced call for papers for the Financial
 Cryptography and Data Security Conference in Cozumel,
 Mexico, 28-31 January, 2008 (http://fc08.ifca.ai).

 Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major
 international forum for research, advanced development,
 education, exploration, and debate regarding information
 assurance in the context of finance and commerce. The
 conference covers all aspects of securing transactions
 and systems. Submissions focusing on both fundamental
 and applied real-world deployments are solicited.

 This year, for the first time, we are also accepting
 submissions for posters and short papers. The poster
 session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
 opinion, interesting established or preliminary work,
 or a cool idea that will spark discussion. Poster
 presenters will benefit from a multi-hour session to
 discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback
 from attendees. The intention behind short papers
 (peer-reviewed) is to encourage authors to introduce
 work in progress, novel applications and corporate or
 industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated
 with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking
 participants' interest and future research avenues.
