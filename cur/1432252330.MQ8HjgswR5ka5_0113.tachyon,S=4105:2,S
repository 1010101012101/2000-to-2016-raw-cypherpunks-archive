"The Western conceit that its culture is so superior that it
must impose it on others through missionary campaigns
now many centuries old, through economic policies, through 
eduation, through foreign policies, through military enforcement,
and through disparagement of other cultures, has bred a
deep seated anger toward the prime exporters, the idea
supremacists of state, church and family."

A pity to see terrorist propaganda taken up in this place where reality
should prevail.

Western culture stopped spreading by force before WWII, but it's still
in demand. Guess what - it IS superior! Not surprisingly, cultures based
on individual rights and the cultivation of reason are more effective
than those based on conformity and superstition. Sorry if you don't like
that, but it's true. And it is that ineluctable FACT that the fanatics
of 9/11 hate. They hate the fact that the people they want to control
like our culture better.

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

Rather than make war on the American people and their
liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
