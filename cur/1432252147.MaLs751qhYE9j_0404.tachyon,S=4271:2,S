>      displays a bare-backed woman and the headline "Quit Spying on People!
>      (we never told you to do that)." The technology uses radio frequencies
>      for communication among devices within a 100-foot radius, and
>      represents a development that one attorney says "is outstripping
>      everything we once contemplated about privacy." X10 devices have been
>      found planted secretly in such places as college shower rooms,
>      attorneys' offices, and corporate meeting rooms. (San Jose Mercury
