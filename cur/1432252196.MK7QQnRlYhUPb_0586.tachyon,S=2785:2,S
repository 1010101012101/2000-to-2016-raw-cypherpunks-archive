An odd aspect of the Stakeknife revelation is that the prime
candidate for outing Stakeknife, an undercover agent pseudonymed
"Kevin Fulton," has had his true name on Cryptome for several 
months on court claims made against HMG for compensation
for years of undercover spying and the death of his stillborn
daughter allegedly caused by a security raid:

"Kevin Fulton" is known to a number of British and Irish reporters
but none have published his true name, although the Scottish
Sunday Herald reported on Fulton's court claims without reporting
the true name of the claimant.

A British court banned publication of one of the claims which
name British intelligence officers and handlers of undercover
operatives:

On May 4 Fulton was reported in the Guardian to be threatening 
to reveal the identity of Stakeknife within a week if a broken deal 
for compensation with HMG was not made good. On May 11 the identity
was published -- not first by Cryptome as some newspapers have
said but by Scottish and Irish newspapers (Cryptome was alerted
and grabbed the stories the night of May 10).

Fulton has received several bullets indicating he will be killed for
revelations about what he learned during his undercover work,
has applied for a gun permit, and the police have refused to
grant the permit.

Fulton is one of a group of 12 former undercover agents who are
hounding HMG for protection and/or compensation, and are pissed
mightily that active agents are getting superior protection and
treatment. The former agents are being killed one by one while
HMG bides its time.

There is a slim chance that the former agents will do unto others
what is being done to them.
