Question - is it possible to have an open public discussion on the
issue of vaccinations and their level of safety or otherwise?

Apparently not, not even for a "public" figure such as American actor,
Robert De Niro.


Don your flameproof jackets...





TRIGGER WARNING: This article may contain implications such as "there
may be a link between modern vaccinations and autism" and "big pharma
has a lot of lobbying money and US congress has only publicly heard
one side".




It may sound macabre, but I'm waiting for the 5 day gestation period
contagious contaminated flu vaccine to hit - there's plenty of numbers
and computer crunching of human pupulation activation thresholds for a
would be Dr Save The World or his mini me.


Forearmed is forewarned. And may the rest cower in submission to the
"you're fucking up our herd mentality^B^B I mean herd immunity"
intimidation.

Robert De Niro and Autism – a Tragic Drama of Intimidation
Column: Society
Region: USA in the World

Robert De Niro is a magnificent actor, one who has won countless
awards in his profession over decades. Recently he involved himself in
a drama that is costing millions of tragic lives to be condemned to a
special world of autism. What has developed from that involvement is
tragic. Not alone because his own son is autistic
( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/health/vaccines-autism-robert-de-niro-tribeca-film-festival-andrew-wakefield-vaxxed.html?_r=0
).

On March 25 the New York Times printed an article with the title,
“Robert De Niro Defends Screening of Anti-Vaccine Film at Tribeca
Festival.” It was a decision deeply personal for De Niro and his wife.
De Niro, co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, defended the
festival’s controversial decision to screen an anti-vaccine
documentary, Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe. De Niro explained,
“Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical
that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly
discussed and examined. This is very personal to me and my family and
I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening
Vaxxed. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I
anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a
conversation around the issue

)
.”

Background

That was a clear statement and a courageous act. De Niro made the
decision not only to premier the Vaxxed film at his film festivan bust
also to introduce the Director, Andrew Wakefield and the film
personally. Before deciding, De Niro contacted US Congressman Bill
Posey, the same Congressman who has spoken directly and at length with
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Whistleblower William Thompson (
http://celebritories.com/2016/03/vaxxed-filmmakers-accuse-de-niro-tribeca-film-fest-of-censorship-in-wake-of-cancelation/
).

In 2014 Thompson told Posey and others that the CDC, where he had been
employed as a scientist, had documents that CDC officials deliberately
suppressed tests that indicated links between the common MMR
vaccine–Measles, Mumps and Rubella (whooping cough)– and child autism.
After a one hour discussion with Posey on what he had been told by
Thompson about the CDC autism coverup, De Niro made his personal
decision to present the Wakefield film (
http://celebritories.com/2016/03/vaxxed-filmmakers-accuse-de-niro-tribeca-film-fest-of-censorship-in-wake-of-cancelation/
). Forty eight hours and a firestorm of mainstream media attack on De
Niro’s decision led to his reversal of the screening.

In 2015 CDC whistleblower William Thompson, in an apparent act of
conscience, told US Congressman Posey that while a senior scientist at
CDC, he and his colleagues, after making a study of the link between
vaccines and incidence of autism in small black boys, “scheduled a
meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four
co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting
room, and reviewed and went through all the hardcopy documents that we
had thought we should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can.”
The…co-authors…brought a big garbage can into the meeting room… [and
put the documents]…into a huge garbage can. –CDC Senior Scientist Dr.
William Thompson (
http://journal-neo.org/2016/04/10/robert-de-niro-and-autism-a-tragic-drama-of-intimidation/%20https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/
).  A cowered US Congress declined to even hold hearings on Thompson’s
charges, charges that could have brought the global vaccine industry
down if held honestly. The pharmaceutical industry makes enormous
financial contributions to Congressional candidates in key committees.

Autism Epidemic and Rise in Vaccinations

Once De Niro announced he would premier the Vaxxed film at his film
festival, a savage firestorm of attacks erupted from US mainstream
media ranging from New York Times to forces to CNN. They all attacked
Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the Director of Vaxxed, a British citizen,
medical doctor and scientist who was literally crucified, stripped of
his medical license in Britain and attacked as a scientific fraud for
publishing a study in 1998 in the respected scientific journal,
Lancet, on possible links between MMR vaccinations and an alarming
rise in child autism. Only in 2010 after twelve years of relentless
pressure and attacks on Wakefield and claims of faulty methodology did
Lancet finally retract the article (
http://www.medicaldaily.com/history-autism-and-vaccines-how-one-man-unraveled-worlds-faith-vaccinations-294474
).

I have personally met and talked at length with Andrew Wakefield and
have respect for his refusal to be cowered by the pharmaceutical
vaccine cartel. I have also met numerous children in clinics and
rehabilitation centers who have been maimed, crippled or mentally
turned into vegetables from vaccinations. Their stories are hushed up
by the medical industry, a trillion dollar cartel that links countless
medical professionals, scientists, pharmaceutical makers, the CDC and
the WHO.

What none of the mainstream, politically correct, media dares to
report in the De Niro-Wakefield debate are the alarming facts of the
epidemic rise in autism in the USA over the past two decades. Autism
rates climbed nearly 30% between 2008 and 2010. Incidents of child
autism have more than doubled since 2000 according to a new study from
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition
affects one of every 68 children who are 8-year-olds. That’s up from
one in 88 just two years earlier. Thirty years ago autism in the USA
was virtually unheard of (
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/27/autism-rates-rise/6957815/
).

When it was first described in 1943 by Leo Kanner, it was believed to
occur at a rate of 4–5 per 10,000 children. Today, 1 in 68 (
http://www.momsagainstmercury.autismoava.org/archivos/Theoretical-Aspects-of-Autism-Causes-A-Review1.pdf
)!

The CDC claims not to know the cause. It is clearly not genetic change
because such changes take many generations to manifest. Therefore it
must be a significant change in the environment of the children.

In 2011, Dr. Helen Ratajczak, herself a former senior scientist in the
pharmaceutical industry published a groundbreaking article in the
Journal of Immunotoxicology entitled “Theoretical aspects of autism:
Causes–A review.” Ratajczak did what nobody else apparently has
bothered to do: she reviewed the body of published science since
autism was first described in 1943. Not just one theory suggested by
research such as the role of MMR shots, or the mercury preservative
thimerosal; but all of them.

Ratajczak’s article states, in part, that “Documented causes of autism
include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and
encephalitis [brain damage] following vaccination [emphasis added].
Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation
of the brain.”

The article goes on to discuss many potential vaccine-related
culprits, including the increasing number of vaccines given in a short
period of time. CBS award-winning journalist Sharyl Attkisson
interviewed Ratajczak on her findings. “What I have published is
highly concentrated on hypersensitivity, Ratajczak told Attkisson in
an interview, “the body’s immune system being thrown out of balance.”

No less a scientist than Dr. James R. Shannon, former Director,
National Institute of Health, stated, “The only safe vaccine is one
that is never used (
https://vactruth.com/2011/06/06/part-1-of-3-an-interview-about-vaccines-with-helen-v-ratajczak-phd/
).” Robert De Niro is a magnificent actor. He let go of an opportunity
to give mankind far more.
