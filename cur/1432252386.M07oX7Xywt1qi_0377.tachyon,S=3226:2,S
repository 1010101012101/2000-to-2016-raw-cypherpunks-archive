	Is used as cool looking, and just as impractical for anything 
other than infrastructure hits.

	A .300 Win Mag or .338 Laupa will do 1000 to 1500 yard hits 
just as well, in a smaller, cheaper, easier to handle package.

	Anything past 800 to 1000 yards is luck and voodoo anyway.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
