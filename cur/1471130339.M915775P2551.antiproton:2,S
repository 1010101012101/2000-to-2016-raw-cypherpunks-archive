Our highly educated, socially aware Liberals and Progressives are very
good at looking the other way when that means protecting their
comfortable middle class lifestyles.  They are unreachable because
there really is a monster under their beds, or locked in the back
closet of their deepest subconscious cellars:  It's OK to endorse and
support a political system that murders children in other countries
for commercial gain, if that's what it takes to assure the future
financial security of your own children.

If they could face that monster they could beat it, but they won't
face it and that's final.  If they hear it thrashing around, all they
have to do to drown it out is to complain politely through the proper
channels and declare, "We did all we could do.  Some problems won't be
solved in our lifetimes."

Sleep well, little monsters.
