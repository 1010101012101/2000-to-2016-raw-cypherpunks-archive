in '94 there was report (possibly sjmn?) that said at least half of all 
cal. univ. tech. PHDs were awarded to foreign born. during some of the tech 
green card discussions in the late '90s ... it was pointed out that the 
internet boom (bubble) was heavily dependent on all these foreign born .... 
since there was hardly enuf born in the usa to meet the demand.

in the late 90s there were some reports that many of these graduates had 
their education paid by their gov. with directions to enter an us company 
in strategic high tech areas for 4-8 years .... and then return home as 
tech transfer effort. i was told in the late 90s about one optical 
computing group in a high tech operation .... where all members of the 
group fell into this category (foreign born with obligation to return home 
after some period).

another complicating factor competing for resources during the late 90s 
high-tech, internet boom (bubble?) period was the significant resource 
requirement for y2k remediation efforts.

nsf had recent study on part of this

graduate enrollment in science and engineering fields reaches new peak; 1st 
time enrollment of foreign students drops
