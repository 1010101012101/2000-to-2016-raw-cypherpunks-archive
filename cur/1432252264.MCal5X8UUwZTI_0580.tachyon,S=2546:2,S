Right.

Like Ellison (and Metzger :-)) have said for years now, the only
"assertions" worth making are financial ones. "Identity", biometric/meat,
or otherwise, is only a proxy for asset protection anyway.

I claim you can do this on the net without the current mystification of
identity that exists in the financial system, using bearer asset
cryptography, among other things, but that's another discussion altogether.

Cheers,
