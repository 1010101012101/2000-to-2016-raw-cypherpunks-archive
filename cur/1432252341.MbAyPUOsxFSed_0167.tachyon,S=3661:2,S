SSZ's being an open relay doesn't have anything to do with people sending
virii through it.  All CDRs, except the one at lne.com, accept and re-post
mail from anyone, on the cypherpunks list or not.   That's not an open
relay, which is a mailer that allows third-party mail- i.e. joe spammer @
aol sends mail to ssz which then forwards it to the spammer's targets.

That said, even if all the CDRs only accepted posts from subscribers
("closed" list), the list would be subject to virii-- Exchange seems to
be the email virus writer's target of choice (opportunity?) these days,
and too many people use Exchange, probably because their corporate IT
depts force them to.

What makes you think that the virus was specifically an attack on the CDR?
