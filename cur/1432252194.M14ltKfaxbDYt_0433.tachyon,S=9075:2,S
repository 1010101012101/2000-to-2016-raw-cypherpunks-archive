Enlighten us then...

Socialism, the management of all property and activity through a central
authority, also called a 'command economy' because everything is done
through the control and command of a central authority.

Fascism, is the management of private property for the goals and policies
of the state. Ownership of that 'private' property is contingent upon
compliance and performance. The term itself comes from the Italian name
for a Roman weapon which consisted of a group of reeds banded together
with a axe head embedded. The point to the symbolism is that together we
are stronger than apart (refering to the strength of individual reeds
compared to when bundled).

The distinction is simply at what point they step in and take away 'your'
property.

Actually, other than the issue private ownership they are nearly identical
in philosophy and goals.

No they don't. They ostensibly want to create a workable utopic society
where everyone gets what they need.

The question they are trying to answer (the question that ALL political,
socialogical, and religious theory try to answer) is 'who gets to make the
decision' and 'what is the range of acceptable decisions'.

Not if used in the context I used them in. That they both end up taking
the decision making point away from the individual and move it toward a
central authority. In that sense the results of the two, though their
process may differ, is to create a system where a few benefit from the
many.

A dictatorship simply means that a single individual is in charge and has
ultimate authority. The resultant system can have a variety of other
paramters. It is not nearly as defining a term as 'socialism' or
'fascism'. The same goes for feudal/aristocratic (which by the way aren't
related in the way this pairing would indicate). And neither do these need
to be totalitarian. It is quite feasible for dictatorships (say Ceasar in
Rome and the relation with Jews/Christians) to harbor a variety of
philosophies and political systems.

Open markets don't settle conflicts, they barter goods. This takes us
right back to the question I was asking about a few weeks ago (Hayek was
asking it of you as well). How does one reach the economic equilibrium
which free market economies require? It is clear that they wil not
spontaneously form, despite your claims here to the contrary.

If a bullfrog had wings it wouldn't bust its butt when it jumped.

You suppose? So even you're not sure if it will work or not? Is that
correct?

Why would an anarchist accept 3rd party arbitration? How is this any
different than 'government'? If the arbitration doesn't conform to some
sort of principle and standards then it's arbitrary and nobody with half a
click of a clue will agree to arbitration with no principles or standards
available. Anarchy was meant to prevent just this sort of situation.

And what happens if one or more of the parties, excluding the arbiter,
decide that neither want to comply? How does the arbiter enforce it?

'property deed'? There is no government or law, there is no deed.

You weren't paying attention the other day during the Goldback and fractal
discussions, you can't create complete descriptions.

And why would I do that? Where did this standard come from in an anarchy?
Where is the 'law' that decides that initial 'volumetric' estimate? Why
should either party comply with such a description?

Or I can tell the fat slob to trim his own roof and leave me alone. Then
when he comes over later I shoot him and get both his house and mine now.

There is no government, it's an anarchy remember.

Blipverts strike again.
