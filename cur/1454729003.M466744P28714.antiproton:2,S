this assumes you're keeping it under constant supervision, of course :P

one of my favorite tricks, but rather rude in spectrum,
 is setting high power amplifier to maximum. DF tends to see this
signal arriving from all around...  *grin*

this introduces it's own trade-offs, of course.

free space optics rides again!!  :P

right, UWB is the solution here with privacy and authenticity at the
physical layer (not above MAC, or other deferred placement in stack)

if you're building LPI, you don't give a fuck about the FCC (compliance).
 by definition, if they've found you, you fucked up!

it is now possible for a professional's budget to accodomate the SDR
equipment necessary to do this type of phase sync'ed active beam
forming MIMO transmission, and not all methods require the training
phase. in fact, omission of this (by out of band training, in a sense)
in a method of "keying" phased delivery of UWB MIMO in a way more
likely to achieve LPI.

synthetic aperature millimeter wave vision systems are also pushing
along this boundary, for cross-pollination of suitable phased sync'ed
UWB MIMO signal processing.

i could go on, if you're curious, but perhaps on another list? :)
