ITALY Public Announcement
July 3, 2001

>From July 20 to July 22, the city of Genoa in northwestern Italy will host
the G-8 Summit, a meeting among heads of state and government from eight
nations including the United States.  There will be thousands of government
officials, press representatives, and security personnel in Genoa.

In addition, it is estimated that from fifty to eighty thousand or more
demonstrators will be present before and during the Summit meeting period.
As at past international meetings it is likely that some of the
demonstrators will become disorderly or violent.  If that occurs, clashes
could result in injuries and/or arrests.

Italian officials are working to minimize the potential for disruption.
Access to many areas of the city, including well-known tourist sites, will
be closed to the general public.  Travelers to and through Genoa are likely
to experience delays, detours, and limitations on their movement due to
traffic and other restrictions.  Travelers scheduled to arrive in or depart
from Genoa via train, ferry, cruise ship, or plane during the Summit period
should confirm with their companies whether there have been changes in their
travel arrangements or instructions regarding travel to or from their points
of arrival or departure.

U.S. citizens, other than those with official Summit-related duties, should
avoid travel to Genoa during the Summit period.  Those who must travel to
Genoa, should exercise caution, avoid any crowds or demonstrations, and
monitor the local media to keep informed.

The U.S. Embassy in Rome is located at Via Veneto 119A, telephone (24 hours)
(39) 06-46741, fax (39) 06-4674-2217.

The U.S. Consulate General in Milan is located at Via Principe Amadeo 2/10,
telephone (39) 02-290351, fax (39) 02-2900-1165, and after-hours telephone
(39) 02-2903-5928.

For further information regarding travel to Italy, please consult the
Department of State's latest Consular Information Sheet, which is available
on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov.

This Public Announcement expires on July 26, 2001.
