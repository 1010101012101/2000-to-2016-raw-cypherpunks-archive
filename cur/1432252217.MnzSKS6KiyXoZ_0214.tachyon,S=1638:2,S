So the market for faraday-cages for your passport will grow to
equilibrium.  A cage will cost less than a buck in parts, easily
affordable by the clueful.  The damage to the clueless will
quickly be the best advertising for the product.  Since we
have been wearing conductive mesh burkhas for some time,
the only inconvenience will be for the terahertz voyeurs
employed by the TSA.
