Hops and C.s. are closely related, and grafting ain't genetic surgery.  
Catnip is also related, which explains certain feline behaviors.  (Just

What are you, a toadpunk?  goddamn tryptamine freaks.  Keep your

The sequence for smallpox is in the public domain, btw.  The 
endogenous endorphin peptides previously mentioned would be the
smallest concern, if synthesizers became common.  Libyans taking
molebio courses watch out.  Hey Joe, where you goin' with that
sequence in yo' hand?
