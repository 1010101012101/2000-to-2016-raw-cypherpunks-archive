BLACK HAT BRIEFINGS 2001 SESSIONS HIGHLIGHT NEW COMPUTER SECURITY TOOLS,
TECHNOLOGIES AND TACTICS

Top Industry Gurus will Talk About Key Problem and Offer Solutions to
Todays Security Issues

http://www.blackhat.com/ -- Black Hat Inc. announced today over 40
different speaker sessions for this summer's Black Hat Briefings and
Training 2001, the annual conference and workshop designed to help computer
professionals better understand the security risks to their computer and
information infrastructures by potential threats. This year's show will
focus on hot topics including Honey Pot servers, secure programming
techniques, incident response, Web-based vulnerabilities and Distributed
Denial of Service attacks at the Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino in the
heart of Las Vegas, 11 through 12 July, 2001.

Top-notch speakers will deliver to the conference's core audience of IT &
network security experts, consultants and administrators the newest
developments on the vital security issues facing organizations using large
networks with a mix of operating systems.

"Our goal is to present a vendor-neutral environment where conference
attendees can receive key intelligence in a face-to-face environment with
the people developing the tools used by and against hackers," says Jeff
Moss, founder of Black Hat Inc. "Our speakers discuss the strategies
involved in correcting existing problems and inform attendees on upcoming
issues, preparing them for the future."

The lineup of Black Hat Briefings presenters for 2001 include:

          -- James Bamford, author of NSA books "The Puzzle Palace" & "Body
of Secrets", will discuss some of his key research tactics that lead to his
exposes about the most secret government agency in the United States.

          -- Richard Clarke is the senior U.S. government official
responsible for cyber security policy. He was appointed by the President as
the first national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and
counter-terrorism. He chairs the U.S. government's committees on cyber
security, continuity of operations, counter-terrorism, domestic
preparedness and international crime.

         -- Steve Christey, Lead INFOSEC Engineer in the Security and
Information Operations Division at The MITRE Corporation will discuss the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) concept (naming standard for
computer security vulnerabilities that hackers exploit to break into
systems) and the challenges that MITRE faced trying to meet the criteria
created for the concept.

         -- Martin Roesch, founder of Sourcefire Inc and author of the open
source "Snort" Network Intrusion Detection System will talk about the new
features in version 1.8 of the system (including features to improve it's
enterprise scalability, resistance to anti-NIDS attacks, and integration
with other security products and protocols) as well as the architecture and
evolution of the next-generation Snort 2.0 system, is currently in the
planning stages.

         -- Lance Spitzner, founder of the Honey Net Project and the
group's 25 members will present the resulting research from their endeavors
and discuss the goals of the project, how they accomplished their research
and what they have discovered.

         -- Jose Nazario, a Biochemistry Ph.D. student from Cleveland, Ohio
will discuss the future of Internet worm viruses and how the current crop
(Ramen, Melissa, ILoveYou) are just the tip of the iceberg. Nazario applies
the morphing approaches of biological systems with computing, and shows how
new threats and adaptive defense strategies emerge.

         -- Dr. Ian Goldberg from Zero Knowledge Systems (known for
cracking the first RSA Secret Key Challenge in three and a half hours,
breaking Netscape's implementation of SSL encryption, and breaking the
cryptography in the GSM cellular phone standard) will be discussing the
"highly flawed" Wired Equivalent Privacy in the 802.11 wireless network
standard.

         -- Brian Martin, founder and staff member of Attrition.org will
cover the lessons learned and insight gained from monitoring the world of
Web site defacements including reactions from the defacers themselves,
system administrators, law enforcement and journalists as well as
identification and analysis of several trends and statistics.

Cryptography expert Bruce Schneier and Technology Futurist Richard Thieme
will be giving this year's lunchtime presentations.

Black Hat Inc. will also conduct computer security training for several
different topics the two days prior to the briefings - 9 through 10 July.

Subjects include:

         -- NT Network Intrusion Workshop
         -- Complete Windows 2000 Security
         -- Advanced Scanning with ICMP
         -- Reverse Engineering and Security Auditing with IDA

The instructors for the training segment of this year's Black Hat are some
of the top experts in their field and are fully active in the computer
security community. You won't find most of these speakers anywhere else and
these handpicked security gurus will train participants in understanding
the real threats to any network and how to keep them from being exploited.
