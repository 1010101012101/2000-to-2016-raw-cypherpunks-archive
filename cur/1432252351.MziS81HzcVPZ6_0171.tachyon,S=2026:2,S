You can't protect people from cowardice.  Jim Bell plead the first time.
Michael Milkin plead.  Bill Gates plead.  Various Arabs plead recently.
If you plead you can't be acquitted unless you can convince a judge to let
you withdraw your plea tough.  Courage.

Prosecutors and cops are allowed to lie to you about their intent.  Know
the law.
