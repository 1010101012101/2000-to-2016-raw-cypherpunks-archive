You're absolutely right, no law could stop you from being a re-commenter.
However, you would be liable for everything you said.  This would mean
that you pay the penalty for any illegal message, any obscenity, any
violation of copyright.

In short being a re-commenter buys you absolutely nothing.  Any message
so innocuous that it could be delivered by a re-commenter (like this one,
for example) does not really need anonymity.
