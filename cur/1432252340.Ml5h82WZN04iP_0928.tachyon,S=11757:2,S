  Terrorist 007, Exposed

  By Rita Katz and Michael Kern
  Sunday, March 26, 2006; B01

  For almost two years, intelligence services around the world tried to
  uncover the identity of an Internet hacker who had become a key conduit for
  al-Qaeda. The savvy, English-speaking, presumably young webmaster taunted
  his pursuers, calling himself Irhabi -- Terrorist -- 007. He hacked into
  American university computers, propagandized for the Iraq insurgents led by
  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and taught other online jihadists how to wield their
  computers for the cause.

  Suddenly last fall, Irhabi 007 disappeared from the message boards. The
  postings ended after Scotland Yard arrested a 22-year-old West Londoner,
  Younis Tsouli, suspected of participating in an alleged bomb plot. In
  November, British authorities brought a range of charges against him
  related to that plot. Only later, according to our sources familiar with
  the British probe, was Tsouli's other suspected identity revealed. British
  investigators eventually confirmed to us that they believe he is Irhabi 007.

  The unwitting end of the hunt comes at a time when al-Qaeda sympathizers
  like Irhabi 007 are making explosive new use of the Internet. Countless Web
  sites and password-protected forums -- most of which have sprung up in the
  last several years -- now cater to would-be jihadists like Irhabi 007. The
  terrorists who congregate in those cybercommunities are rapidly becoming
  skilled in hacking, programming, executing online attacks and mastering
  digital and media design -- and Irhabi was a master of all those arts.

  But the manner of his arrest demonstrates how challenging it is to combat
  such online activities and to prevent others from following Irhabi's
  example: After pursuing an investigation into a European terrorism suspect,
  British investigators raided Tsouli's house, where they found stolen credit
  card information, according to an American source familiar with the probe.
  Looking further, they found that the cards were used to pay American
  Internet providers on whose servers he had posted jihadi propaganda. Only
  then did investigators come to believe that they had netted the infamous
  hacker. And that element of luck is a problem. The Internet has presented
  investigators with an extraordinary challenge. But our future security is
  going to depend increasingly on identifying and catching the shadowy
  figures who exist primarily in the elusive online world.

  The short career of Irhabi 007 offers a case study in the evolving nature
  of the threat that we at the SITE Institute track every day by monitoring
  and then joining the password-protected forums and communicating with the
  online jihadi community. Celebrated for his computer expertise, Irhabi 007
  had propelled the jihadists into a 21st-century offensive through his
  ability to covertly and securely disseminate manuals of weaponry, videos of
  insurgent feats such as beheadings and other inflammatory material. It is
  by analyzing the trail of information left by such postings that we are
  able to distinguish the patterns of communication used by individual
  terrorists.

  Irhabi's success stemmed from a combination of skill and timing. In early
  2004, he joined the password-protected message forum known as Muntada
  al-Ansar al-Islami (Islam Supporters Forum) and, soon after, al-Ekhlas
  (Sincerity) -- two of the password-protected forums with thousands of
  members that al-Qaeda had been using for military instructions, propaganda
  and recruitment. (These two forums have since been taken down.) This was
  around the time that Zarqawi began using the Internet as his primary means
  of disseminating propaganda for his insurgency in Iraq. Zarqawi needed
  computer-savvy associates, and Irhabi proved to be a standout among the
  volunteers, many of whom were based in Europe.

  Irhabi's central role became apparent to outsiders in April of that year,
  when Zarqawi's group, later renamed al-Qaeda in Iraq, began releasing its
  communiquis through its official spokesman, Abu Maysara al-Iraqi, on the
  Ansar forum. In his first posting, al-Iraqi wrote in Arabic about "the good
  news" that "a group of proud and brave men" intended to "strike the
  economic interests of the countries of blasphemy and atheism, that came to
  raise the banner of the Cross in the country of the Muslims."

  At the time, some doubted that posting's authenticity, but Irhabi, who was
  the first to post a response, offered words of support. Before long,
  al-Iraqi answered in like fashion, establishing their relationship -- and
  Irhabi's central role.

  Over the following year and a half, Irhabi established himself as the top
  jihadi expert on all things Internet-related. He became a very active
  member of many jihadi forums in Arabic and English. He worked on both
  defeating and enhancing online security, linking to multimedia and
  providing online seminars on the use of the Internet. He seemed to be
  online night and day, ready to answer questions about how to post a video,
  for example -- and often willing to take over and do the posting himself.
  Irhabi focused on hacking into Web sites as well as educating Internet
  surfers in the secrets to anonymous browsing.

  In one instance, Irhabi posted a 20-page message titled "Seminar on Hacking
  Websites," to the Ekhlas forum. It provided detailed information on the art
  of hacking, listing dozens of vulnerable Web sites to which one could
  upload shared media. Irhabi used this strategy himself, uploading data to a
  Web site run by the state of Arkansas, and then to another run by George
  Washington University. This stunt led many experts to believe --
  erroneously -- that Irhabi was based in the United States.

  Irhabi used countless other Web sites as free hosts for material that the
  jihadists needed to upload and share. In addition to these sites, Irhabi
  provided techniques for discovering server vulnerabilities, in the event
  that his suggested sites became secure. In this way, jihadists could use
  third-party hosts to disseminate propaganda so that they did not have to
  risk using their own web space and, more importantly, their own money.

  As he provided seemingly limitless space captured from vulnerable servers
  throughout the Internet, Irhabi was celebrated by his online followers. A
  mark of that appreciation was the following memorandum of praise offered by
  a member of Ansar in August 2004:

  "To Our Brother Irhabi 007. Our brother Irhabi 007, you have shown very
  good efforts in serving this message board, as I can see, and in serving
  jihad for the sake of God. By God, we do not like to hear what hurts you,
  so we ask God to keep you in his care.

  You are one of the top people who care about serving your brothers. May God
  add all of that on the side of your good work, and may you go careful and
  successful.

  We say carry on with God's blessing.

  Carry on, may God protect you.

  Carry on serving jihad and its supporters.

  And I ask the mighty, gracious and merciful God to keep for us everyone who
  wants to support his faith.

  Amen."

  Irhabi's hacking ability was useful not only in the exchange of media, but
  also in the distribution of large-scale al-Qaeda productions. In one
  instance, a film produced by Zarqawi's al-Qaeda, titled "All Is for Allah's
  Religion," was distributed from a page at www.alaflam.net/wdkl .

  The links, uploaded in June 2005, provided numerous outlets where visitors
  could find the video. In the event that one of the sites was disabled, many
  other sources were available as backups. Several were based on domains such
  as www.irhabi007.ca or www.irhabi007.tv , indicating a strong involvement
  by Irhabi himself. The film, a major release by al-Qaeda in Iraq, showed
  many of the insurgents' recent exploits compiled with footage of Osama bin
  Laden, commentary on the Abu Ghraib prison, and political statements about
  the rule of then-Iraqi Interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi.

  Tsouli has been charged with eight offenses including conspiracy to murder,
  conspiracy to cause an explosion, conspiracy to cause a public nuisance,
  conspiracy to obtain money by deception and offences relating to the
  possession of articles for terrorist purposes and fundraising. So far there
  are no charges directly related to his alleged activities as Irhabi on the
  Internet, but given the charges already mounted against him, it will
  probably be a long time before the 22-year-old is able to go online again.

  But Irhabi's absence from the Internet may not be as noticeable as many
  hope. Indeed, the hacker had anticipated his own disappearance. In the
  months beforehand, Irhabi released his will on the Internet. In it, he
  provided links to help visitors with their own Internet security and
  hacking skills in the event of his absence -- a rubric for jihadists
  seeking the means to continue to serve their nefarious ends. Irhabi may
  have been caught, but his online legacy may be the creation of many
  thousands of 007s.
