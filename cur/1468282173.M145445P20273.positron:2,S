Sound like rather compelling questions to me.
But I'm not a physicist, and I never worked for Nike or a boot maker, so
I couldn't begin to say how ripple soles got left behind on the Moon.

Bah humbug ... prolly someone conspired to think of a theory.

Subject: Neil Armstrong's Boots

No one has answered my simple question, instead of providing an answer they
want to call me names and say I am a conspirator--I am not, I am just
asking a fair question.

When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface he left a deep footprint
in the dust showing a *ripple soled imprint, *the photo was shown all
around the world. The landing module was about 3 meters in diameter and the
thrust rocket central: from “NASA Launch Vehicle/Spacecraft Key Facts
<http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-13_Launch_Vehicle-Spacecraft_Key_Facts.htm>,
LM descent stage maximum rated thrust = 9,870 lbf (43,904 N)”.  This
massive thrust would have blown the dust away from the landing area
creating a massive dust cloud, so why was thick dust still on the ground
and no massive dust cloud? Please explain NASA.

In July, 46 years to the day after the first moon walk, the *Smithsonian's
National Air and Space Museum* in Washington, D.C., started its first
Kickstarter campaign, asking for money to preserve the spacesuit Neil
Armstrong wore when he stepped off Apollo 11 onto the moon in 1969. Oct 15,

NASA verified this was the actual space suit worn by Neil Armstrong,
interesting to see the boots have no ripple sole. Please explain NASA.  My
father often said “Do not ask difficult questions you upset folk and get
called names”.


Oh Dear!
Cheers
