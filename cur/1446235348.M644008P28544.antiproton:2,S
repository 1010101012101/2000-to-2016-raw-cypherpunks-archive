I don't agree.  The only reason human beings require society to survive is
that all the other human beings are also using up resources, so if we did
not coordinate our use of resources (via the market) we would exhaust them
and perish.

As an anarchist I disagree with this characterization.

No. Society is an emergent phenomenon whether or not you want it to be. It
does not pre-exist individual interactions with one another. A thousand
people who never meet and whose actions never affect the others do not form
a society. It is not until they get together and interact that you have a
society.

This is an anti-human, anti-life sentiment. If you'd prefer we leave the
universe as dead rock, please feel free to kill yourself and leave it to
those of us who believe in life.

Even if there are aliens, the galaxy is almost certainly unimaginably
sparsely populated. Even on Earth, I can think of no tale of a human being
ever having been hit by a meteor, much less a piece of falling space debris.

I'm certainly happy to leave the planet to you when I go. I'm guessing your
descendants will still be here when the sun renders it uninhabitable. Or
maybe they will have wiped out the planet in a war over ideology, because
they believe in a fictitious "collective."

Go look up the definition of the word "practically." I'll wait.
