You are flattering yourself. This list is not all that interesting.
Even less so, since the usual suspects have moved on (to bigger and
better things, I hope).

But picking off things off ssh sessions based on a typing timing
model is something quite easy, so I wouldn't be surprised if
it happens on a large scale.

Btw, in an unrelated vein there are distinct trends in
capabilities in Riddle Palace/Body of Secrets, which can
be extrapolated to today.
