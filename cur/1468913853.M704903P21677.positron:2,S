I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)

Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.

Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?

Maybe key funders have said no to that.

Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.

But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.

Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.

I doubt that they hire anons :(

But damn, I'd do it for free, if they let me :)
