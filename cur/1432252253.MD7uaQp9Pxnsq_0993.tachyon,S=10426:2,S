'Electromagnon' effect couples electricity and magnetism in materials
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-electromagnon-effect-couples-electricity-magnetism.html

"It has been well known for a long time that electricity and magnetism
are two sides of the same coin. Waves in free space, such as visible
light or mobile phone radiation, always consist of both an electric
and a magnetic component. When it comes to material properties,
however, electricity and magnetism have been viewed as separate
topics."

note: enormous problems with this. mathematics as if short-fiction.
what if concept/cosmology is being influenced by language framework
(q: is truth bounded or infinite).  hierarchical nesting core of set theory,
numberline in this context, why assumed 1d/2d versus N-dimensional.
issues of bounded infinity everywhere (particle ladder, consciousness),
perhaps zero is issue (empty set?) -- metaphysics seem completely off,
being and nothingess as set relations not grounded in reality it seems.
(note: why three zeroes allowed to diagram infinity as a first question,
what if number line is hiearchical, zero different dimension than 1...N)

[quote]  4 Great Tech Ideas That Flopped // via digg
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pogue-4-great-tech-ideas-that-flopped

"The plug-and-play gadget: A spinoff of the PalmPilot called The
Handspring Visor held much of the same attraction as the PhoneBloks.
It was a handheld organizer with a big cartridge slot on the back.
Into it you could snap a range of accessories: more storage, a
GPS receiver, a camera, a cellular transmitter, a remote control,
a Bluetooth module, an MP3 module or a voice recorder.

The Visors were on the market for about four years (1999 to 2003) and
have fans to this day. But clearly, the concept of interchangeable
gadget parts alone isn’t enough to start a revolution."

(note: the above article mentions something repeatedly endlessly about
PDA development, that it no longer exists, especially in the context
of the Handspring which preceded and was probably a trial for the
modularity of the iPhone and iPod Touch (a PDA or networked digital
assistant). the Handspring was certainly limited unlike the Apple
ecosystem approach which could expand exponentially and had wide
software integration, and thus the concept lives on in another product
line and its development yet is consistently not attributed this way.)

Researchers discover roots of superfluorescent bursts from quantum wells
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-roots-superfluorescent-quantum-wells.html

[quote] ...mysteries remained, especially in results obtained at low
or zero magnetic fields. Kono said the team didn't understand at the
time why the wavelength of the burst changed over its 100-picosecond
span. Now they do.  //...

Kono said superfluorescence is a well-known many-body, or cooperative,
phenomenon in atomic physics. Many-body theory gives physicists a way
to understand how large numbers of interacting particles like
molecules, atoms and electrons behave collectively. Superfluorescence
is one example of how atoms under tight controls collaborate when
triggered by an external source of energy. //...

"The quantum well, as before, consisted of stacked blocks of an indium
gallium arsenide compound separated by barriers of gallium arsenide.
"It's a unique, solid-state environment where many-body effects
completely dominate the dynamics of the system," Kono said.

"When a strong magnetic field is applied, electrons and holes are
fully quantized – that is, constrained in their range of motion—just
like electrons in atoms," he said. "So the essential physics in the
presence of a high magnetic field is quite similar to that in atomic
gases. But as we decrease and eventually eliminate the magnetic field,
we're entering a regime atomic physics cannot access, where continua
of electronic states, or bands, exist." [unquote]
