Dear Quinton,

Why waste your hard-earned money on an expensive watch when you can have the next best thing for a tenth of its price?

The watch of your dreams doesn't have to be an overpriced piece of machinery. Nowadays you can get the same functionality and distinctive looks from the next best thing. Vi it Cartier Store and choose from hundreds of gorgeous models at less than ten percent the price of an original.

Sincerely,
Mr Woodruff
