Jim's been pinged on this many, many times. He used to include
tens of kilobytes of HTML pages with his postings, but at least he's 
gotten over that.

I've come to the conclusion that Jim is unable to see things
from another's viewpoint, and so regards it a bad trade to spend
30 seconds of his own time to save man-hours of wasted effort
by his readers.

The result, of course, is that he becomes progressively less effective
at communication, as more and more people tune him out due to
the low value of his postings.

Adam: Jim regards unsolicited private email as a personal affront,
and gets crabby about it.
