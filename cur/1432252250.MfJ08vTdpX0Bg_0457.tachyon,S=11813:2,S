	Look! Here's a cute family picture 
	https://cerebrovortex.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/stalin-roosevelt-churchill-1943-image-8.jpg



	So, what the commies did in WWII was part of the dirty work of
	the anglo-american fascists. 


	a) the anglo american nazis needed the commies to stop the
	german nazis

	b) both commies and anglo-american fascists needed each other
	and both were willing to 'collaborate' with their 'evil'
	'enemies' (communists and 'capitalists' respectively)

	
	A lot of russians got killed thanks to their own government of
	course. And so helped 'save' 'capitalism', that is to say,
	helped the anglo-american fascists.


	And now the anglo-american fascists don't want to be remined of
	their past association with the evil commies. Go figure.
