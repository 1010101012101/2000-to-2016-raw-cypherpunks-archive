Firefox / Mozilla has a prefetching feature
that you can turn on and off,
which can occasionally speed up your next click by prefetching,
so the page(s) you're most likely to read next are
loading in the background while you're reading the page you're on.
What Google's doing is including information in their results pages
that Firefox recognizes as the page to pre-fetch next.
This means that if Google's highest-ranked page is what you want,
then you can get to it faster.

Prefetching can make web browsing dramatically faster or slower.
I tend to read online news by loading lots of tabs in the background,
e.g. the interesting articles from Google New or NYTimes.com.
That tends to be somewhat slow already, because Mozilla is a real
memory hog, and prefetching would just make it worse.
On the other hand, if it loads the *right* pages, it's really nice.
