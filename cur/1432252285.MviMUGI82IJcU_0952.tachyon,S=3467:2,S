Yep. So why not do a little something about it? I've been donating books
to a local women's prison for awhile: Ayn Rand, history books, old textbooks,
etc. can go a long, long way. Go to the local library sale and load up on the
fifty cent hardbacks, ten cent classic paperbacks--such a small investment
when you think of the good that might come of it. Magazine subscriptions are
probably worth looking into, too. I was meaning to do that myself, thanks
for the reminder. 

Of course "what you REALLY need" is in the eye of the beholder, but 
if more literate, concerned people at least made an effort to get what
THEY would want to read into the prisons,it could only be a good thing.

I'll never know if I made a difference, but it's the idea that counts.
