Hi everyone,

I want to announce to the list that new rleases of tor-ramdisk are out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686 and MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux distribution
whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that
maximizes security and privacy.  Security is enhenced by hardening the
kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be
off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to
minimal information.  Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral
memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP.

Changelog:

These releases update tor to 0.2.1.20 and busybox to 1.15.2 on both
architectures.  Users are encouraged to upgrade since these updates
address issues which may effect the memroy-restricted ramdisk environment.

Nodes "simba" and "mufasa" have been running the i686 and MIPS versions
for about one week in the wild.
