Virtual entrepreneurs and 'griefers' spoil the fantasy of online worlds
http://technology.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg19526196.000&print=true

IT SHOULD have been a coming-of-age moment. In December 2006, Anshe
Chung, the most prominent of Second Life's entrepreneurs, was
interviewed about her burgeoning [12]property portfolio, which she
says is worth more than $1 million. It was a milestone to mark the
emergence of a mature and corporate side to virtual worlds. But
then, for a full 15 minutes, the virtual room in which she was
being interviewed was invaded by [13]flying penises.

Two months later, something similar happened. The Second Life
headquarters of US presidential candidate John Edwards was attacked
by a gang known as the Patriotic Nigras, who [14]plastered the
building with objects including faeces (see Picture). Other
residents say they have received racist materials from the Nigras.

To anyone familiar with Second Life, airborne genitalia and
offensive comments come as no surprise. Griefers - the disruptive
residents who create such disturbances - have been active since the
virtual world's earliest days. Since many residents are attracted
to Second Life precisely because of its anything-goes ethos, such
behaviour is generally tolerated.

Now that Wild West spirit is under threat. With tens of thousands
of denizens logged in at any one time and [15]millions of dollars'
worth of transactions taking place in a single year (see Chart), a
class of entrepreneurs is emerging who see griefers not just as an
annoyance but as a potential source of lost revenue. That can
simply encourage the griefers, some of whom are irritated by
residents who seem to take life in Second Life too seriously, but
it also prompts entrepreneurs to turn to [16]real-world courts to
settle disputes. That in turn is cause for concern for residents
who believe virtual worlds' value lies in their freedom from
real-world laws and norms.

"As the worlds industrialise we're going to see more appeals to the
law," says Ren Reynolds, an expert on virtual worlds based in
London who is establishing [17]a think tank to explore their policy
implications. "The worry is that legislators will say that virtual
worlds should be like the real world." That might wreck the main
reason for using virtual worlds, which, despite rampant
commercialisation, many still view as fantasy spaces.

Last week New Scientist reported how virtual worlds can enhance
social interactions, by facilitating meetings between people who
wouldn't have that opportunity in real life or allowing them to
step into the shoes of others (25 August, p 26). But it is also
clear that virtual worlds are ripe for abusive behaviour, and that
the naively enthusiastic attitude of some residents may even
provoke it.

Studies of griefer psychology are limited, but the Nigras' former
leader, "Mudkips Acronym", who declined to give his real-life name,
is happy to talk about his gang's motivations. He says that the
group, which boasts between 35 and 60 members, is motivated by
"laughs" and a desire to annoy the Second Lifers "who take their
'metaverse' enormously seriously". Despite the fact that the Nigras
hurl racist abuse at some residents (see "Second Life - under
attack"), Acronym says that he is not aware of anyone who is "truly
racist". Rather, "we do anything we can to shock people".

In the past, online communities have either endured residents like
Acronym or acted together to punish them. In World of Warcraft
(WoW), an online game full of elves and dragons where players
compete for gold and weapons, users often group themselves into
[18]guilds that police themselves, so that certain tasks, such as
dividing the spoils of a raid, can be carried out fairly.

Linden Lab, the San Francisco firm that runs Second Life, is also
happy to let its residents settle their own disputes. The company
says its goal is "neither to be a 'government' nor to foist one
upon the residents". Rather, it hopes to "foster a self-governing
community where residents are empowered to act on things they feel
strongly about, and adjudicate such disputes".

Self-policing is sometimes so effective that it can be used not
just to punish residents, but also to wrest control of a virtual
world from its owner. Last year, that's exactly what residents of
WoW did when Blizzard Entertainment, of Irvine, California, which
runs the world, [19]tried to block an attempt to form a guild for
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) people. Once word
spread, players organised protest marches in WoW, says Reynolds.
Some wore pink armour as a symbol of support for the proposed
guild. Bloggers also criticised the decision. Eventually Blizzard
backed down, and now several GLBT guilds exist.

The approach appears to be breaking down, however, as
entrepreneurial residents call upon real-world justice systems to
settle disputes. "Most people consider virtual worlds to be like
the Wild West, places where the law doesn't apply," says Sean Kane,
an attorney with Drakeford & Kane in New York City who specialises
in internet law. "But the law will catch up."

Financial disputes are the most common trigger for legal action.
Last month, Second Lifer Kevin Alderman filed suit against a
resident known as Volkov Catteneo over Alderman's SexGen bed, which
animates Second Life avatars so that they are able to perform more
than 150 sexual acts. Alderman's suit alleges that Catteneo, whose
real-life name is not known, is selling a pirated version of the
bed, which normally sells for $45.

Another virtual entrepreneur who has contemplated - but not yet
initiated - legal action is Catherine Fitzpatrick, a Second Life
real estate dealer who goes by the Second Life name of [20]Prokofy
Neva. She says she regularly receives obscene and racist messages
from the Nigras, some of which have led to tenants leaving her
properties. "I don't view Second Life as a fantasy world," says
Fitzpatrick. "I'm looking at it as a business."

That attitude makes some residents anxious. "The worry is that
legislators will say virtual worlds should be the same as the real
world and make very naive laws," Reynolds says.

It is not only business activities that might bring a legal
clampdown to virtual worlds. Second Life has a long tradition of
adult users adopting childlike avatars, and sometimes getting their
characters to engage in sexual acts with adult avatars. Users have
debated whether this amounts to virtual child pornography, but
since Second Life is viewed as a fantasy world, and all
participants are adults, such behaviour has generally been
tolerated. In May, however, a German TV show covered the practice
and reported details to the police. Linden Lab subsequently banned
two of the residents involved.

Meanwhile gambling, which is illegal in most US states but
widespread in Second Life, has also taken a hit. In July, Linden
Lab decided to shut down its virtual casinos after receiving a
visit from the FBI. Angry users on the firm's blog accused the
company of eroding the freedom associated with an experience that
was, after all, designed to be different from normal life. "Welcome
to Real Life 2," wrote one user. "Enjoy your stay!"

Will big online worlds like Second Life and WoW survive these legal
attacks, perhaps by adopting the protected status that sports enjoy
(see "Sporting solution")? Or will the pressure from commercially
minded users eradicate the anything-goes spirit, perhaps allowing
smaller and freer worlds to take their place? Read about a host of
planned virtual experiences in next week's instalment of this New
Scientist report.

Sporting solution

The fantasy inherent to virtual worlds is under attack from
commercially minded residents and real-world laws. Is it possible
to keep everyone happy?

One solution is to look to sport for guidance, says New York
attorney Sean Kane. When players take to the rugby field, they
experience tackles that would be classed as assaults if they took
place anywhere else.

Courts understand this and create what Kane calls a "magic circle"
around on-field behaviour. When disputes arise, the courts tend to
respect the arbitration systems established by sport authorities,
even though such committees have no formal legal standing. Virtual
worlds might earn the same respect from courts if they ensure that
the arbitration systems established by residents are fair and
transparent.

Another option is to have different types of virtual spaces, says
[21]Ren Reynolds, who studies virtual worlds, with some regulated
to keep entrepreneurs happy, and others free, for people who just
want to have fun.

Second Life, however, is one space that could face more legal
problems. The site currently [22]reserves the right to terminate a
user's account "for any or no reason", destroying their virtual
assets. If the company does not start to provide residents with
genuine ownership, some will feel compelled to go to the courts,
Kane says.
