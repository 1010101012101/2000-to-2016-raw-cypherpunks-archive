this is wrong.  Michael Mooney is going to end up on angry squirrel's
shitlist if he keeps this up.

perhaps he meant "any electronic encryption can be bypassed with the
resources available to a government."
 , in which case he is probably right.

there's a whole lot of bullshit, exaggeration, and unfounded
assumption in here,
  not worth my time to respond in detail.

moral of this story:
don't get your information from STRATFOR. unless you like it suitably
polluted...

no. i'll leave the detailed current power and scale calculation to Marsh Ray ;)

note that this is a different question from how long 2048 bit RSA
might be considered secure.  if you're responsible for protecting TOP
SECRET information against nation state attacks for multiple decades,
QC may become a non-negligible risk.  RSA of any length is not
acceptable for such data, however this does not mean that RSA of
decent key length is immediately at risk.
