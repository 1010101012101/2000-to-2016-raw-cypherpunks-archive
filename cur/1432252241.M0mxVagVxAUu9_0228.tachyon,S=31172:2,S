        Dear Investor

        A top analyst at an equity research firm has initiated
        independent coverage on the Neptune Society and we at Investors
        Edge believe the Neptune story and the company's success is well
        worth a little investigation. Key among the analysts findings
        were:

          A 67 % Increase In Revenues Over The Same Period In The Prior
                                      Year
           A 55 % Increase In Gross Margins Over The Same Period In The
                                   Prior Year
          An $8 Target Price, $9 Takeover Price, And An 'Aggressive Buy'
                                  Recommendation

        The Neptune Society is a solid company with experienced
        management, predictable profits, 'Pre-Need' contracts that have
        an annual compound rate of 32.7% from 1998 to 2000, and a $40
        million trust fund that is expected to exceed $74 million by
        2004.

        The Neptune Society was recently relisted on the OTC BB with the
        trading symbol NTUN and is now seeking to be listed on the NASDAQ
        for higher visibility and broader market exposure.

        Banyan Capital Markets LLC, an equities research firm, has issued
        an in-depth report on the Neptune Society. Highlights of the
        report are listed below followed by Banyan's press release and
        contact information.

                       * * *  H I G H L I G H T S  * * *

             Of The Research Report And Key Investment Considerations

           * The Neptune Society® is the only public “pure play” in the
             cremation segment of the death-care services industry and
             the company benefits from extensive goodwill from its
             reputation and high visibility brand name built during its
             27-year history.

           * The compelling value proposition for cremation is its
             simple, dignified, environmentally friendly and economical
             ($799 to $1,299) alternative to traditional burial service
             ($5,000+). The cremation industry is taking market share
             away from traditional burials, increasing from six  percent
             in 1975 to 24 percent in 1998 (0.55 MM cremations) and
             projected to reach 38.2 percent by 2010 (1.0 MM cremations).
             The $15 billion annual death care services industry is
             highly fragmented with the top six companies having a 25%
             market share and numerous acquisition opportunities
             available.

           * The Neptune Society serves customers in 35 major metro areas
             with 16 offices located in 6 states (CA, FL, WA, OR, NY and
             IA), excluding the corporate offices and a dedicated “call
             center” with 20 telemarketers in Tempe, AZ. One part of the
             company's business model includes opening offices in new
             locations (that meet stringent growth criteria) and making
             selective acquisitions.

           * The Neptune Society's new management team, assembled since
             1999, has substantial industry expertise. The management has
             implemented a multi-pronged marketing strategy focused on
             selling “Pre-Need” cremation plans. Including direct sales
             over their Web site, the strategy also includes direct mail
             of approximately six million pieces being sent in 2001 and
             the support of five sales managers with approximately 200
             independent, commission- only sales representatives
             providing follow-up.

         BANYAN CAPITAL INITIATES COVERAGE ON THE NEPTUNE SOCIETY WITH AN
                       $8 TARGET PRICE, $9 TAKEOVER PRICE
                         AND AN ‘AGGRESSIVE BUY’ RATING
          -Top Analyst Reports On Strong Brand Name, Effective Marketing
                         And Growth In Cremation Demand-

        Deerfield Beach, FL, July 10, 2001 – Banyan Capital Markets, LLC
        announced today that it has initiated coverage of The Neptune
        Society®, (OTC BB: NTUN), with a 12-month, $8.00 per share target
        price, a $9.00 per share takeover price, and an ‘Aggressive Buy’
        rating.

        “The Neptune Society is the only ‘pure play’ public company
        focused solely on the cremation segment of the death care
        services industry,” said Louis M. Fischler, CFA, and VP of
        Investment Banking And Research at Banyan. “We feel that The
        Neptune Society® name has tremendous brand equity due to its
        industry leadership over its 27-year history.

        “Also, Neptune’s fiscal first quarter results showed strong
        revenue growth and a significant improvement in operating cash
        flow, net of non-recurring and non-cash expenses, versus last
        year’s first quarter. The Neptune Society has developed a
        highly-effective, multi-pronged marketing program for selling
        “Pre-Need” cremation contracts that consists of direct mail
        campaigns, telemarketing (using its own call center), direct
        sales by independent contractors, and a new Web site.”

        The $15 billion death care services industry is highly fragmented
        with the top six companies holding only a 25 percent market
        share. Traditional burials, which actually declined in the first
        quarter of 2001, are losing market to cremations. The Cremation
        Association of North America estimates the market share for
        cremation will increase from approximately 26 percent to over 36
        percent in 2010, or approximately 1 million cremations per year.

        “This growth can be attributed, in large part, to the average
        cost of a cremation only being 15 to 25 percent of the average
        cost of a traditional burial, as well as to greater acceptance by
        the general public based upon religious, environmental and other
        considerations,” said Mr. Fischler. According to the report, The
        Neptune Society achieved a 67 percent increase in revenues in
        Q1-2001 versus Q1-2000. As a percentage of revenue, the company
        also increased its gross profit margin by 55 percent and improved
        its EBITDA by $742,000.
