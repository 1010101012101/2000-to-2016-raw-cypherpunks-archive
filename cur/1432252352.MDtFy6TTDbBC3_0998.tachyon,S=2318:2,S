right.

What does that have to do with transitivity?
You didn't mention transitivity when you posed the question.

Ridiculous.  '*' is an operator, not a relation.
Relations can't be parenthesized unless you're going to
make truth or falsehood a symbol to be operated upon.

Tim is right.  Cypherpunks isn't a place to look for help with your
algebra homework.  I like doing interesting math problems, but
you're not even properly asking the questions you want answered.
That makes it a LOT less fun.

This is getting stupid.  The '*' operator was defined associative.
The property of associativity applies to ASSOCIATIONS between symbols
(i.e binary operators).

I'm totally done with this.
