Subject: Microsoft speech at Stanford where we need people to show up

At this event tomorrow, Microsoft will try to present Palladium as a
security measure.  It would be useful if a few people who understand
the issues of treacherous computing and security could show up there
and point out flaws in that argument meant to justify Palladium.
Flaws could include (1) that in practice this "solution" wouldn't
solve the whole problem unless users' usage is grievously limited,
and (2) you could do as much for security in other ways that won't
attack the user's freedom.
