This is the great day for *true* privacy advocates worldwide.

In face of huge difficulties and dangers in providing real anonymity, some
human rights/wrongs organisations capitalised (in several ways) on the need for
anonymity by providing non-solutions with cosmetic appearance of anonymity.
They captured the  gullible public with this "service" and dealt another blow
to the real anonymity.

Who needs complicated mixmaster when there are cool cretin-friendly
java/web/whatever solutions ?

One would hope that users of other centralised "anonymity" services will learn
from this, if one is incurable optimist, that is.
