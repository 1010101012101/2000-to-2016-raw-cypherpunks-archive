Reminds of the scramble to gin commercial-personal spying ops as the 
big spigot of the Cold War began to close. Which begat cypherpunks
with diminished careers for the androidial best and brightest bastard-bred
by Vietnam gush bribery.

This augurs a new flowering of disaffected neo-androids out to neuter
their former enemies' and mentors' desperate attempts to top-cream 
the comsec-compsec-natsec-privacy-trashing FUD.

This augurs the greybearded cpunks generation, the EFFs, and other 
crypto-privacy-mongering TLAs and NGOs and POGOs getting 
gut-shot by the young-guns who missed out on buy-outs, awards, 
grants, contracts, counter-celebrity, seerism, sageism, crackpotism, 
pony-tailism become baldism, pansexualism, White House inviteeism,
oh the glorious days when the bullshit snakeoil meter had to be reset 
higher mathematically every news cycle.

No wonder making money has come out of the closet of shrewd
"dissidents" who no longer believe the shit about protecting the
people but gush that BS way over the top, a la wily hackers, WL 
and rush-rush sec-capitalizers scratching each others backs with
threats and counter-threats, every more saber-rattling and strategic
warnings demanding more secrets to be Chrome-barred for 
Intelnet stud and mare fees.

Inept-security-bastard Wired is now happy as a pig in shit to be inside 
the beltway of reporting on threatened sec-profits as honey and 
myhrr.

Those over 32 years old better take their cash out of the banks
before they are emptied by anons well beyond bitcoin play dough.
