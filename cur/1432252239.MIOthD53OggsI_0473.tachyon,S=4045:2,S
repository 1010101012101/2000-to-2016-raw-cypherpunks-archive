Telephone Conversation with Tripoli Pres. Bruce Kelly
September 28, 2001
Web posted at: 5:43 PM EDT

(ROL Newswire) -- ROL received a phone call from Tripoli Pres. Bruce Kelly
moments after the announcement by the FAA regarding lifting the restrictions
on rocketry. Bruce conveyed that a congressman was very instrumental in
helping restore flight waivers for rocketry. Bruce also mentioned that
individuals at the highest levels of military warned that if ANY rockets are
launched inside the continental U.S. without proper waivers the FAA
restrictions on rocket flying will be reinstated. Both Tripoli and Rocketry
Online STRONGLY encourages all rocket fliers to abide very closely to FAA
requirements for all rocket flights. ANY violations of waivers WILL RESULT
in an immediate ban on future rocket waivers. So, please be very careful to
follow the rules set forth by the FAA in all instances!
