it seem more compagny are going to put protection and drm in hardware,
to avoid bypassing or cracking it. I ask myself from times about such
systems bypassing with emulators use. The role of an emulator is to work
"as" a real cpu. What would be the usability of such an emulator with
cpu-drm enabled emulation ? The emulator work with real instructions of
drm-cpu, the os belive as a real one. But the emulation software can
give access of such drm datas to softwares running in the host os to
access or modify them. What people here that certainly have better
experiences than me in crypto think about such system ? Is it a possible
flow in new drm protected systems ?
