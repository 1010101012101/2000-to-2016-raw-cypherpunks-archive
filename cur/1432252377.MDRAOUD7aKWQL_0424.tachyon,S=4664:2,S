<grin> In the year or so I've been posting on c-punks, you have several
times mentioned that I had a good point but not once had you suggested
that I should be killed. I was starting to feel left out.

I do not think the woman should be filing suit. She should have ignored
the boor or, if her command of invective sufficed, told him off
scathingly. I do, however, support the right of people to take matters
to civil court if they truly feel they have been wronged. I'd prefer to
see a loser-pays system to prevent or compensate for frivolous claims,
as this claim would be likely to prove.

The _main_ point I wanted to make was that the state had no business
interfering here. The anti-swearing law is nonsensical, unenforceable,
and almost definitely unConstitutional. Disturbing the peace charges, if
they should exist at all, should be reserved for matters of greater
import than making a rude gesture at one woman. I concede that my
previous post didn't make my point well, if at all.

Regards,
SRF
