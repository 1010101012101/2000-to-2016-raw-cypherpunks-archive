I hadn't planned to, but I watched most of the debate tonight.

Though I won't in all likelihood vote for either the Reps or the 
Dems, I was much-impressed with the debate. Both candidates were 
thoughtful, had an easygoing command of the issues, and avoided 
simplistic cheap shots. The humor was welcome.

No mention, that I caught, of either "weapons of mass destruction" or 
"for the children," at least not in codeword ways. (There was some 
blither about "Hollywood peddling smut," and both candidates seem 
willing to suspend the Constitution on this point.)

I watched bits and pieces of the debate a few nights ago. It was 
jarring in its freneticism, especially where algore kept trying to 
squeeze in more points, kitchen-sink-style.

Generally I'm avoiding the campaign. I read no articles about the 
campaign, I watched not a minute of either of the "conventions," and 
I switch the channel on the t.v. when the election is covered. 
Perhaps I'm watching the debates because I recently read a biography 
of Lincoln.
