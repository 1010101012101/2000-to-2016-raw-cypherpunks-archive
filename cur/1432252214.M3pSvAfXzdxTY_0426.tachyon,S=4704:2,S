There's also some very nice advice for nontechnical people about things like 
Mixmaster, checking IP addresses, and how to DO a lot of stuff making use of 
the tools that are out there.

It's a great little book.

Oh yeah...I think Gilmore wrote a section in it.

>Given the complexity of the technology, Sarah is pleasantly surprised to

>downloads an installer which installs Tor on her system, then downloads
>and installs Privoxy, a proxy that works with Tor and has the pleasant
>side benefit of removing most of the ads from the webpages Sarah views.

>University. She reloads, and now noreply thinks shes in Germany. From
>this she concludes that Tor is changing her identity from request to
>request, helping to protect her privacy.

>This has some odd consequences. When she uses Google through Tor, it
>keeps switching language on her. One search, its in English - another,
>Japanese. Then German, Danish and Dutch, all in the course of a few
>minutes. Sarah welcomes the opportunity to learn some new languages, but
>shes concerned about some other consequences. Sarah likes to contribute
>to Wikipedia, but discovers that Wikipedia blocks her attempts to edit
>articles when shes using Tor.

>Tor also seems to have some of the same problems Sarah was having with
>other proxies. Her surfing slows down quite a bit, as compared to
>surfing the web without a proxy - she finds that she ends up using Tor
>only when shes accessing sensitive content or posting to her blog. And
>shes once again tied to her home computer, since she cant install Tor on
>a public machine very easily.
>
>Most worrisome, though, she discovers that Tor sometimes stops working.
>Evidently, her ISP is starting to block some Tor routers - when Tor
>tries to use a blocked router, she can wait for minutes at a time, but
>doesnt get the webpage shes requested."
