This was an incorrect diagnosis of the problem.  The Mojo Nation team were 
thinking like Keynesians.

If markets are failing to clear, prices should fall.  Even if users are  
hoarding mojo, at some sufficiently low price point, supply and demand  
will match.

Hoarding money can never be a problem, for that is what money is for. You 
are *supposed* to hoard money, otherwise it would not be worth anything.  
Gold is not good for much, other than hoarding, and government paper is 
good for even less.

Failure of price discovery is frequently a very large problem.  Price  
discovery is always arduous, laborious, costly, slow, and not very  
accurate, something Keynesians blissfully ignore.

Bittorrent, by focusing on short term exchange of like data for like data, 
has, as was expected, a permanent and massive seeding problem.

It is not apparent to me that Tahoe has achieved the goal of reliable  
storage on friendnets.  Too large a friendnet, anti social behavior makes 
the net unreliable, too small a friendnet, k of n storage runs into the 
problem that k and n are small making the net unreliable.

The problems that Mojo Nation sought to solve are still there, unsolved,  
and pissing people off.

Any reputation system will have good inputs, evil inputs, insane inputs,  
and evil insane inputs.  The evil or insane inputs will be rated as good  
by fellow members or sibyls of each evil or insane faction, so we will get 
graphs that are by some measure, in some sense, disjoint.  If one starts at 
a good node in the good faction, reflecting a well known good guy, everyone 
well linked will be good, thus connection analysis of the reputation graph 
generates faction subgraphs.  Faction subgraphs will typically have 
important highly connected nodes.  Mencius refers to such nodes as Kings.  
You give your allegiance to a good King, and your problem is solved.  You 
give your allegiance to a bad King, you are hosed.  The graph analysis 
system may help you find a good King, but cannot reliably find one for you, 
because whatever criteria it uses will be gamed by the evil.

A simple solution is to bake a single king node into the client software - 
otherwise known as a central point of failure.  A default king node will, 
however, work, or at least fail less disastrously than a baked in king 
node.

People don't really want remote storage.  They want file sharing, in some 
cases highly controlled sharing - sharing with only with themselves at 
different logins, only with other instances of themselves, being a special 
case of controlled sharing.

Thus, it is a communication and publication system, not a hard drive.
