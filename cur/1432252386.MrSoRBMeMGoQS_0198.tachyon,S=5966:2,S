The subject line says it all, if one remembers Variola's clever dare.
As far as I'm concerned, this big brother bullshit should work two ways: any 
tyrrany should expect that any public actions will make it onto the net 
somewhere. Of course, one day they'll probably begin a set of countermoves, 
but think of it like a chess match.

So I'm still playing with the idea of a publically-accessible document that 
outlines the strategies, technologies, aims and requirements for somehow 
uploading images and data to public repositorioes. (DAMN I'm typing like 
shit...must be that Chimay beer I was drinking.) The most obvious target app 
is large public demonstrations where video/film is likely to be confiscated.

Anyone interested? And what does it mean (if anything) to do this within the 
context of the Cypherpunk list?

And if there's interest, how do we proceed? As an engineer (well, until very 
recently!), a "drill-down" approach seems good: Start with an outline (I can 
take a stab at that), and then after the outline is agreed upon, send out 
the sections for various individuals to work. After the first draft of the 
document is finished, then the whole thing is somehow re-worked by all 
concerned.

Of course, I would think it's not necessary for everyone to agree on every 
section or every word...different sections can contain contradicotory 
information...I see no real problem with that, except if PR is a 
consideration (in the end, this should be basically a cookbook...the users 
can decide upon which recipes thery want to use). Oh, and open issues are 
perfectly fine, and if well-identified can be a strength to a document.

Of course, when I look at this email later I may regret that I sent it out 
before coming down from the Belgian high. I'm hoping, however, that this 
will be because I started a ball rolling that SHOULD be rolling, and that I 
would have not set to rolling had it not been for the good ole' Chimay 
trappists.

So now to click the send button and YAH!
