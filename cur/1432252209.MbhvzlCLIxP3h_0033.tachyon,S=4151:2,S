BEDFORD, Mass., September 6, 2000 -- RSA® Security Inc. (NASDAQ: RSAS) today
announced it has released the RSA public key encryption algorithm into the
public domain, allowing anyone to create products that incorporate their own
implementation of the algorithm. This means that RSA Security has waived its
rights to enforce the patent for any development activities that include the
RSA algorithm occurring after September 6, 2000.
