I find the content from remailers is far higher than average for the
list.

So sign your messages.  With your true name, if that's important.

The technology isn't there yet, true, but it won't get there without
deploying it and using it.  Why isn't this obvious?

Don't worry, the cypherpunks list isn't going anywhere.  It's just not
realistic to put that genie back in the bottle.  It would have to be a
separate list entirely or one which rode on the current cypherpunks
list.

We may not be able to decide for others, but we can certainly look
down on so-called cypherpunks who, in many cases, cannot even encrypt
a message, never mind "writing code".  Many, in fact, exhibit
hostility towards remailers and anonymity, as you do.

What I fail to understand is why such people are on this list in the
first place, but, as you say, people make their own decisions.

(None of these comments apply to Tim May, of course.)
