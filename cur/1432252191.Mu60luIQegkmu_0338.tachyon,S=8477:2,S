Ditto, sir.  Along with the amazingly irregular "English", and various
other systems subject to Metcalfe's Law (aka the fax effect).

Feh.  You may choose not to work for the military.  I do.  You may
also choose to work with folks who require MShit.  The cost of
either decision is pretty high nowadays.

I (and you) have to share the planet with a population *half* of which
is subaverage
in intelligence.  A population that loves Fox News and Bush and Brittny
and ESPN etc.  So what?
Its our albatross.  You don't use govt violence to correct this.

One can assume that Joe Sixpack has seen the creditcard trick, and makes

locally rational decisions.  Hell, my Dad read about Blaze's "master
key" attack
in the paper.

Ok.  But do you see my point?   You do not want the State to decide
what is good, fair, publishable, etc.  The 1st amendment permits
all kinds of objectionable bits.  I rather like that, although I don't
like many of the bits or their effect on many members of my species.
Here in the US, we don't sue folks who write inflammatory books
because their readers have done some wrong.  It should be the
same with machine-executable bits.

Actually, yes.  Though I very much like your use of that phrase.

I can't sue Fox for polluting the minds of people I might encounter.

Whatever.  There was generally a reason for introducing abilities else
it wouldn't
have been invested in, assuming rational actors.  That <feature X> was a
horrible
security/privacy risk didn't occur to them, or was ignored, is
irrelevant as
far as legal culpability should be concerned.

I thought NetBSD was the tight one.  I've run FreeBSD.  *Whatever*

But your comment again illustrates: security vs. convenience.  *BSD
biasses are different (and clearly superior from a security point of
view)
than other OSes.  But this is *irrelevent*.  We're not talking tech
here, we're talking law.

Right.  And MS has zero obligation to support anything it doesn't want
to.

:-)  But what I meant was this decision is irrelevant.  Or would you
have Ashcroft aim his guns at Redmond for that (perhaps poor,
perhaps required, I don't know the rationale) design decision?

If they were easier to admin, perhaps you would not have a job :-)

YOU ARE JOE CODER.

Do you want to threatened with state violence because
someone doesn't like your design decisions or implementation
quality?

Exploding tires are dealt with by Consumer Reports and other reputation
modifiers.

I'm not sure whether being an implied MS defender is any better than
being
associated with the folks who took L Ron seriously.  I'll let this one
pass
since I was borderline abusive before.

Yes, Esperanto has no hope, though it may be better designed.  Metcalfe

Let them whine.  So long as they don't use state violence (eg DMCA)
against others.

Doesn't that make them legally *more* liable, realizing they
