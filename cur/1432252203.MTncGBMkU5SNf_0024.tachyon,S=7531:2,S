VW presents new synthetic fuel strategy

In the context of its fuel strategy released at the recent Frankfurt 
IAA Motor Show, Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a key step towards 
environmentally compatible mobility. The new fuel offers considerable 
potential for the optimisation of conventional engines. SunFuel is 
also suitable for use in fuel cell systems with reformers.

On this basis, it will be possible to fill up fuel cell vehicles with 
a fuel produced from renewable resources without developing costly 
new infrastructure of the type which would be needed for hydrogen 
fuel.

SunFuel is a synthetic fuel produced from biomass by a regenerative 
process. Natural photosynthesis is used for fuel production. Plants 
develop biomass from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the aid of 
energy from the sun.

To a large extent, this biomass consists of carbon and hydrogen. In 
the first step of the SunFuel process, these major constituents of 
biomass are converted into synthesis gas (H2, CO, CO2). This is then 
transformed into hydrocarbons in a synthesis reactor and processed as 
required to produce the "designer" fuel.

SunFuel is an extremely high-grade fuel, free from sulphur and 
aromatics. As biomass binds carbon dioxide during growth, the process 
is neutral with regard to carbon dioxide production. A variety of 
different types of biomass can be used for the synthesis of the new 
fuel.

On the one hand, fast-growing, sturdy, resilient plants such as sedge 
(Miscanthus), poplars or willows can be grown. On the other hand, 
waste products containing carbon and hydrogen, such as sewage sludge, 
plastics or household refuse, can also be processed.

SunFuel must not be confused with Biodiesel. While only rapeseed oil 
is used for Biodiesel production, the SunFuel process taps the energy 
contained in the entire plant.

The use of SunFuel is highly environmentally compatible. In contrast 
to fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas, no additional carbon 
dioxide is produced during the combustion of SunFuel. As it is free 
from sulphur and aromatics, the new fuel also ensures a significant 
reduction in all types of emissions normally measured, especially 
particulate matter.

According to Dr Ulrich Eichhorn, Head of Volkswagen Research, 
"SunFuel opens up additional new perspectives. To date, engine 
developers have been forced to work with the fuel qualities 
available. Now, synthetic fuels of a variety of types can be produced.

"Not only petrol or diesel fuels can be synthesized from biomass. A 
number of intermediate stages are also possible. On this basis, there 
could be further rapprochement between petrol and diesel technology. 
In this way, the benefits of a diesel engine, such as low 
consumption, could be further expanded and combined with the very low 
emissions of a petrol engine with three-way catalytic converter.

"The designer fuel can be mixed with conventional petrol or diesel 
without any problems. SunFuel could therefore be introduced in a 
gradual transition process.

"In order to produce SunFuel for all the diesel-engined vehicles in 
Germany, it would be necessary to plant about 20 000 square 
kilometres. Currently, this area is certainly not available. However, 
the area of agricultural set-aside, about 10 000 square kilometres, 
could be used for growing energy plants for fuel production.

"The production of synthetic fuels from natural gas is a 
state-of-the-art technology. The properties of the fuel do not 
change. However, this type of synthetic fuel can result in a carbon 
dioxide saving if associated gas (for instance, the gas produced 
together with oil, which is normally flared) is used."

Volkswagen sees hydrogen as a possible fuel of the future. However, 
it will be best to combine hydrogen with fuel cell technology.

According to Dr Eichhorn, "There are still at lest three 
technological barriers to overcome: the regenerative production, 
storage and distribution of hydrogen. Volkswagen therefore believes 
that hydrogen technology will not be used before 2015."

Hydrogen will only result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions 
if it is produced from renewable sources. However, carbon dioxide 
reduction with regenerative energy production is not only possible if 
elementary hydrogen is used as a fuel. SunFuel can be stored and 
distributed using existing infrastructure and is less costly to 
produce than hydrogen. This is why Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a 
promising fuel for the future.
