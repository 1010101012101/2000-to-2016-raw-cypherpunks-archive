Well, if you can't win on the truth, win on the procedures.

At least Dr. Mercuri is in fine company there, ranging all the way
back to Socrates and Galileo.  Little consolation, I know, as our
democracy gets replaced by a kleptocracy, but what can you do?

Maybe she should set up stealdemocracy.com, a new voting machine
company.  Sell machines that explicitly let you steal elections.  Get
some press.

| Computer Voting Expert Ousted From Elections Conference

| 
| Denver CO Aug 1 - Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, a leading expert in voting machine
| security, had her conference credentials revoked by the president of the
| International Association of Clerks, Records, Election Officials, and
| Treasurers (IACREOT), Marianne Rickenbach. The annual IACREOT Conference
| and Trade Show, which showcases election systems to elections officials,
| is being held at the Adam's Mark Hotel in Denver all this week.
| 
| Mercuri believes that her credentials were revoked because of her position
| in favor of voter-verified paper ballots for computerized election
| systems. "I guess in a very troubling way it makes sense that an
| organization like IACREOT, that supports paperless computerized voting
| systems, which are secret by their very design, would not want computer
| experts who disagree with that position at their meetings."
| 
| Dr. Mercuri said that her credentials were approved for the first three
| days of the conference. She attended meetings of other groups and visited
| the exhibitors hall. But it was only on Thursday as she sat down to attend
| her first meeting at the IACREOT that President Marianne Rickenbach took
| Mercuri out of the room and told her that her credentials were being
| revoked. Rickenbach said that Mercuri had not filled out the forms
| correctly. Mercuri protested, but was refused reinstatement.
| 
| David Chaum, the inventor of eCash and a member of Mercuri's
| 'voter-verified paper ballot' group, had his credentials revoked on the
| first day of the conference. On the second day his credentials were
| partially restored. Chaum was allowed to visit the exhibitors hall, but
| not attend the IACREOT meetings.
| 
| Rickenbach was unavailable for comment as of this report. Mercuri can be
| reached at the Adam's Mark Hotel through Saturday.
