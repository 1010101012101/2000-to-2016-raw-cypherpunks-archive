-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


The Talley remailer is temporarily down (as well as my high-speed access; 
this msg is sent via CDPD modem); my  DSL was disconnected by Speakeasy.net 
related to complaints about the Talley remailer.

(Apparently the complaints are important enough to justify shutting off my 
service, but nobody's available to explain who sent them, which messages 
generated them, which addresses got things they didn't want to get, or so 
forth.)

Anyway, Talley will return (likely pretty soon) when I find good 
connectivity for it; my personal email is accessible, but very slowly.

Cpunks who are looking for DSL or dialup connections might want to avoid 
Speakeasy and their ad hoc disconnection policy.
