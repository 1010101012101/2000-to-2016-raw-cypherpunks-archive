If anyone reads this and doesn't think they haven't pulled the same
gambit with every US cloud service provider, they are kidding themselves.

This, in my opinion, can make all US encryption, even US-based
certificate authorities really untrustworthy. What is to stop them from
getting GoDaddy to give up their root certificates with a NSL and a
small legal justification?

Once they have it, they could, in theory, MitM attack a ton of servers,
and I don't think the judges even realize that.
