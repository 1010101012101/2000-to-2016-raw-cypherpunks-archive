Joe Sixpack got lost at "Compile".
It's still easier to use than the early versions of FreeS/WAN
("First do a clean compile of your kernel...")

On the other hand, if you're using Mutt, you're already
more complex than Joe Sixpack is likely to use.

Also, rather than a virus installer, it'd be interesting if there were
an anonymizer package built for Apache.  Widespread anonymous web browsing
would mean that simple web-based remailers would be easily usable.
