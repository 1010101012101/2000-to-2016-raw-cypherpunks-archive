Hmmm.  These devices could be useful, even without using 
them as credit cards.  I wonder if you could buy a batch 
of them from the manufacturer with custom software installed? 

It would sure be nice if I could make a physical key token 
that would render my system completely useless if the key 
were, say, in my wallet at work, and the computer found its 
way to, say, the hands of someone carrying out an illegal 
search and seizure.  

likewise it would be nice to store PGP keys on, etc -- bits 
of data that you want to maintain complete physical control 
of at all times. 

"Oppression is sometimes best fought with the tools that 
the oppressors have built for their own use." 

I want a PGPdisk you can boot from.
