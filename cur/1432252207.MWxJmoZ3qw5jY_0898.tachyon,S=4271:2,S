Sure.  I'd assumed you'd seen his mail; I'm separately forwarding the message
that I'd excerpted, though I don't seem to have most of the other messages
in the thread; archives are at http://inet-one.com/cypherpunks/
(it's mostly full of spam, because somebody once decided to make a point
about list filtering by subscribing us to all the spam he could find
but there's real content as well; I read the spam-filtered version of the list,
but I'm not aware of an archive of that version.)

You do get occasionally discussed on the list, or at least referred to,

Oh, that'll be interesting - I'll see you there.

One of the cypherpunks arguments is that you'll get a lot more
whistleblowers if they can do so anonymously.
