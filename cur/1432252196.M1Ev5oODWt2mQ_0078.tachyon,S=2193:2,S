Cryptome has copies (http://cryptome.org/s3202.txt) of a speech by an
elected US politician of some stripe about a proposed "Dangerous
Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000" who makes this point:

"Third, the legislation makes it unlawful to knowingly communicate
false, but believable information, concerning an activity which would
constitute a violation of this statute."

So is the sentence "This sentence is a violation of the Dangerous
Biological Agent and Toxin Control Act of 2000" true or false?
