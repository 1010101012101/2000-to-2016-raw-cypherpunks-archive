#    Would-be shoplifters foiled
#    
#    Sporting aluminum underwear illegal under new law
#    By Bill McKeown/The Gazette
#    
#    If you're thinking about going to the mall in that snappy 
#    aluminum-lined underwear in the back of your dresser drawer, 
#    think again.
#    
#    Beginning Sunday, it will be illegal in Colorado to wear aluminum 
#    underwear.
#    
#    OK, there's a caveat. You can wear aluminum briefs and lingerie 
#    as long as it's for personal amusement - but not if it is to 
#    help steal by foiling stores' anti-shoplifting devices.
#    
#    The new law, surely the oddest of the dozens coming out of this 
#    season's legislative session, is no laughing matter ... really.
#    
#    "This is serious business," said Sen. Stephanie Takis, D-Aurora, 
#    one of the bill's sponsors. "We have laws against using crowbars 
#    as theft devices, but if you were lining your underwear with 
#    aluminum foil, that was not a crime."
#    
#    And by golly, said Takis, it should be. She cited several 
#    Denver-area malls that have caught shoplifters with aluminum-lined 
#    shopping bags and even the so-called "iron pants" and could do 
#    nothing to stop it.
#    
#    Steve Miller, an attorney with the Legislative Council, helped 
#    draft the bill: "I don't know if it was the highlight of my 
#    career, but I got the assignment."
#    
#    Miller said the bill went through several evolutions - "or 
#    devolutions depending on your viewpoint" - before it received 
#    Gov. Bill Owens' approval.
#    
#    Essentially, it makes it a misdemeanor to make, wear or know 
#    others are wearing aluminum underwear if they intend to use it 
#    to fool stores' theft-protection devices. Those devices 
#    electronically sense when merchandise leaving the store hasn't 
#    been handled by a cashier, and foil can interfere with that 
#    detection.
#    
#    Miller said the new law also gives store employees civil and 
#    criminal immunity if they stop shoppers who crackle when they 
#    walk.
