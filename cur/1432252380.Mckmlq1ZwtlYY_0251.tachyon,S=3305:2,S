Yes, but the reason it's bullshit is that shooting messengers does no
good.  It leaves intact the originators of the message, all hundred-
million of them.  Tomorrow, the hundred million will be stumbling over
each other trying to empower new messengers to replace those fallen.
Who else but the messengers (politicians, bureaucrats, etc.) is going
to collect the money to pay the Social Security, after all?  Who else
is going to halt the drug trade?

Worse than the secret ballot?
