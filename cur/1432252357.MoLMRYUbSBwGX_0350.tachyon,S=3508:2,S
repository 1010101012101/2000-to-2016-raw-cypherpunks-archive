No, only a very small faction of crypto-anarchists (better known as the
terminaly self-indulged). The vast majority of people on this list (and
elsewhere) for that matter understand the concept of self-defence and
recognize its distinction from "I have a right to kill a person" bullshit.

No, Tim and a handful of others have been spouting this crap since day
one. Check the archives.

A well armed fuckhead bag of hot air you mean...

Nothing wrong with your deductive powers. This observation with respect to
anarchy is why the vast majority (99.999% perhaps?) of people have enough
of a clue to pass it by.

It's worth mentioning that the only 'working' anarchy (Iceland) had to
legalize murder in order to build a system that didn't break down into a
Hatfields-McCoy type scenario. It's also worth mentioning that after
several attempts at exporting it to other Scandanavian countries it died
an ingnoble death.
