Considerably less than three thousand.  And "we" did not kill 
them.  The Israelis did.  There are lots of states worse than 
Israel -- Iraq for one.

In particular, the people in the two towers did not kill them.

If Palestinians had bombed the white house or congress, that 
might well have been just.  But Bin Laden's boys were children
of wealth, power, and privilege.  Even if they had been bombing 
Washington, they did not have just cause.  And they were not 
bombing Washington, they were bombing the two towers.

The 9/11 terrrorists were not Palestinians.  They were not 
avenging Israeli dispossession of Palestinians, and had they 
been, they would have been hitting the wrong target.
