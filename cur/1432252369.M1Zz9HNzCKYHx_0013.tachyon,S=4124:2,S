ok, so let's play the game and assume you're not just trolling:

> What makes 'your friend' an authority? 

he had the weapon in question in hand pretty much every day for several
years. he trained new recruits on it. I bet he can disassemble, clean
and reassemble it blindfolded. is that enough authority to answer a
simple question on ammunition?


> Why should we take your word for it? 

because I have nothing to gain by stating anything false, while I do
have reputation capital to gain by making truthful statements based on
actual research.

you are free to come over to germany and verify my existence in person.
in addition, I've been too long on this list to be a prank for this
unimportant issue. third, you can make a call to my company and ask to
be connected to me. ricardo.de happens to be a little too large for tim
to buy up just to create a fake account.


> How do we authenticate your friend (ie pk management)?

web-of-trust. I will authenticate my friend by having a face-to-face
meeting. you can authenticate my words via PGP if you want to, I can
sign the mail. which leaves only me as a possible instance of
introducing false facts, and that point has been answered above.

now as to how to authenticate whether or not my friend is what I claim
he is - well, I'm sure he has the appropriate documents that could be
checked for forgery, etc. if you insist (and pay the costs) that could
surely be arranged.
