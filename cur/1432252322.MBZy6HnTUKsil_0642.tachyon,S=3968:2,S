So, if I tear the cover off of a paperback book that I legally own 
(bought, for example), Choate's claim is that this "is in fact a 
crime"?

Gee, so much for scienter. So much for proof of actual criminal 
action. So much for tort law.

Jim, please call the police, as I have just torn the cover off of a 
book I own. Worse, I just cut the tags off of a mattress. Call before 
I commit more crimes.

Fucking retard.
