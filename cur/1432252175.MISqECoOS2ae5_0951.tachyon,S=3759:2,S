Here's an interesting thought, though.  There are all kinds of 
number generators already hanging in the sky, and some of them 
are fairly random, so this thing might actually have a prayer 
of working.

Take a good telescope, and focus on, eg, Jupiter's Red Spot. 
(ignoring for a moment the problems of focus and synchronization).
That's turbulence - a pretty damn good source of randomness. 
If Bob and Alice can see the same image, and derive the same 
stream of random numbers from it, this scheme might be salvaged 
yet. The bandwidth wouldn't be quite as high, especially allowing 
for enough "roughness" to keep it likely that the number streams 
Alice and Bob get have enough correlation to work with - but it 
might serve.
