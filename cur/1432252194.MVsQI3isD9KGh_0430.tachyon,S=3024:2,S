It sounds suspiciously like an int16 issue.

32K is close enough to 32767 after which a 16 bit integer goes negative 
when incremented.  Which is odd because it should roll over, not count 
backwards.

perhaps they did something like this:

note the use of abs on reporting.


int16 votes[MAX_CANDIDATES];

void add_a_vote(uint8 candidate)
{
 if (candidate>MAX_CANDIDATES) return;
 votes[candidate]++;
}

void report(void)
{
 int i;

 for (i=0; i<MAX_CANDIDATES; i++)
 {
  printf("Candidate %s got %d votes\n",candidates[i],abs(votes[i]));
 }

}
