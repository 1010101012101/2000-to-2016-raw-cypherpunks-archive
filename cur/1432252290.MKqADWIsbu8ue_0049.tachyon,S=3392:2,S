The tax man is not the same as your reputation agent(s).

The tax man is supposed to prevent and punish coercison.
That's all.

You are not forced to subscribe to any reputation agents
under threat of violence.

The Council of Rabbis (or the Tribe of Granolaheads) 
does not seize your house at gunpoint
if you don't support their efforts at maintaining what
the tax-supported-USDA claims about cleanliness.

Similarly future private Better Business Credential Bureaus
transcend the State's limitations on credit hysteresis.
