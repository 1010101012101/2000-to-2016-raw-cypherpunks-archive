In that one case, yes.
The compression will vary based on the deviation from an ideally
compressable sample - for *any* bit pattern 0x0000 to 0xFFFF you would
expect to see it once in 2^32 trials (by definition) therefore you will
get a mix of compressable and uncompressable patterns, with uncompressable
patterns being more likely (simply because there are more of them in the
full range of available patterns 0x0000 to 0xFFFF

randomness is a funny thing. a truely random file can be *anything* that
is the right length - including a excerpt from william shakespere
(provided you have enough monkeys)
it is most likely to be random garbage, for a large sample - but for a
very small sample the odds of it being an ordered sample are surprisingly
good.
the obvious example here is a double coin test - two bits. an ordered
sample would be both heads or both tails. a disordered sample would be one
head and one tail. in practice, you would expect to see half the results
from a larger trial (say 32 double-throws) with a ordered sample, and half
disordered.
as you reach three coins, the odds of a completely ordered result decrease
(from 2 in 2^2, to 2 in 2^3). for four coins, you still have the same two
compressable results. consider:
HHHH    HHHT    HHTH    HHTT
HTHH    HTHT    HTTH    HTTT
THHH    THHT    THTH    THTT
TTHH    TTHT    TTTH    TTTT

in a large trial, you would expect to see each of these once every 2^4
tests, on the average. obviously HHHH and TTTT are very compressable.
assuming a runlength encoding, I don't think any of the others are
compressable at all.....
