	For starters when he contacted Poitras he was still working for
	the american nazi government. He wasn't in any 'watch
	list' (rather he was the one making such lists) - His actions
	were not 'detected' because nobody was interested in 'detecting'
	them.

	So, there goes your theory...

	I don't think so. Snowden was 'one of them'.

	Also, Snowden didn't plan to remain anonymous and didn't remain
	anonymous except for a few days. So, there isn't any evidence
	of tor working, except for a few days, at best. Although even
	that is unwarranted. 

	Bottom line, this "trusted his life to Tor"  is just cheap
	rhetoric.

	Yes, I think it's a red flag. I'm guessing you disagree(?) but
	I don't know exactly how to read your remark about different
	people and different tastes...
