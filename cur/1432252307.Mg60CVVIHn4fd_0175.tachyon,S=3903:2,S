It's a pipe. The whole plaintext IP packet, from start to finish, including 
headers and checksum, gets treated as data, and encrypted.

The encrypted packet is the data for a new packet, which goes from one
firewall to another (and has only the firewall IP addresses exposed). The
packets visible on the outside only tell Eve that firewall A sent firewall
B an IPSEC packet of a certain size, with a particular Security Association.

(ie, the protocol field says 'this is an IPSEC packet').

A single SA can be used for many, many, internal connections.

Check the IPSEC RFCs for more info.
