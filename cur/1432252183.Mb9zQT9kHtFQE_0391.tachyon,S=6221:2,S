Oops. Forgot to cc this:

How long do you think NRA management's "Winning" Team 
could continue suckering gun rights supporters into 
sending them $200 MILLION a year if they came out and 
frontally assaulted the right to keep and bear arms, 
rather than gradually undermining it while appearing to 
fight the good fight?

I wish you were right. I wish it was just incompetence.
