	Sure. It's not totalitarian. It's simply based on the free
	principle of democracy : obey or die. 

	You don't need to waste your amazing intellect refuting me,
	Nick. I've conceded your point.

	Thanks Nick. Now I really get it. People who do evil things are
	not evil. They are good.

	See Nick, that's the real extent of your intellect. It took you
	two paragraphs to flatly contradict yourself.

	Well, thanks for considering me a hardore cypherpunk? Now think
	about what you wrote. You're whining about cypherpunks in a
	cypherpunk mailing list. Do you see just how ridiculous you
	are? 

	But I get it. What you want is a cypherpunk mailing list full of
	obama supporters - like you. Did I get that one right?

	Thanks.

	Humor me. What word do you use to describe your political
	beliefs?

	Oh OK. You are a fucking nutcase who fancies himself an
	anarchist while he praises the US government. 


	I rest my case.
