He can slap that order on anything he likes, even if it is an unpublished
(literally, not the copyright meaning) private work.  This is a common
method used by the fedz to avoid having to do a complete "site
clearance" on certain new defense contractors (at least this was true in
the late 80's - I have no reason to think it has changed).  If work is
expected to yeild "national secrets", but it is expected to do so without
utilizing previously classified materials ("classified" being over
"Sensitive"), the work is normally allowed to progress until such time as
a "secret" work product is produced, at which time it is retroactively
classified to it's appropriate level(s).

These shenanigans work in the fedz favor because it costs real dollars to
send out the men with the little plastic ID cards to do site surveys and
personnel background checks.  If the work is unsuccessful, they have not
wasted the $$.  If it comes to fruition, they impart a "temporary" site
and personnel classification, classify the work product, and only then
spend the necessary money and D.I.S. hours.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
