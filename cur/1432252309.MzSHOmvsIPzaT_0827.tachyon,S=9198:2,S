because he is against the death penalty and that is being used to target 
him in another one of these right-wing smear campaigns the country is so 
fond of right now.

-0800 Subject: Danny Glover Under Attack
Dear member of the State of the Possible community,
Here's a message to act on and to send on to your networks.
Danny Glover, actor, activist, and board member of the Positive Futures 
Network, has been coming under a hailstorm of attacks based on an incident 
following a speech he gave at Princeton on November 16.
This is not just about Danny. It's about all of us. As Danny noted in his 
speech "When we fear, we clamp down on those who do not think like us or 
who do not look like us." We see that happening everywhere, as our leaders 
look for total support for their military agenda and view dissent as 
unpatriotic.
As we enter this McCarthyesque period, I think we are all called upon to be 
more courageous, more articulate in our views, and more supportive of one 
another.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED TO DANNY
On November 16, at the invitation of the local Amnesty International 
chapter, Danny gave a speech about the death penalty to a packed auditorium 
at Princeton University. Danny is well known for his opposition to the 
death penalty. He pointed out that 98 death row inmates have recently been 
released after new evidence demonstrated their innocence. He also noted the 
racial bias in the system in which 43 percent of 741 executed prisoners 
were African Americans. His speech was received enthusiastically by a 
sympathetic audience.
After the close of the speech, when many had already left the auditorium, a 
young man questioned Danny in such racist language that the remaining 
audience booed the questioner. Danny signaled for quiet, saying we need to 
listen to all. The questioner accused Danny of "playing the victim" and 
suggested he go back and fix his own communities rather than blame racism. 
He also wanted to know if Danny would extend his opposition to the death 
penalty to Osama bin Laden. Danny affirmed his opposition to the death 
penalty, period. The provocative exchange continued, with Danny noting that 
America has been a key purveyor of violence in this world. Danny also 
voiced his objections to the military tribunals that President Bush has 
created.
These comments have elicited a hailstorm of outrage. For two weeks The 
Trentonian newspaper ran angry comments suggesting that if Danny didn't 
love this country he should leave it -- and worse. Oliver North broadcast 
the story across the country on his Radio America show, provoking hundreds 
of hate-filled calls to Danny's agency in Los Angeles. North urged his 
audience to boycott The Royal Tenenbaums -- a movie to be released in late 
December in which Danny stars along with Gwyneth Paltrow, Gene Hackman, 
Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray, and others.
In Modesto, California, the controversy caused the City Council to pull out 
of sponsoring Danny as the featured speaker for the celebration of Martin 
Luther King Day. Fortunately, the local planning committee for the event 
has maintained their invitation and Danny plans to speak. According to the 
Modesto Bee, "John Lucas, president of the Modesto Peace Life Center, one 
of the sponsors, noted that King himself was controversial and criticized 
the Vietnam War. Lucas does not think Glover's views are much different 
from those King might have had if he were alive today. 'The interesting 
thing I find is that Martin Luther King wouldn't be invited to his own 
event,'" he said.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
Those who would stifle dissent are quick to express their opinions and 
target anyone who takes a larger view of patriotism. We too must be ready 
to respond quickly in our vigilant defense of real democracy.
**MODESTO: Show support for Danny -- and for free speech -- in Modesto. If 
you know anyone around that area, urge them to attend! Danny will speak on 
Saturday, January 19 at 7:00 p.m. at the Christ Unity Baptist Church at 
1320 L St. in Modesto (Call the Peace Life Center for further information: 
209/529-5750).
Fax the Modesto City Council at 209/571-5586 or write them at Modesto City 
Council, P.O. Box 642, Modesto CA 94341 saying you support free speech and 
disagree with their decision to pull their backing for Danny's appearance 
at the MLK Day activities.
**THE MOVIE: Here's an easy one. See the Royal Tenenbaums -- don't let 
Ollie North's call for a boycott depress the box office.
**MLK Day. Let's celebrate Martin Luther King Day with an extra measure of 
clarity about his courage in consistently urging this nation to live up to 
its ideals of democracy, freedom, and peace.
**SUPPORT EACH OTHER. Let's look for every opportunity to support one 
another. What happened to Danny is happening to many others. This is a time 
for courage and mutual support.

Support the proffr "kill ollie" campaign.Start by sending ON copies of 
"assassination politics",by jim bell.If he cant take a hint,pool and pledge 
enough to pay the closest prediction of ONs permanent retirement from 
politics.Something thats long overdue.
"Simon wiesenthal was under the impression that tracking down people who 
did bad things for the government was not only acceptable, but in fact 
laudatory."
We need some vietnamese simons,some central and southern american simons 
and some arabic and Iranian simons.Im an anti-militarist simon.Oliver North 
is a liar,murderer by remote control and green collar crook.The scum 
deserves to die.Good riddance ollie,you straining anus.
Killthepresident,proffr1
Im suprised the friends and relatives of some of the 80 US marines havent 
punched ollie a new one.
The fact that cold blooded state torture and murder is carried out by 
volunteers in the prison service would seem to make them almost perfect AP 
nominee's.Creepy fuckers like that would surely not be missed and the govt 
would learn who was boss.
