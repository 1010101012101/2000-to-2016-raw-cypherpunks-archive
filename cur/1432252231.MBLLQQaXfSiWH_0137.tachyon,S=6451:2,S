an interesting anecdote.  friends and i had prior moved to
configurations with explicitly no logging (a change from defaults,
since OTR in most clients would log to disk by default)

a change to pond no different, as prior expectations assumed no persistence...

we ended up on random etherpads on a trusted host. (e.g. one of our own).

very true; evokes Gibson:
  “The street finds its own uses for things.”


(and in the example above, the URI itself the authenticator for the
random pad...)
