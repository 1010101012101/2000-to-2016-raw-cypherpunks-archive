This is silly. Rather than show that Hanssen had any particular erotic 
reaction to part of the NSA presentation, it is vastly more likely that 
it shows that anyone under constant surveillance will at some point do 
something, perhaps out of boredom, out of daydreaming, which 
surveillers will note with prurient interest.

during the Thursday One Hour Preparation for the Great Hate. Suggest 
surveillance be increased."
