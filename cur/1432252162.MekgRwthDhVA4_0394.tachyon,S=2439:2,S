You forget that Bush and his cronies are Evangelical Christians.  They 
believe that the world is going to end *soon* and that it is a good thing. 

These are people who are doing everything they can to make the world a 
less stable place because in doing so they bring about armagedon.  (Then 
Jesus will come back and they will be rewarded for bringing about the 
deaths of billions.

Sometimes i wonder if they worship Jesus or Cthulhu.  (Maybe they are the 
same.  How else could he walk on water?)
