Z1 SecureMail Gateway 2.1 Checks Certificates In Real-Time
Posted on 26 November 2004 | Other Zertificon Solutions releases at HNS

E-mail security solution enhanced with online protocol and monitoring in
new release

Zertificon Solutions just released version 2.1 of the Z1 SecureMail
Gateway. The so called "virtual admin office" protects corporate e-mail
traffic with centralized cryptography and electronic signature from being
manipulated and spied out. The server-based solution contains a certificate
management that now also supports the OCSP protocol. This enhancement
enables verification of external certificates in real-time and is an
increase of the security level.

 The Online Certificate Service Protocol (OCSP) is the emerging standard
for the validation of certificates at trust centers. With the disposal of
OCSP the common use of steadily growing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
and databases with expired certificates obsolete. This new way of
certificate validation is faster, every time up-to-date and receives a
security level which could not be achieved by manual verification by the PC
user.

 Version 2.1 of the Z1 SecureMail Gateway now also contains a statistic
module that e.g. shows how many e-mail messages went in and out, how many
of them were encrypted and / or signed, which standard was used (PGP or
S/MIME).

 Thus the statistic module monitors the increasing use of central
encryption and electronic signature. Free and unlimited test version 2.1 is
available on the companies website.
