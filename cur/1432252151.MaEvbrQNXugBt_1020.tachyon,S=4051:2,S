Yes that is one of the things you can actually learn from this group
if your receiver can handle the S/N ratio.

If you have a non-persistant but traceable nym, what's
the point?  Suppose you use a one-time email account to threaten the
president, but the message is traceable to your carcass (e.g., the internet
cafe
had surveillance cameras).   You may as well use your Meat Name; its gonna
hit the papers anyway.

On the other hand, a non-persistant and untraceable nym is good for
threatening the president, but not useful for reputation building.

A persistant but untraceable nym is good for commerce.

All are possible.  All are useful.  Ergo, all will come about, whether
you like it or not.
