Encryption is a defense against threats.  For people to adopt
encryption, they need to be threatened.

All businessmen are guilty of insider trading and destruction 
of evidence.   In consequence all businessmen use encrypted vpn 
internally within companies, but not, however, in external 
communications, rendering a public key infrastructure quite 
useless.  For widespread tax evasion to take off, we would like 
widespread use of public keys.

Now the entire population is guilty of file trading.   Pretty 
soon, therefore, the entire population will be using 
encryption, but it is far from clear that this encryption will 
enable all the potential uses of encryption that cypherpunks 
foresaw.
