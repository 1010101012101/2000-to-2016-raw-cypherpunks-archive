Just google through the Tailwind debate.  The CNN supporters
said that the tape contained clear admissions of war crimes,
which of course it did.  I just quoted one such seemingly
clear, unambiguous admission of enormous war crimes at the
start of this thread.

The interviewees denied saying what the tape showed them to
be saying.  Then, under great pressure, CNN released the
transcript.

 The CNN opponents pointed out that the transcript of  the
 material that was edited into the tape did not contain these
 admissions.
