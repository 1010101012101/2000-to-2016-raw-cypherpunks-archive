I guess it's the same issue that I mentioned a couple days ago: it only
matters if it affects you. that's why multinational corporations or the
people representing them get a lot of wrath, and the solitary
millionaire without a corp behind him does not. micro$oft and billy boy
affect my life a lot more than the 1,000 millionaires living close
by(*), most of whom I don't even know about.


(*) I happen to live in Hamburg, which has germany's highest density of
millionaires.
