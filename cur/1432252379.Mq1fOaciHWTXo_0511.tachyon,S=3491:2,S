        Frenchman Probed for Web Site Applauding
        Attacks

        PARIS (Reuters) - A Frenchman who allegedly set up an internet
site applauding the
        deadly attacks on U.S. landmarks and urging Muslims to fight a
holy war is being
        investigated for encouraging suicide acts, judicial sources said
Thursday.

        Smain Bedrouni is under formal judicial investigation after
being accused of creating
        stcom.net, a U.S.-based Web site that calls for ``jihad.''

        Endorsing suicide attempts which aim to kill others is illegal
in France.

        The daily newspaper Le Figaro said the site was blocked earlier
this week by hackers
        but was soon accessible again to the public after it squeezed
space on the server of a
        U.S. company.

        France has been swift to clamp down on extremist or racist Web
sites. A French
        judge made headlines last year with a controversial ruling that
Yahoo! Inc. block
        French citizens' access to its U.S.-based auction site featuring
Nazi memorabilia.

        Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been on the lookout for
sites in their networks
        that incite violence since last week's terror attacks on the
United States in which
        6,000 people were killed or are missing.
