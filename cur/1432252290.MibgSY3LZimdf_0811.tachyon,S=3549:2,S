"Objection. The witness cannot attest to the "truth" of the article."

The cross-examiner may ask whether the witness _believes_ his article to 
be based on fact, but his opinion as to its truthfulness or not does not 
establish facts in a case.

A reporters _tape recorded notes_ or _contemporaneous notes_ are more 
probative, which is a major reason some important cases have involved 
courts ordering reporters to produce their notes and reporters then 
refusing.

Was Declan asked about the "truth" of the article? Did he testify with 
the words above?

(Yes, I tried to find this quote with Google. Either the transcript 
hasn't been released, hasn't been posted, hasn't been Google, or that 
phrase was not used...even "the article is true" as a phrasal fragment.)

Declan can tell us what he recalls of the proceedings. Has the 
transcript ever been released?

Regardless, you seem to have some personal vendetta against DM.
