>From http://www.ntk.net/ :

More cut-and-pasting from ukcrypto, Britain's last remaining form of
parliamentary oversight. This week: the government's plans to require
all security consultants to register with the authorities, and be
strictly licensed afore passing on their forbidden, arcane wisdom. First
the bad news: the bill in question, the PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY BILL,
is already at its Commons' Second Reading, and is set to be law in two
months (barring those pesky elections). Now, the good news: at the
reading, HO minister Charles "RIP" Clarke said it's mainly aimed at
security guards and bouncers, not IT security consultants. Now, the bad
news: he added the word "currently" - and, "currently", the Home Office
says it *does* apply to computer consultants, but they won't get around
to enforcing that until 2005. Now the good news: the main restriction on
the license is that you mustn't have a serious criminal record.
