If this foolishness is implemented I'm sure stamp exchanges will become 
routine at many public and private meetings.  Such exchanges could become a 
good business opportunity.

As others have mentioned, the Supreme Court has ruled that anonymous 
correspondence is supported under freedom of political speech.  The USPS is 
a quasi-governmental organization with exclusive legal rights to transport 
and deliver first-class mail to our mail boxes.  Exactly the kind of mail, 
which if anonymous could be protected speech.  It seems fair to me that if 
the USPS wanted to foreclose on our ability to use anonymous first-class 
mail then they should be willing to give up the exclusivity of their 
first-class mail franchise, so competitors who will offer this can deliver 
to postal mail boxes.
