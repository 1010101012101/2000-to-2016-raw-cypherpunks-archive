John:

Remember to apply Occam's razor occasionally. The WTC
towers were one of the best known landmarks around the 
world, were filled with people, stood well clear of the 
surrounding buildings, and symbolized the globalization/
Americanization of the world UBL hates.

The WTC towers were (from UBLs presumed viewpoint)
about the best US targets he could have picked, simply from
a PR, ideology, and practicality standpoint. The presence 
of a CIA office in a neighbouring building was not required 
to make the WTC towers target #1.

I used to work at 101 Barclay Street, across the street from
WTC #7. I watched it going up from my office window. I hated
the building - it blocked my view south. 101 Barclay seems to
have survived with little damage, possibly because WTC7 
shielded it from the falling debris of #1 & #2, and later #7
fell almost staight down.
