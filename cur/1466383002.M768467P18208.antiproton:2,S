As another, ironic example of spam, this just arrived in my inbox:

Notice there are many cheeky things going on, besides the fact that it was
sent to a non-existent email address (I have not included that line, not
wanting extra spam of course) which was my first giveaway.

Then there's the extra cheeky List-Unsubscribe email header (and it was in
a link in the bottom of the email too) - for all I know, this email could
be an initial part of a spam sequence - this first email is just
canvassing say 10 million email addys, to see who clicks on at least ONE
of the links in this sort-of-reasonable sounding email "oh, these guys
must have sent the email by mistake to me, looks like they handle spam,
I'll click the unsubscribe link so they don't mistakenly email me again".
Yeah right!!

But wait! this list-unsub link begins with a hash of some sort, not just
the (non-existent/ fake) email address to which this spam email was sent
to. Again, by itself not necessarily nefarious.

Next, the observant might notice the millisends on the date stamp, which
does not necessarily say this is spam, but adds to the picture.

Also, the name that this "letter" addresses begins with a lowercase, is
misspelt, clearly is addressing at best an email address and not a person,
and at best best, has been scoured since there is no family name.

The content, if legitimate, is definitely spam - "Spam Digest is a short
report sent via email to the administrator OR YOUR END USERS". Oh, it must
be ok, I'm just an end user, my administrator must really want me to view
this video.

And finally, it is spam - it's neither appropriate nor legitimate for a
spam filtering company to spam the users belonging to the administrator
who installs and manages such a product to protect his/her users from spam
- well, no administrator worth his salt anyway :)

And so on and so on...

May you have a lovely and spam minimized day :)


P.S. It's really a damn good thing I'm on our side of the fence and not
doing the low level dirty work of spam propagation - if I were me, I'd
really hate being on the receiving end of the cunning I'd dish out.
