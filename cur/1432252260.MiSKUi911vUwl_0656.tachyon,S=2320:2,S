Several civilians stood at a bus stop in the quiet center of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, which suddenly found itself at war with Russia. At the sight of a plane that appeared high up in the sky, people panicked and ran to seek shelter in 
a bus or in a nearby store; one man threw himself down on the ground and covered his head with his arms. The plane continued its way and soon disappeared.It was just a passenger jet.

In Tskhinvali, a town one hour's drive from Tbilisi, people can no longer use public transportation--or even walk in the streets. 
Their city was destroyed Friday after Georgian forces carried out a massive artillery attack. 

"Women and children were hiding in basements for a few days,It was enough just to hear this howl of shell rushing along. You feel like nothing in the world is more important than this sound," said Djemal, a vacationer in Tskhinvali. He has forbidden his 8-year-old daughter to approach the sea. "I will cover her with my body during bombing if she stays close to me. I won't be able 
to save her when she is swimming..."" 

We do not care who started the war, we are concerned about the facts... thousands are suffering because of the political propaganda shrouding the Russo Georgian conflict...
