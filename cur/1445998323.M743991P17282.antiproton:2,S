 Wednesday Hearing in NSA Spying Case

 EFF Battles Against Government Stalling in Jewel v. NSA

 Pasadena, CA - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will urge an
appeals court Wednesday to reject the government's attempts to block an
appeal in Jewel v. NSA, EFF's long-running lawsuit battling
unconstitutional mass surveillance of Internet and phone communications.
The hearing is set for 2:00 pm on October 28 before the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Pasadena, California.

 At issue in the appeal is the NSA's tapping into the fiber optic cables of
America's telecommunications companies--a digital dragnet that subjects
millions of ordinary people to government spying on their online
activities. A mountain of evidence from whistleblowers and the government
itself confirms the Internet backbone spying, yet a district court judge
ruled earlier this year that there wasn't enough publicly available
information to rule if the program is constitutional.

 EFF appealed to the Ninth Circuit, but the government claims that the
appeal is premature and entwined with other issues that are still being
litigated in the lower court. EFF Special Counsel Richard Wiebe will argue
Wednesday that the appeals court should reject the government's delay
tactics, and finally address whether backbone spying is legal and
constitutional.
