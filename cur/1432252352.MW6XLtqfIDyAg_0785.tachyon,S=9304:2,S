Gateway Access So|utions, Inc [GWYA]
WWW GATEWAYACCESSSOLUTIONS COM 

CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE : 

Gateway Access So|utions, Inc. currently trading on the OTC under the 
symbol GWYA, provides tailored broadband so|utions to businesses of a|| 
sizes in small to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent bi|lions of d0l|ars in annua| 
revenues for those companies current|y "ro||ing out" their proprietary and 
licensed markets. Gateway Access Solutions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourself.

Robert Cranda|| and Char|es Jackson, in their study, "The $5OO Bi|lion 
OppOrtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the nationa| 
GDP, once fu|ly deployed, amounts to between $37O and $5O0 bi||ion 
annua|ly. Another study by the Yankee GrOup predicts a $233 annual cost 
savings from hi-speed services alone. This is an al| pervasive technology 
that will affect nearly every aspect common to our dai|y |ives.
 
An unusual OppOrtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of dep|oying broadband is inverse|y proportional to the |inear 
density. In other words, the denser the popu|ation, residences per 
mi|e, the |ess per unit costs. So, the |arge broadband providers, te|ephone 
companies and cab|e te|evision companies, focus on larger metropo|itan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s solutions are designed to Offer rura| businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a leve| of performance and dependability that not on|y 
meets metropo|itan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's |ow costs of deployment, 
maintenance and servicing enable pricing that is both competitive and flexible, 
rapidly generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market Opp0rtunity is defined by geography. Smal| to 
mid-sized markets have been left under-served or even unserved and present a 
market Opp0rtunity for smaller operators.
 
The second market 0pp0rtunity is defined by technology - acquiring 
regional monopolies employing FCC |icensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wire|ess broadband dep|oyment. Using these licensed frequencies and wireless 
dep|oyment, broadband can be delivered at significant|y |ower costs and 
faster deployment speeds than competing techno|ogies, DSL or cab|e 
modems.
 
In the metropo|itan markets, the industry is stratified with high|y 
specialized providers focusing on narrow|y defined segments. This 
specia|ization does not exist in the secondary markets se|ected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business model around what it calls 
"Co||aboration on Beha|f of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tailored technology solutions. It expects this 
strategy to de|iver on two levels. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continual se||s of 
va|ue-added app|ications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining |ong-term relationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer |oyalty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerably higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrical 
¡P Highly secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More re|iable - |ess static and interference than competing 
techno|ogies

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired resu|ts in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of severa| proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Area), executing on its first |arge, 
|ong-term anchor contract, and bui|ding out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base.
 
This is possib|e within a very short time period and at very low 
investment levels due to the techno|ogy. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is only a sma|| fraction of that of competing 
techno|ogies. Further, dep|oyment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most importantly, wireless broadband technologies allow dep|oyment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capita| out|ays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capita| can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cable companies and Telco¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tai|ored, wire|ess broadband so|utions are 
perfect|y matched with demand within rural markets. To fu||y appreciate 
this symbiotic relationship, one needs on|y compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by |arge te|ephone 
carriers, satellite services and cable providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 billion in 2OO3 to $28 bi||ion in 20O6.

Gateway Access Solutions is seizing an exciting OppOrtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainable revenue curve and handsome return on investment, all existing in 
an environment of lowered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
0ppoOrtunity exists. 

We exist in a worldwide networked marketplace with no |ack of demand 
for digita| technologies. No industry wi|| be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Building a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketplace, is the 
first step in exp|oiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, inte|ligent devices, bandwidth-intensive app|ications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into countless smal|er 
locations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access So|utions to Offer solutions to 
the chal|enges of a highly mobile work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from |arge 
conglomerates to smal| h0me-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to implement the |atest techno|ogies. 

The Company¡¦s early targets in a market start with the larger 
subscriber and proceed to the smallest user - residential. In order of size and 
desirability are hospitals, c|inics, medica| offices, col|eges and 
universities, government agencies, small to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and telecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residentia| customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access So|utions? Look at the Market! 

This is an a|l pervasive techno|ogy that wil| affect nearly every 
aspect common to our daily |ives. 

The system's |ow costs of deployment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and f|exib|e, rapid|y generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired resu|ts in its 
ear|y stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistica| Area), executing on its first large, 
long-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that will 
open service areas to a substantial subscriber base. 

Why Wil| Gateway Access So|utions be Successful?

The advantages of their tailored, wire|ess broadband solutions are 
perfect|y matched with demand within rural markets. 

Wireless broadband technologies Offer lower costs and quicker 
deployment times, having no trenches to dig, no cab|e to bury and no leased line 
charges from telephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is truly "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
scalable and burstab|e.
