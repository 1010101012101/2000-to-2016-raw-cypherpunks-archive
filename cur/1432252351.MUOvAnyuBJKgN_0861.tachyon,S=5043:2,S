	Uh...  Clue alert!  It was the clueless teacher who brought the
charges and the prosecutor dropped them stating that the teacher could
have no expectation of privacy in a classroom of 30 students.  That neither
sounds like the government nor the prosecutors.  Just one dweeb of an
inDUHvidual teacher that was a few clues short of a load.  And a science
teacher, as that...  Shesh...  No, strike that...  I met my kid's physics
teacher.  Another fine example of those that can, do, and those that can't,
teach.  Took everything I could to restrain myself from embarassing the
hell out of her during a parent / student swap day.

	Me thinks you need to do a little more research before loading
and firing that keyboard.  Let me see that learners permit.
