Personal aside.  I've started working for a medical device company.
This is not so far from security programming, as checking your
inputs, robustness, and being able to justify time spent inspecting
and testing are all common to both domains.

But today I learned that a device that keeps you heart going, should
it forget how, has a field that rolls over in about 40+ days.  But hey,
euthanisia
is underappreciated.  Reboot that pacer!

"The servers are timed to shut down after 49.7 days of use in order to
prevent a data overload, a union official told the LA Times."
That would be 49.710269618055555555555555555556 days, or (curiously
enough) 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF) milliseconds.  Known problem with Win95
