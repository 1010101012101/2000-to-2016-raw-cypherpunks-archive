Just because you're German doesn't mean you can say 'tight glands'
without a snicker.  'Highly conductive gaskets' is perhaps less likely
to amuse the more adolescent among us.

Faustine, look up Faraday cages, TEMPEST, and search the archives.
As if you didn't know.  Succinctly, the electron gas in metals shields you
from the electromagnetic antics of distant, radiating electrons, by
shorting the
ripples in the aether they make -and this shielding makes it harder to listen
to your emissions, too.  The problem is that cables and ventilation vents
are antennae,
for sending and receiving both.

Testing is key.  If you don't measure, you don't know.
