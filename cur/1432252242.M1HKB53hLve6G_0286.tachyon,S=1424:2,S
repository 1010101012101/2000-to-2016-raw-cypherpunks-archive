WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI has banned its employees from taking any items
from crime scenes or evidence sites after Justice Department
investigators found that 13 agents took debris from the rubble of the
World Trade Center.
...
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a letter Thursday to FBI Director
Robert Mueller that there appears to be a double standard for agents
because private citizens have been prosecuted and given prison sentences
for taking items from the site.
