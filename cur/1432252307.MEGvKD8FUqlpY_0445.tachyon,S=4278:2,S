Of the 600+ being held without charges, bail, lawyers, etc., wanna bet 
that about 500+ of them will never be charged, never give any useful 
information? This was a "panic sweep," a "round up all the suspects" 
case, a shotgun blast of arresting anyone with any imagined, guessed, or 
coincidence in names connection with the likely attackers (and since 
many of those in the 4 planes were believed to be using stolen 
passports, even the coincidence in names is even more coincidental).

Anyway, as Declan says, this is being covered in newspaper stories. (No 
coverage that I've seen in a hundreds of hours of coverage on CNN, 
MSNBC, Fox, ABC, CBS, or NBC. None. Just vague mentions of "several 
hundred detainees.")

The issue is not "coddling the terrorists," the issue is the expansion 
over decades of police powers to the point where "speedy trial" and 
"jury of peers" and "due process" means nothing.

I expect King George would have loved to have these kinds of police 
powers: if Patrick Henry is causing troubles in the colonies, but no 
grounds for arresting him can be found, just arrest him and hold him 
indefinitely as a "material witness." And don't "coddle" him! That'll 
take care of the uppity colonists and their quaint talk about liberty.

And King George _really_ would have been thrilled to have the Nazi-like 
powers to put a hundred thousand persons of some ethnic background into 
concentration camps!
