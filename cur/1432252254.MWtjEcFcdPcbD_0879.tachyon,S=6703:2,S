A swell beginning, for email to be merely one way to
communicate, supplemented with unlimited other
ways which do not require email, or for that matter,
the Internet or any digital means.

Presume that digital means are the easiest to fuck with,
sorry, subvert, corrupt, pack with junk, surveil, harvest,
store, search, forge, track, make your own list on your
digital device and expect it to be violated accordingly
and used against you whether you know or not, usually
not. Here especially.

Now the other means, non-digital, ancient and amply
used and understood among those who use them
although susceptible to the digital vulnerabilites if
considerable more difficult:

Paper
Music
Sound
Dance
Architecture
Plastic arts
Graphic arts
Poetry
Drum
Glossalia
Jokes
Holler
Gypsy
Mime
Chant
Curse
Vulgarity
Sex
Sin

And much more everybody uses with greater facility
than digital emissions.

Note that conventional lanugages are not on the list
because of the heavy reliance upon them to communicate
and thus most heavily scutinized and attacked, usually
successfully.

Language is like metadata, with only its mastery the content
can be followed from end to end, then the ends burgled,
beat, cut, shot, persuaded to talk in plain language.

Steagonagraphy is not on the list unless it is non-digital,
and if not, then hiding communication has great potential.
Its weakness is finding a means, non-digital, for preparation
and transceiving.

For example, architecture is an ancient means of communication,
among its funders, designers, builders, maintainers, destructors,
restorers, investors, evaluators, burgler, surveyors, surveillors,
protectors, attackers, underminers, repairers, materials suppliers,
excavators, and a host of participants -- the list of guilds and unions
and professionals is vast -- perhaps one of the largest cohorts
of quasi-private aggregations on earth lagging only farmers
if taken to mean any form of human construction. I flatter
myself, so do yourself likewise.

Similarly, just about any specialty of human intercourse has
its quasi-private, esoteric, unique means of communication.
The human body specialists -- scientific, shamanistic, soulseeking --
along with its pschobabbling corollary, generates a fantastic
array of marketable, if not wholly, believable garble and
gibberish. Politics and law the most vivid at laying on the
self-serving shit about the necessity of government and
the rule of law(yers).

Now back to the simple task of communicating in private.
Before that, a side note, the end is near:

First do not expect anyone to believe anything using the
word "security." So comsec is dead due to abuse. Maybe
compriv is better, understanding that privacy has become
a crock of shit too.

"Shit bag" (thanks to Assange) Natsec needs to go as well
because it has been abused the most of all since assuming
the parmount importance of a secular religion prevailing
over all belief-systems with deadly weaponry, heartlessness,
amorality, criminality and unaccountability, motto: fuck with
it and you will die. Much evidence of motto in deed. And
much evidence it will be used against its insiders.

This is relevant to private communication. Natsec really
hates being cut out of any kind of communication. It
will use virtually unlimited means to get inside, most
of them kept secret and manifestly violent if needs
be.

So compriv should not be promoted as capable to
exclude natsec's prying, stealing, owning, using to
demolish with its opponents. OTR is futile, BTW,
as comsec.

Wind compriv down to comchat. Then wind comchat
down to comgossip, to comwhine, comjoke, comlie,
comlurk, comslur, com-social engineer. You get the
point. Do nothing life-threatening or natsec defying
by com-whatever. Communications is owned by
those who provide its means and they are owned
by extremely badass natsec ritualists willing to
barbecue your beloveds to share the goodness
carefully prescribed in their secret manuals of
unlimited warfare.

In conclusion, there you have it, com-bat, the most
reliable means of communication. Anything less is
com-ical.
