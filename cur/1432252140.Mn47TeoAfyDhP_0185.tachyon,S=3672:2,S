      So the native americans here before 1492 weren't free? They did, of
course, have private property -- whatever they could carry with them -- but the
land was held in common. The idea that individuals could "own" land was not
known to them.

   You're right, and it's really too bad the indigs here didn't realize soon
enough that they needed to kill each and everyone of those euros who landed here
and thought they could "own" land.

   People can smoke in public if they wear some sort of helmet which contains
all the smoke, otherwise they are using force to invade my body and I should
have the right to kill them for it.
