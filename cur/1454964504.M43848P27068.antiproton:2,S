Or do you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct =
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer your =
beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360 degree view =
with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some blind humans can =
use clicks to get a picture of their entire environment. (I use humans and =
not bats because I think bat sonar is pretty directional, whereas human ears =
can localize sound quite precisely without any need to turn one's head.)
