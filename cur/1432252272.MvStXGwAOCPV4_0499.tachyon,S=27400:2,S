How do they subpoena records from garden supply stores looking for people
who buy too many grow lamps or hydroponic setups? Do they just subpoena all
of these stores on a regular basis? What do they claim they are looking for
in the subpoenas? My understanding is that you pretty much have to know what
you are looking for and be fairly specific about it in the subpoena. If you
do not already know who is buying "too many" grow lamps or hydroponic
setups, how do you structure the subpoena? The only signed subpoenas that I
have seen that were grossly general and unsure of what was needed were
either A) Internet related (taking advantage of a seeming lack of knowledge
on the part of judges) or B) a case where the person who is being subpoena'd
is actually a victim of the crime being investigated. Do you have more
information on the garden supply store thing?

ok,
Rush Carskadden

Interesting - the article is a little confused on a few points - 
specifically, this is not the first time this has happened, the DEA 
subpoena'd records from a publisher of mushroom growing books back in the 
mid 90's. They also subpoena records from garden supply stores looking for 
people who buy too many grow lamps or hydroponic setups.

Also, it doesn't sound like they're talking about a search warrant - those 
aren't issued by DA's, nor do their targets have an opportunity to argue 
about what's searched prior to the search, because the searches take place 
without notice and at gunpoint. It sounds like they're talking about a 
subpoena, which does afford the recipient a chance to get an attorney and 
argue about it prior to releasing information.

Still, it's a good reminder that it can be dangerous to trust even good 
people with sensitive information - the good people may not willingly 
betray you, but they may be forced to divulge the information on pain of 
losing money, property, or their life, or it may simply be stolen by armed 
gangs.

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;Moriarty insists it was never her unit's intent =
to comb through reading</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;records of the general public. Rather, she said, =
Phillips' order will give</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;investigators &quot;an important piece of a =

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;Critics say one arrest is a high price to pay =
for allowing a war against</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&quot;Key principles of the right to privacy and =
freedom of speech have</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;ultimately been compromised in the =
decision,&quot; said Sue Armstrong,</FONT>

Liberties Union in Colorado.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;Judith Krug, director of the Office for =
Intellectual Freedom at the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;American Library Association, said she worries =
that drug investigators</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;unfairly are &quot;making the connection between =
what people read and what they</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;do.&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&quot;Just because you read a book on =
homosexuality, for example, doesn't mean</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;you're gay. And reading a book on the symptoms =
of cancer doesn't mean you</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;have the disease,&quot; Krug said.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&quot;Our concern is that what people read, what =
goes into their heads will no</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;longer remain private.&quot;</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;KEY QUESTIONS:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;Denver District Judge Stephen Phillips posed =
four key questions as part of</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;a legal balancing test in his ruling:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;1. Is there a legitimate and significant =
government interest in acquiring</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;the information?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;2. Is there a strong nexus between the matter =
being investigated and the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;material being sought?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;3. Is the information available from another =
source?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;4. Is the intrusion limited in scope so as to =
prevent exposure of other</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;constitutionally protected matters?</FONT>
