They are not a hoax, not at all.  However, contrary to the rumors
flying around, they are not at all related to the events of 9/11.  You
have to look someplace further away than Afghanistan to find the
source.  Hint: why do you think it is taking them so long to analyze
the DNA?  BECAUSE IT ISN'T FROM EARTH!  Do you think there is a
coincidence in the timing of the anthrax situation and the enormous
dust storm on Mars?  Do you think that maybe this dust storm, which
has been going on for three months, might be being used to CONCEAL
something which is going on on the surface of the planet?  Or do you
think these two incidents are just another "coincidence"?  Yeah, and
I've got a bridge I can sell you.
