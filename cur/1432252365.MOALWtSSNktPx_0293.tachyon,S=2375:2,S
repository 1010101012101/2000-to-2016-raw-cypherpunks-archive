Nothing forces you to tell anyone else that you booted securely.  At most
someone may offer to give you something in exchange for such a proof,
but you're not obligated to take them up on it.

It's not clear what you're getting at about exporting the host key.
These systems (TCs) are generally designed to make that difficult or
impossible to accomplish.  The security of the whole system is built on
that assumption.  If you actually did manage to pull out the host key
then you could make it attest to any falsehood you wanted, although you
might get caught eventually.

Trusted Computing lets people convincingly tell the truth about what
software they are running.  This is seen as a horrific threat in certain
circles.  It's easy to see why liars wouldn't like it.  What does an
honest man have to lose?
