When your torture and mass deportation policies inspire resistance then 
reprisals for assasinations are inevitable.

Back to the Fighting
Nancy Wake, then 31, became one of 39 women and 430 men in the French 
Section of the British Special Operations Executive which worked with local 
resistance groups to sabotage the Germans in the occupied territories. She 
was trained at a British Ministry of Defense camp in Scotland in survival 
skills, silent killing, codes and radio operation, night parachuting, 
plastic explosives, Sten guns, rifles, pistols and grenades. She and the 
other women recruited by the SOE were officially assigned to the First Aid 
Nursing Yeomantry and the true nature of their work remained a closely 
guarded secret until after the war.
In February 1944, Nancy Wake and another SOE operative, Major John Farmer, 
were parachuted into the Auvergne region in central France with orders to 
locate and organise the bands of Maquis, establish ammunition and arms 
caches from the nightly parachute drops, and arrange wireless communication 
with England. Their mission was to organise the Resistance in preparation 
for the D-Day invasion. The Resistance movement's principal objective was 
to weaken the German army for a major attack by allied troops. Their 
targets were German installations, convoys and troops.


There were 22,000 German troops in the area and initially 3-4,000 Maquis. 
Gaspards recruitment work, with the help of Wake, bolstered the numbers to 
7,000. Nancy led these men in guerrilla warfare, inflicting severe damage 
on German troops and facilities. She collected and distributed weapons and 
ensured that her radio operatives maintained contact with the SOE in Britain.


On one occasion Nancy cycled 500 km through several German checkpoints to 
replace codes her wireless operator had been forced to destroy in a German 
raid. Without these there would be no fresh orders or drops of weapons and 
supplies. Of all the amazing things she did during the war, Nancy believes 
this marathon ride was the most useful. She covered the distance in 71 
hours, cycling through countryside and mountains almost non-stop. Her focus 
was rock steady to the end of her epic journey, when she wept in pain and 
relief.



   "I got back and they said, "how are you?" I cried. I couldn't stand up, 
I couldn't sit down. I couldn't do anything. I just cried."


  Pitched Battle
It was an extremely tough assignment: a near-sleepless life on the move, 
often hiding in the forests, travelling from group to group to train 
Maquis, motivate, plan and co-ordinate. She organised parachute drops that 
occurred four times a week to replenish arms and ammunition. There were 
numerous violent engagements with the Germans. The countryside was wracked 
with hostage taking, executions, burnings and reprisals.
No sector gave the Reich more cause for fury than Nancys - the Auvergne, 
the Fortress of France. Methodically the SS laid its plans and prepared to 
obliterate the group, whose stronghold was the plateau above 
Chaudes-Aiguwes. Troops were massed in towns all around the plateau, with 
artillery, mortars, aircraft and mobile guns. In June 1944 22,000 SS troops 
made their move on the 7,000 Maquis. Through bitter battle and escape, 
Nancy and her army had cause to be satisfied: 1,400 German troops lay dead 
on the plateau, 100 of their own men.


Nancy continued her war: she personally led a raid on Gestapo headquarters 
in Montucon, and killed a sentry with her bare hands to keep him from 
alerting the guard during a raid on a German gun factory. She had to shoot 
her way out roadblocks; and execute a German female spy.
