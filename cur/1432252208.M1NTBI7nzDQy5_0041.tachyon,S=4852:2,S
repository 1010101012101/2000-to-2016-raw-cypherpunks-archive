   True, well, almost -- there was a lot of resistence and various areas delayed
until well into the 60's-70's. And some perhaps never did. At any rate, I don't
think I was ever exposed to fluoride until an adult.

    Aluminum pans are a serious no-no, regardless whether they defintely cause
alzhimers or not. Once I tried the "take a dark, well-oxidized cooking pan, cook
some tomatoes in it" test, I never cooked with Al again. Just read about the new
findings of good old teflon migration. Freaky.

   Well, yes, I'm sure the inordinate amounts of sugar has an serious
effect. Not to mention all the other weird little additives in candy and pop
that humans never evolved with.

    Yup, for sure. I like kids but I'd never want to teach K-12 these days, most
kids seem to have no discipline whatsoever, and I don't have that much patience.

   Well, that's sort of what I was getting at. ADHD becomes the norm and the
normal kid becomes the weirdo. I remember getting so involved in reading that
I'd sometimes not hear the bell and still be sitting there when the class got up
and left. Nowadays that sort of behavior would likely get you a visit to the
principals office and a piss test.
