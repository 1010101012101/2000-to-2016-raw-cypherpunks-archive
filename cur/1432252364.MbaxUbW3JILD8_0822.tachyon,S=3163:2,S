Like most good publications, Reason gives columnists wide latitude
Cathy Young has written some excellent articles in certain areas in
the past. Now she's branching out to anti-terror responses, which
shows that she's not a libertarian across the board.

Reason asked me to write a piece for them on civil lib after 9-11,
which I finished last night, so the editors seem to want a variety of
voices.
