   Probably because of all the heretofore unheard of things happening to
people in the courts these days. My attorneys recently spent some time
explaining to me about the new trend in Wisconsin courts and police. It seems
that if they are "investigating" a crime, and you become "uncooperative" in
any way -- not meaning you have to incriminate yourself, just "uncooperative"
-- they charge you with obstructing an officer, a class C felony. And it
generally sticks. Apparently no one thus far has taken it into fed court, or
at least been successful in getting it overturned, and it's become a real
threat.
    Interesting times we live in.
