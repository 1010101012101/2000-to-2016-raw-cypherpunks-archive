#    Stock trading account hacker gets three years
#
#    RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) - A man who illegally accessed other
#    people's online stock trading accounts has been sentenced to
#    more than three years in federal prison.
#
#    The Secret Service estimated that Babatunde Osiname, 36, and
#    a 29-year-old Texas woman stole the identities of more than 100
#    U.S.-based employees of Swedish telecommunications giant
#    Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson and other companies. They were
#    accused of draining about $1.9 million from stock and credit
#    card accounts.
#
#    A U.S. District judge on Monday sentenced Osiname to 37 months
#    in prison and ordered him to pay more than $1.1 million in
#    restitution.
#
#    Osiname pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud and wire fraud.
#    He admitted accessing accounts managed by ETrade Group using
#    Social Security numbers and home addresses provided by Jeanette
#    L. Franklin, of Richardson, Texas, who once worked in an Ericsson
#    payroll office.
#
#    Franklin has been found guilty of 16 counts of mail and wire
#    fraud. She faces a maximum of 80 years in prison when she is
#    sentenced July 9.
