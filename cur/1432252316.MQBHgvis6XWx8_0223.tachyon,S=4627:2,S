Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This |etter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park wil| supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

About the EC Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimu|ate the
development of renewable energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
relevant po|icies, strategies and plans. To fulfi|l the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
