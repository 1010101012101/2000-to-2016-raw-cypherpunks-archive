I suggest we grab a table in the lowest level Cellar bar.  These can not
be reserved.


Pete Chown on IPsec: Pervasive Encryption for the Internet?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the first part I will explain what IPsec is and how it is supposed
to work.  I will explain the three protocols which provide security,
and explain the relationships with other technologies such as DNSsec.

I will then explain how to set up FreeS/WAN under Linux.  I will
explain how to patch your kernel and how to make the FreeS/WAN patch
co-exist with the international kernel patch.  Finally I will explain
how to configure and start FreeS/WAN so as to communicate securely
with another machine.

In the final part I will talk about issues with IPsec, such as
interactions with firewalls, and how IPsec could be used to provide
all-pervasive encryption on the Internet.  I am hoping that this part
of the talk will become more of an "open forum" where ideas can be put
forward; there are real issues here and I don't claim to have all the
answers.
