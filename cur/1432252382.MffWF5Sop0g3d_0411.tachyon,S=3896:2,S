I just responded to a post by him where he took that extreme position -- you probably read that response just before this response.

You, and Black Unicorn, have taken that extreme position.  You were full of shit.

You are now backing away from it, denying that you said what you so plainly said, demonstrating that you now realize you were full of shit, demonstrating you do not know shit from beans in that area of the law.

Here is a fragment from the post that I just responded to:

So Harmon Seaver says routine document destruction in the ordinary course of business is quite safe.  Black Unicorn confidently, and quite untruthfully, claims the material he cited shows it to be unsafe.
