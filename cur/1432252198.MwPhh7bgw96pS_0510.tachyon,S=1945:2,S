Are you kidding? One advantage to living in NYC (and traveling on the 
subways) is that you get one tough thug of an immune system going...it would 
stand there pointing and laughing at the scary H5N1...if someone's sick 
anywhere in the world we pretty much get it here if the vectors can survive 
the plane flight. During flu season it would show up as a medium-sized blip 
in emergency room statistics but that's it.
