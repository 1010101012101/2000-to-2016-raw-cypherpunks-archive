 VIN SUPRYNOWICZ: You can't hide your lying eyes



I see where the people of Haiti finally got sick of defrocked collectivist
priest and all-around "necklace" killer Jean-Bertrand Aristide, took up
arms, and kicked him out.

 So what are U.S. forces doing there now? About 1,800 of our guys have been
sent in to -- in the words of Associated Press reporter Paisley Dodds --
"rid the nation of guns."

 Hey, good plan. In the great tradition of George Washington, Francis
Marion, and young Jim Monroe, the Haitian people just used firearms to
throw out a vicious tyrant, and the immediate goal of Big White Brother is
to "rebuild a shattered police force and disarm militants who began the
insurgency."

 At least back in 1994, when the freedom-loving Bill Clinton sent in 20,000
troops to install Aristide the murderous dictator, U.S. troops offered to
buy these weapons of freedom in order to better enslave the natives. This
time (Mr. Dodds reports) "Haitians ... are being asked to give up their
guns with little or no incentive and in a very insecure environment."

 The only good news? U.S. forces, Mr. Dodds reports, have so far "recovered
two shotguns. Their Chilean counterparts have confiscated three weapons."

 Washington City has no constitutional authorization whatever to spend our
tax dollars sending troops into Haiti to disarm "uppity Negroes" who dared
fight to win their own freedom. And also for the record, there were no
organized police departments in this country until the 1850s.

 That's right: From 1776 until at least 1850 America was a nation of "armed
insurgent militants" with no government police. And we got along just fine.

 How do you think the people of the proud, young, free United States of
America would have reacted if some foreign army had arrived here in 1783
with the declared the goal of "ridding the nation of the guns" that had
just been used to win America's freedom?

 Why does our Second Amendment say a well-armed citizen militia is
necessary? That's right, it's "necessary to the security of a free state."

 After all, as early as 1785, our own Southern states were passing laws
that "No slaves shall keep any arms whatever, nor pass, unless with written
orders from his master or employer, or in his company, with arms from one
place to another."

 Whereas, in his proposed constitution for the state of Virginia, Thomas
Jefferson wrote: "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The
strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep and bear arms
is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government."

 Notice the definitive difference there between "free men" and "slaves"?

 In 1788, debating the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, a great
patriot and friend of Washington named George Mason stood in Richmond and
recalled: "When the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great
Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was
Governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and
most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should do it not openly,
but weaken them, and let them sink gradually. ... I ask, who are the
Militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public
officers." And it was no less a freedom-fighter than Mohandas Gandhi who
said, in 1927: "Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India,
history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of its arms as
the blackest."

 And this conspiracy to attack and remove the very tools of freedom is not
isolated. There isn't even any Second Amendment in the new Iraqi
constitution, according to World Net Daily.

 In a March 10 piece bearing the sub-headline "Colin Powell hails
prohibition on arms while emphasizing 'liberty,' " WND correspondent Ron
Strom writes: "Iraq's new interim constitution sounds many of the same
themes as the U.S. Constitution in guaranteeing freedom of the people --
with one stark difference: There is no right to keep and bear arms in the
new charter."

 The document does indeed promise a whole bunch of freedoms. (So did the
Soviet Constitution.) But when it comes to civilian ownership of
military-style arms -- which our founding fathers warned us was the last
and only real safeguard of the rest of our liberties?

 The only reference to individual ownership of arms is in Article 17: "It
shall not be permitted to possess, bear, buy, or sell arms except on
licensure issued in accordance with the law."

 And Article 27 further addresses the formation of militias: "Armed forces
and militias not under the command structure of the Iraqi Transitional
Government are prohibited, except as provided by federal law."

 America's leading gun-rights organization quickly registered strong
opposition to this nonsense.

 "It's a very big mistake," said Erich Pratt, director of communications
for Gun Owners of America. "What an interesting contrast to what our
Founding Fathers thought."

 Not that any of this should come as a surprise. Aaron Zelman's
Milwaukee-based Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership recently
noticed our own federal naturalization folks now require incoming citizens
to study a booklet which claims our Second Amendment guarantees the right
to bear arms "subject to certain reasonable restrictions." When JPFO
contacted our duplicitous federal masters to ask where in our founding
documents they found this "subject to certain reasonable restrictions"
language ... they received no answer.
