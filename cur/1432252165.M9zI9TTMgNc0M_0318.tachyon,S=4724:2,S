Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20O0 with a view to become

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented technology relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a large gr0up of pheno|ic secondary 
metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,0OO different known 
chemica|s. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modu|ate the 
permeability of the wa|ls of the b|ood vesse|s including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2OO4-2005 are more then  $10O mil|i0n USD

Further developments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
