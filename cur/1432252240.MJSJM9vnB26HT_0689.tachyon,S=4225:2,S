No, I'm not going to let you argue the general by picking a specific that
fist your argument.

You can't shoot at aircraft of any kind at any time, even model ones.

No, you can't shoot at aircraft of any kind at any time that aren't yours.
Call the FAA on this one. If you're on your property and the air vehicle
is something like higher than 500ft you can't shoot it then either it's
no longer in 'private airspace' (look into the license free experimental
aircraft for the flight ceiling, it's been years since I did anything
like this.). I do experimental rocketry and one of the projects I wanted
to work on was a 'rocket wars' where two rockets tracked each other. When
I contacted the FAA they said they would not issue a waiver irrespective
of insurance issues.

A bird <> aircraft.

I'm quiting here 'cause you only get sillier.
