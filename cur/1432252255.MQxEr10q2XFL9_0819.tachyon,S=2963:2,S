More importantly, if there is any way for you to track digital money, 
then whether you _claim_ to be "not recording" or not is irrelevant.

Without blinding (or similar), a system is just another "trust me" 
system.

And "trust me" systems are not interesting.

Not meaning to sound too harsh, but you need to think deeply about what 
cryptography is all about and why "trust me, I promise not to look" 
systems are not desirable or interesting.

(The cipher equivalent of your "because my sacred code did not in fact 
record any IP-based transmission logs" is just the usual central key 
server example: "Digital Datawhack generates keys for its customers but 
does not in fact record them." Yeah, right.)
