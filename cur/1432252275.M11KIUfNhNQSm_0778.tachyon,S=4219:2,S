The "cops" won't be driving remailer operators in various U.S. states 
"out of business." Even in these sad times where democrat expediency 
seems to be winning out over constitutional rights, this battle will 
have to be fought in the courts, probably all the way to the Supreme 
Court. And we know that virtually no readings of the First Amendment 
give local courts the say over what people can mail to each other, 
outside of certain types of porn and suchlike.

This has been discussed many times here. Do you have some new 
insights, or are you just now discovering the notion that government 
may try to apply pressure on what people mail to each other?

Handwaving. The First Amendment will not likely be abandoned because 
some Marxists in France concluded that there should be limitations on 
what people mail to other people.
