The Sun Sentinel reports it being attacked with heavy Iraqi
casualties within hours of Baghdad Bob's making the claims that
Robert Fisk endorsed,and falling later that night.

Fisk tells us that the Iraqi minister was right and the 
Americans were wrong, that the Americans had been caught lying 
again

The Sun Sentinal reports that the Iraqi minister (Baghdad Bob) 
was wrong, the Americans were right, and the Baghdad Bob was 
caught lying.

You are splitting legalistic hairs.   If Fisk is telling the 
truth, the Sun Sentinel is lying.  If the Sun Sentinel is 
telling the truth, Fisk is lying,  Subsequent events give us 
good cause to believe the Sun Sentinel was telling the truth, 
and that Baghdad Bob was lying extravagantly and ridiculously.

And if Baghdad Bob was lying, which today everyone, including 
Fisk, agrees, then Fisk was lying, for Fisk told us that the 
Iraqi minister was right and the Americans were wrong, that the 
Americans had been caught lying.

Fisk wrote in his report:
	"Had the Americans found themselves miles away on the 
	edge of the old RAF airbase at Habbaniyeh, one 
	wondered, and confused it with the airport outside 
	Baghdad? Had they sent a patrol up to the far side of 
	the Saddam airport for a few minutes, just to say 
	they'd been there? Back in 1941, a German patrol 
	briefly captured the last tram-stop on the line west of 
	Moscow, collecting the discarded passenger tickets as 
	souvenirs - and then got no farther.
