            "Someone explain to me so I can understand. How is it that
            Russia is<br>
            somehow negligent in influencing pro-Russian separatists in
            east<br>
            Ukraine, when the Kiev junta’s forces are the ones shelling
            civilians<br>
            daily? Does Germany’s Angela Merkel see something the world
            cannot? God<br>
            only knows."<br>

            We, the collective "West" are an absolute disgrace on this
            planet!!!!!<br>
            <br>
            So YES if I were the USA president I would do better! The
            only real<br>
            challenge is doing better as USA president, and stopping
            yourself from<br>
            being killed for cleaning up the endless shit that is North
            American<br>
            foreign policy!<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            "The West", an absolute disgrace to humanity..<br>
