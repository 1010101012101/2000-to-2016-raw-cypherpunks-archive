It's a fact that there is a much larger developer community for the Palm
than
for the Ipaq, however, I suspect that this is a temporary phenomenon. MS
is giving away it's development environment for free, and as pointed out, 
there is are several Linux ports. The higher cost of PocketPC devices can
be balanced against their higher power.

Let's remember that for a specific app, we don't actually *need* more than
one programmer.

I could care less if I have to program under WINCE or Linux; some
OSs require a bit more learning before I'm productive, but any 
programmer who can't pick up another environment quickly isn't 
worth his salt.

Doing it under WINCE (or both Linux and WINCE) has the 
advantage that the app develops a user base much more
quickly.

As for hardware limitations; I havent verified this independently,
but this is from the Stanford project cited earlier:

> 	"An investigation of the audio capture and playback capabilities 
of the Compaq iPAQ revealed that the speaker and microphone on the 
PDA are the same hardware device, and cannot both be in use at the 
same time. As a result, the system had to be engineered such that only 
one of audio playback and audio capture happens at any one time."
