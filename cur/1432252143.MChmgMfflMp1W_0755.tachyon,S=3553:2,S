<<In Virginia, officials said last night that they were monitoring a
possible case of anthrax in a Northern Virginia man whose job may have
brought him into contact with the company where the other two men
worked.

State and local officials said the Prince William County man entered the
emergency room of Prince William Hospital in Manassas yesterday
complaining of flu-like symptoms. Medical personnel on the scene
responded quickly by performing tests to determine whether he had
anthrax, meningitis or another disease, officials said.

Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also on
the scene and monitored the preliminary investigation. A germ culture
from the man was transported last night by a State Police trooper from
Prince William County to a state government laboratory in Richmond,
officials said.

"The state government was notified and we are following our established
procedures," said M. Boyd Marcus Jr., chief of staff for Virginia Gov.
James S. Gilmore III (R). "We cannot confirm at this point whether he
has developed anthrax or not.">>
