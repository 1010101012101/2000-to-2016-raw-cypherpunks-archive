Well, here's where my ignroance is revealed.

But let me recall the 'threat scenario' in this case.

MwGs don't like Tor networks, and set about trying to find the nodes, and 
take them down. How do they do this? They can, perhaps, look at the IP 
addressses of packets they themselves shoot through the network, and then 
(theoretically) trace these back to the machines that sent the packets, 
presumably a tor node. Or at least, they can do this  for an exit node(s).

After finding an exit node, they can then contact the operator to locate the 
server and Tor node, and bludgeon them in totaking it down. The operator 
prrobably won't be surprised, because they will have installed the Tor node, 
which presumably has all sorts of files named, TOR.EXE, TOR_CLIENT.DLL, and 
so on. The only other way to tell they are running a Tor node is to see the 
other IP addresses coming in and going out, which presumably are other Tor 
nodes.

Is that basically right?

What if, for instance, a Tor client sent out a whole buttload of IPs, some 
of which are Tor nodes, some of which aren't, in various cities (including, 
say Fallujah). Let's say also that the Tor package sent to an actual Tor 
node operator was disguised to look like some other innocuous service. Let's 
say also that there are plenty of fake non-Tor packets coming in and out of 
that node which don't lead to any Tor nodes at at all.

In the case, the local authorities would have to have some kind of subpeona 
(one would think) 'proving' to the operator that they indeed have a hated 
Tor node on one of their machines. They would also have to do this for a 
variety of nodes, perhaps, even ones that aren't actually Tor nodes.

OK, farfetched. But possible? I'm a telecom guy so what the hell do I 
know...
