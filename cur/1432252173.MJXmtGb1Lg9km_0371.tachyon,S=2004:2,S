Most likely no. From the context of the circuit order it seemed pretty clear 
that this was all active traffic. These were the fibers that were opticall 
tapped. Also, BLSRs (Bidirectional Line Switched Rings) support "extra 
traffic" that gets bumped during a protection switching event, so the 
protect bandwdith wouldn't even be idle (though the routers would probably 
throttle down when they sensed less bandwidth).

Interestingly, though, from your chart above it looks like they probably 
have a router and an OC-192.The odds of all of these pipes being full of 
packets at the same time is probably very small, so maybe they can indeed 
grab everything.
