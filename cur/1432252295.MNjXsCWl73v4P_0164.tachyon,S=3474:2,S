I disagree.

"the government" is a term for more than the people, even for more than
the people making up "the government". lumb them all into a football
stadium and you don't have a government - just a bunch of people.

there's an organizational structure that makes up "the government", and
in most western countries it's stronger than the people - you can
basically exchange them all without too much of a change to "the
government" (as proven after every election). but change the structure
while retaining the people and you end up with something completely
different (e.g. germany's transition from the weimar republic to the
third reich).

in that sense "let's get rid of the government" *can* be interpreted as
"let's tear down these structures". it not always *is* meant that way,
but it *can*. and of course the opinions about what to replace it with
differ a lot. but most of those who are anti-government don't so much
say "let's kill president X or minister Y" as rather "the voting system
is crap" or "government is bought by the big corporations" or "there
should be no authority at all" or something to that effect, which is
definitely a *structural* as opposed to a *personal* complaint.
