A word of caution: I have run both a high throughput remailer, and a 
low-bandwidth (3mb) TOR exit node, both in the early through mid aughts. 
If you are serious, you need to get you legal house in order, as you will 
be spending a fair bit of your time with the feebies.  Make sure you have 
an attorney who reallyunderstands what you are doing, and make sure s/he's 
got a hefty retainer ($5,000.00 seemed to be about right). Also, and most 
importantly, make sure this legal beagle is willing to both give you their 
direct cellphone/pager #, but that they are willing to actually drop 
everything and go get your ass out of the pokey at 03:00! And yes, 
03:00-06:00 really is the favorite "raid time" for a certain testosterone 
addled federal police agency.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying don't do it: I think *everyone* should, 
at least for a years or so, for a variety of technical, political, and 
other reasons.  But you *cannot* go in unprepared!
