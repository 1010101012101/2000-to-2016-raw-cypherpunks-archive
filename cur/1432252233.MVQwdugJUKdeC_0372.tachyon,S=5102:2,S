Americans and their Drivers Licenses.  There's something funny about
them.

"States Devising Plan for High-Tech National Identification Cards

By Robert O'Harrow Jr.
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, November 3, 2001; Page A10

State motor vehicle authorities are working on a plan to create a
national identification system for individuals that would link all
driver databases and employ high-tech cards with a fingerprint, computer
chip or other unique identifier."

"4th Arrest in Probe of Hijacker ID Fraud Man Accused of Helping
Suspects in Sept. 11 Terror Attacks Exploit Va. Loophole

By Patricia Davis and Brooke A. Masters
Washington Post Staff Writers
Friday, October 26, 2001; Page B09

A fourth person was arrested and charged yesterday with helping the
Sept. 11 hijackers illegally obtain Virginia identification cards less
than five weeks before the terrorist attacks.

**************

Both civilians and officials seem to think that there is some magic
about a drivers license that would make it a good national ID and
requires that it be protected from misuse by unauthorized persons.

Apparently unknown to these worthies is the fact that terrorists,
criminals, or just plain folks can do anything they want to do without a
drivers license issued by a US state.

As surprising as it may seem, one can drive, rent cars, fly domestically
or internationally, get a job, start a business, rent accomodations,
open bank accounts, and do anything you like without a US drivers
license.

Holders of foreign drivers licenses can drive in the US.

Among the four million US expats are many native born US citizens who
have an absolute right to enter, live, and work in the US but who do not
*currently* even have a right to obtain a US drivers license since they
are not *resident* in the US.  Any US citizens who care to can
characterize themselves as being in this group.

A drivers license issued by a US state is no more than evidence of
identity.  It is not evidence of right to reside in the US, right to
work in the US, etc.  One must use other documents to establish right to
reside and right to work (if those documents are required).  One can use
other documents to establish identity.  Including most significantly a
passport (whether foreign or domestic).

With 300 million US border crossings by aliens annually, it is clear
that plenty of aliens are travelling around the country almost none of
whom have drivers liccenses issued by a US state.

I hope that a "new, improved, drivers license" takes some of the heat
off the National ID concept.
