What was that old saw that went "Well, you're equipped to be a whore, but
you're not?" again?  how about banning chainsaws, they can kill or main
people too and yes, cars, and trains, and airplanes, plastic shopping bags
without holes, belts, rope, wire, electricity, etc. they can all be used
to kill.  all of which is unlawful.

Um, remind me again, when exactly is it lawful to exploit children?  Oh, 
wait, that's right!  When they're in other countries, then, you can make 
them work in sweatshops producing Nike's, Levi's, GAP, etc. products... 
oh, sorry, I forgot.

so how soon before we ban paper and pencil? or keyboards, hands - 
because they can hold pencils or type, and eyeballs and ears, because they 
can see video and hear music?
