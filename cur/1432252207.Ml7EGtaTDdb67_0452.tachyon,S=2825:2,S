There are none.  Blowfish has a very large key setup time, so unless you
cache its internal state, its a poor choice for *certain* apps ---those
where you need to switch contexts frequently.  But it
is very strong, because of that key schedule, and its structure.
Twofish has a much faster key setup.

I can't imagine what PKZ what talking about otherwise, and what you've quoted
is intriguing for that reason.
