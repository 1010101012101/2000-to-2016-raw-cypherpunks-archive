PRESENTATIONS

Robert Leen -- Defense Counsel for James Dalton Bell

Mr. Leen served as the court-appointed defense attorney in the recent 
federal trial of Jim Bell, who was charged in the most recent case 
with harassment of federal agents.  Jim was a former subscriber and 
occasional contributor to the main cypherpunks list and was somewhat 
known in libertarian circles in southern Washington State.

It's well known that the way that the federal courts are set up is 
biased toward prosecutors, but Robert Leen faced considerably higher 
barriers than normal in his defense of Jim Bell.  This case gave a 
glimpse of what happens when cypherpunk philosophies come in contact 
with government, and has several enlightening lessons in 
prosecutorial tactics.

Robert Leen will discuss the case in general and then will address 
specific questions from the audience.


DIRECTIONS

The Bellevue Library is immediately north of downtown Bellevue.  Take 
the "8th St N" exit from 405 and head toward downtown.  Turn right at 
110th Ave.  After approximately 3 blocks, look for the Bellevue 
Public Library on the left.
