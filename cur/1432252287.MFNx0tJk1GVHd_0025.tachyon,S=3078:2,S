That's pseudonymity, not anonymity.

This is just plain not true.  When operating under a pseudonym,
you are making linkable acts - linkable to each other even if
not necessarily linkable to your own official identity.  Anonymous
actions or communications are those which cannot be linked to any
other no matter how hard someone tries.

We can expect the public to fail to grasp the distinction, but
on this list "anonymous" is a very strong claim.  Anonymity is
*HARD* to do, not something that results from failing to check
a credential.
