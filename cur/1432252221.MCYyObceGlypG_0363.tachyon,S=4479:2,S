Well, it's interesting to consider how coordinated the Feds are these days.
Someone I know recently went to a one-day Passport processing center, where 
you can take your documentation in the morning, pay a lot of extra $, and 
get the passport in the evening. You can even do this across state lines. So 
I'd suggest gathering up the documentation and taking a trip to a busy 
similar center across state lines and see if they can get a passport.

It should be noted that this behavior may not be the result of hyper-fascist 
feds, but incompetant ones: There's a apparently a huge backlog of 
applications because of the new laws requiring a passport to 
travel...everywhere outside the US, so they may be looking to push off as 
much as they can. (I hear stories of the break rooms and hallways being 
stacked floor-to-ceiling with applications). As for the lost documentation, 
it's possible it's actually lost...
