It is easy to be a central source for randomness. The problem is that, =
for crypto, you want secret and private randomness.=20
Whether it is reasonable to use randomness from an outside source to =
supplement the entropy on your own system depends on your threat model.

If you absolutely require true randomness, and you are entropy =
constrained on the local device, and you are not concerned about =
compromise of the entropy server or the path between you and that =
server, then this might make sense.=20

Lots of "ifs".
