You're right, for a crypto currency to be credible in the long term,
it needs to be convertible into Real Money(tm), i.e., something you
can use to pay your taxes.  (That's the actual working definition of
money, by the way.)

But that really has nothing to do with the crypto part.  You can have
crypto out the wazoo, and it's worth nothing unless there's an issuer
in meatspace who will accept your crypto coins, cancel them, and hand
you the agreed amount of money.  Or think about the ETF model I
suggested a few years ago, which provides a close approximation to
convertibility without requiring that the issuer be able to redeem
every individual coin on demand.

PS: For anyone who wants a crypto currency backed by gold, that's
functionally equivalent to a gold ETF, of which there are several,
such as ticker symbols IAU, GLD, GTU, SGOL, and AGOL.  They do what
they do perfectly adequately, but they are in no sense currency.
Bubble sceptics can trade put options on them.  Too bad there's no
options on bitcoins.
