Thanks.  Are there authoring constraints as well ?  There is some cost 
involved in authoring a blu-ray disc, but they're not astronomical.

Presumably there is some kind of mechanism to stop someone from authoring 
and releasing a copy-protected disc with 10 minutes each of black, white, 
and all the primary colors ?   :)
