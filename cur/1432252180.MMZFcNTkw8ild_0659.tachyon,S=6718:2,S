The UK Times is reporting that the web site for a UK-based firm offering
"jihad training programs" has been shut down, unclear by whom.

Through the site, the company promoted its "Ultimate Jihad
Challenge" workshops which included the how-to's of "bone breaking,"
"foreign firearm instruction," -- and gun-training sessions in the
United States at a live firing range.

The course outline ends on this note: "SUCESSFUL
STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE THE SAKINA INSRUCTORS CERTIFICATE AND OATH
OF LOYALTY TO THE UMMAH OF ALLAH DIVINE RELIGION OF SUBMISSION."

I found a Google cache of Sakina's site, and have included the
URL below with a text cut-and-paste from the cache. --XJ

 "Holy Wars" website is shut down

A British website which offered young Muslims the chance to train for
holy wars abroad has been removed from the internet. The website of
London-based firm Sakina Security Ltd is no longer available, Internet
service provider Freeserve confirmed. The site had offered the "ultimate
Jihad challenge" in which clients were taken to a live firing range in
the United States for weapons training where they shoot up to 3,000
rounds each. It also offered training in hand-to-hand combat, including
"the art of bone breaking" and how to "improvise explosive devices" in
live operations. The website, which had more than 15,000 visitors, also
asked people to donate money to a fund for the "liberation" of the
Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. They were asked to give money to a
London-based account of the Woolwich bank. It also carried a link to a
"Jihad in Chechnya" site which showed the bodies of dead Russian
soldiers. It was not clear who instigated the shutdown of the website,
but police have been aware of Sakina's activities for at least 18
months. Hendon MP Andrew Dismore asked a question about the firm in
Parliament in May last year and was told by then Home Secretary Jack
Straw that police were already aware of the company and were looking
into it.
