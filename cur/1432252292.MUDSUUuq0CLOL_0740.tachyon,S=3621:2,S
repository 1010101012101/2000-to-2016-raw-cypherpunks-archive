Although my bet wasn't with Lucky (proving that he is indeed Lucky) 
it does appear that the book is in print and for my wager to be 
successful it must be orderable and shippable by Amazon or other 
on-line bookstore within a week after Jan. 1, 2002.  So methinks my 
wager was a good one, unless Lucky wishes to wager it otherwise?
