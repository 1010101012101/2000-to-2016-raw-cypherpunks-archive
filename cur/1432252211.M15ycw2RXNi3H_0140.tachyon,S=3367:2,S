Actually there are many papers over the last several years (e.g., at
ACM CCS and Info Hiding) showing that one can place undetectable
timing channels on flows (for some schemes provably undetectable for
others practically undetectable).  But passive correlation is adequate
anyway, even at very low sampling rates (cf. Murdoch and Zielinski,
PETS 2007). This is long known and well understood. It's why we have
always said that onion routing resists traffic analysis not traffic
confirmation.
