Do you imagine for an instant that a list like this could go out, 
be available to anonymous people, and *NOT* be archived?  I guarantee 
various interested parties including Law Enforcement Agencies are 
archiving it, and would be whether or not anyone else did and whether 
or not any public archives were available.  In fact, I'm betting that 
their archives are more complete than the ones on the web, and I wish
we could restore some stuff from those records that's gotten lost from 
the web archives. In particular, I designed a digital-cash protocol 
once and discussed it on this list, and it's not in the web archives. 
I'd like to have that back, it would save me some design work when I 
go to implement it.

We can't stop anybody who gets cypherpunks from archiving it.  We 
can't stop anybody from getting cypherpunks.  QED, there *are* 
archives.  Some of them might as well be public.  Occasionally 
they are useful, or contain worthwhile URL's.
