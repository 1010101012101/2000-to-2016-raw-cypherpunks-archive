Since people can't do good random, I presume you can't prevent from
leaking bits, unless you use very short messages with very primitive
syntax, and do some algorithmic substitution.

A better solution would be to use AI which expands a formal construct into
natural language, or just ask another person to rewrite a text, then
another and maybe one more. Of course the final message still bears a
fingerprint, but it's no longer your own.
