Distributed, fractal, peer-to-peer, nonhierarchical, geodesic, silk 
road, agoric, anarchic, are all terms basically describing the same 
sort of thing. Which term is whizzier is in the eye of the beholder.

Personally, I got tired several years ago of hearing everything 
described as a "fractal geodesic network." I don't know whether the 
term was coined by its chief user, Bob Hettinga, or by a similar 
propagandist, George Gilder, or by someone else.

The naming issues are parallel to the issues with "open systems," 
"bazaar and the cathedral," etc.

But I imagine others are tired of hearing me talk about crypto anarchy.

I'm not sure "geodesic" captures the important issues. Are merchants 
in a Baghdad bazaar part of a "fractal geodesic network"? I suppose. 
But this is just a basic open market, with no top-down rules set.

Is the Law Merchant a fractal geodesic network? Whatever.
