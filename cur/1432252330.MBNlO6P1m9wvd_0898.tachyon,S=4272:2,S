Possibly - they're using an ASIC, so I'd have thought that speed would not
be the issue. I have not run the numbers.

I'm not really up on crypto file systems, but I beleive at least some
use the sector address as the IV. IVs don't need to be random,
secret, or unpredictable - they just need to be unrepeated. (I'm
assuming sector-at-a-time encryption).

Having the user generate the key and load it on the dongle 
means that he has good assurance that the manufacturer doesn't 
have the key. Any kind of backup will open a possible route of
attack. If the user can specify the raw key value (it's short - this
is symmetric crypto), they can choose their own backup - up to
and including writing it on paper and carefuly hiding it.

We're talking about two different products. The ABIT is a MB, 
presumably with it's own custom BIOS, so that's not an issue 
there.
