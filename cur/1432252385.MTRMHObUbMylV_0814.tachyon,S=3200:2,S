Hmm, didn't Sircam do a bit of that?  But it sent files, not your entire

mail spool; and it didn't try too hard to broadcast (it could have
always
forwarded a copy to usenet in addition to your contacts).  Not sure if
disk-encryption would have helped; it just would
have sent one of the open (cleartext) files.  Sircam forwarding a saved,

encrypted email would have been harmless modulo traffic analysis.

To encourage WiFi encryption you could use a high-gain antenna and
anonymously (re) broadcast traffic you found.  And publicize the site.
Don't do
this too early during deployment or you'll stunt the early growth.
