Well, as an EFnet user, I can say that EFnet is pretty unreliable. Network
splits are extremely common (major splits occuring once every 3 or 4
hours, and usually lasting about 10 minutes or so). Lag between major irc
servers is often quite apparent. All-in-all, EFnet needs a lot of
work. Some of the other networks like Chatnet behave better, but they are
also smaller and have less users.

Is there a need for a new IRC network? Unclear. I think that the probolems
EFnet has are not going to be fixed by relacing it. The IRC servers simply
need to be more reliable.
