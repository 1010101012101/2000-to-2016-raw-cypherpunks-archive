And, just in case you were wondering how on earth they'll know you're watching the news online, Mr Hardwell adds, "Finally our
detection equipment is capable of picking up television reception via computer. And no, the BBC do not look at IP addresses for
licence fee evasion."

It's my understanding that TV detector vans work by picking up the radiation emitted by cathode ray tube TVs - which should mean
that, if you're rich enough to run an LCD monitor they'll never know you're a secret Paxman admirer.

Burglar.com is illegal, coppers claim

A web site that connects the victims of a burglary with the people who have their property is illegal, according to the police.

Theburglar.com bills itself as a "link to the underground". There are three ways to register.

Time Warner's home video division has changed DVD's region coding scheme to make it even harder to play movies sold in one territory
in another.

Other DVD distributors are expected to follow suit. Sony subsidiary Columbia Tristar has already agreed to do so.

According to a leaked internal Warner Home Video document posted on Web site DVD Debate, the company began shipping discs with an
"enhanced" region code at the start of this month.
