There was an interesting proposal by Dave Del Torto yesterday at SFBAY
cypherpunk meeting. He suggested that cypherpunks were, sort of, invited
to help a newly founded international police force. These guys help the
international court of justice, and track down criminals like Milosevic,
bin Laden and others. In their investigations they need strong crypto,
because sometimes they operate in the hostile environments.

If any cypherpunk needs a get-out-of-jail pass, this is the chance to
earn one.

Volunteers should contact Dave.
