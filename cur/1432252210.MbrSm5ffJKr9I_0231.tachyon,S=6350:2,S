the worst kind of xpost of all?

every day without RDRAW is another day of my life with provably less
information theoretic meaning.  ;)

two chips or two families or two architectures or ...
is this a game of twenty questions? can we do a reddit AMA for the
leakers with their stash at the ready?

past experience tells us they like attacks universally effective,
unidirectional, silent/random-looking (without secret knowledge), and
don't mind expending custom hardware and algorithms to do it.
Dual_EC_DRBG doesn't count - that was a "jeezus, everyone asleep at
the wheel.  i bet we could get this approved!" moment.


triggering is active, observable (potentially), and usually
re-playable.  the only "delivered payloads", ala
EGOTISTICAL*/ERRONEOUS*, appear to be for confirmation pinging or
identification, and memory resident forensic/exfiltration run locally
on the host.  even the slides you link to note the OPSEC concerns of
"adversarial actors" (i think that's us on this list?)

sure.  note how this is also more complicated, with higher risk?  if
there was a better way i bet they'd choose it!

also, Intel and ARM, Apple and ARM, Apple and VIA, etc.
  you're not helping my pleading and cajoling for RDRAW sir.



on a related note, if Intel were to decide to include RDRAW in next
CPU line design, how long would it be to retail channels? >3yrs?
