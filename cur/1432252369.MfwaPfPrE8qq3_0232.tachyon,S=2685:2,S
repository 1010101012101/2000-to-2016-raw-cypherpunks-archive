If someone would vote for "none of the above" rather than write in
his/her ideal candidate, that someone is a lazy oaf.  Everyone who
writes in a candidate is voting "none of the above."

The 50% of the U.S. population which doesn't vote is also voting "none
of the above" in a way.  There's a difference in that some non-voters
may slightly prefer one candidate over another, but _assuming that
everyone has an ideal candidate_ they'd be willing to go to the polls
for, not voting is the same as saying all the candidates are
significantly less than the ideal.
