Anyone who doesn't support that doesn't deserve freedom of speech. I understand limits to speech being necessary to prevent imminent harm (when there is evidence of clear and present danger) like yelling fire in a crowded theater. However, this logic has been overextended and abused to the point where less-than-clear danger and just potential risk are enough to justify censorship of unpopular political speech. One more reason to nix the Terrorism Act.

Agree with the main idea, but not sure agree
with the "limits".

Currently in theory most people have right of
free speech, but there are so many limits/
exceptions they rule and one can hardly exercise 
free speech without hitting limit/exception.

To paraphrase a quote:

First they came for the terrorists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a terrorist,
Then they came for the communists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist,
...{jews, trade unionists, protestants}
Then they came for me,
and by that time no one was left to speak up.
