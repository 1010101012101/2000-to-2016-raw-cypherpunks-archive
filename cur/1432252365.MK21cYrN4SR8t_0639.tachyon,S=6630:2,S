Halliburton to Build New Cells at Guantanamo Base WASHINGTON (Reuters) - 
Halliburton Co. has been awarded a $9.7 million contract to build an 
additional 204-cell detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba to hold additional suspected al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, the 
Pentagon said on Friday.
The move will expand the high-security prison on the base, where hundreds 
of such "detainees" from Afghanistan are already being held in 612 small 
cells.
The prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station has played a major part in the 
U.S. war on terrorism declared after September's attacks on America in 
which more than 3,000 people died. No prisoners have been charged, but some 
could eventually face military trials.
Brown and Root Services, an engineering division of Halliburton, will build 
the additional 6-by-8-foot cells on the windward side of the remote U.S. 
base at the southeastern tip of Cuba, the Pentagon said.
The work is expected to be completed by October. But the Pentagon suggested 
on Friday that the facility could grow even more and that the contract 
could eventually total as much as $300 million if additional options were 
exercised over the next four years.
Vice President Dick Cheney is the former chief executive officer of 
Halliburton, whose main business is providing oilfield services. The 
company has come under heavy pressure this year because of concerns about 
its liabilities and a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission into 
its accounting for cost overruns on construction projects.
Additional Cells Sought By Rumsfeld
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld earlier this month asked Congress to 
approve expanding the prison facility, which currently has 612 cells, by 
204 cells.
Army Lt. Col. Joe Hoey, a spokesman for the task force running the prisoner 
operation at the naval base in Cuba, said earlier that the United States 
was holding and interrogating 564 suspected Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners.
The prisoners were captured in the U.S.-led war against the al Qaeda group 
blamed for the September attacks and against the Taliban government that 
sheltered them in Afghanistan.
The captives were moved in April to Camp Delta, a permanent facility built 
to replace Camp X-Ray, a series of makeshift chain-link cells hastily 
erected when the U.S. military first brought prisoners from Afghanistan to 
Guantanamo in January.
The United States drew fire from human rights groups after photographs were 
distributed of the prisoners squatting in their cells in the blazing Cuban 
sun. Human rights activists have criticized that U.S. stance that the 
captives are not prisoners of war under the Geneva conventions.
The fate of the prisoners being held at Guantanamo is still uncertain. The 
United States government has set guidelines to try some of them before 
military tribunals but has not said when that might happen.
Camp Delta is made up of solid cells in rows that look like long mobile 
homes. Unlike Camp X-Ray, they have wash basins with running water and 
floor-style toilets that flush.
Like X-Ray, Camp Delta is surrounded by fences topped with razor wire and 
ringed by wooden guard towers manned by sharpshooters. But the new camp is 
enclosed inside a green mesh curtain, which prevents visitors from seeing 
in and keeps the prisoners from seeing the tightly guarded shoreline a few 
hundred yards away.
