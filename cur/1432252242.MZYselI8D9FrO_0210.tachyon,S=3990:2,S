Right on target.  There is one aspect to this loss of nerve not mentioned: the correlation between those with the means and interest to pursue these avenues and those with merely the interest.

One of this list's members shopped here and elsewhere a few years back for participation in building a DBC-based payment and value system.  He had assembled a team with the banking experience, needing the technology implementors.  None were willing to put their talents to the test.  They all nodded regarding the need for such a facility but none would expend any efforts.  

They were all being courted by the failed dot.bombs which waved generous salary and stock offers.  Now that the tulip market has evaporated along with the dreams of quick riches I wonder if any these pseudo-zealots were ever really interested or was it a merely a childish fancy from the start?  As Tim demonstrates the opportunity is still there it waits only for those with the right stuff to grab for the ring.
