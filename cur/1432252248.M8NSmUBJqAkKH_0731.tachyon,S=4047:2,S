Reese asked:
 
> How dry will the air be at the burning cherry on a cigarette?

Quite wet, because the combustion adds water vapour to the air. It won't
be much good at physically wetting things, because the air is warm, but
the water vapour is there and being hot will be chemically quite active.
Hold a piece of cool glassware near a bunsen burner  or candle flame and
you will see lots of condensation. No, not *that* near...
