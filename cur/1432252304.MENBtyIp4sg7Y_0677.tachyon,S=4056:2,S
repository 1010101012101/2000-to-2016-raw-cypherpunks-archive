Please let me..

When you joined, you received instructions.

Further, amongst those hundreds of messages you cite have been 
messages explaining how to unsubscribe. Please find and read them.

Until then, you are being put on the special high spam diet.

And please don't even _think_ about complaining to _my_ ISP.
