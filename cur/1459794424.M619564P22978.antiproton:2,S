About your Panama Papers ... Brought to you by US intelligence agencies
with special thank to the "International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists" (ICIJ), which Pepe Escobar notes is funded by the "Center
for Public Integrity"... IOW:

"...the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Family Fund,
Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket"


One of his commenters:

"The  Panama Papers are the exact kind of weaponized Psyops posing as an
'activist leak' I wanted to see from Hybrid Warfare."


    THE ULTIMATE LIMITED HANGOUT LEAK

    Put on your Panama hat and dance the leak.

    And if you believe in the integrity of the "International Consortium
    of Investigative Journalists" (ICIJ), I got a made in Shenzhen
    Panama hat to sell ya.

    I never was, and never will be, a member of this racket; well,
    people asked me, and I'm answering.

    The ICIJ gets its cash and its "organizational procedure" via the
    Exceptionalistan-based Center for Public Integrity. The money comes
    from: Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Faimly Fund,
    Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket.

    This alleged most massive leak ever was obtained by - what else - US
    intel.

    But the REAL leak will never be known. Even the uber-pathetic
    Grauniad admitted, on the record, that "much of the leaked material
    will remain private".

    Why? Because it DIRECTLY implicates a gaggle of Western
    0.00000000001% multibillionaires and corporations. All of them play
    the offshore casino game.

What is the main point?

The law is written by the rich for the rich.

I suspect a lot of laws have subtle workarounds for "optimizing taxes"
and worse stuff.

What other consequences this may have except to show someone broke local
laws and have more virtual money than expected?
