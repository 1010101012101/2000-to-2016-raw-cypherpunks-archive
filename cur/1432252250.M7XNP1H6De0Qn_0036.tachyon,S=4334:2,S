Hey Dave,

I know you prefer to keep things tech focused, rather than political.
But then how do we classify this bit of selective internet filtering:


Websites blocked by political stripes for Marines in Iraq?
Snip from an email sent by an anonymous US Marine to Wonkette:

Unfortunately anonomizers don't work out here (never have). Anyway, I
had a few minutes today and thought I'd look and see what else was
banned on the Marine web here. I think the results speak for themselves:

* Wonkette b bForbidden, this page (http://www.wonkette.com/) is
categorized as: Forum/Bulletin Boards, Politics/Opinion.b
* Bill ObReilly (www.billoreilly.com) b OK
* Air America (www.airamericaradio.com) b bForbidden, this page
(http://www.airamericaradio.com/) is categorized as: Internet Radio/
TV, Politics/Opinion.b
* Rush Limbaugh (www.rushlimbaugh.com) b OK
* ABC News bThe Noteb b OK
* Website of the Al Franken Show (www.alfrankenshow.com) b
bForbidden, this page (http://www.airamericaradio.com/) is
categorized as: Internet Radio/TV, Politics/Opinion.b
* G. Gordon Liddy Show (www.liddyshow.us) b OK
* Don & Mike Show (www.donandmikewebsite.com) b bForbidden, this page
(http://www.donandmikewebsite.com/) is categorized as: Profanity,
Entertainment/Recreation/Hobbies.b

If it wasn't so sad, it would be laughable.  Litigation to follow . . .

Incidentally, Josh Marshall has been discussing what could be an
illegal use of the Military for purely political events here:  http://
www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2006_03_05.php#007808

How can we avoid discussing politics when it seems to intrude
everywhere?
