Reasonable? Well, compared to dying of malnutrition, anything is
"reasonable". After that, it's mostly a matter of letting economic growth
do its deed.

OTOH, dismal civil rights conditions make a country a hostile, high risk
environment to investment capital. That gives a reasonable incentive to
the government/dictator to do something about those rights violations. A
similar argument holds for credit ratings and the subsequent cost of
foreign loaning.

And guess what? Part of globalization is getting the fundamental human
rights and civil liberties infrastructure in place in these countries.

Sure, they're separate. That by no means implies that socialism is stable
or that it could be kept from degenerating into a dictatorship. Cf. Hayek.
