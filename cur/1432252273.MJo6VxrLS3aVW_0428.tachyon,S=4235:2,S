Drudge flashes about lots of things.  It's nice to get a bit of context
besides just the URL, Jim...

This is the Pentagon claiming that the story about Delta Force getting shot up
during a raid on Afghanistan is incorrect.
Seymour Hersh is a journalist who's annoyed the Pentagon for decades,
printing stories they don't want printed.
This one they're denying before it even hits paper...

Also, I don't see any evidence that he "strongly debunked" the story;
he flamed it aggressively, but to strongly debunk something
you need facts, not just assertions.  You also need to have read the
story you're debunking, which the spokescritter indicates he hasn't.
The phrase " My guess is and my belief is that" also makes it clear that
he doesn't know the facts of what happened, though he does indicate
that US forces had a helicopter accident and some parachute accidents,
and comes close to implying some problems with friendly fire,
because he'd rather admit that than admit that The Enemy shot US soldiers.
Bunk.

Mullah Omar's complex in Afghanistan.
