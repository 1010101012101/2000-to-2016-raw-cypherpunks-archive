Makes for lively conversation doesn't it :-)

A good discussion should alternate.  Certainly it's not the same people.
And both urge the same action - tell your congress critter to butt out!

Exactly.  Let the market decide.  This is why it's necessary to
contact your congress critter - they don't need to be involved.

As long as it's not legislated, nobody needs to worry about what
gets fabbed.  The market will decide if DRM makes any economic sense.
I'm betting it doesn't, but I've been wrong before.  Untrusted
platforms will be cheaper than trusted ones, so there has to be some
incentive for customers to buy them.  Economic incentives make far
more sense than legislated ones.

The main point is not the content of the bill, or its purpose.  The
main point is that government is being told to get involved in the market
place, and that, all by itself, is a *bad* idea.  If people want to
build trusted platforms and put them on the market they can go ahead
and do it.  If people don't want to buy them, that's their choice,
and if others do decide it's worth it, they should be allowed to.

As long as TCPA is really an option, the market place is a good way
to sort things out.  But S.2048 needs to die, not for scary reasons,
but just because there's no reason for it in the first place.

Patience, persistence, truth,
