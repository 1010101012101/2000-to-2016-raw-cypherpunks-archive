No problem. Not having read the actual paper, I'm not even sure what
they meant by "noise" preventing amplification of quantum signals in an
EDFA. Quantum states cannot be copied, which seems like a more
fundamental problem, but perhaps they are talking about the potential
for using an EDFA just to create a large number of entangled particles.

I'm fairly optimistic for a couple of different reasons. First of all,
progress on quantum computers has been very slow and the experts in the
field who have spoken up believe it's unlikely the NSA has a major
breakthrough on this front. Second, I'm skeptical that quantum computers
can even be made to work at all. While D-Wave and others have built
systems that they *believe* are quantum computers and shown some
evidence that they behave as one would expect for such devices, nothing
has yet been demonstrated that could not easily been achieved with a
classical computer, though much of this is due to the small scale of the
devices.

Even if quantum computers can be made to work, one can hope that by then
we'll either have quantum cryptography infrastructure in place (though
the need for physical infrastructure scares me here - maybe guerrilla
wireless quantum crypto?) or have widespread access to practical
quantum-proof public-key crypto. Maybe either the NTRU patent will have
expired or we'll have found alternative cryptosystems that do not
infringe, ala the Lucas sequence alternative to RSA. Of course, the
patent is only a problem in the US and its satellite states anyway.
