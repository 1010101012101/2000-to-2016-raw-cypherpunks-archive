What better way to carry spores in the US's strongest
fortress, Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center, than
by way of the President seeking protection from a 
September 11 threat? When told of the WTC attacks
was he not visiting the region of the first spore attacks?

Prior to 911 CMOC regularly conducted tours of the
facility which it recounts on its Web site:

  https://www.cheyennemountain.af.mil/cmoc/

What better way to spread spores throughout DC's
most secure facilities than to use members of Congress 
and staff as vectors, not just the Capitol but the refuges
set aside for wartime use?

To be sure, all those who have fled spore threats have
likely served as vectors, as in the past did asbestos workers 
and animal hide handlers who took the contaminants home
with them.

The WSJ reported yesterday on the Anthrax Capital of
North America, a tri-county area in southern Texas where
cutaneous anthrax infections are common. The soil of
the region is claimed to be the richest source of anthrax
in the country. Locals have no fear of the spores, antidotes
are sold in cattle feed stores.

This is not to suggest that the People's Republic of Texas 
is out to get its Connecticut carpetingbagging cowpoke for 
messing with the dirt-rich downhomeland.

South Texas, for those who never studied our homegrown
stone-age, is right there with Afghanistan in deviousness, 
monomania, religious fundamentalism, treachery, animal
copulation, lying, infecting Yankees, abusing immigrants,
and sending one-nation-only-Texas-Texans up north to 
prey on people who believe they are superior for losing
the war of 1845.

Choate, and me, will never forget the insults, you miserable
sonsabitches, breath deep and die.
