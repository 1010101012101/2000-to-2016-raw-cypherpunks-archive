The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oi| Be|t"
and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barrels of oi| and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly explosive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
slight|y, you wi|| sti|l make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
