How do you know he's serious?  He could just be trolling you.

Naw, we just use more subtle techniques.  Like calling Tim a "soccer mom".

Anybody who takes Tim seriously is messed up.  Like the feds :-)  He's
just your run of the mill nut case who's pretending to be a white
supremiscist because it gets people riled up.  Then again, maybe he really
is a texan living in CA.

What difference does it make really?  If he's scaring you, then you need
to visit the wizard and get some courage.  It's better to laugh at him.
That's what I do :-)

And I don't have to worry about him reading any of this, because he
"plonked" me a long time ago!

So chill out dude, and enjoy the conversation as just ephemeral bits.  Now
and then even a blind chicken gets a kernel of corn, so it doesn't hurt to
skim things.  Besides, there's more than enough skill here to nuke Tim off
the face of the earth if we *really* have to.  It's just more fun to take
a hit and laugh tho.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
