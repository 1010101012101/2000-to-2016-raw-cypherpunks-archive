It's also become increasingly difficult for crypto-enthusiasts within a company
to convince mgt. that a new project should use PGP.  A year or two back you
could still, with a bit of persuasion, convince a company to go with PGP rather
than S/MIME or SSL or whatever (and "whatever" is, with frightening frequency,
IPsec, of which more below).  This is now almost impossible to do, because PGP
is seen as having very little industry support, which terrifies management.

The major reason for this is the incessant need of the PGP standards
contributors to keep tweaking the spec for every little issue which comes down
the track, constantly breaking compatibility with the current code base.
Unfortunately given that someone is going to come up with some novel problem
which PGP doesn't quite address at the moment but which can be fixed with a
minor update, every six months or so, it's quite possible that the standard
will never settle down until someone gets around to shooting the engineers and
backing out the last dozen or so compatibility-breaking tweaks and updates.

>Even the most casual user of software tends to be familiar with and acceptant
>of the need for occasional software upgrades.

Only if it's broken, and that's the "problem" with PGP: It ain't broken.  I can
take my 10-year-old copy of PGP 2.6.x and be no less secure with it than with
the very latest NAI release.  The only reason most people ever dumped ssh 1.x
was because of very widely-publicised exploits, and even then for many users it
took the widespread use of ssh rootkits to get them to go to 2.x.  PGP hasn't
had that problem.  Like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps on going.  Look at
the Disastry PGP releases with source code going back 10 years, it's like
taking a trip back in time.  Except for the gratuitous changes in packet
formats and whatnot and a few new algorithms, you could use it to process
current messages (it's one of the first of my standard suite of PGP versions to
try).  In fact since good ol' 2.x will interoperate with any other 2.x-vintage
version out there but post-2.x stuff is nothing but interop trouble, there's a
strong incentive *not* to upgrade.

It's not PGP specific.  It's because it ain't broken, and going to a newer
version is frequently more painful (due to interop problems) than staying with
what works.

As a matter of fact I keep an old DOS box stashed away for emergencies.  No
matter how bad things get, you can always bring up DOS on whatever random
hardware you can scrape together from various corners, fire up a terminal
emulator, and get online.

That's always been the problem with crypto software.  Crypto is cool and fun to
do.  It is (compared to the UI) relatively easy to implement given a decent
toolkit with a good selection of algorithms and whatnot (just to show I'm not
blowing smoke, it took me around two weeks to add OpenPGP as a target format
for cryptlib enveloping).  OTOH UI work is painful and boring and not even
remotely sexy.  It'd take me forever to put a UI at the level of Outlook (which
is what the masses would expect) onto cryptlib, and even if I knew anything
about Windows GUIs you couldn't pay me enough to do it.  There are however a
few products which have managed this, eg The Bat,
http://www.ritlabs.com/securebat/index.html, so it's not impossible.  Sure,
it's not Outlook, but it's an impressive piece of work for one person.

Frequently because of management misunderstanding... no, let's be honest, total
cluelessness, though.  "You got a security problem?  No worries, just install a
VPN.  Sign here please".  VPNs are being sold as the solution to everything
from viruses to premature baldness, and occasionally even because of concerns
about outsiders grabbing sensitive data off external networks, although the
latter seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Either the complete
lack of addressing (or even considering) the threat model before deployment, or
the fact that everyone including the tea lady are regarded as requiring access
once it's deployed, mean it's just an expensive collection of electronic worry
beads once installed.

These things are great, for $29.95 and a little isopropyl alcohol (or acrylic
spray paint) you get a nice GemPC430 card reader and drivers (they're normally
$60-70).  The card is just a dumb memory card though, so you still need to get
a GPK8K alongside the reader.
