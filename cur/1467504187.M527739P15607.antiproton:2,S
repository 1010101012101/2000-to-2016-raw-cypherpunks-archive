In the case of someone not including their email address in their key, you will probably need to just save the message to a file, pop into the shell, and verify manually... which I realize isn't what you're looking for!

I'll poke around my mutt config when I get to a real computer, seems maybe you could play with the pgp_verify_command (setting is something like that..), although mutt+gpg always a little fragile IME (although def works)....
