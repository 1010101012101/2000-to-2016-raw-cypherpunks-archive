Well, ya' gotta a point there. Actually, I WISH I were smoking something.

But "saying" is at some point important. At least, prior to this a number of 
individual landholders might have been able to work together (ie, amass 
legal funds) to prevent the bulldozement of their properties by The Donald 
or whoever else's mouth has been watering recently. Now it just comes down 
to who can buy more guns: the poor or rich guys & their hired hands (ie, 
local government).

Also, it will probably end up being a kind of turning point. Now, knowing 
what the SC has decided, there are lots of plans going to drawing boards 
that have nice big fat red X's over low-income dwellings..."Don't worry 
about the new Brooklyn stadium, we'll just set off the ED roach bomb and 
clear 'em all out of there."
