If you're looking for territoriality, alarm capability,
and something cops and crooks don't know how to work around or prepare for,
don't mess with dogs - go for geese :-)
The cops may bring dog biscuits with them to distract dogs,
but with geese, that's just a noisy feeding frenzy,
and if they didn't bring bribes, well, you can reason with dogs,
but geese don't fall for the "Nice doggy" alpha-crap...

Of course, this only works well out in the country,
though I had a suburban neighbor in New Jersey who had geese
for a while before deciding some of the neighbors might get
bothered by the noise, and in Tim's case there's a risk that the
psycho dog next door might decide they look like food,
but they're cheerful to have around and don't require the
constant time and attention and work a dog needs.
