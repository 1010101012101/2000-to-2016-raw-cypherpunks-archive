On arterial roads this may be an interesting approach. 

In a residential neighborhood you're absolutlely right. Rather than
flatten everyone's tires, ID the worst offenders then give them a chance
to get it right. My dad has suggested leaving old strollers, bikes &
kids toys around the streets. Deny knowledge or ownership. In our area
the limit is 25, there are a couple of shitheads who regularly do 45.
They deserve to be beaten to within an inch of their lives, if I thought
I could get away with it...the same with the assholes who let their dogs
run around loose. Oh to live out in the country again where an
aggressive dog loose on your property could be called a threat to
livestock...

sorry, I'm pining...

PS - about eartags for cows and sheeple^H^H - they only seem to mind for
a few seconds then they go right back to chewing their cud...
