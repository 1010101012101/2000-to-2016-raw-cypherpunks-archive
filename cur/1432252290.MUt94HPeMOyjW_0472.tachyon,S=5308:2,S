I don't think so.  Other people don't think so.

Please don't be unhappy, I'm actually trying to be helpful.  I've
enjoyed reading your work.

Specifically, your work on spoliation has affected my thinking, and
probably that of others.  Sometimes it's a little hard to tell that
one is having an effect.  Often a really good post elicits minimal
response because there's not much more to be said.  And thousands of
readers of this list never post at all.

However, you have made a variety of remarks which could be seen, not
too unreasonably, as being just a little bit condescending.  If you
are feeling that people are behaving inappropriately towards you, it
might be worth considering if you might be unintentionally conveying
this impression.

No, what I am specifically addressing is complaints of having done
some research and "jocular" requests for money.  Other people who have
experience and have done research have not made these requests.
(Okay, some have, but they warrant the same response.)

Good!  As I've said earlier, I find these posts useful.

It wouldn't be unreasonable to do so.  This isn't just an engineering
thing, academia functions the same way.  People want to know the chain
of evidence.  This is healthy.

I don't especially believe in trusting "recognized experts" because so
many of them are simply "recognized."  In your case, nobody even knows
your name, so is it all that unreasonable to ask for a citation?

(Perhaps you didn't enjoy being insulted, but that's part of the deal
if you trifle with the Lion of Aptos. ;-)

Is this really all that civil? :

To me, this is condescending and that is unwarranted.  If you feel
that you are slumming it, it's a good idea not to let on to the
slummees.
