Al-Quaeda is not a military force by any reasonable reckoning; it is a
criminal association whose victims are defenseless and innocent of any
involvement (pro or anti) in the cause that the criminal association
claims to espouse.

Interrogation is certainly NOT prohibited by the Convention. Where are
you getting this nonsense? Every army of every signatory power has
interrogators trained and ready to process prisoners of war. Every
infantry leader is trained to rapidly elicit information of immediate
tactical value from the enemy soldiers whom he captures.

Right. Coercion and torture forbidden. Asking questions is not. Use of
trickery is not. Many other means of obtaining information are not.

The Convention certainly did not envision eliminating security
precautions against the escape of prisoners!

I'll say it again - these are not prisoners of war!

If the US prisoners in question had engineered, or were suspected of
having engineered, the deaths of thousands of innocent people, I suspect
that even LESS sympathy or consideration would be shown them. They
certainly would not get any from me.
