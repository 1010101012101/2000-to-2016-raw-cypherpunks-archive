NBL.  The international organizations will merely relocate their
meetings to more defensible locations.  The Canadian Rockies will be a
little harder to storm during the next Gang of Seven meeting.  Davos
relocated to NYC where the 40K cops are used to imposing frozen zones and
indulging in anti terror policing.  Some may also choose to meet in US
sunbelt cities whose auto-friendly streets are not protest friendly.  Open
prospects easy to defend.  Politicos and police departments not friendly
to socialists from out of town.  And with an armed citizenry (concealed
carry laws) and the death penalty.

Even the Euro-wimps are starting to crack down on foreign terrorist cells
operating on their soil.  May make it harder for mass demo organizing.

World War IV - The War on Terrorism - has already been and will continue
to be hard on a movement that uses demos (as opposed to entity building)
as its main strategic and tactical technique.
