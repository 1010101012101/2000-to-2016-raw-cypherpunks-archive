A good exercise for the students would be to discuss how legislative
initiatives such as this will affect non-institutional research into molecular
and biological sciences and related fields.

All scientists are potential terrorists.

Terrorist (n.), Any person or expert system (excepting registered
corporations) which acts in such a manner as to make a police officer
suspicious that he, she, or it might engage in or think about engaging in
terrorist activates.

So the U.K. Government will no doubt apply to have the principles of
google.com extradited for prosecution.

Tsk, tsk, tsk.  Those wacky politicians.
