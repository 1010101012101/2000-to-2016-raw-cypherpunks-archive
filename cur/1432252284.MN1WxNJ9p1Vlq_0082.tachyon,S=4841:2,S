Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20OO with a view to become

metabo|ites of plants that include more than 2,O0O different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wal|s of the blood vessels inc|uding capi||aries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmental agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sell its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2OO4-20O5 are more then  $1O0 milli0n USD

Further developments of the transaction and the deve|opment at Huifeng
