I was able to read the document on "anthrax" going to the URL address:
www.sfmu.org/kiosque

(Societe' Francophone de Medicine d'Urgence)

and then, click on the link referred to "Documents et liens sur le
bioterrorism de guerre, le plan BIOTOX en France"

I arrived then to: "Terrorism bacteriologique et chimique - Textes de
references" by Dr. Lannehoa - Dr. Berthier.
