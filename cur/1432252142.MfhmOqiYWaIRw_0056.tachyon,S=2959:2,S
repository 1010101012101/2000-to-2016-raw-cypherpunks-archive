Local Communities Refuse to Enforce Patriot Act

Thursday, May 15, 2003

By Kelley Beaucar Vlahos



WASHINGTON . In a rare occurrence, conservative watchdogs are siding with
liberal groups who say that several provisions of the anti-terror USA
Patriot Act (search) are cause for concern by Americans seeking to protect
their basic rights.

"We must balance at all times the fact that national security is
important, but freedom is essential," said Phil Kent, president of the
conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation (search), which has taken issue
with expanded federal surveillance powers granted under the law.

Kent and others are applauding local efforts to try to ward off provisions
of the Patriot Act. As of this week, the state of Hawaii as well as 104
cities and counties across the country have passed resolutions protesting
federal law enforcement measures in the USA Patriot Act.

Responding to a anti-Patriot Act resolution passed by the Tucson, Ariz.,
city council on May 5, Republican U.S. Sen. John Kyl said none of the
invasiveness activists have warned about has come to pass.

"Despite what critics charge, law-abiding Americans have not seen their
rights infringed," he told Foxnews.com.
