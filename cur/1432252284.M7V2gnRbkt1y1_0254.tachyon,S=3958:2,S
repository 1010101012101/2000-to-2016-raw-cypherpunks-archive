The FBI acknowledged that they'd done some black-bag jobs on Hanssen, 
including wiretaps and access to his computer.

Not surprising at all that they had access to both his private key, 
assuming he was using something like PGP, and his pass phrase, no 
matter what system he was using. Keyboard sniffers are easy to 
install.
