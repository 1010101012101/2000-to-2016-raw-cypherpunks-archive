It's the very fact that so much probation exists that makes it 
economically feasible for so many behaviors to now be felonious.

If residents of a local community had to actually _pay_ for the 
building of enough prisons to house the thoughtcriminals, there would 
be far fewer things classified as felonies.

The parole machine _is_ what makes the criminalization of every area 
of life so attractive to the "it can't happen to me!" crowd.
