I'd like to believe this -- it would make the struggle more heroic --
but I can't. As they say, all politics is local. I don't think most
people in the Middle East care whether Americans are enjoying freedom &
democracy any more than most Americans care whether people in the Middle
East are (alas!). If they were really upset about capitalism they'd be
bombing Swiss banks; instead, they probably keep their money in them.

In fact, when was the last time terrorists struck Switzerland?*

Mostly Kurds protesting against Greeks. Nothing to do with the Swiss. 

Nothing at all listed for 1995-1998, 2000:
