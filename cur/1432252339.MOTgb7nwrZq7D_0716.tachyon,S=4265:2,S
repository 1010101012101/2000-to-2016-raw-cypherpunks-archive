the point is, that's enough.  Both endpoints on such a packet's 
route are participants, obviously.  If they want to shut it 
down, and they have seen such a packet, they have two people 
they can shut down.  Repeat ad nauseam, and the infrastructure 
is destroyed.  They don't have to trace individual messages 
if they can make the software illegal. 

And in an agent provocateur mode, the software is illegal the 
minute they want it to be -- all they have to do is show a 
DMCA violation (which they can manufacture at will) and declare 
the software illegal as a "circumvention device".

Really?  I guarantee you that if a particular OS gets in the way 
of those with power, they can declare it a "circumvention device" 
the same as any other software.

Bingo.  That is absolutely the point.  The current paradigm being 
the Internet as we know it.
