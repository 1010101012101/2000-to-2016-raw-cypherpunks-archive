An interesting exercise is to ask where the government (ANY branch of 
government) gets the authority to require me to put smoke detectors 
in my home.  If my house burns down, that's my tough toenails, right? 

Well, probably not in the city.  In a densely built area, the 
government is exercising the PRESUMED property rights of my 
neighbors to minimize the risk to their homes from fires I 
may start. But it has done so, in most cases, without ever 
consulting my neighbors or getting their authorization for such 
action. 

I really wish that property ownership, or whatever else, came with 
an attached list of the supposed "property rights" exercised on 
your behalf by government.  I think people would be appalled at 
what their presumed interests amount to complicity in.
