The Internet is not controlled, i.e., there is a power vacuum
that will soon be filled.  There are many, many players and soon
to be more.  The question to be contemplated, if any, is this:
Do you prefer that the competing claims of control over the
Internet be resolved by way of (1) dramatic Balkanization or
by way of (2) making the Internet an organ of world government?

A thought experiment, if needing one: is VoIP a part of the
Internet or is it not, that is do you have two networks in your
home/office or one?
