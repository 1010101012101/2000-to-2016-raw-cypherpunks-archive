Yeah, no kidding: John, I hate to break the news, but this issue is 
*really* old news.  Paypal has been famous for this for going on 15 years 
now.  Because of this behaviour, there are a ton of people on eBay who 
wont accept PayPal, and there are any number of "anti paypal" website up.  
For example:

PayPalSucks.com
PayPalSucks.org
PayPalSucks.net
paypal.ctyme.com/paypal/paypalsucks.htm (warning: Perkel site)
www.aboutpaypal.org/paypal_sucks
knaddison.com/opinions/why-i-hate-paypal-why-paypal-sucks

this list is endless.  I gave up on these f-heads many years ago, after a 
run-in with a scammer on eBay managed to get a refund for an item he never 
shipped (yeah, he got the money, and I got squat).  Paypal needs a Nuclear 
Enema.
