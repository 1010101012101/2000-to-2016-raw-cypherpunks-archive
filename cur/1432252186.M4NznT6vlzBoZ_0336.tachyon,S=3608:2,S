A quote from Petro's Archives:   *******************************************
Today good taste is often erroneously rejected as old-fashioned
because ordinary man, seeking approval of his so-called personality,
prefers to follow the dictates of his own peculiar style rather than
submit to any objective criterion of taste.--Jan Tschichold
