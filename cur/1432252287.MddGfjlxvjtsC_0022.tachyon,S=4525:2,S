Also you should think patch (ie flat) antennae as a possibility.

Second rate equiptment.  Even the russians have burst-bugs now.

Didn't Bell use a field strenth meter (output to vibrator in pocket)
to direction-find the spook in the Libertarian Party meetings?

The picture of Gerry Adams holding the GPS bug that MI-5 planted in his
car last
year (during a truce, heh) shows a rectangular box about the size of a
man's forearm;
this could hold plenty of joules.  A motion sensor would be pretty
clever for
waking the thing from sleep mode, to conserve power.

Sounds like the Ultranoids need to monitor the weight of their car
before
operating.

Jim sounds moody; does CJ's tourettes' really make him spit,
or did the Mountie deserve it (or both)?
