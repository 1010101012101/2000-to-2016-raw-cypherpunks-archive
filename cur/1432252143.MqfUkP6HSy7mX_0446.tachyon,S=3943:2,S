I'm a firm believer in mobile preparedness: in fact, every day I never leave
home without carrying a complete BOB concealed in a Kate Spade bag. And I mean
fucking EVERYTHING, the true survivalist nutcase works: first aid kit,emergency
rations, flashlight, space blanket, poncho liner, magnesium fire starter, water
purifying tabs, mini-entrenching tool, Swiss army knife, NIOSH-95 filter mask,
nitrile gloves, monocular, grundig shortwave, passport, etc etc. (Full contents
available on request, it would take awhile!)

Okay... I'll post it in the following forum today or over the weekend:

http://ubb.plainsmanscabin.com/

If I can dig my digital camera out of storage, I'll even put up a picture or
two of it. I'll use some other nym, but I'm sure you won't have any trouble
finding my post in the "Survival Kit" section.

If you haven't come across it yet, this is a great site--tons of valuable
information. There's also a huge archive of old threads you can get to
through Google, worth a look.
