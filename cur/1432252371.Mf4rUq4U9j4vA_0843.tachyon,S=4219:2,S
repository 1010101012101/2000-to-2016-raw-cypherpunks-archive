Lotto is netted
25aug02
A MALVERN man is the first to win a major Tattslotto prize on the Internet.
The health industry worker won the first division prize of $207,000 on 
Saturday, August 15 with a Take Five entry.
"I've played Tattslotto for about 20 years and on the Internet since it 
started," he said.
"I've found playing online really easy and, obviously, very lucky for me."
OZ Lotto, Powerball and Tattersall's sports betting also are on the Net.
