Not mob rule, not democracy. Go back and read the books you 
apparently skipped over in the 10th or 11th grade.

The Constitution exists largely to circumscribe the powers of 
government and to head off precisely the kind of "50% plus 1" 
mobocracy you have consistently been advocating.

In case this just doesn't make sense to you, read the Bill of Rights 
several times and reflect on what the various elements actually mean.

Think about this when next you advocate using the democratic vote to 
seize private property by majoritarian rule.

Frankly, I think I've read enough of you, Nathan Saper.
