"May's handlers are panicking."
In spite of alpha baboons best efforts to lead c/punk revolution up racist 
and capitalist cul de sacs.

Subject: capitalism in america
Anyone who reads this book should recognize Alan Greenspan, Phil Gramm,
Milton Friedman, and David Horowitz for the lying charlatans they are.
Anyone who reads this book should realize the Democrat party is as much
the party of the propertied class as the Republican party. And anyone who
thinks the there is any worthiness to capitalism as an economic system, or
who believes the propertied class is not waging unremitting class war
against eveyone else should consider the words, not of Karl Marx, but of
Abraham Lincoln: "These capitalists act harmoniously and in concert to
fleece the people."
Malthus, Ricardo, Adam Smith--to see they fully
understood what they were creating. They knew capitalism would be a
tremendously productive economic system; but, as they followed the logic
of the economic principles they were developing and articulating, they
also realized it was a system which eventually reduces virtually the
entire population of capitalist societies to starvation while all the
wealth becomes vested in the hands of an ever shrinking elite. As they
themselves predicted, capitalism is an economic system which ultimately
destroys itself and takes everyone with it. It, quite literally, is the
Titanic of economic systems; and its advocates preach it is unsinkable.
Because the version of capitalism practiced in most European nations is
not as pure, not as true to the principles of capitalist ideology as in
the U.S., the inherently destructive consequences of the ideology are not
as pronounced and as profound as in the U.S. The European nations may be
"behind" us, but what is happening here will happen to them; it is
inherent in the logic of capitalist ideology.
Tims opinions of jews are well documented.So long mate,Its been real.
