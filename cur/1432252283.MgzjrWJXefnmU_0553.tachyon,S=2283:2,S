Assuming its true (*) the one security breach is the action of the 
  cabin crew member who tried to reassure this woman by going on 
about air marshalls.   That security breach should certainly get 
them sacked, and probably interrogated by the men in cheap suits.

Or does she assume that apparently nervous middle-aged 
middle-class white women can't be bombers?



(*)  (which it might be, US print journalistic standards are 
higher than our British ones - if I read this in a UK paper like 
the Dally Mail or the Sun I'd assume it was some rambling racist 
fantasy put ion as political propaganda - on the other hand our 
broadcast journalism is mostly better than yours, so there)
