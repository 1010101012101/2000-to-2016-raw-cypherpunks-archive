My name is Lexus and I am contacting you today because your name is among a list of many folks who 
have expressed an interest in receiving information about home-based business opportunities. If this is
not true please accept my apologies and rest assured that you will not be contacted again. It is not my 
desire to contact anyone that does not share my interests. Your email address was sourced at:
http://www.geocities.com/emailcenter719/ Please contact here for removals/disputes e.t.c. 

If you are searching for ways to supplement your income from the comfort of your own home
I have very good news for you. A program is about to launch that has received a glowing
endorsement from many very experienced home-based business entrepreneurs. Here is the best
news! During pre-launch you can register a position at NO COST! Upon doing so you will
receive your own website that provides all of the information you will need to make an informed
decision. You will also receive support from myself and other senior members. If you like
what you see you may qualify your membership at a cost of ONLY $25 when the program launches
at the end of July. 

I have seen many so called "opportunities" come and go over the years and I have learned to be
very selective these days. If you are able to recognize a truly fine program when it is presented
to you, I invite you to request more information and I will respond within 24 hours. Please use this
link to facilitate your request: 
 
Mailto:lexuspost@netsponder.com

JUST SEND ME A BLANK EMAIL...THAT'S ALL!


Sincerely,

Lexus
 

PS. Since I registered my position in this program
on June 13, about 20,000 members have joined our program.
When folks join this quickly you know that something
special is taking place and you can benefit by acting
quickly. Launch date set as 31st July!
