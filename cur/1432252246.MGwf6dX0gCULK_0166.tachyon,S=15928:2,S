Wireless LAN Summit
Unplugged Access to Profitability
November 14-16, 2001
Boston, Massachusetts
Click on to http://www.gartnerinfo.com/g.cgi/1550783/62/us/wlan

Your final chance in 2001 to explore extraordinary WLAN profit opportunities with 
Gartner analysts
*********************************************************************

PRIORITY CODE: RA04F

Dear Joe Cypherpunk:

In the tech sector, where good news is in short supply right now, the 2002 outlook for the 
Wireless LAN space is extraordinarily bright.  

So seize this final chance to be part of the resurgence in profits and productivity by 
attending GARTNER'S WIRELESS LAN SUMMIT NOVEMBER 14-16 IN BOSTON.  
To register immediately, go to http://www.gartnerinfo.com/g2.cgi/1550783/62/us/wlan.

The news about this lucrative, growing market is compelling:
* WLAN equipment vendors and chip manufacturers are making money and 
growing while the rest of the networking industry struggles through a recession.
* Disney, UPS, BMW and other top companies are achieving remarkable ROI and 
productivity savings with WLANs.
* Wireless technology is getting faster, cheaper, easier and more secure all the 
time.

Still, as we've all learned, real profitability comes from sound decision-making.  And 
that's where Gartner analysts give you the edge. 
*Gartner's WLAN Summit is the only vendor-neutral WLAN conference being 
offered today – which means it's the only place you can get an objective appraisal 
of what's really going on with WLAN technology and what it means for your 
business.
* At the Summit, Gartner clients can book their own one-on-one half-hour 
counseling session with one of our analysts.  Get personalized, specific answers 
to your most pressing concerns.
* Case studies from key executives at UPS, Disney, BMW, and other 
companies give you a firsthand look at what it really takes to get unplugged.
* A special keynote session presented by Allan Scott from Wireless Ethernet 
Compatibility Alliance (WECA).
* You'll walk away with an actionable plan for setting up your own WLAN.
* You'll achieve significant financial savings based on the pragmatic advice 
and suggestions of Gartner's WLAN analysts.

END 2001 ON A HIGH NOTE:  LEARN WHAT YOU NEED TO PROFIT IN 2002
All major WLAN issues will be covered including:
* ROI:   Discover the real financial savings and improved productivity you can 
expect by getting unplugged.
* Security:  What it takes to manage and control your WLAN – especially for 
telecommuting and traveling employees.
* Traffic Demands:  How to optimize traffic on your enterprise network
* Technology:  The verdict on Bluetooth, 802.11, 3G and WLAN application 
infrastructure.
