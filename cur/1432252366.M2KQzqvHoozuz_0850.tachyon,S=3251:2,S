Yes, a corollary to 2) is that by saving our fellow man, we are saving
ourselves as well.  The elitist idea that it doesn't make any difference
what happens to the little people is wrong-headed.  Because the world is set
up to make cars affordable for the little people, you and I can have
personal automotive transportation at a fraction of the cost if we were to
try and assemble them up in Galt's Gulch.  If crypto gets wide-spread use by
the little people, our use will be lost in the noise.
