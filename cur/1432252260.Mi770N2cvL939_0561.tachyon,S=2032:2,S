    FBI may collect juveniles' DNA
By Richard Willing, USA TODAY
WASHINGTON  DNA profiles from hundreds of thousands of juvenile
offenders and adults arrested but not convicted of crimes could be added
to the FBI's national DNA crime-fighting program under a proposed law
moving through Congress.
The law, if enacted, would be the greatest single expansion of the
federal government's power to collect and use DNA since the FBI's
national database was created in 1992. The FBI says its national DNA
database holds genetic profiles from about 1.4 million adults convicted
of state and federal crimes.
