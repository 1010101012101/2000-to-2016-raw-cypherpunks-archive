This is misguided.  You can't involve the general public when you 
are going to be doing something illegal.  The guy announces, "we 
will have secured the bridge...." to the general public and every 
and every LEO in nine states dispatches officer friendly to make 
sure it doesn't happen.  

So you have a problem.  You can open the border *IF* you don't blab 
about it so the public can cross, or you can announce it to the 
general public and watch a zillion lions converge to make sure it 
doesn't happen.  

It looks to me like this is a straight-up publicity play; the guy 
has no intent to open the border (or at least knows he won't be 
allowed to), but wants the publicity that will be generated by 
a bunch of would-be border crossers running into a bunch of lions.

Besides, the US/Canadian border is pretty permeable anyway; it's 
very long, unguarded, and has a long history of being crossed by 
unarmed individuals who didn't bring any special tools...  such 
as the draft dodgers who (unlike Quayle) couldn't afford national 
guard posts.
