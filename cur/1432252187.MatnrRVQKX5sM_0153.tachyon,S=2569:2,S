How about calling them "asyms", for Asymmetrical Warriors?  This is in 
keeping with the U.S. military nomenclature for them.

"[I]t is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is 
always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, 
or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. 
Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the 
leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being 
attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing 
the country to danger. It works the same in any country."
--Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering
