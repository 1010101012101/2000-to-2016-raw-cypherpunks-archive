Speaking about not letting the terrorists win...

My favorite MTA is qmail, for couple reasons. The TLS support is available
as a thrid-party patch. However, the support for Diffie-Hellman cipher
suites was missing, the initialization code was not there.

I borrowed code from stunnel, and implemented it into the qmail patch.
>From now on, the ephemeral keying should work there.

See http://213.246.91.154/patches/qmail/

Peer review more than welcomed. I am a very beginner in
cryptography-related programming.
