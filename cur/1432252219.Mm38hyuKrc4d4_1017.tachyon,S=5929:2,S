So what is compression/decompression? Isn't it just finding
corresponding sets using defined procedures, one set being "smaller"
than the other? Which types of procedures are allowed and which are not?

What exactly is random data? Does it have to appear to be random? Does
it have to pass some set of statistical tests to be random? If a string
or bits from a radiation source spells "Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year" in ASCII is it non-random - a message from above? If a string of
bits from a natural source ( decay etc ) matches a string of bits from
some PRNG is it somehow disqualified as truly random data? 

I think the classification random does not rule out the presence of
local patterns however obscure. If a substring of data happens to match
what is generated by some PRNG then that substring can be "compressed"
to {generator, seed, count}. The geological timescale might be involved
in matching generator outputs to input data sections or deriving
generators for subsections of data.

So, bottom line, my point, while not necessarily practical, was entirely
missed by you even as you summarized it :-)

Here we go :

"As Eric correctly points out, true random input simply cannot be
compressed, it doesn't matter how clever you are or how much time and
computing power you have access to."

This is a statement of belief isn't it? Odd.

Mike
