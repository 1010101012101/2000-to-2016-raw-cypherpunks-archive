Hi gang,

Its been a long 2 months since the 0.4.1 release, but we've finally
got the new 0.4.2 release out and ready for your consumption.  As
discussed in the meeting logs and weekly status notes, the main
change is a new streaming library which will improve reliability,
reduce latency, and get more appropriate throughput.  The new release
is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE, so you MUST UPGRADE.

The update process is largely as before - though there is one
important change, so please, read the instructions for updating on
http://www.i2p.net/download

The installer has also been changed a bit, streamlining some things,
and on windows systems, we build shortcuts on in the start menu and
on the desktop (if desired).

There have also been numerous bugfixes and improvements along the
way - please see the full list online for details:
http://dev.i2p.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgii2p/history.txt?rev=HEAD

Anyway, thats that - please update as soon as possible, because if
you don't, you wont be able to do anything on I2P at all - it is NOT
BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE (should I repeat that a third time?  maybe with
blink tags?)  If anyone has any problems, please post up on the
list [1], the forum [2], or get on #i2p [3]!
