  OpenSSL version 0.9.6 Beta 1
  ============================

  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  http://www.openssl.org/

  OpenSSL is currently in a release cycle.  The first beta is now released.
  This beta is in fact two releases, one for the current mainstream
  OpenSSL, and one with an "engine" branch incorporated.  The "engine"
  branch contains an interface to external crypto libraries, which is
  currently used to support the hardware devices CryptoSwift (by CryptoSwift
  Inc), Atalla (by Compaq) and CHIL (previously called HWCryptoHook, by
  nCipher) as well as the internal OpenSSL routines.

  The two beta releases are available for download via HTTP and FTP from the
  following master locations (the various FTP mirrors you can find under
  http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

    o http://www.openssl.org/source/
    o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

  The file names of the two betas are:

    o openssl-0.9.6-beta1.tar.gz
    o openssl-engine-0.9.6-beta1.tar.gz

  Please download and test it as soon as possible.  This new OpenSSL version
  incorporates 75 changes and bugfixes to the toolkit (for a complete list
  see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES).

  Yours,
  The OpenSSL Project Team...
