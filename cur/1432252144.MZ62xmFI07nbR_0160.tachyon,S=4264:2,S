Among other reasons, mainly because it serves to make me feel a little more
accountable for what I say here. People tend to act badly when they don't have
anything at stake; it's just a symbolic 'good faith' gesture in that direction
as a reminder to keep myself honest.

"What's the matter with you that you need a reminder?" you might ask. Well,
anyone with 1) ego issues 2) a rotten temper and 3) a mean streak (sound
familiar...?) has to realize that adding a remailer to the mix makes for a
potentially toxic combination. There's too much to lose, and these issues
are just too important: if I came here to talk "to" people rather than
"at" them, anything that helps me keep a civil tongue in my head is a huge
plus. If I can't bring myself to discuss something rationally, I try to skip
it. Would that more people did the same...

It's the easiest thing in the world to hurl ad hominems at idiots you
disagree with--in real life, much less behind a remailer!--but to make an
exchange worth the time, you have to grow up and work a little harder than
that. Otherwise, why waste your breath? You'd much be better off sitting around
grousing and talking back to the TV set. How am I going to persuade anyone
if I'm content to adopt the manner of a doddering old irrelevant kook? Ugh.
A little common courtesy goes a long way: not quite there, but I'm working on
it.

I've been posting from cotse, but switched to my hushmail account
since they announced they're shutting the free service down. I feel rather
silly using a nickname these days, and anyway it's 100% pointless to assert
continuity-of-identity from one psuedoanonymous account to another.

Hope that answers your question...
