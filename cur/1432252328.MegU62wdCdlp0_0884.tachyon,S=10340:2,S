The" Appearance" Trap

No "Policy Enforcement" / "Revenue Collection" officer ("Police") has the power  to "Arrest" 
you. They can only "apprehend" and "detain" you for up to two (2) hours, -during which 
time they must take you before a "Court Officer" for "probable Cause" Hearing. it is the 
Commissioner/ Judge/ magistrate's job to determine whether the government has sufficient 
evidence to "charge" or prosecute you. it is at the "Court Officer's Office", that the detainment 
is converted to an actual "Arrest".

In order to become a "Party" to a Law suit or "Case",- government must "trick"  you (within the 
first 48 hours after "Arrest" at the "court commissioner's"/  Justice of Peace's/ Judge's 
Office) [See Riverside vs. McLaughlin ], into making "Appearance". By making "Appearance", - 
you become "a party" to the case as "Defendant".

The several "tricks" are:

(1). You must give them your Name. Until YOU voluntarily state your Name, -  they must write 
the fictitious name "John Doe" on their papers. Even if they already know you. Even if 
they have found a "Driver License" with the ALL CAPITAL LETTER fictitious name duplicate to 
yours, - they can not make the tie-in. They have to trick YOU into stating your name 
to them, or They must trick you, where:

(2.)You must agree to post a "Bail-Bond", or,

(3.)You "sign" something (Signature = "Consent to be regulated") or

(4.)You must agree to accept an "Attorney" to "Represent" you, or

(5.)You must enter a Plea of "Not Guilty" or "Guilty", or

(6.)You discuss, address or mention any facts about the case, or

(7.)You must say or write something (anything) favorable to your position or   un-Favorable to the 
Plaintiff's position, (traverse).

(8). You say or write anything admitting that there is a "case".
[The presumption being - if it is not Your "case", Why would you even acknowledge it ?] By 
acknowledging that there even is a "case", - you must be a "Party" to that case - you 
just made an "Appearance".   According to C.J.S.(California Jural Society) the only way to 
defeat being tricked into making "Appearance", is to challenge "In Personam" jurisdiction, 
and  NOTHING ELSE. The (geographical) physical location "Venue" jurisdiction, and "subject 
matter" "In Rem" (contract in commerce) jurisdiction of the Court, 
arise by "Operation of Law". (Case entry)

Returning All Papers with the "SAMPLE" "Neutral Response #1" letter, removes  the "In 
Personam", which accomplishes - they don't get "Appearance" on You. 
So, You are Not a "Party" or "Defendant" - if you send All papers back with it.   This is for 
"Defense" Mode only.

If they "Arrest" you and "Take you in" - DON'T EVER give your name. To do so, is to 
voluntarily enter into a "Contract " with the court - and You have made an "Appearance" in the 
"Case". Exercise your "Miranda" "Right to remain silent" and DON'T SIGN ANYTHING (No 
Bond papers, No "Finger Print Card", No."Photograph Card", No "Personal effects" 
voucher, etc.), where they only have 48 Hours to hold you, and trick you into "Appearance", or 
Release you (See Riverside vs. McLaughlin- Calif.).

Also, - If they "Arrest" you, - have a Friend (after the 49th Hour) serve the "Riverside vs. 
McLaughlin Law Suit" on the Plaintiff "STATE OF of I and District Prosecuting Attorney, and 
the "Keepers" at the jail (or wherever they are holding you). They will contact their "Lawyer" to 
ask about it. He will advise them to let you out, immediately, rather than face additional 
damages from the "Law Suit".

When in the Court, - When they ask you a question, ANY question - Don't say Anything. Don't 
give, write, or say your Name. When they say, - "What's your name?" Say "I am not 
'authorized' to sign anything." When they ask you a question, (such as "What's Your Name?"), 
say "I don't have enough information or knowledge to form a responsive answer" or "I 
Object" or "I don't Understand."  
(To "understand"- is to "stand" "under"; be subordinate; be "subject" to.) 

Note. If the "Judge" enters a Plea (for you) of "Not Guilty". You must ask "Is that a 
"Administrative" decision or a "Judicial" Decision" ? When he says "Judicial". - (or "both") - 
You 
say "On the Record" , "Thank you Your Honor, for the "Acquittal that I am "Not Guilty" I and 
WALK OUT OF THE COURT.   DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ELSE TO ANYONE. 
SIMPLY WALK OUT.

"'If he orders the Bailiff or other "Court Officer" to apprehend you or You will be in "Contempt Of 
Court", - say "If you are Not going to honor your own 'Decision', -  I hereby serve 
NOTICE of Appeal" (State vs. Adams, K- Mart Corp vs. Salmon, "Malicious Prosecution", and 
"Abuse of Process".
