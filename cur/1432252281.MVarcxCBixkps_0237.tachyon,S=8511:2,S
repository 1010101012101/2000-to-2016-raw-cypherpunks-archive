Anyone gigling? Notice that the amount he cheated the government out of 
could have easily payed the salaries of a bunch more IRS agents.

This guy should receive an Official Cypherpunk award. Or does he not deserve 
one 'cause he got caught?

>I.R.S. Accuses Man of Hiding $450 Million
>  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

>ASHINGTON, Feb. 28 - A prominent telecommunications entrepreneur who once
>tried to mount a rescue of a Russian space station has been arrested and
>charged with evading taxes by hiding at least $450 million of income
>through offshore corporations.
>
>According to a 12-count indictment released on Monday that federal
>prosecutors called the largest criminal case of individual tax evasion, the
>entrepreneur, Walter Anderson, 51, did not pay over $210 million in federal
>and local income taxes he owed for the years 1995 through 1999 alone.
>
>"Mr. Anderson ran the table when it came to violating the tax laws," Mark
>W. Everson, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, told a news
>conference Monday. "Because of his dishonest dealings, Mr. Anderson's
>lavish lifestyle was subsidized by honest, hard-working Americans."
>
>In 1998 Mr. Anderson, who lives in Washington, reported a total income of
>$67,939 and paid a tax of just $494. Mr. Everson said Mr. Anderson actually
>made at least $126 million that year that he never reported. From 1987
>through 1993, officials said, Mr. Anderson failed to file a tax return.
>
>Mr. Anderson is the chief executive of Orbital Recovery, a company trying
>to extend the life of telecommunications satellites. He was arrested
>Saturday at Dulles Airport outside Washington as he stepped off a plane
>from London, according to Kenneth L. Wainstein, the United States attorney
>for the District of Columbia.
>
>In court on Monday, Mr. Anderson pleaded not guilty to the charges. His
>lawyer, John Moustakas, told Magistrate Judge Alan Kay that the
>government's case was based on "innuendo and rumor."
>
>  If convicted, Mr. Anderson faces as much as 24 years in prison.
>
>Judge Kay ordered Mr. Anderson held without bail until a bond hearing on
>Thursday. Susan Menzer, a prosecutor in the case, called Mr. Anderson "a
>flight risk" who "can't be trusted."
>
>"He hasn't been listening to judges for years," she added.
>
>  Since a search warrant was executed in 2002, Mr. Anderson has moved
>artwork and cash to Switzerland to defeat both tax collectors and creditors
>who have civil court orders, the Justice Department said in court papers.
>
>Mr. Moustakas did not return a phone call seeking comment.
>
>Mr. Anderson has long attracted a certain level of public attention,
>especially when he tried to arrange a rescue of the Mir space station five
>years ago. He frequently flew in a private jet and made deals involving
>millions of dollars. At conferences on space travel he often spoke of his
>hatred of government.
>
>But he came under scrutiny, law enforcement officials suggested, only
>because of a tip from a disgruntled business associate.
>
>  Mr. Anderson, according to the indictment, formed an offshore 
>corporation,
>Gold and Appeal Transfer, in the British Virgin Islands in 1992 to hide his
>profits from deals involving a telecommunications company he started in the
>1980's.
>
>Over the next three years, the indictment charged, Mr. Anderson set up a
>network of offshore corporations, including one in Panama under the alias
>Mark Roth, that were used to hide his ownership of three telecommunications
>companies and allow him to earn hundreds of millions of dollars without
>paying taxes.
>
>  While Mr. Anderson at times insisted publicly that he was worth no more
>than $4 million, he serves as a senior business adviser to Constellation
>Services International, a fledgling satellite rescue company that disclosed
>his ownership of several companies, including Gold and Appeal. Its Web site
>said Gold and Appeal was worth at least $100 million and described Mr.
>Anderson as selling the Esprit Telecom Group in 1998 for $900 million.
>
>  In extensive filings with the I.R.S. and the Securities and Exchange
>Commission, the indictment charged, Mr. Anderson claimed that he was merely
>an employee of Gold and Appeal, the offshore bank that the indictment says
>was central to his tax-evasion effort.
>
>  "The I.R.S. holds all Americans, even the very wealthy, to the same

>Besides avoiding federal taxes, the indictment charges, Mr. Anderson also
