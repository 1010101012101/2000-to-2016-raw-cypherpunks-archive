We still don't know, and likely will never know, what is in the
Snowden collection. Admirable as his courage may be, he
erred in handing it over to media incapable of assessing the
whole wad, which has led to the teasing and hyperbolized
accounts valorizing crypto to armor info-warriors.

Perhaps more capable assessment is being done and will
be made public in a credible fashion instead of the goofy
call for debate before much is known beyond rhetoric and
hype. The heavy-handed redactions suggest official advice
threats and culling, and do not augur well for seeing the rest.

Stupid claims of hiding the collection, insurance as stupid as
that of WikiLeaks, stupidly sending some or all of it to other
parties, come across as patent dissimulation of the comsec
advertising type.

Comsec is now a fat mark-up of junk, espoused by stupid
comsec advisers to journalists as if a saintly medallion to
stop a bullet.
