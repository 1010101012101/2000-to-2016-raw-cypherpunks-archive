Could they find out without stalking that she left work phone at home
and went away? Was she supposed to be available 24/7? If not, is it
legal to spy on worker after work hours and out of workplace (sure,
some agencies may have it in the job contract, explicit or not, but
other employers?).

Oh, btw. Can she be punished if she forgot to charge her phone (say,
can she be punished for being tired after work hours)? Can she be
punished if after work she fell asleep in bath / made love / was
learning Japanese / playing drums and didn't hear the ring (in case
they wanted to check if she's with her phone)?

Sure, it may look strange if one day she plays drums, another day
makes love and yet another saws trees to build a DIY coffee table. But
so what?

Tomasz Rola
