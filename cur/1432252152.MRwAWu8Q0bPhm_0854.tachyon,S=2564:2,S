Can't be too short, less than about a third the size of the modulus you start
running into problems [*], which, with the sizes you're suggesting (you would
need, what, a 100K+ bit key to do this?) would make signature generation pretty
slow too.

Easier to do standard RSA and then encrypt the whole thing with a 64 or 80 bit
symmetric key.
