Swiss firm offers digital "Fort Knox" beneath the Alps



May 31 10:56 AM US/Eastern


A Swiss computer services firm is offering to stock sensitive business data
for companies in secure servers located in ex-army bunkers deep beneath the
Alps.

The company, C-Channel, which specialises in banking software, claims that
the data will be stocked "deep beneath the ground, protected from theft,
fire, computer viruses and hackers."

"We have already set up several servers in two disused bunkers in the
Alps," Rene Reinli, a company executive told AFP.

The company says the service amounts to a "Swiss Fort Knox," in deference
to the fortress which houses the US gold reserves.

However, business customers can access up to 200 megabytes of storage space
directly at any time with security codes.

The physical entrances to the disused army bunkers near the small western
Swiss towns of Saanen and Zweisimmen are under private guard, Reinli said.
