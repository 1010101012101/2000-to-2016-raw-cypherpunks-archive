This is complete and utter nonsense.  Popular fissionable elements are 
long-lived alpha emitters, which require little shielding.  Properly 
moderated, criticality can be achieved with a few kilograms of material.

Some fission triggers for thermonuclear weapons are small enough to fit in 
a suitcase, and could be employed as standalone small nukes.

Does anyone remember DOD's nuclear grenade?

While the stories of suitcase nukes may be nonsense, they are not nonsense 
because such devices are impossible to construct, or last only a few 
months.
