This development wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120

upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annua||y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mil|i0n for a

its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
