      I think you're getting a little off-track here --- the original
discussion was about whether the court could make the journalist turn
over *all copies* of a document. She wasn't trying to destroy them to
hide anything,
      As others have stated, if you don't keep logs, or throw away all
your reciepts, there's not jack they can do about it --- the interesting
question is whether or not they can somehow expect you to turn over
*all* copies of a document you've published on freenet or mojo. And
whether they are encrypted or not is irrelevant.
      Although really, the most serious question everyone should be
asking is why the court wants "all" copies.
