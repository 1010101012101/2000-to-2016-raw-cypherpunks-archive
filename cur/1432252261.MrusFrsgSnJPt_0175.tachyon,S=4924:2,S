Subject: Re: [IP] FCC order on VOIP snooping

Lee (and Dave),

The good news is that the recent FCC orders (last fall and last
Wednesday) only extended CALEA (wiretapping design mandates) to reach
broadband service providers and "interconnected" VoIP providers
(i.e., VoIP providers that offer a service that can both connect
calls out to the PSTN, the regular phone network, and receive calls
from the PSTN).  So in its current form (as you describe it) the peer-
to-peer audio system would not be covered by CALEA.

The bad news is that if the FCC's extension of CALEA is upheld in the
face of legal challenges, it is certainly possible that the FCC would
eventually try to extend CALEA to all voice-capable technologies on
the Internet.

But the good news is that this past Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in Washington heard oral argument in four
consolidated challenges to the extension of CALEA (including one
brought by CDT), and two of the three judges were very skeptical of
the theory on which the FCC extended CALEA to broadband.  Indeed,
Judge Edwards called the FCC's reasoning "gobbledygook" and "totally
ridiculous."  See, e.g., http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/
article/2006/05/05/AR2006050501032.html. One certainly cannot be sure
how the court will come out based on an oral argument, and the court
was less strong on the VoIP side of the challenge, but overall the
argument was a very good sign.
