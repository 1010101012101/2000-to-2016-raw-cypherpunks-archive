Just received the below from a totally different channel. It's in the air.

1722 seems to be missing a word, perhaps "possessions"?

1859 omits "or for the restitution of a damage caused by him to another"
otherwise we're saying once a crime (e.g. of theft) has occurred, no
restitution is permitted in natural law, which I would (hopefully
obviously) disagree with.

:

   300s BC Epicurus
          Natural Justice is a symbol or expression of usefulness, to
          prevent one person from harming or being harmed by another.

   900s Islamic Theologians
          Man can rationally know that man has a right to life and property.

   1689 John Locke
          Being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in
          his life, health, liberty, or possessions.

   1682 Samuel von Pufendorf
          Among the absolute duties of anybody to anybody, the first place
          belongs to this one: let no one injure another. For this is the
          broadest of all duties, embracing all men as such.

   1722 William Wollaston
          No man can have the right to begin to interrupt the happiness of
          another yet every man has a right to defend himself and his
          against violence

   1790 Mary Wollstonecraft
          The birthright of man is such a degree of liberty, civil and
          religious, as is compatible with the liberty of every other
          individual

   1816 Thomas Jefferson
          Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will
          within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I
          do not add within the limits of the law because law is often but
          the tyrants will, and always so when it violates the rights of
          the individual.
          No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal
          rights of another, and this is all from which the laws ought to
          restrain him.

   1851 Herbert Spencer
          Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he
          infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.

   1859 John Stuart Mill
          The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
          over a member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
          prevent harm to others.

   1961 Ayn Rand
          The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of
          physical force from social relationships

   1963 Murray Rothbard
          No one may threaten or commit violence (aggress) against another
          mans person or property. Violence may be employed only against
          the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively
          against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no
          violence may be employed against a non-aggressor. Here is the
          fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of
          libertarian theory.

   L. Neil Smith
          No one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force
          against another human being, nor to delegate its initiation.

   Walter Block
          It shall be legal for anyone to do anything he wants, provided
          only that he not initiate (or threaten) violence against the
          person or legitimately owned property of another.
