Personally, I see nothing wrong with this type of technology.  Those `millions
of innocent people' which comprise the populace are, as we all know, criminals
in thought if not in deed.  Considering the laws as currently instantiated,
we all know that each so-called innocent person will commit a crime in the
future, or has committed one in the past for which they were not convicted.

There is no reason to bother considering the `rights' of criminals to not be
face-scanned as only innocent people deserve that kind of respect.  Therefore,
installing smart cameras in every corner of the world in which man might
conceivably tread is a task which should be undertake soonest.

All this whining about invasions of privacy, unreasonable search and seizure,
Constitution this, Bill of Rights that, etc. is just so yesterday.


Regards,

Steve
