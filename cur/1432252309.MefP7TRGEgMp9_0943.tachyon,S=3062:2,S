   [AnonymousHeckler] Silly punk, they don't send a van for a sneak and peak.

it's hard to sneak when you've got remote surveillance of the
perimeter.  unfortunately hiding in plain sight didn't work too well
either. (of course i'll never know the details, which is part of the
point. FOIPA has been neutered; though another try can't hurt...)

visible cams are cheap and easy (my recent favorite: "Cams from the
TPB bust" http://youtube.com/watch?v=30HF-m_I6yY ) and i like the
deterrent they provide.  wireless makes a good backup path (in
addition to primary broadband) for critical signalling and remote feed
archival; recording locally doesn't make much sense, right? :)

rcovert and wifitap style wireless transport is a great secondary path
with an amplified injector (unidirectional).  i'd love to try this at
1Mbps encoding on 700mW 900Mhz (SR9 radio) but the 2.4Ghz works well
enough at 30dBm.  don't forget those UPS's...
[i dream of a day the 802.11 MAC is dead. flawed assumptions at the
base of this stack leads to vulnerability up
transport/session/application layers too. cognitive software radios++]

regarding critical signalling: always fail safe to zeroisation upon
DoS or detection.  good key management means a false positive is easy
to recovery from.

concealed/covert cameras would be fun but difficult.  anyone have
suggestions / experience?

   coderman - with a significantly lower B.A.C. today...
