They certainly were provided to the probation officer...by the LEAs who
are easily able to monitor my InterNet activities by virtue of my use
of my REAL SocialSecurityAdministration Issued NAME in connection
with the accounts.
OfCourseOfCourse[TM], I suppose that, technically, my Release Conditions
require that I personally inform my PO immediately upon acquisition of any
new accounts, but realistically, since the Torture and Abuse that I have
suffered at the hands of the Federal Government have left me in such a
debilitated Medical Condition that even remembering to feed myself and
wipe my ass are major projects, it would seem that the same results are
already being attained by my using accounts which are easily identified by
the very same LEAs that my PO would be reporting my use to, anyway.

Uhhh....sez who?
My memory suggests that I specifically pointed out that much of
the evidence in my case resided on CypherPunks archives which
I would need to access.
Beyond that, I don't recall being specifically told not to post to
the list, although I vaguely recall suggesting that I didn't forsee
doing so, except in regard to my legal matters.
DISCLAIMER: OfCourseOfCourse[TM], since *I* am the one who
requires CopiousQuantities [WordOfTheDay: EveryBody SCREAM!!!]
of medications in order to remember to wipe my ass, I would hardly be
so bold as to suggest that I was *not* told to totally refrain from
posting to the CPUNX Disturbed Male LISP...

True, but to make ComplimentaryComments would have involved
*lying*...
Besides, the derogatory comments were in basically the same form
that they will take in my 2255 Motion to the Court, where the truth
is, I understand, required by law.

Not exactly true. I vaguely remembered having gotten a HotMail
email account and provided several approximations of what I
thought the account might be named, at which point the SSAgent
provided *me* with the name of the account, which was
lamer11@hotmail.com. (Indicating that the LEAs are, in fact,
better qualified to provide my PO with my account information
than I, myself, am...)

Oops...
Yeah, I think that is KindaSorta right. As a matter of fact, I recall
asking for something from Probation in writing informing me of any
restrictions on my InterNet activities, but I never got one--not even
a copy of the enclosed 'Probation Report' that everyone else in the
world has seemed to have already read.
However, as a result of John Young and Declan McCullagh's
diligence in getting this important information to me, I have just
deleted the CPUNX Disturbed Male LISPs from my email
address book, and can now add a print out of the 'Probation
Report' to my list of things to carry with me and periodically
read in an effort to remind myself of the current status of my
restrictions on freedom.

If it was a thourough inspection, then why was the MountainOfTrash
in my room left undisturbed? (I was hoping THEY [TM] would bag
it and take it away as evidence, but no such luck...)

TRANSLATION: After three years of UnConstitutional Denial of Proper
Medical Care, and SubsequentSubjection to Criminal Torture&OR&Abuse
for exhibiting symptoms of my untreated Medical DisAbilities, it should
come as no surprise to anyone that, absent clear written instructions as
to the limits and restrictions on my InterNet activities and 'Acceptable
Content' regarding my communications, it is unreasonable to expect me
to fulfill sometimes vague and confusing verbal requests or demands.
