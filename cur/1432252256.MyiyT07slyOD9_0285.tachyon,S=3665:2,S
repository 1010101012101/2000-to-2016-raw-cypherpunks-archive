"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." 
		-Matthew 5, verse 5. 

Think about that, though.  While it may have seemed reassuring 
to our ancestors, who did not anticipate modern capabilities for 
destruction, what exactly will be left for the meek to inherit, 
after all the non-meek run roughshod over this sorry old planet 
until it becomes too decripit for them to exploit and they go 
elsewhere leaving it to the meek?  

I don't think prime real estate, exactly,  Perhaps a near-barren 
rock with a poisonous radioactive atmosphere and a few surviving 
species of insects and fungus. Perhaps less than that.

I regard that one verse, and its implications, as one of the most 
dire, tragic, and hopeless of all the prophecies in the bible.
