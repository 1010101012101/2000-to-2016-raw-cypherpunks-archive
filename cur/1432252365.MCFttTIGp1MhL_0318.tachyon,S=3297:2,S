#    Group accused of operating bank to defraud IRS
#    
#    10.54 a.m. ET (1609 GMT) November 17, 2000
#    
#    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An Oregon-based tax resistance group 
#    operated a "warehouse bank'' that allowed hundreds of people 
#    to illegally conceal income and assets from the IRS, a federal 
#    indictment alleges.
#    
#    Six people listed in the indictment were arrested and another 
#    was being sought, authorities said.
#    
#    The nine-count indictment filed Wednesday in federal court charges 
#    the seven members of the Christian Patriot Association of 
#    conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and violate 
#    federal income tax laws.
#    
#    Members of the group have declared themselves sovereign citizens 
#    exempt from paying taxes, officials said.
#    
#    The illegal bank, operated out a warehouse just east of Portland, 
#    offered customers anonymous banking transactions to conceal income 
#    and assets, according to IRS Special Agent Kathleen Sulmonetti. 
#    Nine hundred customers deposited $186 million in the warehouse 
#    bank with the money then being shuffled into legitimate commercial 
#    bank accounts, she said.
