[Disclosure: I work on SecurID]. 

This was discussed on Perry's Cryptography list last week.

It does look kind of like a "dumbed down SecurID" - but what 
it looks like even more is an ActivCard keychain token 
http://www.activcard.com/activ/products/end_user/activ_card_one/index.html
repackaged into a bigger form factor. The code generation scheme
appears similar as well. The Company Info page reveals that 
ActivCard actually manufactures the device. 

I'd be nervous about a availability with centralized servers,  
even if they are "triple redundant with two sites". DDOS 
attacks, infrastructure (backhoe) attacks, etc, could all 
wreck havoc.

I also wonder about scalability with centralized servers. A BBC article
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2334491.stm
claims 600 authentications/second, in a system which cost UKP 1M
in hardware alone. This is not really good enough if you're trying to
cover the world (or even just Britain) from one site. AOL gets about 
*50,000* login attempts per second at peak times, to give one admittedly 
extreme example.
