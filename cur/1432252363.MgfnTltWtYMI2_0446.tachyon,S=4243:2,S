I find his tone here curious since he is also quite insistent that NSA
abuse is fairly mundane and - while agreeing with calls for more
technical controls - seems perfectly happy to consider the existing
ones good enough to agree with the NSA's assertions "no harm, no
foul"..

I also think that assertion of human control is glib-ludicrous,
especially after calling out (rightfully) Greenwald's sudden
"expertise" on all matters technical.

I like Foust generally but he keeps getting the idea of controls
balanced against human activity wrong IMO. -Ali
