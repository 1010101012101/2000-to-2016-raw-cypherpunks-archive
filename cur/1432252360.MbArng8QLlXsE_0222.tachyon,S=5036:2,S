Correct at present.  Ultimately DNA will include it's own custom mesh
routing protocol that drives an overlay mesh so that operating system
cooperation is not required, thus maximising portability.  It will
also support asynchronous and highly partitioned mesh networks.

Yes.

That is right for now.  The overlay mesh will change things a bit, but
DNA will still do phone number to address resolution, it is just that
the addresses will be 256 bit public keys instead of IPv4 based SIP
addresses.  SIP will go by the way side as well, to be replaced by
something more suited to lossy wireless meshes.

It is pretty tied to posix, not unix.  Windows and practically every
other operating system supports most of posix.
There will be some OS specific code.

You do not need to first port BATMAN to produce something of value.
In the long term, Serval will be based on the increasingly pluripotent
Serval DNA daemon (which will probably get a rename from dna to
servald or similar at some point), that will handle everything, and
just need hooks to the audio and network channels on the host device.

Thus a C# port of DNA is exceptionally valuable.  It will also serve
as a good basis for a port to Windows.

Paul.
