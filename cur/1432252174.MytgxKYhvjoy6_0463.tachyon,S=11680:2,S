I don't accept this. You should be able to: generate traffic dumps 
pointing to the 'help field', and showing where it fits within the SSL
specifications. This is hardly rocket science.  There is no need to
compromise anyone whatsoever. Put forward the evidence, so we
can independently confirm it.

This sort of thing happens every year or two on this list. Someone
makes a claim which, if true, has interesting and/or important
implications. However, the nature of the claim is one which is
quite capable of verification. The onus is placed on the claiment
to 'put up or shut up'. Usually, they shut up. Examples of
such claims include:

* PGP has a secret backdoor. (OK: Here's the source: Where is it?)
* gcc is hacked to stick secret backdoors into PGP. (OK: Here's the source:
Where is it?)
* All gcc binaries will stick the PGP hacking code into gcc when compiling
gcc.
     (Here's a dump: show us.)
* Emily Dickinson hid her boyfriends initials in her poems. 
	(Here's some statistical tests you need to run: Show us).

So I call upon you: Put up or Shut up.

Huh? "Doesn't talk about it"? It was announced with fanfare at the 
RSA Data Security conference a few years ago. There were press
releases. It was widely discussed on this list. I invented the term
'espionage enabled' to describe this kind of application. Lotus got
a lot of flack about it, but persisted. Some customers even bought
it, noteably the Swedish government (See Risks Digest
http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.52.html#subj1).

Well, it could mean that they want to use Web features available in 
later versions but not in earlier ones. Or maybe there are known 
security holes in earlier editions. Wells Fargo has actually been 
ahead of the curve at times: they were one of the first sites to
require 128 bit encryption.

Is it after BXA? Bruce notes that the stories are all at least two years
old,
which would place them in very early 1997 at latest. I can't remember when
the switch took place. Of course, if LG was doing this (and I have no real
doubt that the NSA might try), it's excreable, but what is the relevance to
products today? He can no longer seriously threaten to hold up export.

Actually, I know of at least one other case where a major exec at a
crypto company threw NSA people out on their ears after they 
offered to write some software to help with a project.

I think you're confusing two different types of subversion.

1. Company policy based subversion.

This is the type where word comes down from above to put in 'helper
fields', etc. I can't see this happening in any company which was not
simply a LEA front (such as Crypto-AG). The liability would be simply
too great, the exposure too likely. This would require a large number
employees and former employees to know, yet keep their mouths 
shut. When exposed, the officers of the company would be subject
to criminal fraud and conspiracy charges, as well a variety of civil
suits. It's simply a non-starter. Lew Giles can make as many pleas
as he wishes; but I don't think he'll get many results.

2. Individual treachery.

This type involves corrupting one or more engineers, whether via money,
threats, or misplaced appeals to patriotism. This is more likely to 
succeed in the short term than type 1, but is very fragile for several 
reasons familiar to anyone who has done commercial software development.

* Peer code reviews mean that many eyes look at the code.
* Employee turnover in the field is high - 30-50% year. Thus, bugs
  inserted by earlier compromised employees are unlikely to
  last through many release cycles, as new employees come in
  and say 'Oops - Joe forgot to init the PRNG properly - lets fix
  that!'
* Source code management systems make it very difficult to a single
  actor to monkey with code secretly, and even harder to cover his
  tracks.

Actually, it's pretty clear what happened with most of those cases
where companies were allowed to ship strong crypto overseas
before most of the restrictions were lifted. They all involved products
where at least one party of the communications was a large
organization or company which was subject to, and could be counted
on complying with, sub poenas and court orders. Thus the authorities
had another route by which to acquire content in which they were
interested. 

I have little doubt that government organizations have attempted to
subvert commercial crypto at various times in various ways. However,
the 'help fields' you describe are simply implausible in open protocols
such as SSL. Again, I ask you to point to the evidence. I and others
have already run the searches you suggested and come up dry. Where
are the URLs?

As it stands, you are spreading FUD.
