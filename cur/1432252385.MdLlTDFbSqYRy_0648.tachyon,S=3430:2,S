Really, Declan.

First, there was waiting for DoubleClick at your site.

Now, you are releasing articles via an URL at another
"DoubleClick" type site, akamaitech.net?

#  NIST believes that participants in the upcoming workshop would 
#  be interested in comments that include statements regarding the 
#  intellectual property and/or licensing requirements of any 
#  proposed modes.

Why have a requirement, beyond making standards?

----

Is that what 'NIST' stands for these days?

#    Various examples of surge capability are available in this
#    area.  One example is the deployment of National Intelligence
#    Support Teams (NIST) to "forward" areas in order to augment
#    military capabilities, as well as to assist theater commanders in
#    understanding what "national" systems can provide and how they can
#    be tasked.  The response to NIST deployments has been
#    overwhelmingly positive.  That NIST in essence provides a type of
#    synergistic, horizontal approach to collection, suggests that such
#    an approach could be beneficial on a larger, Community scale.
