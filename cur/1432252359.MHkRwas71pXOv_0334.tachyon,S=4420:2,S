<br>
Why consider C<diiv>HINA G</diiv>OLD CORP (C<font>GDC</font>)? Seee n0wadays what happened.<br>
<br>
&#8729; Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.)<br>
<br>
&#8729; HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.<br>
<br>
&#8729; China is the world's last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China's rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.<br>
<br>
&#8729; China is already the world's 4th largest producer of gold &#8776; and will soon be the world's #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!<br>
<br>
&#8729; Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.<br>
<br>
You can see China's developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare opportunity for early investors!!<br>
