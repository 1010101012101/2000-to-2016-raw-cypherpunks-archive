Yes, the treatment Bill received after raping Juanita Brodderick was 
indeed instructive.

As was the punishment he received for lying under oath, suborning 
perjury, tampering with evidence, and (very probably) having 
witnesses in his scandals killed.

(While not _all_ of the several dozen people on the Bill Hit List 
were victims of foul play, I expect many were. And about 10 standard 
deviations' worth of deaths as compared to the expected number around 
other men of similar age
