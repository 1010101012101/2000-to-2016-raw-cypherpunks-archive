Well, we're imagining systems set up deliberately to be beneficient. If 
someone wants to create an awful orwellian thing instead, they can do 
so; with enough guns they'll get everyone to register to anything.

So, leaving aside the non-technical question of "what if the creators 
are assholes with guns", let's get back to the core question; how to 
implement a fairly OK "Basic Income On Blockchain".

Firstly, basic income is the sort of system that you can likely only do 
with an external registrar for person:key correspondance, because we've 
never cracked the sock-puppet/sybil problem and might never do.

This registrar need not actually be able to *track* these people once 
registered, though; that's the whole idea behind blind signatures for 
voting, for example. The registrar could be asked by a person to sign 
their basic income allowance to any (evenly divisive of the income) 
number of sub-addresses, which would be blinded from the registrar, and 
the funds could then be redeemed zerocoin-style as income by the 
registrant. The registrar "knows" that someone's just claimed their 
income, but not to what addresses, and can therefore prevent 
double-claims. The registrant gets their income to one or many bitcoin 
addresses and can then generate new receiving addresses as usual for the 
change.

Of course, this might all be meaningless if you just used zerocoin 
instead, because with zerocoin you could just collect your coins openly 
in your own name, launder them trivially, and move on.
