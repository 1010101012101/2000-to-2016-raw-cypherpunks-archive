But why should this be limited to the book stores? The same should go for
laudries etc. In this sense we *are* talking about privileges to those
dealing with 1st Amendment protected material, like the press and book
stores. Declan's problem obviously is that while free speech has
constitutional protection in itself, here *privacy* is protected only via
extension of the 1st Amendment protection. This isn't enough.
