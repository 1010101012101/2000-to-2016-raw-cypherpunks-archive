(was: Re: Meet "badBIOS")

additional clarification regarding my last post...
https://cpunks.org//pipermail/cypherpunks/2013-November/001957.html

i did not thoroughly think through my explanation and
a large gap exists in reasoning, and so want to provide
additional explanation about how it could be possible
to defeat existing security measures via this approach


                 +------+
   attacker ---> | SCIF |
                 +------+


basically the idea of a boundary or wall around a SCIF,
even if acoustically and electromagnetically shielded, is
proposed possible to bypass via resonance and-or also
quantum effects if they were to function in a similar way

so even though a boundary could exist for EM and sound,
that separates what is outside from what is inside, it is
proposed that an attacker could potentially move through
this boundary and still interact with interior equipment via
acoustic and electromagnetic principles

what was missing from the explanation was that this
attack could occur within a context of 'other dimensions'
or additional dimensionality, versus 4D of space-time that
is presumably standardized for the basic security evaluation


    [4D] ---> [otherD] ---> [4D]


in other words, what is proposed is that resonance could
occur outside of only a 4 dimensional context, as part of
the larger nested circuitry of the cosmos, and bypass the
bounded "physics" of limited 4D space-time and its rules,
to reemerge on the inside of the SCIF security perimeter,
in a context accessed by electromagnetism and sound

(as these may be connected with, interdimensionally)


      f l a t l a n d
   ......................

                 +------+
   attacker ---> | SCIF |
                 +------+


in other words, this is to recontextualize the SCIF in
 the realm of multiple dimensions beyond space-time,
that hierarchically could exist in N-dimensions, which
is proposed to correlate with a state of absolute truth

like Flatland the novel, higher dimensions may exist
 unseen due to parameters or limits, and thus beyond
imagination, unless somehow accessing keys to the
threshold condition, the structure connecting layers

(note: relation of electromagnetism, sound; the aether)

so while an attack against a SCIF could be defeated
by electromagnetic and acoustic shielding that would
not allow such emissions to escape in 4D, seemingly,
this condition may not exist within higher dimensions
that can bypass the secure boundary, threshold, 'wall'


      f l a t l a n d
   ......................

    (otherD)--------.
       |            |
       |            |
       |            v
       |         +------+
   attacker ---> | SCIF |
                 +------+


if an attacker, for instance, had equipment that could
access this higher dimensionality, likely using acoustic
and electromagnetic technology to do so, it may involve
a circuit that exists outside 4 dimensional space-time,
and moves through a higher-dimensionality to breach
the protective barrier, reemerging on the other side of
the wall, inside the SCIF, via acoustic and EM effects,
such as resonance or perhaps quantum-correlations
due to entanglement of matter, energy, information


       f l a t l a n d
    ......................

    (otherD)    (attacker)
                    |
                    |
                    v
                 +------+
     secure ---> | SCIF |
                 +------+


likewise, a true security threat could today exist that
in this way appears entirely *invisible* because it is
functioning beyond normal perception in a 4D context
which is actually nested within higher dimensionality

and thus omniscient-like observation, surveillance, if
not political meddling and exploitation could occur from
beyond the normal realm of perception, via similar means
yet remain officially unaccounted for and unacknowledged,
though be the actual context for events that are occurring,
which tends towards a Matrix red pill or blue pill situation

in other words, the attackers could be invisible and have
the advantage of different physics, and be siphoning data
and information from other dimensionality yet basically
remain unseen or removed from immediate interactions,
though rely on avatar-like secondary relations as part of
a management scheme, in a realm as if "make believe"

note: in this context, "binary computation" could relate
to dimensionality and in this way: mathematics in 4D
could be differently patterned in higher dimensions if
not solvable via unseen correlations (math based on
patterns, dimensionality effecting their functionality,
 how the patterns relate, 'compute', via structures)


  attacker [4D] =3D=3D> [otherD] ---> SCIF: =3D=3D> [4D] equipment


thus, even in the four dimensional context, if this could
be circumvented to defeat the security barrier or wall of
the SCIF, a principle that is interdimensional such as
resonance could appear on both side of this boundary
and yet not pass through it in 4D space-time, instead
the attack would leave this realm, move into a higher
dimensionality and reappear elsewhere in 4D, within
acoustic and electromagnetic principles that involve
pairing or matching can that be remotely correlated,
as with entangled objects and acoustic resonance


  sound/em [4D] =3D=3D> [otherD] ---> SCIF: =3D=3D> [4D] sound/em


thus to clarify: the 'magic flute' of some unknown
technology would access other dimensionality via
its acoustic or other principles, and perhaps this is
also potentially ~natural or automatic- and could
reappear on the other side of the boundary, via this]
resonance or entanglement, even while the SCIF is
designed to protect against any such outside/inside
interactions, because it goes beyond 4D spacetime
and involves interdimensional circuits of connection,
seemingly fundamentally involving information itself
as this connects to matter and energy structurally

(perhaps in some ways related to information and
its hypothesized ability to escape a blackhole)

(such structures are what CERN could be dealing with
in the unmentionable Da Vinci Code realm, where the
recontextualization of dark matter and dark energy
could involve bridging into higher dimensionality)

i.e. the hack is literally "out of this world" & back
or could start in higher dimensionality from the start
or be coordinated across the dimensional boundary by
a shared-identity group attacker in multiple dimensions,
e.g. agents in 4D coordinated with higher dimensionality
where the stealth attacks could be multipronged, ~magical.
