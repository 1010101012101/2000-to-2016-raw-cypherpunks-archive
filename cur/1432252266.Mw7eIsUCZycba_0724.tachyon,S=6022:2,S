In response to the Philip Hallam-Baker message below with his
IETF draft, posted on Cryptome, these responses have been offered:

1. A 1997 paper: "Kleptography: Cryptography Against Cryptography,"
by Adam Young and Moti Yung.

http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-69053-0_6

"Kleptography: persuading the party to be intercepted to use a
form of crypto that the attacker knows they can break."

2. "Phil's background as Verisign's principal designer is wellknown,
and so are his design efforts in 'certificates, cert crypto and secure
dns'. Lesser known are his friendships with the 'men-in-black'."

I have attempted to produce a summary of the discussion so far for use as
a requirements document for the PRISM-PROOF email scheme. This is now
available as an Internet draft.<br><br>

I have left out acknowledgements and references at the moment. That is
likely to take a whole day going back through the list and I wanted to
get this out. <br><br>
If anyone wants to claim responsibility for any part of the doc then drop
me a line and I will have the black helicopter sent round.<br><br>
