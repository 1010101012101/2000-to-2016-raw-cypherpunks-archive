all the beer they can drink..."

>H.R. 3201 Carter G. Woodson Home National Historic Site Study Act of 2000

"..is a special give-back to the heirs of Carter G. Woodson to 
provide them with a government-guaranteed pension and for funs to 
support the home of Carter G. Woodson, our first Undersecretary of 
the Interior for Central Texan Agrarian Affairs."

"...mandates that all history books be rewritten to stress the role

Requires that history teachers place her alongside of Crispus Attuck, 
the Negro bystander who was unknown until the 1960s when the Johnson 
Administration forced textbook writers to make him a central figure 
in the Revolutionary War."
