SSH server public/private keys are widely deployed.  PKI public 
keys are not.  Reason is that each SSH server just whips up its 
own keys without asking anyone's permission, or getting any 
certificates.

Outlook and outlook express support digital signing and  
encryption -- but one must first get a certificate.

So I go to Thawte to get my free certificate, and find that  
Thawte is making an alarmingly great effort to link  
certificates with true name information, and with the beast  
number that your government has assigned to you, which imposes 
large costs both on Thawte, and on the person seeking the  
certificate, and also has the highly undesirable effect that  
using these certificates causes major loss of privacy, by  
enabling true name and beast number contact tracing of people  
using encryption.

Now what I want is a certificate that merely asserts that the  
holder of the certificate can receive email at such and such an 
address, and that only one such certificate has been issued for 
that address.  Such a certification system has very low costs  
for issuer and recipient, and because it is a nym certificate, 
no loss of privacy.

Is there any web page set up to automatically issue such  
certificates?

The certs that IE and outlook express accept oddly do not seem 
to have any provision for defining what the certificate  
certifies.

This seems a curious and drastic omission from a certificate  
format.

Since there is no provision to define what a certificate  
certifies, one could argue that any certification authority  
that certifies anything other than a true name connected to a  
state issued id number, the number of the beast, is guilty of  
fraud.  This would seem to disturbingly limit the usefulness  
and application of such certificates.  It also, as anyone who  
tries to get a free certificate from Thawte will discover,  
makes it difficult, expensive, and inconvenient to get  
certificates.
