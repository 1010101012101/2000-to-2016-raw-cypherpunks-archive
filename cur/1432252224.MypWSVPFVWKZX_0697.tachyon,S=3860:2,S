Subject: VeriSign to keep the .com registry?

http://www.icann.org/melbourne/proposed-verisign-agreements-topic.htm

Has anybody looked at the ICANN proposal to let VeriSign keep hold
of the .com registry servers?

Apparently NSI under VeriSign has been behaving itself, so ICANN are
wondering if they could just forget all that nasty separation stuff.

But, they do not mention anywhere the conflict of interest that will
arise if the biggest certificate seller is also the biggest registry.

I'm not sure how the DNS security discussions are going, but it would
seem that there is a conflict of interest in having VeriSign able to
influence the registry whilst also being a seller of domain certs.

Comments anyone?  (by this monday :)

(I know this is nothing to do with coding, but it does seem that
coderpunks has the greater concentration of people who understand
the security issues involved...)
