Vietnam: New clampdowns on media. Prominent former Communist party 
journalist Nguyen Vu Binh was detained on Friday as the country's newly 
elected parliament was meeting. It says material was taken from his 
computer and he is under arrest and cannot be contacted.
A California-based organisation, the Democracy Club of Vietnam says he is 
among a group of dissidents who wrote to the Communist leaders early in 
July calling for political reforms and the release of political prisoners.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, reported that the 
writer was taken from his home by police on July 19 and is believed to be 
in detention somewhere in the capital, Hanoi.
