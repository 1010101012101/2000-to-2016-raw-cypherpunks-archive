Quantum mechanics based on heisenbergs uncertainty principal is under 
attack.The two slit experiment has another explanation that even revives 
'ether'
According to electrical engineering professor,bill honig.
The theory feynman was sure no one quite understood and einstein mistrusted 
may be about to be superceded with potential to crack crypto's,holy 
grail,Quantum encryption.
Quantum mechanics is 75 years young and the cornerstone of the modern 
scientific world view.But it has its dissidents.
Bill honig's an internationally recognized inventor,journal editor and long 
time academic at curtin university.A skeptical inquirer whose doubts about 
the orthodoxy are caused by logic.
His rebellion took shape as a  teen  prodigy at a brooklyn high 
school,asking too many questions about quantum mechanics.He went into 
electrical engineering and rose high in military research.Then in 
mid-career,while working on nuclear weapons he had a change of 
heart.Looking in an atlas for a new home that might be safe and peaceful 
and passing over iceland he settled on perth.WA.au.
Believing we can and must describe the fundamental particles of matter as 
they really are there and not blurs of probability is carrying on einsteins 
fight.In this old/new picture of the subatomic world,the basic particles 
are spinning,electromagnetically
charged droplets;as they change speed they cast off expanding 
"photexes"that are compared with smoke rings,rippling outward.Space is an 
ether made up of two oppositely charged fluids.
