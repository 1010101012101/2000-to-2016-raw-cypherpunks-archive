I know how to read, and I read _Science_.  A sidebar called "American's own
prion disease" describing Chronic Wasting Disease belonging to the 
transmissable spongiform encephalopathies (like Creutzfeld-Jakob and BSE).
Vol 292 1 June 01 p 1641

Part of a larger article, "Is the US doing enough to prevent mad cow disease"
p 1639-1641
