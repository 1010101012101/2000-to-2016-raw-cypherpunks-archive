By the way, it ought be obvious to any thinking mind, but if Russia
chose to actually invade Ukraine and risk the big confront with America
and WWIII, it would have seized Ukraine's capital Kiev in about 48 hours
- less time than it would take the US to actually get its shit in order
to respond and ship over many battallians of various forces (which is,
truly, what the war hawks want the excuse to do - to be "the
policeman of the world").

The conclusion AFAICT on both sides (USA and Russia) seems to be that,
assuming no nuclear armageddon, a regular ground/air war would proceed
for a few months and America would likely reclaim Ukraine from such an
aggressive Russia, but Russia would exact a very high toll as the price
for "Western freedom".

Fortunately, this did not happen.

(And in that hypothetical, the Ukrainians would have experienced a hell
far greater, far more devastating, far more intense, and over a much
shorter time frame, than they have ever experienced (as f@#$ed up as it
is) over the last two years of civil war.)
