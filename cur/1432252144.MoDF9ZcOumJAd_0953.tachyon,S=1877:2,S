It depends on what your goal is.  As someone else on this list pointed out,
terrorism is just another form of PR.  If OBL took out (say) that huge AT&T CO
in the center of Manhattan (the skyscraper that looks like something out of a
SF film), every cellphone user in the country who's had any dealings with AT&T
would help him pack the explosives.  Sure, there'd be some economic damage,
but Joe Sixpack would barely notice, and certainly wouldn't care.  OTOH the
WTC had enough significance and enough lives involved that everyone had to sit
up and take notice.  He knew exactly what target to hit to create the biggest
mess (I offer the results in the last two years as proof).
