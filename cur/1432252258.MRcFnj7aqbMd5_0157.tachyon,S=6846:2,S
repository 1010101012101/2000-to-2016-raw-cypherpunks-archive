It does not authenticate the endpoint's identification, other than "same
place I had been talking to."

There's no difference between having no "name" and having a name you
cannot trust. I.e., I could travel under the name "anonymous" or "", or
under the name "A. Smith". If you don't know whether I am actually A.
Smith, the latter is identical to the former.

Correction: it is a proposal to extend Internet security - including
Ipsec, but also including TCP-MD5 (sometimes called "BGP MD5") and other
security mechanisms at various layers. It is not focused only on IPsec.

This is one option, but not the only one.

There are two aspects:
	- smaller portion of the packet is hashed
	- none of the packet is hashed, but a cookie is used

>The point has nothing to do with anonymity;

The last one, agreed. But the primary assumption is that we can avoid a
lot of infrastructure and impediment to deployment by treating an
ongoing conversation as a reason to trust an endpoint, rather than a
third-party identification. Although anonymous access is not the primary
goal, it is a feature of the solution.

Please review the draft; there are a number of reasons this is being
considered, not the least of which is to reduce the cumbersome
requirement of key infrastructure as well as to avoid performance penalties.

Please be more specific; how would it be better?

Address != identity. Agreed, if what you want to do is hide traffic,
this does not provide traffic confidentiality. But it does not tell you
whether the packets come from 128.9.x.x (ISI, e.g.) or from someone
spoofing 128.9.x.x; all you know is that whoever is using that address
is capable of having an ongoing conversation (TCP connection, e.g.) with
you.

I.e., there are two ways to be anonymous, as noted earlier:
	1) don't give out your name (A. Smith, e.g.)
	2) give out a name, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything
	(e.g., Mickey Mouse)

Even if you use "real" names in (2), there's no difference with (1),
since you don't know whether the real Mickey Mouse is using it.
