Which is self-referential (it basically says that even anarchism will 
oppress). <<

Indeed.Especially where delegates are not rotated and revocable.See jamesd 
for the dangers anarchism in practise.
The Friedman/May "anarcho-capitalist" crock of shit would opress like 
HELL.BE AWARE! Dont let him get away with all thet CALCer crap here.Its 
ahirstoric,amoral,unrealistic insanity.

Which raises an interesting question. How do you get everyone to behave the 
same way with the same levels of consideration under anarchism without some 
sort of universal standard (a central organization)? Who gets to decide it? 
What happens if somebody decides they don't want to play nice? How do you 
pay for it? <<

APster.Central organization,summits,world federations are all scalable and 
not to be feared as long as all democratically elected delegates are 
revocable and rotated.Its not rocket science.Everyone a remailer,(they will 
be essential,as will crypto)Everyone a mint,presumably when all the drug 
war prisoners are released there will be room for fraudsters.
Everyone an APster,.Justice by consensus complements then overtakes common 
law.Everyone a jury.
Warlords in the SW Quadrant? Put together a 'sandline' army and knock them 
out.Commo's opressing bears?
Lets all vote on nuking commie HQ.Operation soft drill International,only 
there will be no more 'nations'.
Can you dig it? CAN YOU DIG IT? Anarchy is not just a job; Its an Adventure.
