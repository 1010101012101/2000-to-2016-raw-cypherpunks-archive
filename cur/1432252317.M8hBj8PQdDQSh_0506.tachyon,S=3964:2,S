In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I'm bouncing 
between voting for Bush as a "do the least damage" (on gun issues, 
tax issues, foreign affairs, etc.) and voting for Browne of the LP on 
"feelgood" issues.

(In that I'll feel better in coming years being able to think to 
myself: "I didn't vote for that Bush clown...I voted my principles!")

However, as any vote is of marginal importance, as with the 
amelioration issue you mention, I'm still undecided. Needless to say, 
neither Gore nor Nader are in my universe of choices, however.
