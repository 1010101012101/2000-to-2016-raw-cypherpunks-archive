An alternative method, discussed privately with another CP list member, 
would have the sender could provide a response-inbound message appropriate 
for each remailer in the chain and imbed this with the outbound message 
(maybe in the header). This imbedded message would be a concentrically 
wrapped and encrypted message just like the sender's outbound message, but 
constructed so it would backward chain to the originator.  Might not even 
be to the same address as the sender's to obfuscate the linkage. Similar to 
reply block.

My preference is using a Web server interface in the remailer to allow the 
originator's client to automatically check the progress of their message.
