I guess my idea of a productive mailing list excludes posts about
technologically unworkable ideas from people who will never be able to
implement them that will never be adopted under the FB aegis. I think
that that's stupid, and I'm not afraid to say so.

It seems that you're okay with that, and that's okay -- it just means
you have more free time to read and ponder mailing list messages than I
do, or have a much lower possibility barrier when faced with possible
time investments.

But considering how vemently you attacked me for making a flip comment
about how I hoped unproductive/stupid mailing list traffic would
decrease on the freedombox list in the presence of an organized group
advancing the FBF agenda, I think at this point it's more probable that
you're just pissed off that I called you out for putting too much faith
in electoral democracy than that you have a strong inclination to defend
unproductive mailing list postings.
