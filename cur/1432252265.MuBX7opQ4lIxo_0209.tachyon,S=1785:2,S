As a white man, I find the implication that I'm lacking some "color"
based on my race to be offensive.  I often hear "of color" used
(Pacifica radio is quite guilty) as a term of exclusion and division,
implying that white people are soulless: they can't jump, can't dance,
can't fuck, and can't understand social justice.  Frankly, as a racist
term.
