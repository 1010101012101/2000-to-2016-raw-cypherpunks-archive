This is a known problem, and I have a patch pending for the next merge
window to address this.

The Chrome browser in particular is a very heavy /dev/urandom user,
and this is causing the problem you describe below:

With my recent change, /dev/urandom becomes much more like a
periodically seeded CRNG, where we aren't even pretending to extract a
bit of entropy from the input pool for each bit sent to userspace.  If
you want that, then you should use /dev/random.

There are some good questions here.  Some of them have been recently
addressed, others have not been yet.  I don't have time right now to
go through them all in detail, but I will put this on my reading list.

Some quick notes: I have considered the possibility of replacing the
output pools with something that uses AES instead, which would be
especially useful for those architectures which have an AESNI-like
instruction.  That's obviously something that would require a lot of
thinking and prototyping before making such a major change, though.

As far as your comments about /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
usually being close to zero, I'm currently running an upstream kernel
with the dev branch of the random.git tree merged in, and things are
significantly improved on that score:

% cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail 
2847

On a process note, there is a huge amount of interest about
/dev/random that has been demonstrated on this mail thread, and while
some seem to be from people who haven't necessarily looked at the
actual drivers/char/random.c source code, nor are interested in
proposing specific changes, your comments above indicate that you have
done this, and I very much appreciate your thoughts.

Is the cryptography mailing list the best place to be having these
discussions?  There is the moderation delay, and I'm also not sure how
eager the moderators are about having the mailing list taken over by
people talking about code patches, etc., on this list.  I wonder if we
should create a separate mailing list, perhaps a
linux-random@vger.kernel.org, and take the more technical discussions
to that mailing list.

P.S.  If there are folks who will be at the LISA Conference in
Washington, D.C, I'm hoping to meet with Matthew Green and try to
interest him into doing a detailed look into at the random driver, and
perhaps dragoon some of his students into evaluating entropy sources
on various embedded Linux platforms.  If there are other people who
are interested in talking /dev/random while I'm in DC, I've
tentatively blocked off the afternoon of Tuesday, November 5th for
that purpose.  Let me know off-line....
