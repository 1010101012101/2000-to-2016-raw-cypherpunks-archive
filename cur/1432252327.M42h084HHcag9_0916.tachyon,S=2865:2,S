I dunno...as an ex-optical engineer/physicst, I'm sceptical about this whole 
scary "tempest" bullcrap. Even if it can be made to work fairly reliably, I 
suspect deploying it is extremely costly. In contrast, the main benefit of 
CALEA is that they can merely provision their copy of a circuit to go back 
to VA or wherever. They can be eavesdropping while surfin porn all without 
leaving their desk and cup of coffee. Hey--if they want me that bad these 
days, it would probably be cheaper just to send the van and beat whatever 
they need out of me.

Actually, I suspect that Tempest is some kind of smokescreen..."Don't bother 
encrypting because we have this super-technology called tempest that can 
read your mind anyway."
