Myth.

29 people were killed in an real IRA bombing in Omagh in 1998. This
was a shopping High Street full of people.

The warning given was incorrect and _increased_ the number of deaths
because the terrorists said, probably on purpose, the wrong end of the
street and the people were moved towards the bomb.
