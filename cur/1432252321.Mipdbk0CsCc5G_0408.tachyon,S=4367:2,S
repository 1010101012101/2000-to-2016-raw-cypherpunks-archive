Bork Still In Hospital

MAYDAY DC Activist still in hospital
Bork suffered an asthma attack yesterday while in custody of US Marshals. 
She was arrested Friday morning during the MAYDAY DC action at Franklin 
School. Her asthma attack was most likely triggered by chemicals used to 
clean cells. (Her asthma problem was originally caused by the sadistic 
Philadelphia Police when she was sprayed a large quantity of pepper spray 
straight in the mouth during the RNK2000 protest. She’s been suffering 
respiratory problems ever since.) She was rushed to Howard University 
Hospital after her release – sometime around 3:00 PM yesterday. She was 
treated in the emergency room and looked OK in the evening. However today 
her condition deteriorated. She is visibly in pain, very pale, and will 
spend a second night in the hospital. She’s also quite irritable (ask 
Earthworm)! The phone number in her room is 202-865-5420.
