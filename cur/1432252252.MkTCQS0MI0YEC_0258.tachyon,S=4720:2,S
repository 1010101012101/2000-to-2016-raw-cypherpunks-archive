Bear may not be as far off the mark as you think. Remember back when the
hot news of the day was militia groups how advocating the violent
overthrow of the government and playing soldier in the woods could
constitute intent? Can that twisted reasoning be applied to advocating
the use of code to obsolete the government and then actually creating
code? Should the political speech and coding action be separated? Is
participating in both risky? I consider code to be publishing and speech
but look at some of the recent GRUsa activity that addresses that issue.

Get ready for "to code is to act." Whoops, it's here. Just title your
application "Espionage Communications Suite with Government Overthrow
Features" and package the speech and the act up nice and neat for the
GRU. 

This can't really be the case, can it?

This little gizmo is not new but I like it and it's only $30 at an AT&T
Wireless store. It looks like it would be a nice companion ( assuming
one could make a very tiny uP-based adapter ) for an iPaq. I find those
folding kybs to be ugly.
