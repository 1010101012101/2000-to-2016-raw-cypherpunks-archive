	It's not size, it's Mass. 

	What size was the extinguisher? It wasn't mentioned in any of the 
reports I saw, but I was picturing a rather large (25 pound PKP or CO2 sized
extinguishers) one. 

	If that is the case, it contains rather more energy, even when thrown,
than a .38.

	No, it isn't. It's a lot less force concentrated into a small area.

	Really. 
	
	Ever been hit by one of them? 

	Given the mass of one (assuming it was one of the bigger ones), it
most certainly could cause bodily injury--but that isn't really the point. 
And let's not even talk about what could have happened would the neck of a 
pressurized extinguisher break.

	You are in a crowd of hostile people. You are there because you were 
ordered up by your government, not because it's part of your normal job. You 
are young. You are more than a little scared (ever been in the middle of a 
protest that is running up against police force? It's not a peaceful situation). 

	Suddenly some masked nitwit throws something big and heavy at you. You 
don't know what it is. You've been hearing shit all day like "Revolution is 
the only solution", you have no idea what these people are up to. You've 
read shit on the internet about these "black blocks" and "street actions",
and your nervous. And all of the sudden the window shatters (maybe you get 
hit with glass, maybe you don't, doesn't matter). 

	Thing is, *you* didn't initiate force. The masked man did. And he's 
not wearing some sort of goofy holloween mask, he's dressed like a freaking
bank robber. 
	
	It is very easy to understand why a shit scared 20 year old started 
shooting. 

	It's hard to understand why supposedly rational people condemn him 
and wish to excuse the actions of some idiot hooligan. 

	Free speech stops with *THREATENING* others, much less any sort 
of initiation of violence. 

	Did the kid in the Mask deserve to die? Yes. Not so much for throwing
the extinguisher, but for terminal stupidity.

>bodily injury. It's not justification for lethal force).

	It is at minimum because once someone in a protest starts something
like that, it usually grows. 

	Further more, getting glass in ones eyes *CAN* blind you, depending on
the force with which it hits gets in, etc. Glass, expecially in the eyes, is 
very difficult for a doctor to find and extract, and it's *really* sharp, so if 
it gets to the back of the eye (where the nerves are), I can see it doing a 
great deal of damage.
