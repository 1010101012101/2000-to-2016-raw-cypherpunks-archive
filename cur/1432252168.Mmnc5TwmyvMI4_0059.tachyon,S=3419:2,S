Well, the MPAA v 2600 case ("constructing and trafficing in a
circumvention device") isn't about reverse engineering, so "not at all".

The weaker DVD-CCA case ("theft of a trade secret in violation of a
clickthrough licence agreement" (said agreement having been clicked
through by a minor in anither country, of course)) depends on how the
reverse-engineering Connectix did relates to that done by the original
CSS extractors.
