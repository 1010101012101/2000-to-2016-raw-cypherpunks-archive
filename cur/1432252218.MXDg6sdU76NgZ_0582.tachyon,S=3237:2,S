BO, trojans, http tunelling and similar are really not rocket science
these days. 99% of sheeple machines are vulnerable. This is perfectly
valid and real attack. Not on my machines and probably not on yours -
that does not make any difference.

This is just another data point supporting secure devices insulated
from microshit OS, java and wintels in general. Running PGP in the
environment where attachment execution and/or java and/or activex are
tolerated does not make any sense.

And *THERE ARE* tools that offer real protection. Look up iButtons
running RSA and holding the secret key. If it's not sold in Wallmart
that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
