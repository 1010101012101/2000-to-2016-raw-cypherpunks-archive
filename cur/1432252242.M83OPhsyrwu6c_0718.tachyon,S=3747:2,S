They're not contradictory because the market they exist in now isn't
'free'. Just another example of your poor reasoning. Telling somebody
'quite taking advantage of that person' is not the same thing as 'give
that that or else'.

What is contradictory is to say one believes in a 'free market' and then
actively support a non-free market by such commentary as you provide
above. "If they don't like it, they can leave."; never mind they can't
leave. Very convenient that.
