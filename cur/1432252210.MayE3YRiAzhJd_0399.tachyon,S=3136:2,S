Subject: [liberationtech] DM-Steg - a deniable block device driver for Linux
X-Mailer: Evolution 2.32.3 

An interesting deniable filesystem implementation for Linux has recently
appeared:

http://dmsteg.sourceforge.net/

http://dmsteg.sf.net/Steg.pdf

This looks well-matched to using with something like the Tails USB
distro: allocate half a gig of your USB stick for Tails, have Tails fill
the rest of it with random data on first boot, and now it's impossible
to tell whether you're using just Tails or have one or more hidden data
partitions.
