Indeed 'privacy' and 'secrecy' are often confused and their meanings 
overlap in many a mind.  I think that most, at least in the West, accept 
that privacy "..is based on rules and trust," for example, records kept on 
us by our doctors.  Because exposure of various aspects of our private 
lives can do lasting damage, privacy is only effective when controlled by 
the party seeking it, who may disclose it or not as they see fit and can 
only be guaranteed when those who would "sell you out" don't possess the 
possibly damaging information.  For that reason among others, I am really 
only interested in privacy mediated by personal secrecy and technologies I 
trust and/or control.
