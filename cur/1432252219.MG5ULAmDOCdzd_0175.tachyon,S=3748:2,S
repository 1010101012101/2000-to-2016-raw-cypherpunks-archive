The Wall Street Journal of October 18 quoted portions of Congressional
testimony by Ken Alibek, former top Russian biowar researcher, as
saying that of the five main purposes for developing anthrax as a
weapon, the least importnat purpose was injuring or killing people. 
The most important purpose was to create terror and panic.

Alibek was reported to have said that anthrax was not that dangerous,
that it took a substantial dose to cause injury and more to kill, that
even crop-dusting Washington DC with weapons grade stuff would
not kill the huge numbers alleged.

But that lack of effectiveness was not what was to be publicized, 
he said, instead development of the anthrax attack system included 
massive disinformation about its lethality before all else. In short,
anthrax is primarily psywar (as is most NBCI WMD).

Richard Preston is his two New Yorker articles* a while back heavily
relied upon Alibek for his terrifying bio-WMD scenarios. I don't recall 
Alibek being so whipsaw disinformational in those articles as he 
allegedly was in briefing Congress how to whipsaw the public.

Still, there is the smallpox campaign just getting underway to
escalate the horrendous, shocking, information Pearl Harbor
attack.
