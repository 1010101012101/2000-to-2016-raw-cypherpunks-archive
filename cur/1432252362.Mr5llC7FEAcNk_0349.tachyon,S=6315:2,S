Exactly, perfect example of my point. You had already made up your mind

I don't read it unless I think I'll get something out of it; your
assertion is really a tautology (though you don't seem to see that).

All the time. Irrelevant to the point under discussion though.

Ah, you draw a synonymous comparison that is false. 'expectation' is not
'judgement'. Not synonyms. Expectation is something that happens a priori,
judgement post facto. Further, 'hope' is not 'expectation' either.

As to methodology/scholarship, that's a slippery slope. It could be the
reader not the author...

Another point to add is that by using 'expectation' you're clearly not
approaching the subject without bias (which isn't the same thing, despite
your apparent equivalence, as tabula rasa). For a person to approach a
subject tabula rasa they would need to be ignorant of the subject even in
a subjective sense. If they are aware of the topic the best they can hope
for is non-biased/open minded. Not the same thing.

Generaly when I read a book, assuming it's not for personal pleasure, I'm
not interested in the pro's or con's, but rather what info they can
present that I haven't heard before (back to that hating sequels :). As to
the logical consistency/validity of an argument, I can make my own mind
up. I read books to expand my own model, not to take up anothers.

'wasting time' is 'personality'. Your waste of time is somebodies
jewel of the Nile (I have these images of Creationist books I've read 
flashing through my mind, very unpleasant).

And there's looking for corroborating evidence... :)

That wasn't where I was going with my commentary. I was simply pointing
out that the way you had worded it made it look like you were choosing
reading/research material based on POV/personality instead of logic of
argument. That you chose reading material based on pleasant past
experience and familiarity rather than raw subject matter relevancy.

As to the general commentary, now it makes more sense with 
clarification...I even agree for the most part.
