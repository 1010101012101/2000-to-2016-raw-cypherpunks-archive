This claim is partly true, and partly false.  In a few cases the Jews have 
openly responded to rocks with gunfire.  I would do the same in their shoes.

In many cases someone in hiding slingshots a rock at a Jewish gunman and 
then runs, the Jewish gunmen men then kill some random Palestinians in 
reprisal, and then proclaim they think that someone was shooting at 
them.  Note I said Jewish gunmen, not Israeli gunmen, since non Jewish 
citizens of Israel are screwed almost as badly as the non citizens, because 
Jewish non citizens have no difficulty exercising freedom to move 
themselves, goods, and money throughout Israel and the occupied 
territories, whereas non Jewish citizens have great difficulty in doing this.

About half the Palestinians that are killed are shot in the head.  If they 
shot in the course of combat, more of them would be shot in the trunk.
