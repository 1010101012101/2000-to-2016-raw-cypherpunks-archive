Sending this thread over to cypherpunks for now as it no longer
has any relevance to Tor.

Apparently we have some new friends with various projects in mind...

At some point these people will stand up and start acting right,
some respected member will evaluate it (including the binaries),
or some respected group will fork and adopt it... or not. Until then,
it's demonstrated itself as being mud, so who cares.
People would be nuts to trust it, let alone play with it outside
of a sandbox.
