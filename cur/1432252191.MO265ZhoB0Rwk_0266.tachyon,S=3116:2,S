You may want to look at EAP-PAX. We tried to engineer around the  
patent land mines in the field when we designed it. This of course  
doesn't mean that someone won't claim it infringes on something.

We also have a proof (not yet published) of security in a random  
oracle model.

Best, Bill

p.s. EAP-PAX is work with my student T. Charles Clancy.
