	cypherpunks-moderated@minder.net

is quite close to that.

The moderation policy is:

- obvious spam gets dropped.
- one-line pointers to news articles will tend to get dropped.
- news articles posted in full without comment will tend to get dropped.
- content will tend to get passed, even if it's off-the-wall
  (eg. Xenix Chainsaw Massacre). 
- submissions from high signal posters will tend to get passed.
- the list is read-only. submissions should go to cypherpunks@minder.net
  or another CDR node.
- cypherpunks@minder.net will remain unfiltered and unmoderated.
        
To subscribe, send the text "subscribe cypherpunks-moderated" to
majordomo@minder.net.
