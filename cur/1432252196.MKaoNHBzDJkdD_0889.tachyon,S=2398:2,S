It Depends[tm]. 

All you really need is one TCP listen socket - if you can't receive incoming 
TCP connections, you can only participate as a transient node and retrieve 
content, but you're not really useful to the network as it is.

Using a DynDNS host name for the ipAddress setting is pretty common on Freenet,
so that shouldn't be a problem.
