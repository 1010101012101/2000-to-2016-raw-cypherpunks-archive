With respect, the stripping involved requires unanimity amongst the
nine sites, each much different than the other.  If one is to dismiss
Chaum's scheme due to the possibility of 9-way unanimous collusion,
then, in like manner, all threshold (split-key) cryptosystems are
unacceptable.  And then there is the DNS where the possibility of
collusion amongst all root servers would also trigger disavowal of
the DNS.

I'm probably missing your point.
