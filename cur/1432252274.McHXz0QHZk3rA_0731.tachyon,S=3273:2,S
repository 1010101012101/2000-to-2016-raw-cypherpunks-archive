"You see this?" the Libyan said. "This was created by an enemy of God.
This has blown many
operations and has caused more arrests than you can imagine. Why do you
think the brothers in
Germany got arrested? With this. When they were talking, the others were
listening.... It's nice, you
can communicate. It's fast, but it causes big problems. They made it,
and they know how to intercept
it."

                     Chilling 'Chatter' of Jihad
                       Wiretaps of an Al Qaeda cell in Italy reveal not
only possible missed signals of attacks but a
                     glimpse at a world of angry, adrift extremists.

                     By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

                     MILAN, Italy -- They knew the police were spying on
them, but they
                     needed to talk. So the members of the Al Qaeda cell
often met in a car.
                     They thought the police were unlikely to bug the
car.
