That was not rude.  This is rude: it is my fervent wish that someone as
stupid as yourself under no circumstances breed.  To be more exact, it is
my wish that you never become a "fucker" so to speak.  Since you can't
look in a goddamn Loompanics catalog to get the Anarchist's Cookbook, you
have no hope of ever understanding it, and it would be even MORE rude of
me to actually give you a copy, since a good portion of the recipies
contained therein are almost certain to cause death or grave bodily
injury if followed as written.  I really cannot see the down side in this,
but I also do not wish to have your moronic blood on my hands, even by
proxy, as I fear that idiocy such as yours might have some infectious
element.  I have included cypherpunks in this thread again, as I'm pretty
sure that your idiocy should propagate on the off chance that somebody
actually wanted to send a copy of the AC to you.
