Hardly! And what about all the first-rate people who were "outsourced" in 
the 90s, along with the boatloads of project work that got contracted out 
to the DoD federally funded R&D centers like MITRE and the CNA Corporation? 
What about In-Q-Tel and the feelers being put out toward public-private 
partnerships? The very fact that they're trying to adapt to the times 
indicates that if the quality of research isn't keeping up with 
developments in the private sector, they certainly have no intention of 
letting it stay that way for long. 

It's a grave mistake, I'm telling you: plenty of people would like nothing 
more than for someone like you to kick back because you think you don't 
have anything to worry about.
