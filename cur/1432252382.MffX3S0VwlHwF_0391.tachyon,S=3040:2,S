It appears that the Feds and LEA at the DNC Convention
have ordered Yahoo to axe the mail list TSCM-L run by James
Atkinson for his blistering attack on security at the convention.

  http://cryptome.org/dncsec-yahoo.htm

Jim's reports on the inferior security:

  http://cryptome.org/dnc-insec.htm

  http://cryptome.org/dnc-dauphine.htm

The mail list had nothing to do with these reports, and the
gag appears to be spite against Atkinson for whistleblowing.

However, the mail list purpose is likely to have scared them 
more than his insecurity reports:

TSCM-L Technical Security Mailing List

Dedicated to TSCM specialists engaging in expert technical 
and analytical research for the detection, nullification, and 
isolation of eavesdropping devices, wiretaps, bugging devices, 
technical surveillance penetrations, technical surveillance 
hazards, and physical security weaknesses. This also includes 
bug detection, bug sweep, and wiretap detection services.

Special emphasis is given to detecting and countering 
espionage and other threats and activities directed by foreign 
intelligence services against the United States Government, 
United States corporations, establishments, and citizens.

The list includes technical discussion regarding the design and 
construction of SCIF facilities, Black Chambers, and Screen 
Rooms. This list is also for discussing DIAM 50-3, NSA-65, 
and DCID 1/21, 1/22 compliance.

The primary goal and mission of this list is to "raise the bar" 
and increase the level of professionalism present within the 
TSCM business.

The secondary goal of this list is and increase the quality and 
effectiveness of our efforts so that we give spies and 
eavesdroppers no quarter, and to neutralize all of their espionage 
efforts.

This mailing list is moderated by James M. Atkinson and 
sponsored by Granite Island Group as a public service to the 
TSCM, Counter Intelligence, and technical security community.
