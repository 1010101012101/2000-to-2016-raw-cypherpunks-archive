So like what CJDNS does? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cjdns

It can be compared to a kind of VPN, it creates an IPv6 addressed network
in the private fc:: range where the addresses are based on hashes of public
keys. The connections can go over the internet, or over meshnets, or over
your local LAN, or over a RONJA link (http://ronja.twibright.com/about.php).

Then on top of that you could run anonymization like I2P and any other
services you might want.

IIRC support for that already exists in I2P, although not yet implemented.
The protocol already have support for a number of things like fake filler
traffic.

Anonymizing routing in local networks can be hard to achieve against timing
attacks and other correlation attacks, in particular when assisted by DoS.
The problem is that there's typically a limited number of local routes
going outwards, poor interconnction and not many long-range links, and
node-to-node links reflect human sociograms very well. Having I2P being
able to support connections over both types of networks simultaneously
would be an advantage.

I'm using "just" as a synonym for "doesn't need novel research, can be
implemented by a any experienced programmer". As compared to requiring
experts in the field to create new algorithms to make it possible,
practical and secure. The difference between "needs time" and "needs
brainpower".

I'm aware there's a very significant amount of work required, see my
comment above. I'm trying to gather the various things I've written about
it now. There's a lot to write down. There's a lot of questions about how
to make it work without massive overhead. I'm trying to figure out how it
should work on each level of abstraction, from data encoding to routing to
key management, etc... I want to see a mainly P2P oriented system that
allows for server assistance (for distribution of signed data, storage,
receiving messages on your behald when you're offline, synchronization /
coordination, etc...). And I keep finding edge cases that would be messy
with most of the potential solutions I'm considering, which is another
reason for why I don't have a complete sketch written down yet.
