I believe it doesn't gain you anything, but it isn't "bad" in the sense
of weakening anything.

If it were, analysts would start off by encrypting the message again.

It has been a while since I've read on this, too, so please correct me
if I'm wrong, but what is important for multiple encryption is whether
or not the cypher in question is a group (as in closed under
composition).

DES, for example, is not, so multiple DES cycles is not equivalent to
single DES.

Again, I probably shouldn't be talking about this, as I haven't
refreshed my memory on it in a while.
