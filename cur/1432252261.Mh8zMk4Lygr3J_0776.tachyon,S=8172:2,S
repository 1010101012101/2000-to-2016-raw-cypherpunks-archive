Users ID&#39;ed through typing, mouse movements<br />
<br />
By Darren Pauli on Nov 22, 2013 2:16 PM<br />
<br />
Continuous authentication app created from DARPA research.<br />
<br />
Researchers have built a continuous authentication platform that can<br />
accurately identify users based on their typing patterns.<br />
<br />
A series of 90 minute typing tests carried out on 2000 people at Iowa State<br />
University found users could be identified with a half percent margin of<br />
error based on the way they hit keys.<br />
<br />
The work has been spun into an application that could continuously<br />
authenticate users and lock accounts if another person jumped on the computer<br />
resulting in irregularities being detected. (pdf)<br />
<br />
Uniquely syncopated mouse and keyboard patterns made it possible to identify<br />
users, Iowa State University associate professor Morris Chang said.<br />
<br />
“These pauses between words, searches for unusual characters and spellings of<br />
unfamiliar words, all have to do with our past experiences, our learning<br />
experiences,” Chang said. “And so we call them cognitive fingerprints which<br />
manifest themselves in typing rhythms.”<br />
<br />
“The system can see if the same person or an imposter is coming in to hijack<br />
the computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The year-long research run together with electrical engineering students<br />
Terry Fang, Kuan-Hsing Ho and Danny Shih received a half a million dollar<br />
grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency which sought to<br />
discover if continuous authentication was possible.<br />
<br />
It was now being extended to capture mouse movements and touch inputs from<br />
mobile devices with an additional $1.76 million dollars from the agency over<br />
two years.<br />
