No, not a conventional troll.

Disinformation was being spread about how "making a copy of something" 
is the "same as stealing." Some of the apologists for DMCA were saying 
that anyone who copies a CD is the same as a shoplifter.

I casually volunteered that I made an average of one DVD of a Hollywood 
movie per day.

The kneejerks by the apologists for DMCA were illuminating, including 
the claim that the RIAA would be "investigating" this as a case of 
piracy. Frankly, I had hope for one of the several hundred lawsuits the 
RIAA has been tossing out like confetti (including to people who have 
never owned a computer...sounds like some due diligence malpractice 
cases are in order). Even better would be a process server trespassing 
on my property...no point in having a pig farm if you have nothing to 
throw to the pigs.

The revelation that Don Frederickson is one of those who needs to be 
dealt with eventually was rewarding.
