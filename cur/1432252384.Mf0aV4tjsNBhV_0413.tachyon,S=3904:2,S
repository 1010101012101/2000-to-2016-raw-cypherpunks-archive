why don't you simply look at the source?

without sparking a political discussion about the PC of banner ads, your
main problem is that banner services (i.e. external sources) are
undetectable to you because junkbuster never does anything to YOUR site
- it just refuses to grab the ads from the external site.

you may have a way if you would serve the banners yourself. but I doubt
there's money in that.
