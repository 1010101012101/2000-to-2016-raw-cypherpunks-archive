Assuming all of your arguments to be correct (which I don't), I would want 
to remove "freedom of speech" for corporations because it artificially 
amplifies the voice of the corporate entity: the individuals who own the 
issued shares of the corporation already have these freedoms - by allowing 
the corporation "to speak", these "people" (both natural and atificial) 
are given more than their one individual opinions, (b) the corporation can 
be used to nullify the voices of the [natural] People comprising the 
corporation, and (c) the corporation has a narrow interest - making more 
money - which is often (if not always) at odds with those of the natural 
people who comprise the corporation.  Corporations don't need food to eat, 
water to drink, and shelter to live: the People for which the Country acts 
as a home have interests that are at odds with the corporate focus on 
cash.
