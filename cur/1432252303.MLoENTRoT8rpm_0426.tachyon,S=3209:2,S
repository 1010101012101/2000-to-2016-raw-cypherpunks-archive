List members following this thread might find the old thread re "The DES 
Analytic Crack Project" (a representative message is available at 
<http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/dir.1998.09.14-1998.09.20/msg00075.html>, 
and a project webpage at <http://www.cyberspace.org/~enoch/crakfaq.html>) 
of interest - it describes a Cypherpunk-initiated anonymous cryptanalytic 
research effort, funded by donors unaware of the researcher's "true name" 
or address.

Perhaps the participant(s) or researcher(s) would be inclined to describe 
the procedures used to protect privacy and facilitate payment.

5000 dead in NYC? National tragedy.
1000 detained incommunicado without trial, expanded surveillance? National 
disgrace.
