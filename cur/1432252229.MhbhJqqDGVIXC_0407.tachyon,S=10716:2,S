Not really the same at all.  Russia's government is still actively oppressing people in these ways while the US is:

A) Far less homophobic and racist than it used to be.  In some areas, hardly at all.
B) Has gone from the government homophobia hunting people to fire from government jobs in the 1950's to complete legality and 
usually legal protection now.
C) The Millennials as a group are not homophobic or racist to any measurable degree.  Remaining pockets are becoming more 
isolated and their youth are changing too, as far as anyone can tell.

The whole culture is rapidly changing in many ways.  Music, Internet, Hollywood, legal cases, politicians (because many have 
been voted out), etc. have all been changing people's opinions.  The rate of evolution, or at least the rate of maturation of 
active cycles has been apparently increasing each year.

Pervasive cell phone video, major cases of corruption and overstepping bounds and tragedy have caused major pull back of 
longstanding troublesome trends.

This is how all of this ties into cypherpunks:  Observing how opinions, public sentiment, then enforcement, regulations, and 
market options evolve in each of these cycles should be instructive when trying to induce important change.  How can you 
position things to improve better outcomes when inflection points happen?
