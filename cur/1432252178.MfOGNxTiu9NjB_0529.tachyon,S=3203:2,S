Well, not so. This whole discussion is missing an important 
ontological factor: whether intrusion is detectable.

A Medeco lock on a glass door may seem crazy, but a pickable lock on 
a glass door means those who know how to pick locks--like cops who 
have access to lock guns--can enter at will without any persistent 
evidence of their intrusion.

The application to crypto is that the issue of personal data security 
(black bag jobs on keys, for example) is a separate issue from 
machine to machine security.
