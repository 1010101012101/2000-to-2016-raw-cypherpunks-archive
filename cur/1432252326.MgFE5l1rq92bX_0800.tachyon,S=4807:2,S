MLM and NETWORK MARKETING FAILURES WANTED

Are you one of the ten million brave individuals 
who have tried MLM or Network Marketing without,
let's just say, "setting the world on fire?"

But no matter what you do, you can't let go of the 
Belief that there must be some way, some how for
you to reach your goals and begin fulfilling your 
financial dreams. "If others can do it, why can't I?"
I asked myself a million times.... Perhaps
you've asked yourself the same question (?)

Here's why most people without a System Fail:

Most of us aren't experts at marketing. 
We have a staff of full time marketing EXPERTS 
Dedicated to helping You!

We don't like to sell.
In our company, you don't have to sell anything to anyone,

We're not experts at "closing the sale".
Our Professional Staff will "Close" all of your prospects 
for you.

We don't know where to get quality leads. 
We can provide you with all of the Qualified Leads you 
could ever want.

We don't know what to say. 
You don't even have to speak with your prospects 
if you don't want to. We have live customer service "angels" 
who take care of everything for you.

Our uplines generally don't know anymore than we do.
You don't have to rely on your "upline." That's why we 
employ the finest customer service reps in the world. 

We don't have a SYSTEM which works for everyone, all of the time.
If you don't have a "SYSTEM" that works for EVERYONE 100% of 
the time, you may as well bet your money, time and credibility on the 
7th horse in the 7th race at Belmont  :-( 
We have "THE SYSTEM" Everyone Has Been Waiting For! 

No Selling! No Meetings! No Phone-Calls!

Low $32 Qualifier!

We place at least 3 people on your team BEFORE YOU JOIN!

Massive Spillover is Occurring in May 2001.
