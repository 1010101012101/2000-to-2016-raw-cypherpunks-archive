A nice puff piece but it steers clear of well know, if not respected, 
prognosticators that poo-poo any near-term potential for 
micro-payments.  Conspicuously absent is e-gold which predates all of the 
listed vendors, does a daily average of $3 million in transactions, 
relatively simple to use, requires no special end-user software and 
internally cost effective enough to handle payments less than $0.01.  It 
seems e-gold has been smeared (unfairly I think) in the press as only 
attracting gray market types.
