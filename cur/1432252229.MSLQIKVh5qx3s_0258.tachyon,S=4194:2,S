Some of Florida's convicted criminals are under constant
supervision without being housed in prisons, thanks to the use of
Global Positioning System (GPS). The system, which is currently
monitoring 600 convicts in Florida, uses a satellite, and can be
programmed to alert authorities when a sex offender, for
instance, is going near a schoolyard. GPS tracking is more
effective than the old electronic monitoring system, which many
states still employ. The new technology can locate the offender
from room to room within a house, or on a street corner. However,
probation officers will still have to physically check on persons
who are on the program, which lasts about two years. The new
system costs $9.17 per day, compared to $50 a day for an state
prison-housed inmate, or $3 per day for conventional electronic
monitoring. (www.sunsentinel.com) Source: NLECTC Law Enforcement
