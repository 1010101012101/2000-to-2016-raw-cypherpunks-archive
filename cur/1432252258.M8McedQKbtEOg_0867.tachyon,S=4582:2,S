Would do if it were true - this is exactly why unblinded lucre coins 
have structure - that is, you can check that they are well-formed by 
doing hash operations on them. Blinded coins will fail these checks.

I forget the exact form of lucre coins (read the paper), but consider 
the construction x || H(x) - clearly only the unblinded version of this 
will have the right form.
