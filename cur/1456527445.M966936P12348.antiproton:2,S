NOW we get to something substantial.

Why is one branch of the government asking a private company to do
what many believe is easily done by (multiple?) other branches of 
the government. 

Does one sub-beaurocracy have the power to compel a private citizen
to do what another sub-beaurocracy has refused to do?

Or maybe, does the All Writs Act allow a judge to compel a secret
document or procedure they have seen abused many times to be
declassified? There's a fascinating game being played out here.
