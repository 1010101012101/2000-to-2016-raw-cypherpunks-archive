One thing that should set off alarms, the postal service says, is a
customer objecting to filling out an 8105-A form that requests their date
of birth, occupation and drivers license or other government-issued ID for
a purchase of money orders of $3,000 or more. If they cancel the purchase
or request a smaller amount, the clerk automatically should fill out Form
8105-B, the suspicious-activity report. Whatever the reason, any
customer who switches from a transaction that requires an 8105-A form to
one that doesnt should earn himself or herself the honor of being
described on a B form, the training manual says.

But the suspicious customers might just be concerned about privacy, says
Solveig Singleton, a senior analyst at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute. And a professional criminal likely would know that $3,000 was
the reporting requirement before he walked into the post office. I think
theres a lot of reasons that people might not want to fill out such forms;
they may simply think its none of the post offices business, Singleton
tells Insight. The presumption seems to be that from the standpoint of the
post office and the Bank Secrecy regulators every citizen is a suspect.
Both Singleton and Nojeim say Under the Eagles Eye unfairly targets the
poor, minorities and immigrants  people outside of the traditional banking
system. A large proportion of the reports will be immigrants sending money
back home, Nojeim says. Singleton adds, It lends itself to discrimination
against people who are sort of marginally part of the ordinary banking
system or who may not trust things like checks and credit cards.
