QUANTUM TELEPORTATION OF A MOVING ATOM. 
Quantum teleportation involves transmitting all of the information
contained in a quantum-mechanical particle (such as a photon or
atom) to another particle, even if the two are completely separated
by a large distance.   Experimentally demonstrated with photons in
numerous labs, quantum teleportation schemes have up to now
focused on transmitting a particle's internal states, such as photon
polarization.  Exploring quantum teleportation with atoms, an
Israel-Germany-Czech Republic collaboration (Tomas Opatrny,
Weizmann Institute/F. Schiller University, pto@tpi.uni-jena.de) has
come up with an experimental proposal for transmitting an atom's
full information including its "external" states, such as its energy of
motion.  This procedure replicates the quantum features of the
external motion of a particle.  For example, if particle-to-be-
teleported C yielded a diffraction pattern after passing through two
slits, then the same pattern would be produced by particle B, which
receives the teleported information.  The researchers propose the
following idea: Dissociate a very cold molecule with a laser pulse
into two atoms (called A and B).  Then, manipulate the two atoms
so that they become entangled: each one is in a fuzzy state
individually but has a precisely defined relationship with its
partner.  Then, let one of the entangled particles (such as A) collide
with particle C, whose unknown state should be teleported.  After
their collision, the momentum values of the collision partners A and
C are measured.  With that information, the researchers know how
to "kick" and deflect atom B so that the motion of B precisely
emulates that of particle C.   Teleportation is extremely demanding,
but the authors say that state-of-the-art equipment for studying
atomic collisions and quantum effects makes this experiment "hard
but feasible." (Opatrny and Kurizki, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2 April 2001.)
