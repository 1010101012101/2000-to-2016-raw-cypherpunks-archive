It appears that one effective way to combat such a virus is with 
disinformation.

Approach 1: Merge one of those "50 million Internet address lists" and 
random listing of possibly pedo file names which the virus might have 
flagged and generate email.  Generate forged emails from these addresses 
and mail notifications to random addresses from the virus' LE address list.

Approach 2: Release another virus which generates false reports from any of 
the users it infects.
