Hello again. I will answer to most comments all in a single mail
to avoid clogging libtech. While I wrote this another ten mails
have slipped in, so expect another large reply to those.  :-)

Sorry if I start talking about the alternatives only at the very end
of the document. This is about becoming aware of how serious the
problem is and to start directing some energy into fueling the
alternatives which are popping up like mushrooms just recently.
For the obvious reasons. And I specifically mention peer reviewing
them. So the message is: go get yourself new tools and teach your
peers to use the new tool of the day.

That's a good point. The reason why I don't pay attention to lesser
threat models is that the loss in quality of democracy we are currently
experiencing is large enough that I don't see much use for a distinction
of threat models - especially since alternatives that work better than
PGP exist, so they are obviously also better for lesser threat models.

For example, I don't think that a dissident in Irya (ficticious country)
is better off if no-one but Google Mail knows that he is a dissident.
Should at any later time in his life someone with access to that data
find it useful to use it against the dissident, he can still do it.
And who knows what the world looks like in twenty years from now?

Not saying give up and die. Saying if you can opt for better security,
don't postpone learning about it. If you can invest money in making
it a safe option, don't waste time with yet another PGP GUI project.

Fine with me. I don't think it makes much difference for the end

I don't find S/MIME worth mentioning anymore. It has so failed us.
But maybe I should for completeness?

Because it's not true that the client can handle it. The fact that an
email address exists implies that some folks will send unencrypted
stuff to it. I experienced this. Just yesterday a friend changed his
life plans because of an unencrypted message. Yes, you could enforce
PGP once it's configured - but you can't opt out from e-mail. That is
evil.

Look at any of the alternatives instead. None of them allow you to
transmit an unencrypted message. In fact all the modern systems use
the public key for addressing, so you can't do it wrong.

My pleasure. I felt the need to do this since I get asked for
recommendations frequently - and I don't like to say.. wait until
secushare is ready. I don't want to wait for it myself.

> Why doesn't telephony have SIP?

It should. What would the icons be that you would put there?
I'm not familiar with end-to-end encryption over SIP for instance.

I think if employers, schools, parents, skiddies can find out who
you are exchanging encrypted messages with, that can be a very real
threat to you. Using a tool that looks like it does something
totally different.. on your screen, over the network and even on
your hard disk.. can save your physical integrity.

Glad someone is understanding the positivity in awareness and
will to move forward. Ignoring threats just because they are
depressing is a bit like sticking your head in the ground.

The whole architecture is wrong. There is hardly anything worth keeping
in the old PGP approach except for the cryptographic basics. All the
modern alternatives use a completely different approach.

Thanks for reminding me to look at Bitmessage. I was postponing that
unnecessarily. I read the whitepaper and have added it to the comparison
table according to the claims in it. The architecture sounds a bit
like the one of IRC, but without multicast routing - so I expect it
to run into serious scalability issues. It will probably have to split
into several incompatible networks as it grows. It will also probably
keep your computer a lot more busy than you expect from a communication
tool. But for the time being it is a crypto-strategically much safer
approach than PGP.

Concerning standardization: It is a VERY BAD development that it has
become en vogue to require standardization from projects that haven't
even started functioning. It has been detrimental to the social tool
scene: None of them work well enough to actually scale and replace
Facebook, but the scalability problems are already being cemented into
"open standards," ensuring that they never will.

You must ALWAYS have a working pioneer tool FIRST, then dissect the
way it works and derive a standard out of it. Bittorrent is a good
example for that. It's one of the few things that actually works.
Imagine if Napster and Soulseek had developed an open standard. It
would only have delayed the introduction of Bittorrent, promoting
an inferior technology by standardization.

Open standards are part of the problem, not the solution.

Good point. libtech is the place where people put time and money
into these things. Figuring out the ultimate UX fix for PGP won't
solve the underlying problems. The number of PGP critics is growing.

I am saying to use condoms that don't slip off during intercourse

Well, maybe we can find wordings that make it more understandable.
Of course the links are meant for being clicked upon when necessary.

No, it is exactly about not trying to fix on the UI level what is

Didn't feel like including an explanation of Deep Packet Inspection
and elaborate on the recognizable characteristics of the OpenPGP format
as it would explode the paragraph a bit, but maybe that's wrong. Depends
on who my target audience is. Somebody like you could be. Does it work by
following the links or does it get too abstract from there .. in the sense
that you can read the Wikipedia pages but fail to connect the dots?

If this is still jargony to you, hmmm... you are unlikely to understand
the risks you are exposed to by using the Internet from day to day.
These are concepts that anyone in the circumvention business must
be aware of. You can choose to not read the Guardian article and not
try to understand what's going on, but then you should better just
trust that the conclusion is not made up:

There is nothing you can do with email that saves you from this happening.
Thus, it's not a problem of practices. It's a question of throwing away
the broken condom and learn about new contraceptive technology.

You mean I should explain why it is impossible to add forward secrecy
to PGP over e-mail by design? I thought that was going to be clear.

One of the options that are safer than PGP is steganography, yes.

The article is not meant to be an advertisement for the alternatives.
With my working group we are currently exchanging materials by means
of RetroShare. It takes a bit getting used to as you would not expect
that a file sharing app should be used for by-the-way features like
its built-in homebrewn mail system and forum messaging - and to expect
it to be safer than regular e-mail. But RetroShare does indeed solve
some of the things listed in this long list (see the comparison for
details). The downside is, nobody is willing to put her hands in the
fire to guarantee it is a safe choice of software and the source code,
as frequently with file sharing tools, is too complex to be an easy
read. So it is an amazing feature beast pending peer review.

Briar is expected to be a better solution, but it is in alpha stage.

Both should probably be used over Tor for obfuscation, as they don't
provide for that themselves.

And then there is Pond, which is technologically a work of art, but it
doesn't facilitate group communication (yet).

I am saying that teaching people PGP is MORE work than getting them
to installed any of
- Pond
- Briar
- RetroShare
- Bitmessage

And that I hope that we will have more projects to list and that we will
not feel guilty for doing so. RetroShare has a terribly confusing UI (but
the developers are just waiting for some UX designer to tell them what to
do) and I bet the others need a hand on that front, too.
