An interesting proposition ??

Libertarian International's mission is to coordinate various initiatives in 
the defense of individual liberty throughout the world. Formally, 
Libertarian International is a non-profit foundation registered in the 
Netherlands. You can write to us at our snail mail address :
P.O. Box 21, 2910 Essen, Belgium
Our BANK ACCOUNT, where you can send your contributions is with the RABO 
BANK, A/C Libertarian International, number 17.43.35.350
We accept payments in E-gold.
The E-gold account number of Libertarian International is :102265
If you do not yet have your own E-gold account, find out about it on e-gold.com
Libertarian International has little time or need for bureaucracy and 
hierarchy. Hubert Jongen of the Netherlands is the president; Palle Steen 
Jensen in Copenhagen, Christian Michel in Geneva and Henrik Bejke are among 
the founding members, and you are welcome to get in touch with any of them 
for further information and contacts.
Libertarian International's principles are based on libertarianism. While 
libertarians are a diverse group of people with many philosophical starting 
points, they share a defining belief: that everyone should be free to do as 
they choose, so long as they don't infringe upon the equal freedom of others.
Human interaction should be voluntary, not coerced. The only time physical 
force is acceptable is when it is used to defend against force. Many 
libertarians frame this in terms of the non-aggression principle: no 
individual or group of individuals shall initiate force against the person 
or property of any other individual.
This might not seem very radical. After all, your parents probably taught 
you not to cheat, steal or pick fights -- in other words, not to use force 
against others. What sets libertarians apart is that they don't make any 
exceptions to this principle -- not even for governments.
In the libertarian view, governments should be held to the same standards 
of right and wrong as individuals. As a result, libertarians believe that 
governments should not interfere with the interactions and exchanges of 
peaceful people.
