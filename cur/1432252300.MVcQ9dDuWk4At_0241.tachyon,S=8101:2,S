TECHNOLOGY UNLEASHED:  UNDERSTANDING SECURITY CERTIFICATES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Are your customers confident that you are who you say you are?

One of the major problems with the Internet is the ease with which someone can fake their identity.  I could masquerade as anyone I please, including you, your friend or a bank. Resolving identities was difficult and easy to jeopardize. But the concept of a certificate changed that.

A certificate is a specifically formatted document that allows you to authenticate, or identify, yourself to a web-browser, e-mail reader or a secure server. It contains information on who you are and who issued the certificate. The certificate also contains your public key.  

In the current application of certificates, the most common commercial usage of certification is in the realm of Secure Servers. By using the SSL protocol (Secure Socket Layer), servers use public-private keys to create secure connections with web-browsers, allowing them to transmit secure information across the insecure Internet. By reading and trusting the certificate the web-browser can see that the company is who they say they are. This prevents situations where a company poses as a bank, for example, and gets credit-card details and fund-transfer details from unsuspecting customers.

GAME REVIEW:  THE SIMS-HOUSE PARTY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Get the hottest house party in town with the new release of the Sims: House Party. Choose from three themes--jungle, country western, and underground rave--each of which has its own distinctive furniture and style. Hundreds of new objects that have some functionality are available, including women (or men, depending on your preference) who pop out of cakes during birthday a birthday party. 


The Sims can grow tiresome for some, but running a virtual dollhouse does have it's moments. This is a great way to throw the party you?ve always wanted-without the messy clean up.  And is a fun add-on for the true Sim-Head.

If you don't know what The Sims are, then you are WAY behind on the times.  Check out House Party and the rest of the Sim-fun at: http://www.thesims.com/
