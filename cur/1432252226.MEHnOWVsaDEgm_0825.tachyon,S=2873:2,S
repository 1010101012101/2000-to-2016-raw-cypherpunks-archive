Hello,

amnesia [0] is a Live System similar to (and heavily inspired by)
Incognito:

* all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through
  the Tor network
* no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

It has many other features [1].

amnesia is Free Software released under the GNU/GPL (version 3 or
above).

One can download [2] the source code needed to build her own amnesia
Live System using the Debian Live tools as a tarball or using a Git
repository. Pre-built images can also be downloaded [2] using BitTorrent.

Disclaimer: this is the first public release of alpha software that
can kill your kitten, etc.

The aim of this announcement is to get feedback from Tor enthusiasts
early in amnesia's development process.
=> any comments welcome!

We have contacted the Incognito developers to discuss possible
collaboration... as they recently publicly stated their intent to
switch to another base distribution.

To contact the amnesia developers, one can send email to
amnesia@boum.org, preferably encrypted [3].
