Dear Sir,
	I am in the market to locate and purchase a Glock 17L with 3 G17 (17
round) old style magazines with the +2 extenders on all three.  I realize
these may be costly and a little difficult to find.  As you appear to be an
enthusiast and a wealth of information-it would be greatly appreciated if
you could provide any assistance that would help me to do so.  Please feel
free to contact me at any time.  I am also looking for 3 G21 (13 round) .45
magazines.  
	Your time and consideration is greatly appreciated.
