Nonsense. "Everyone" did not think this. Far from it. YAF was going 
strong back then.

Of 8 of us who rented a place, 6 were fairly extreme libertarians, one 
was confused but went along, and one was apolitical. (One of these guys 
wore a dollar sign pin and subscribed to Nathaniel Branden's 
newsletter.) This, was, by the way, when we were 18-20 years old.

The Libertarian Party started at about this time, in 1972, and nearly 
all of the volunteers, spear carriers, etc. were in their 20s. This is 
very well known.

(And today most of the LP volunteers and spear carriers are in their 
40s and 50s. A correlation here.)

Quite likely you, as you have said you were a Marxist. I never went 
through such a phase, having started reading Heinlein and that crowd 
when I was around 11 or so. It always seemed self-evidently silly to 
think that "From each according to his ability, to each according to 
his need" could be taken seriously by anybody.

And I remember taking some cheer that day in November, 1963 when the 
Big Government guy was zapped. My family left the U.S. that afternoon 
and did not return for 13 months.

I was a Goldwater supporter in 1964, when I was 12. (Goldwater was way 
too liberal for me in many ways, but he was against the "Civil Rights 
Act" and other such Marxist nonsense, so I supported him. I didn't care 
for his Vietnam views, except I agreed with him we should either fight 
to win it very, very decisively, or get out.

Still think most of the baldies of today, with rings through their 
noses, marching against Coca Cola and Intel and Big Business, and 
arguing for affirmative action are "more libertarian"?

Again, apparently more so than you. In any case, saying "everyone 
thought that Ho Chi Minh was the greatest" is silly.

This is certainly so. But it doesn't dispute my point. In fact, it 
supports it.

My generation was very active, on all sides. The droids born after 
about 1980 are mainly followers. Probably what the nose rings are for.
