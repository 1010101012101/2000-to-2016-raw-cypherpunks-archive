Well, here's an anecdote: at last year's CEAS conference, Rob Thomas
of Team Cymru gave the keynote on the underground economy, with a most
horrifying set of both live demos and selected snapshots of the online
bazaars where online warez are traded, everything from zombie farms to
spamware to stolen credit cards.  One of the more amusing was a guy
who offered a zombie in some part of the government that you'd hope
would be moderately secure, NASA or someplace like that, at a higher
than normal price.  The immediate response was ridicule, bots on
government nets are a dime a dozen, and aren't worth any more than any
other bot.

R's,
John
