A friend of mine was in a rough airplane landing many years ago,
and after the pilot had gone through the usual steps of
"seat belts on, seat backs up, lean forward and
hold on to the seat in front of you" safety instructions,
she and half her fellow passengers responded with
"and kiss your ass goodbye", which is the punch line of the
hippie version of the American nuclear war education posters.
