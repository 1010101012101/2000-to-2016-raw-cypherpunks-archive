http://www.google.com/search?q=%22truth+drug%22

Turns up a lot of info on the various substances that have been tried as 
"truth drugs."

The first hit is about MDMA:

http://www.idmu.co.uk/xtruth.html

I seem to recall that MDA (very similar to MDMA) was in fact used in US
Army studies of truth drugs.

The most likely to have some measure of sucess would probably be MDMA.  
However, no chemical is likely to be found that forces a subject to tell
the truth. The most successful "truth drugs" all generally work on the
same idea: if you can make your subject more relaxed, at ease, and eager
to talk, you'll be able to extract more information from him and possibly
extrapolate the truth from that.

MDMA would have a greater degree of success in cases where the subject 
subconsciously wanted to talk anyway.
