You probably don't have to read all 256 bits.  One way this had been
handled (in the Starium (sp?) phone), is to display a number derived from
the hash.  One person reads the first half of the number, and the other
person reads the second half.  If both halves verify, there is no
man-in-the-middle.  The length of the number determines the security, but
since it is derived from the Diffie-Hellman exchange, neither side can
control its value.  Probably 6 digits is enough.

Cache entries would be a way for someone who obtains the phone to be able
to trace your contacts.  (So would a in-phone address book.)  Automatic
authentication also might make it easier to spoof the phone's owner.
