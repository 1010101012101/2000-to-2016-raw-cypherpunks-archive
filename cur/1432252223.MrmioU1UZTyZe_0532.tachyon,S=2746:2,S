Yes it does.  Socialists may not always intend that outcome, but that is 
the outcome they are necessarily going to get, want it or not.

And the reaction of Western socialists to real life repressive governments 
shows that most western socialists do indeed want exactly that.  Their love 
of Castro turned to hate only when Castro liberalized Cuba.  They blandly 
overlooked the crimes of Khmer Rouge until the Soviet Union and its 
sattelites quarreled with them.

They worshipped the Sandinistas, while fiercely condemning Latin American 
governments that were vastly less repressive.
