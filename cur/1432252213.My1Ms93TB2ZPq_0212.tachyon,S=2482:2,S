 | 
 | GCC yes, but what about Visual Studio? The LLVM which ships with XCode?
 | Javac?
 | 
 | Those are much jucier targets than say, Debian's GCC. If I worked at the
 | NSA, I'd make backdooring Visual Studio my 20% project.
 | 
 | If anybody with Snowden cache access who is reading this could do me a
