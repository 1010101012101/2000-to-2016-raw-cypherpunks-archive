I thought I was jaded, but this is too much even for me to believe.

A judge in St. Louis has ordered the polls kept open later, until 10 
pm local time. The effect will be to let more inner city, 
Democrat-leaning voters vote.

The rural and suburban polling places will close at the normal times.

Whew.

Democrats are elated that more of their supporters will be able to 
vote in the extra hours.

A similar measure was turned down in another state (Kansas?).

Democrats in other urban areas are hustling to see if they can get 
their own bought judges involved in the process.

A stunning theft of the election. If these "late Democrats" turn out 
to be the margin of victory, this will energize the anger of the 
Republicans.

Amazing.
