I only forward the last part of this email, since the rest is domain
specific (YAML de/serialization minutiae).

Nope. The next choice will be YAML 2. Then the next choice will be
JSON 1. Then the next choice will be JSON 2. Then the next choice will
be native serialization in your language of choice. Then custom binary
serialization. Then a continually permutating algorithmic mixing
stream, just for laughs. There are infinite alternatives to XML and if
worse comes to worst, I suggest hard transcoding your data into COBOL
statements and serializing those in Base63.

Nowhere would one willingly choose XML.

Hell, I'd choose HTML if I was ordered to use XML on a project, just
to make sure the next guy who touches that code knows that the
serialization format has to be changed.

Manager: "Z, did you finish that, what's it called again? Yeah, the
XML serialization?"

Me: "Sure did! And it's Netscape 3.1 compatible too." <snigger>HTML<snigger>

Manager: <used to work at Best Buy, does not understand>"Oh, cool!
That's just great! I knew I'd finish on time, and I'll tell marketing
our new name too, 'NewScope compatible' - has a great ring to it.
Great ring! Good job Z, you'll go places you know. Go places in this
world!"

Should be easy. Anything's more enjoyable than XML... whoops, there I
go again...
