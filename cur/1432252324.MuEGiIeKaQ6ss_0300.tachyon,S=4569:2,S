     "...[T]he core reason the "war on drugs" completely
     dominates the official policies of so many nations,
     including [Canada's], is simple: The United States
     insists on it. ..."

     "The few officials and governments that do stray, even
     slightly, outside the prohibition orthodoxy are cajoled,
     manipulated, or bullied to get back in."

  "Why the War on Drugs has failed"
  Dan Gardner
  The Ottawa Citizen, Tuesday 5 September 2000

This Ottawa Citizen expose of US bullying is dynamite - as is its
expose of many other governments' spineless surrender to that
bullying. If you can read this horror story without mounting fury,
you'd better check to see if you still have a pulse and a mind.

If you think US' drug warriors limit their bullying to backward
countries, you think wrong. Canada. Australia. Holland. The World
Health Organization. Names, dates, details: the works!

Gardner and the Ottawa Citizen merit high praise for publishing
this report; that was a courageous act in view of the systematic
vindictiveness and widespread cowardice they have exposed.

It deserves the widest distribution.

Cheers,  Mike
