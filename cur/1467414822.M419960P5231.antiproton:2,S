Off-Topic TSA Thugs: TSA Agents BEAT AND JAIL Disabled Teen With Brain
Cancer

http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/01/tsa-agents-beat-and-jail-disabled-teen-with-brain-cancer-video/

  ⌐Hannah, who is also partially deaf and blind in one eye set
⌐  off a metal detector while passing through security.  They
⌐  wanted to do further scanning, she was reluctant, she didn't
⌐  understand what they were about to do," Shirley told WREG.
⌐  "She's trying to get away from them but in the next instant,
⌐  one of them had her down on the ground and hit her head on the
⌐  floor. There was blood everywhere."  Hannah was arrested sent
⌐  to "Jail East," though authorities eventually threw out the
⌐  charges.

Her Mother says they have made this trip to and from St. Jude many
times, but this is the first time her daughter was assaulted by TSA.
She also says TSA kept her away from her daughter so there was no way
to explain to her what these [criminal thugs - my words] wanted.
