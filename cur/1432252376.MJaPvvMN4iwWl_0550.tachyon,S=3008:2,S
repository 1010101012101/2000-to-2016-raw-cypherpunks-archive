	Not knowing exactly what that is supposed to mean, I can only
assume that it means "not politically correct" or "scientifically
accurate." If that's supposed to be an insult - well ok.

	Someone should tell him not to go to a lot of effort on my 
account. Apparently, scientific accuracy is not the thrust of 
the posts, I'm not particularly good at being politically 
correct and since I thought this had something to do with 
cryptography, there's not much reason for me to interrupt any
more squabbles.
