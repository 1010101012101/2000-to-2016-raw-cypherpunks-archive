********Note************Please read this complete e-mail in it's entirety be sure that<BR>
you will fully understand it. &nbsp;Read it twice or even three times if you have to. &nbsp;E-mail me with any 
questions if you are still not sure you understand it. &nbsp;When you decide to run this program and follow the 
instructions in PHASE " along with the training manual, you will be highly satisfied with the results.<BR>
<BR>
****This programme is quite new and very effective, many people have not had the opportunity to see it 
yet*****<BR>
<BR>
PHASE 1 BEGINS ***************** Prepared to be impressed !<BR>
<BR>
This programme is seriously the most powerful money generator on the World Wide Web. &nbsp;No other 
programme comes close to it when you need money easy and fast and you are GUARANTEED financial 
success with this opportunity because of the METHOD USED TO CONFIRM THE HONESTY OF ALL THE 
PARTICIPANTS.<BR>
<BR>
When I first looked at this programme I thought the same thing like everyone else, another "get rich 
scheme".<BR>
However it is not. &nbsp;Only a week after joining this programme my inbox was overwhelmed with responses 
and a few weeks later the money started rolling in. &nbsp;Now I am making more money than I know what to do 
with, but I will find something to enjoy with it. &nbsp;(Including paying paying off several bills)!!<BR>
<BR>
THAT IS WHEN I REALISED THAT I HAD FOUND THE PERFECT FAIL SAFE, CHEAT PROOF 
OPPORTUNITY. &nbsp;What have you got to lose? &nbsp;Thousands of people are this program to produce a 
substantial income quickly on the internet. &nbsp;You will be amazed at how quickly you will be able to KISS 
THE BOSS GOODBYE!<BR>
<BR>
YOU REALLY WILL BE ABLE TO PUT UP TO £40,000 IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN THE NEXT SIX 
WEEKS (MAXIMUM TIME) WITH THIS SIMPLE PROGRAM.<BR>
<BR>
This is a FAIL-SAFE money making program where all CASH RECEIPTS are verifiable in advance, where every 
participant is held ACCOUNTABLE, where everyone gets paid EXTREMELY WELL and WHERE NOBODY 
CAN CHEAT !!!<BR>
<BR>
I always new these programmes could work but have always had two problems with them<BR>
1. &nbsp;There is no way of monitoring returns<BR>
2. &nbsp;There is no way of eliminating cheaters - people who add their names to the list without sending money 
!<BR>
<BR>
THIS PROGRAM SOLVES BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS.<BR>
<BR>
IT IS 100% CHEAT PROOF AND EVERYONE WILL GET PAID FOR PARTICIPATING.<BR>
<BR>
I can give you my 100% GUARANTEE because by providing an e-mail &nbsp;&nbsp;it enables you to verify that 
everyone has been paid right up front BEFORE YOU GIVE ANYONE A DIME.<BR>
<BR>
The total cost to you is just two $5 bills (US currency)<BR>
If you were to spend $10 on the Lottery today your chances of making anymoney are slim to non.<BR>
<BR>
Please read this carefully. &nbsp;If you have any questions I want you to email me at<BR>
<BR>
jday442@excite.com &nbsp;&nbsp;- subject "Fast Cash"<BR>
<BR>
According to the US Postal Service Lottery Code: Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341 state that this service is legal 
because we are building a mailing list. &nbsp;The postal service has a phone number where you are able to call 
and verify this &nbsp;-1-800-725-2161<BR>
<BR>
This programme includes a Fail-Safe Mechanism. &nbsp;It is controlled SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
ANYONE TO CHEAT. &nbsp;This way NOBODY GETS HURT AND EVERYONE GETS PAID. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will make the money they deserve for theirt efforts. &nbsp;It can't be ruined by 
someone cheating.<BR>
<BR>
********NOTE**** &nbsp;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY 
AND VERY VERY CAREFULLY. &nbsp;This will ensure that you get the maximum return<BR>
***********************************************************************************************<BR>
<BR>
INTERNET MAILING PROGRAMME<BR>
<BR>
I am sure you have seen similar programmes on the internet....there are a lot of them. &nbsp;This one is 
DIFFERENT.....IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT IS CHEAT PROOF.<BR>
Read on and you will see why.<BR>
<BR>
It &nbsp;includes a method of accountability that keeps everyone honest so that we all get our money and a 
valuable MAILING LIST.<BR>
<BR>
Too many programmes like this one have no FAILSAFE METHOD of protecting its participants from those who 
put their names on the list without sending money which is what ruins if for everyone. &nbsp;With this programme 
it is IMMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.<BR>
<BR>
That problem has been solved for good.<BR>
<BR>
As you read on you will be required to send $5 (US currency) to just TWO (2) of the people on the list below with 
a note asking them to add your name to their mailing list. &nbsp;More about that later. &nbsp;First take time to 
SAVE this letter to a file that you can edit it later, in case you decide to participate.<BR>
<BR>
**THESE NEXT INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THEN CAREFULLY****<BR>
<BR>
Next e-mail the two people in POSITION #1 and POSITION#2 and ask them if they have received their $5 from 
ME. &nbsp;THIS IS WHAT ENSURES THE SUCCESS of this programme. &nbsp;You WILL NOT send money 
to me until you know that I have paid the people in POSITION #1 and #2<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;"Please add me to your Mailing List and rush me Phase 2 to me by e-mail"<BR>

<BR>
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS EDIT YOUR COPY OF THIS LETTER.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST move the person in Position#4 to Position #2. &nbsp;Be sure all information is copied correctly and 
completely. &nbsp;(The person originally in #2 is now dropped from the list.)<BR>
<BR>
SECOND, move the person in Position ~1 to Position ~4 with all the correct information.<BR>
<BR>
THIRD, move the person in Position ~3 to Position ~1 with all the correct information.<BR>
<BR>
FINALLY, enter YOUR NAME complete address and e-mail address into Position #3.<BR>
<BR>
REMEMBER - you only send $5 to the names in Position #3 and #4. &nbsp;DO NOT send money to the names 
in Position #1 and #2 !!<BR>
<BR>
E-mail addresses are very specific and need to be typed exactly as they are given in all of your correspondence 
with us. &nbsp;Otherwise it will not work..I REPEAT..it will not work<BR>
**********************************************************************************************8<BR>
<BR>
OKAY THERE ARE TWO SIMPLE THINGS YOU MUST DO TO MAKE THIS WORK FOR THE MAXIMUM 
RETURN IN 30-45 DAYS<BR>
<BR>
*******ATTENTION******** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT<BR>
<BR>
1. &nbsp;In Phase 2 you will advertise everywhere you can in the FREE AD areas. &nbsp;I will send everything 
you need to advertise such as samples, tips and lots &nbsp;of links to Free classified ads on the net.. If you need 
help just ask me.<BR>
<BR>
2. &nbsp;BE PATIENT ! &nbsp;It easily takes a week or so to really get going and to start getting lots of replies in 
your e-mail. &nbsp;BUT IT DOES COME AND THE MONEY DOES COME ALSO !<BR>
<BR>
YOU WILL DEFINITELY MAKE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY WITHIN A FEW WEEKS. and you will have a 
mailing list service to use yourself or to sell. &nbsp;That in itself can be worth a great deal !<BR>
<BR>
THIS PROGRAMME IS DESIGNED TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FAST. &nbsp;it is very INEXPENSIVE 
&nbsp;to participate in and it is designated totally to be run on line.<BR>
There are no postage expenses or name list expenses (Other than the two stamps needed to mail your two $5 
bills)<BR>
************************************************************************************************<BR>
<BR>
READ THIS OVER CAREFULLY. &nbsp;In addition to being very inexpensive it brings QUICK 
RESPONSES.<BR>
<BR>
Her's how it works.<BR>
<BR>
This programme is not quite like what you might think. &nbsp;You will NOT have to send $5 to five people for a 
report, a recipe a disk or any other product. &nbsp;I WILL SHOW YOU PROOF THAT IT WORKS.<BR>
<BR>
First of all there are only FOUR LEVELS, not five or six,seven or more like other programs. &nbsp;When you first 
send this programme out you will have 40-50 people who send you $5 to get PHASE 2 REPORT<BR>
<BR>
To account for curiosity seekers andfpeople who never recognise opportunity knocking at the door (not you of 
course) lets say that only 20 people pursue this programme. &nbsp;They will put your name in the Accountability 
list POSITION #1 and their respondents will be asking you if they paid you their $5 dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Their acrive participants will then move your name to POSITION #4 WHERE YOU WILL BE RECEIVING $5 
from 20x20x20 =8000 people. Times $5. &nbsp;THIS EQUALS $40,000.<BR>
<BR>
Because this is done only on the internet it moves very quickly. &nbsp;(This is not snail mail taking forever to see 
any money)<BR>
<BR>
THE ORGANIZER OF THIS PROGRAM IS STILL MAKING MONEY<BR>
<BR>
Cindy Allen ran this mailing list summation and has become financially Independant with the proceeds. 
&nbsp;When the programme is continued as it should everyone will profit.<BR>
<BR>
You on ly need 20 active participants who acrtually promote this program. &nbsp;To get this amount you should 
advertise until twice that number of people (40 to 50) have sent you $5 and received Phase 2 from you via email. 
&nbsp;At this point YOU CAN RELAX BECAUSE YOU ARE WELL ON YOUR WAY TO RECEIVING BIG 
MONEY. &nbsp;All you have to do is answer the emails saying "Yes I have been paid". &nbsp;Be sure to keep a 
record of those that have paid and been added to your mailing list for future reference.<BR>
<BR>
You should sen this p[programme to people who send you similar programs because you know yours is FASTER 
AND EASIER. &nbsp;It is simple and the investment is VERY LOW compared to other MLM programmes. <BR>
<BR>
YOU WILL BE AMAZED WITH THE RESPONSES YOU GET FROM THE WEB./<BR>
***********************************************************************************************<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for reading this far....now here are the simple details.<BR>
<BR>
FOLLOW THESE EASY STEPS.<BR>
<BR>
1. Savethis file as your Phase 1 file where you can edit the changes (names, addresses, email addresses amd 
position numbers)<BR>
<BR>
2. &nbsp;Mail out a total of $10 ($5eac) to the people in position #3 and #4 listed above.<BR>
<BR>
3. &nbsp;Update the names on the list. &nbsp;Place YOUR name and address and email address in Position #3 
(Where mine is now) and wait for Phase 2 to arrive in your e-mail box<BR>
<BR>
PHASE 2 WILL BE SENT THE SAME DAY THAT YOUR MONEY ARRIVES AT MY HOME ADDRESS. 
&nbsp;In the Phase 2 file you will be given the information of the person that will be placed in POSITION $ of 
your version of the Phase 1 file.<BR>
<BR>
You will receive more in Phase 2 which will be on its way to you the came day I receive the $5 from you in the 
mail<BR>
<BR>
THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATION. &nbsp;WE WILL ALL MAKE HUGE PROFITS THANKS TO THIS CHEAT 
PROOF/FAILSAFE PROGRAMME.<BR>
<BR>
Again here is how your name will move quickly through the system !<BR>
<BR>
1 &nbsp;Your name is at position #3 in Phase 1. &nbsp;This is what you mail out to people who will respond to 
your add or email to anyone you have ever had contact with on the internet. &nbsp;We all receive junk mail. 
&nbsp;Maybe now is the time for the junk mail to pay off. &nbsp;Just keep sending out as many emails as you 
possible can.<BR>
<BR>
2. &nbsp;You will email out Phase 2 out to each person who has sent you $5. &nbsp;On your Phase 2 you will be 
instructing your respondents to place YOUR NAME in Position #1 and you will begin receiving enquiries from 
others asking if you have been paid by so and so. &nbsp;It is important that you keep track of who you have 
been paid by. &nbsp;At this point you won't be receiving money (with the exception of the $5 you received from 
each person in Phase 1 - which &nbsp;will be $200 - $250 - just enquiries.<BR>
<BR>
3. &nbsp;Those people who have just enquired to you as to whether payment was made to you will be getting 
another 20 people or more to participate and your name will then be in position #4. &nbsp;This is when you will 
receive BIG MONEY.<BR>
<BR>
Last your name will be put in Position ~2 where you will be receiving enquiries &nbsp;and you will be able to 
answer at this point "Yes I am $40,000 RICHER. &nbsp;They should immediately participate and make 
money.<BR>
<BR>
Isn't this Business fantastic ? &nbsp;How can you NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. &nbsp;We have finally been 
able to create a Fool proof Cheat proof programme., where everyone has accountability. &nbsp;That is why 
these programs have not worked in the past because that one thing was missing.<BR>
<BR>
Your small investment of two $5 bills, totalling $10 will reward you with $40,000 &nbsp;or more !<BR>
<BR>
Once again e-mail me &nbsp;if you have any questions.<BR>
<BR>
Good fortune to you all.<BR>
