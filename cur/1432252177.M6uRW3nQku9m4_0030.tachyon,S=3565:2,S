There's a good possibility that Saddam was traced by Tempest
sensing, airborne or mundane. The technology is far more sensitive
than a decade ago. And with a lot of snooping technology kept obscure 
by tales of HUMINT, finks, lost laptops and black bag jobs.

For less sensitive compromising emanations, BETA, among others, 
makes portable Tempest units, desktop and room-sized, the devices 
export-restricted as if munitions.

There's a patent on a booth-like Tempest device into which the
user climbs, with protection provided for connections, but whether
it was ever built is unknown.

A slew of firms make Tempest products which can be examined
for what shielding works sufficiently well to be placed on NSA's
more or less trustworthy Tempest products list:

Beyond commercial-grade, NSA is reportedly able to read faint 
emanations from all known Tempest protection, thanks in part to 
reviewing products and international sharing among spooks.

Those leaked from fiber are now a piece of cake, and not by 
tapping the glass a la the RU submarine cable escapade and 
the derring-do of USS Jimmy Carter custom-rigged to hack 
transoceanic fiber.

Tempest snooping at the atomic level is feasible, thanks to
physicists who walk among the electrons with supercomputers.

As ever, what you don't know is what kills you, and if you are not
currently doing research or working on NDA stuff, you're toast.

Protecting against the known is what keeps the orchestrated 
leak industry thriving.

Be sure to submit bright inventions to the authorities to get contracts
for funding dark ones that work against the grain, then you'll get
really swell contracts or offed.

Ex-NSA staff are rolling in clover selling commercialized versions
of security technology that NSA freely accesses. Reminds of the Brits
selling to gullible govs impregnable Enigma machines after WW2.
