"

The FBI <http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi> is attempting to persuade
an obscure regulatory body in Washington to change its rules of engagement
in order to seize significant new powers to hack into and carry out
surveillance of computers throughout the US and around the world.

Civil liberties groups warn that the proposed rule change amounts to a
power grab by the agency that would ride roughshod over strict limits to
searches and seizures laid out under the fourth amendment of the US
constitution, as well as violate first amendment privacy rights. They have
protested that the FBI is seeking to transform its cyber capabilities with
minimal public debate and with no congressional oversight."
