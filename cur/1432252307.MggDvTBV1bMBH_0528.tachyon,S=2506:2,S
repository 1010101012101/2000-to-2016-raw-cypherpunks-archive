I downloaded the PDF version of the bill, read it, and was both amused 
and aghast.

Amused, because it is precisely the act we have sought to help make 
things immeasurably worse and thus bring on the destruction of America 
the Damned.

Aghast because of the boldness of the suspension of the Constitution in 
Oregon.

Every person in Oregon involved in crafting this bill or in supporting 
it should be killed by freedom fighters.


The USA is a fascist nation. Fuck it dead.
