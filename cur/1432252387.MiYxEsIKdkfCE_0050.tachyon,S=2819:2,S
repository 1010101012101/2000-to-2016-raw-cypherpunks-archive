not if you ever lived in new york, ate lunch 
innumerable times in the courtyard below the 
towers, watched the pink and blue sunrise 
reflect off them as you took a dawn ferry with 
your lover, watched the city glisten from a 
quarter-mile up in the sky, felt your stomach 
flutter in vertigo at the sheer size of the towers against 
the clouds standing at the base looking up ...
We are in tears looking at the cracked city.

You were never there, or you have no soul.
