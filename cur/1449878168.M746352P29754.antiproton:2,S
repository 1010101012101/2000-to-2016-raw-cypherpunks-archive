Oh, a few little things...  Job hunting, marketing one's products
and services, comparison shopping, commercial and educational
research, distributing propaganda, conventional and radical
political organizing, 24/7 access to a library that dwarfs all
previous ones in history combined...

A highly productive "office worker's desk" that fits in a small
tote bag has its uses as well.

Just for starters check out CopWatch, referenced in my earlier
post.  We might also factor in a half dozen or so investigative
journalism outlets, document distribution sites like Cryptome and
Public Intelligence, one's news aggregators of choice, access to
foreign press outlets, various spook watching sites, the mass of
raw data contributed by Manning, Snowden et al...

The Internet is billions of people, interacting through the
world's first many-to-many communications medium.  The "Web 2.0"
buzzword denotes a real thing:  Millions of users as content
creators and content promoters, the appearance (as predicted) of
swarming behaviors on the networks with social and economic
impacts in the real world, smart mobs, pathologically stupid mobs,
etc. etc.

Micro$oft's latest and greatest incarnation of PowerPoint.  Works

- From this I can only you don't take any interest in politics, or
your definition of the word is very different from mine. or that
you just don't use the Internet much.

Yes it will.  But will that be a sufficient advantage to
compensate for the ones our rulers lost when the Internet became
too important to commerce to "just turn it off"?  Little Brother
is watching Them, and there are enough /clever/ Little Brothers
(and Sisters) out there looking to pull Big Brother's pants down
that they are becoming a real world problem.

Yes, it gives the opposition a potentially useful tool.  As there
are FAR too many dissidents of various types wandering around
loose for it to be possible to personally persecute more than a
tiny fraction of them, the main value of mass surveillance is for
aggregate content analysis, social network mapping, and predictive
modelling of large scale social behavior.  This may be useful for
targeting and calibration of propaganda, and advance deployment of
physical assets to counter populist political actions.  But so
far, Big Brother seems to suck at that kind of work...

Do the new surveillance capabilities the Internet gives military
and police agencies outweigh the educational, intelligence,
propaganda and organizational capabilities the Internet has given
to radicals of all stripes?  That remains to be seen, but I am
fairly sure that obsessive attention to "privacy" shifts the
balance of power somewhat toward those whose whole job is to
maintain the status quo.

Of course, any political organizer with any common sense knows
well enough when to keep some specific information OFF the
networks and out of the hands of uncommitted "hang arounds" at
public meetings.

Very old.  Sometimes I wonder, "when did I get so damned old?"  I
watched Mercury and Gemini launches from my back yard.

I didn't start the "age based" comments, but srsly, it doesn't
take THAT much effort to find plenty of clever young radicals to
play with IRL - if you're OK with exposing your identity as a
"political dissident" on teh interwebs.
