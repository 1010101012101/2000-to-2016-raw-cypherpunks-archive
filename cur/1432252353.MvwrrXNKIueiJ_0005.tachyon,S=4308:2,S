Obvious too that if Jim Bell were a nym, there would be no one to send to
prison.

Now that the standard for sending someone away for five years is nothing
more than a statement by some jackbooted thug that they feel "harrassed,"
and today's exercise of ones Constitutional Rights is tomorrow's evidence
for the prosecution, anonymity just became a whole lot more important.

Amerika has finally reached the favorite plateau of police states
mascarading as democracies, that of having enough vague and ambiguous laws
to make everyone guilty of something, with jury Sheeple being viscerally
incapable of taking a citizen's side against the government.

I am reminded of the old law school demonstration of having a black
student, and a white student holding a banana, run into a classroom,
briefly struggle, and run out.  When asked what they saw, students will
swear the banana was a gun, that the black guy was the one holding it,
that the black guy attacked the white guy, and make numerous other
attempts to forcefit the brief flashes of what they saw into the world
view fed them by the media and the public school system.

When shown a drawing of a uniformed cop subduing an ordinary-appearing
citizen, even a six year old will describe it as "the policeman fighting
with the 'bad guy.'"

When the state holds up four fingers, and asks the Sheeple what they see,
the Sheeple truly see five fingers.  The Sheeple realize how fruitless it
is to resist.  The Sheeple look forward to the bullet.  The Sheeple not
only obey Big Brother, they LOVE Big Brother too.

"Proles and animals are free."
