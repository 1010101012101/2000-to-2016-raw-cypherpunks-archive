Hardly. I just happen to be the Mongoose in a pit of snakes, so it should
surprise nobody (especially the snakes) if they all hiss.

The bottem line is you say 'fair' is whatever the two parties 'agree' to.
All you've done is shift the focus from 'fair' to 'agree'. And that shifts
the focus of the question as well. What does it mean to 'agree'.

And to answer another question 'is' means 'equivalent to' or 'identical
with' depending on context. Both acceptable here.

This is especially enlightening coming from a group (CACL, not Cypherpunks
per se) who claim that 'free markets' are the epitome of utopian
strategies (and 'free' most definitely has a significant and particular
meaning in this context - and it doesn't support yorur view). You're only
proving my point. Thank you.
