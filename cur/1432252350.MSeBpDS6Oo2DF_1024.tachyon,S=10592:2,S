But when they say "criminal penalty for mining and other operation", what
they mean? I say, how can Russia know who are using Bitcoin, how can Russia
know who are trading or mining Bitcoin?

I think this image can describe the idea I want pass:
http://news.insidebitcoins.com/sites/default/files/government-banning-bitcoin.jpg
Am I wrong about that?

I miss the Soviet Union, at least they respected the personal and social
freedom (but, yes, I know Stalin was a lunatic).
