Yeah, the guys running it with pistols stuffed in their belts will shoot
you if you get too nutty. They also tend to outlaw fast draws (some won't
even let you wear a pistol in a holster while on the range) and other such

So we see that gun ranges don't allow anyone/everyone to run around armed
and operating equally.

As a result, your point is bogus.
