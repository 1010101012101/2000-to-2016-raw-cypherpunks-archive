  Rayzer, seriously, are you serious?



Which North Atlantic + European military bloc rhyming with poTATO
is Turkey+Erdogan a member of again? (Hint: NATO.)

And which country is Syria's primary military partner and long term
ally again? (Hint: Russia.)

And who was it that intended to overthrow Syria again? (Hint: USA.)

And who was it that established ISIS, trained, funded and provided
weapons to ISIS collaborators, provided military and logistical support
to invade Syria and was loudly proclaiming for 4 years that "Assad must
go"?  (Hint: USA.)

Did you not watch that interview/ talk by USA General Wesley Clark?

Here it is again:

http://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166
(article links to the full Wesley Clark interview - recommended (I'd
only seen the short most significant part before)



Rayzer, you are parroting the establishment/ MSM position, is that
position truthful? (Hint: it is a lie.)



To remind ourselves of a few further facts:

- The first refugee waves into Europe came from Afganistan and then
  Iraq.

- The second refugee wave into Europe came from Libya. Until Qaddafi's
  murder at the hands of Hillary "We came, we saw, he died" Clinton,
  Libya essentially "captured" a lot of African refugees (look how many
  CIA ops and USA MIC wars are going on in Africa), and Libya provided a
  lot of employment, hope, accomodation and, relatively speaking,
  stability.  Look at the immigration of actual refugees into Europe
  since Libya was "democratically liberated" by the West (USA, France,
  Germany, UK).

- Only the third wave comes from Syria, and this wave of refugees into
  Europe from Syria began --way-- before Russia went into Syria to
  rescue her ally, only in November/December last year (Hint: 2015)!

  And this third wave has predominantly been from Turkey, not Syria -
  and Erdogan used it as blackmail for a few billion $Euro from Germany
  - many times Erdogan was blackmailing in fact. Turkey to Lesbos (Greek
  island) has been a main conduit for Syrian, Iraqi and Afghani
  refugees, for one example.



If you look at the media though, you see a different story (the lie that
is), you see all this "ooh, so much Muslim refugees into Europe, since
BAD RUSSIA went to defend Syria!"

Since you seem to know details about Erdogan's deals with Russia,
perhaps you care to share them with the rest of us?
