David,

In addition to STUN, we also have a decentralized mechanism to select 1-hop
relays in the overlay when NAT traversal fails. We have done
simulation-based studies and our empirical evidence from the deployed
SocialVPN/Brunet systems is that these approaches work pretty well, but we
don't have a study of the system "in the wild" with large numbers of real
users behind NATs. We are planning to reach to a reasonably large number of
users to use the software to collect this among other kinds of data; any
suggestions/ideas on how to reach out to potential users for an experiment
would be welcome.

Thanks!
