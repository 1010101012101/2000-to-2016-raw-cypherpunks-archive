Actually, we're talking about markets for digital goods, copies of
bits that have been made already. Or digital services, selling
opinions, or telesurgery, or whatever, and whether people would make
new bits for free if there was a market for those bits already.

The fact that you can sell them, means that you won't do them for
free, was my point, made, what, 5 times now.

That's just plain common sense, right?

So, having attempted to make a point 5 times, I'm going to quit
repeating myself.

The proof will be data, after all, and we'll see that it means when
and if we get some.

Cheers,
RAH
