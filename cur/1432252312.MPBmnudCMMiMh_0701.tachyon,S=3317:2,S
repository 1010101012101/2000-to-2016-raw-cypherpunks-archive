If I understand the paper http://www.eyetap.org/~rguerra/toronto2001/rc4_ksaproc.pdf correctly, Cybersabre and WEP would be fixed if instead of making the RC4 initialization by concatenating a permanent and unchanging secret key, and an ever changing visible random value, they instead constructed 
the RC4 key by doing several different SHA hashes of the unchanging secret key, and the ever changing visible random value, and concatenated those hashes, and also discarded some substantial number of initial bytes from the RC4 output.
