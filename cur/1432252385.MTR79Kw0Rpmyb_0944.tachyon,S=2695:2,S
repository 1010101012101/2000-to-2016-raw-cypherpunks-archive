from panix shell hosts motd:

. panix.net usable as panix.com (marcotte) Sat Jan 15 10:44:57 2005
.
.    Until we resolve the issue of the domain "panix.com", we have set up
.    the domain "panix.net" to include the same names and addresses as
.    "panix.com".
.
.    You may use this as a temporary solution for access to mail, webpages,
.    etc. Wherever you would use "panix.com", you can replace it with
.    "panix.net".
