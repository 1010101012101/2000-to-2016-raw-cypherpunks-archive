	Nobody dies without healthcare under our present system.

	Sadly, at least for those of extreme libertarian bent that  make
up the choir on this list, our society has chosen to pass laws that
require hospitals and to some degree other medical treatment  facilities
to treat patients who cannot pay - mostly at their expense.   ANYONE
with a life threatening or even just very serious medical condition can
walk into most any emergency room and get full medical treatment by law
even if there is no insurance and no money to pay.  For the most part
this treatment is funded by hospitals by hidden (and sometimes partly
overt) charges built into their fee structure - in effect we already are
paying a tax in our present private insurance systems and
Medicare/Medicaid (and especially for private cash paying patients who
pay full rate and don't get the deep discounts that Medicare and HMOs
negotiate from providers)  that provides this last gasp safety net
coverage to the indigent.  

	Of course, in the libertarian ideal universe someone not
completely indigent who had a genetic condition that made them high risk
might still be unable to get any kind of catastropic medical insurance
and might be wiped out of virtually all assets by a serious illness,
even one  completely unrelated in any way to his genetic predisposition.
