SF Bay Area Cypherpunks

January 2002 Physical Meeting Announcement

GENERAL INFO:

   DATE:  Saturday 13 October 2001
   TIME:  1-5 PM (Pacific Time)
  PLACE:  Tressider Student Union
          Stanford University Campus
          Palo Alto, California, USA

Instead of our usual outdoor location, we'll be meeting inside the
coffeehouse adjacent to the courtyard.


AGENDA:

"Our agenda is a widely-held secret."

As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited.

	[ ... it was a quiet week in Lake.Woebegone.com, what with
	lists.meetingpunks.org, ssz, and various havenco servers
	going up and down, and holiday travel and the like.]

One of the main topics of discussion will be planning for
March's meeting, which will be on the THIRD Saturday of the month,
just before the RSA tradeshow, www.rsaconference.com ,
and approximately simultaneous with Codecon
	[ www.codecon.org , topics http://bitconjurer.org/codecon.html ]
which is Bram's conference about actual running code,
primarily focused on crypto and peer-to-peer applications.
	[ Some specifics include Peek-A-Booty, a web privacy tool which,
	in spite of winning Wired's Top 10 Vaporware Award for 2001,
	claims to be demo-ready for next month, cryptomail,
	Zooko talking about Mojo derivatives, and others.

Known foreigners suspected to be in town include Ian Goldberg.

Collateral Damage -
	- Sandy and friends having a party Saturday night
	- Party at Ian's Place Friday night

LOCATION:

    The Stanford meeting location will be familiar to those who've been to our
    outdoor summer meetings before, but for those who haven't been, it's on the
    Stanford University campus (in Palo Alto, California), at the end of
    Santa Theresa, at the tables outside Tressider Union, just west of
    Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

    We'll meet inside the coffee store adjacent to the courtyard.

    Food/beverages are available at the cafe and mini-market inside.
