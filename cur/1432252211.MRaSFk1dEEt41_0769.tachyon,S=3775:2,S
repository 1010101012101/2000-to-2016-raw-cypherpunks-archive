Your system as described is not in the slightest bit anonymous or
private.  Or at least the user has no cryptographic assurances that
the server is not logging everything, or that some adversary isn't
logging everything that goes over the connection even though the
server is not.

Right that is the linkability problem.  Plus of course as mentioned
above the user has no reason to trust the server.  Or at least he
would prefer a protocol where he did not need to trust the server.

That's where blinding comes into the picture.

Probably the simplest one to understand is Chaum's original scheme,
though there are others such as Brands, and Wagner's online system.

serial-no               = (b^e).[R||h(R)] mod n
proto-coin              = serial-no^d mod n
                        = b.[R||h(R)]^d mod n
coin                    = proto-coin . b^-1 mod n
                        = [R||h(R)]^d mod n
check-valid-coin(c)     = c^e mod n is of form [x||h(x)]
check-double-spent(c)   = bank records spent coins
trace-payee(c)          = payer gives bank b, bank records proto-coins as well

so a blind signature in this scheme is that the bank has an RSA
modules n, private key d, and public exponent e.

The user sends b^e.M mod n to the bank (where b is a random blinding
factor), the bank computes (b^e.M)^d mod n (a standard RSA siganture)
and sends back to the user.  The user then unblinds by dividing by b,
which works because:

(b^e.M)^d = b^{e.d}.M^d = b.M^d mod n

and b.M^d/b = M^d mod n

plus some other detais to avoid existential forgeries.

and so the bank can recognize it's signature later on a coin (because
it's a valid RSA signature made with it's private key d), but it won't
know which unspent coin it corresponds to because it doesn't know the
blinding factors b.
