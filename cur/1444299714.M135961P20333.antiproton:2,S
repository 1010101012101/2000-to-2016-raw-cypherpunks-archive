We've encouraged Best to continue doing what he is doing after using Cryptome
as a platform, counsel and source of information. He did set up a website, did
mirror the Cryptome archives, did do further research and announce it widely
and has picked a fight with several parties, complained of mistreatment,
censorship, abuse, exposed collateral innocent (ha!) parties.

We also told Best log files are the dirtiest secret of the Internet, none are
secure, none private, none singular, admins and websites lie about using
them, exploiting them, deleting them, needing them, stealing them, accusing
about them, inflating them, rigging them. They pay for the Net, thus not ever
going away or kept secure.

So Best is going in the tried and true direction, many others have staggered.
And if determined he will avoid depending on anybody for support. More power
to the asshole, welcome to the world of disputatious assholes, cypherpunks,
the Internet, the planet.

Brave new growth to kill off the cowardly old.

Praise and support controls, don't seek it or succumb to it. Enjoy fucking
yourself, Best, to entertain audiences. Cheers and keep at it.
