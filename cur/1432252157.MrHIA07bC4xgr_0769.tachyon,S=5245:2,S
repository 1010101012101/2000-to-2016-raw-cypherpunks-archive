The following are not necessarily focused on 'mesh' networking, but
are more generally addressing the shared property ownership of that
physical infrastructure.

On a similar note: I am forming a plan for an alternative
organizational form (or business model) that solves the typical
problem of power concentration during the growth of such endeavors
which would apply across all types of sharing, not just internet
access.
