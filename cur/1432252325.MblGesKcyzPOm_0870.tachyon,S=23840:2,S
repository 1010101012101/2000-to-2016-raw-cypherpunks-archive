I don't agree with your statement, "Bitcoin is only deflationary because th=

 factors have combined with the net result that Bitcoin is hyper-deflationa=

I don't have a specific number, I would not be surprised to hear that an AS=
IC miner is 1000x faster than even the fastest x86 CPU.=A0 If that were the=
 only factor, it would appear that new bitcoins should be 1000x more availa=
ble than in, say, 2009.=A0 However, I also understand that the 'difficulty'=
 of mining bitcoin has been algorithmically increased regularly, in order
 to make it more difficult to compute to find individual bitcoins.=A0=A0 Th=

&nbsp; In writing my AP essay, I anticipated that very small bets (say, 10 =
