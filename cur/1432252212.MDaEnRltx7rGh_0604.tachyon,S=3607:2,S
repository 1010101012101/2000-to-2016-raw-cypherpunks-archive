The vaccinia virus is most plausibly a weakened strain of
smallpox.

The word "vaccine" does not come from "vaccinia".  On the
contrary, the word "vaccinia" comes from "vaccine".

The Vaccinia virus is intermediate between the cowpox and
smallpox virus.

It may be the result of hybridization between cowpox and
smallpox, but is most plausibly the result of the small pox
virus devolving back towards the cowpox virus from which it
arose, as a result of being cultured in cows.  In this sense,
the vaccinia virus is most plausibly a weakened strain of
smallpox.

The word "vaccine" comes from cow, because the original
vaccine was cowpox, and the current vaccine is raised in
cows.
