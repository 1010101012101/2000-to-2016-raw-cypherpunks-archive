Ribs from sacred cows are the best.

Try John Young sometime, after those beers.  And Hettinga is probably
a perl script :-)

But seriously, you've just mentioned what's called "textual analysis".
Spelling errors and other idiosyncratic choices can be used
to "pierce the veil" of anonymity.  That's what did in Dr. Kaczynski,
who pissed on the FBI for over a decade, until his brother recognized
his text.

Running text through automatic translators (engl->german-engl) has
been suggested, but deeper signatures may remain.  It probably wouldn't
have helped Dr. K.

the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
