No. Rewriting the blockchain gives back those coin days. I imagine it's
pretty hard to use many people's coin days for the same block, whereas a
nonce to a block is very easy to communicate.

Why? If it works it works and if it doesn't it doesn't. A mix between the
two is an extremely political and complicating choice.

I'm stuck with a democracy problem. Is Plutocracy better? Is Democracy
better? Is any Obliarchy better?

I tend to think that the people are incapable of making the best choice.
Things turn into a trust/populism issue as the people thinks emotionally.
Additionally it just often lacks the domain specific knowledge for a good
choice.

Thus a form of obliarchy should be better. The selection criteria is the
real problem. Elections typically reintroduce the previous problems.

A higher level of education is a start as it correlates with domain
specific knowledge. It correlates too weakly for my taste. And it lacks
testing for critical thinking and similar skills, although they also
correlate. This also puts a pressure on determining the level of education
that isn't in the best interest of academics.

Simple intelligence testing would be preferable. But it is as of yet
impossible to accurately determine intelligence.

Wealthy is a selector that would work if it were not for a distorted
political situation and different levels of economic engagement present
even amongst the most capable human beings.


Ultimately the obliarchs can be trusted to make choices best for them, and
not the rest, in the ideal situation. Thus I feel it is not adequate.


In the end however the social/political/economical power wins anyway. Might
as well hardcode it. Even with all choices made up front a system will only
thrive with the support of people. People can be convinced and coerced with
political or economic power, or the social pressure of their peers.



The standing arguments against POS are:
* "Stake" is reverted/restored when the blockchain is rewritten
* It's a political choice, not so much a functional one
* Bitcoin days become a commodity of it's own (it is now too, as it speeds
up transactions, but it becomes something worth buying not something that's
nice to have. Can you imagine trading 1 btc for 1.2 btc and it being worth
it? Sidetracking by exchanging private keys -_-'.... )
* One's investment might change in a single trade. This might also be true
of mining, but it doesn't have to be.
* Large scale mining is traceable. This is an interesting notion, actually.

It'd seem that POS mining is more government-resistant as it does not
require large energy expenses.

I think if someone can solve the "investedness" in a certain blockchain it
gets very interesting.

The relative cost of an attack. It is also assumed that the overal usage
goes up. Mining not going down is a change I would make.

The everlasting counter argument is that money now is costlier still.
There's a simple trade between fraction of computing power devoted to
mining and security.

There's also stuff like http://www.gridcoin.us/ that, if properly
implemented, could drive down computing costs for scientific application.

I think this sort of clarity is valuable. There's a lot of stuff that needs
additional support. If it has to be trusted it is usually not called a
third party. The wealth of individuals is definitely something governments
have* a lot* of influence on.

Difficult to corner for who? Why and how do you want to distributed voting
authority, that's the ultimate question. Ideally there wouldn't be such a
thing as votes, just transactions.

Correctly is undefined. If you give people economic incentive the most
profitable choice would be the one taken. Making the voters take a choice
best for the system, thus the most profitable, might also not have
desirable results. Depending, of course, on the ultimate question.

You don't name the cost of voting. They are allowed to extend the
blockchain and get compensated for it. If they were wrong about their
extension, as defined by the mayority of extenders, their payment gets
revoked. This is enough to ensure each will apply the same rule to maximize
profit.

You incentivise becoming a greater stakeholder. I also think that people
with a lot of money will have ulterior motives. They don't just sit on
their money.

There's also interplay between many currencies and their exchange. It all
complicates the system tremendously.

The chief concern for the blockchain is ensuring a singular sequence of
transactions. Nothing else is vital. As a side effect the miners can change
the policies, but this is not a pleasant feature.

Voluntary entrance to a system is ideal. No need to run with BitcoinXKE, I
prefer BitcoinXKA. Blockchain forking does enable that. But transactions
could cross between chains where they are legitimate and it could get very
messy.


I'm worried about wanting a digital gold and getting a digital euro.
Reducing the flexibility of votes is a good means to that end. In Bitcoin a
policy change is agreed on before hand, a switchover date is arranged, etc,
in order to not lose money. That's pretty good.


> Incidentally, the coin days are from ALL of the transactions in the block,

You weren't and I'm not sure how this would work. If I sent in a
transaction to the network, someone else can claim reward for it? Do I get
rewarded for it?

This sounds like I'd have to re-announce my presence on the network pretty
frequently, allowing for easier tracking of participants.

ASIC time? But why override? I just change the order and that's enough.

How does POS factor into POW in this case?

I suspect reminting older blocks with more transactions would be feasible.
But you have to link to or explain how you want to do POS.

There may be legitimate incidents of accidental double spending. You're
also only fucking the recipient of the transaction, the sender has it's
trade long behind him.

It even means I could do a legitimate transaction and later destroy the
money I sent. Close but no ball. Without psuedonyms this is more feasible.
You could kill the sender's address, but that won't have much effect.
