INTERNET — Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill announced they were leaving  
The Intercept, Saturday, citing conflicts of interest with Pierre Omidyar,  
founder and owner.

In an exclusive interview with the Internet Chronicle, Scahill said,  
“Firstly, I’m sorry to the folks at Pando. I ran my mouth off on twitter,  
but then I did my research and it was obvious that The Intercept’s  
founder, Pierre, was off fomenting world wars in Ukraine on behalf of the  
US government. I can’t report on anything and take money like that.”

Scahill heaved a sigh of relief and his eyes watered, “When I came to  
Glenn and told him why I had to step down, he laughed and told me, ‘Your  
bravery is inspiring,’ and then he said how guilty he was at backing Tor,  
a pseudo-activist internet cloaking device built and maintained by the US  
Navy.”

Greenwald apologized to Yasha Levine of Pando, who reported on Tor’s  
funding, saying, “I know I called you a conspiracy theorist, but I was  
just shooting from the hip. I’m sorry for that. I had backed Tor for too  
long. I now know that you’re basically right. Tor is a military-backed  
project working towards the military’s ends and I was a useful idiot that  
drew in countless thousands by promoting it. And Pierre Omidyar, he was  
always pushing me to put Tor into my stories even when it didn’t fit. The  
guilt will haunt me to my death, but at least if I speak out now I can  
minimize the damage to others, even though it damages me personally. It  
isn’t easy to admit you’ve been accidentally doing propaganda work for the  
US military, but it sure is a relief to get away from The Intercept.”

Greenwald’s eyes twinkled as he said, “Snowden’s dream can finally come  
true. We’re going to do it, finally. We’re going to publish the list of  
people who are in prison because of the NSA’s illegal parallel  
investigations, and they’re going to go free, god dammit!”

Both Greenwald and Scahill remain upbeat and have already joined the staff  
at Internet Chronicle, where they will take a massive pay cut and forego  
all bylines for a year in an act of voluntary penitence as they work on  
freeing the victims of illegal NSA wiretapping.
