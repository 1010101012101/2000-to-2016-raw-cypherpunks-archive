York, NY)

This last one above (216.200.127.174) is a colocated server at 
above.net in NYC.

>From there, using a small piece of IP redirector software that they 
call "Triangle Boy", Safeweb just bounces packets around their 
network.

Likely just an internal Proxy-less netblock.... this is done often 
for private, non-routable IP addresses within a network. In other 
words, packets route ONLY in the internal network, routers are 
programmed to ignore any packets within such netblocks.

It's all true until you hit the colocated box. Then it's all cloaking.

> 2. Why some pings timed out and others didn't.

ICMP squelching is why.... you can selectively top ICMP return 
packets from being sent.... often done to protect the "topography" of 
a network. If you can't hear the pings, you can count the servers or 
hops in a network path.

> 3. Phantom station 10.100.0.2

See above... not a phantom, just can't route.

> 4. Whether the San Jose hops actually go to San Jose or are spoofed.

It doesn't really matter..... even if the server is physically in San 
Jose, which I doubt, so what? The end user connecting to that 
specific server could have been anywhere -- in the Hindu Kush 
mountains, for instance :)

They are probably not administrative... they exist to basically make 
the lives of anyone tracking a lone packet miserable :) Basically, 
it's just inserted path to hide the origin of the packet.

> 6. How is cloaking done on addresses and physical locations

Email me offline.... I can answer some questions on this, but to 
really understand it you basically have to understand how TCP works. 
But this kind of "cloaking" isn't really cloaking, it's just one 
simple technique partnered with a network that has enough depth to 
make it look like you're bouncing around from one place to another.

I forget the specifics, but there's an old physics problem involving 
a black box and inputs and outputs. That's what you have here..... 
the black box isn't really so big, but because you can't see in it, 
you don't know EXACTLY how big, or more to the point, exactly what is 
in it. That's the idea behind ICMP squelching.

btw, this is really a simple defense; it is somewhat easy to 
overcome, although that doesn't mean that you could actually learn 
anything useful by overcoming it.

:) Nothing special at all..... any well-designed network implements 
this right off the bat, to stop the little scripties from following a 
trail of bread crumbs. Safeweb DOES do some (simplistic) IP spoofing 
and "cloaking", but what you see is NOT it....
