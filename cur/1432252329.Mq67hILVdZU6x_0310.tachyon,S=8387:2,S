Subject: [Cryptography] prism proof email, namespaces, and anonymity
X-Mailer: iPad Mail (10B329)

Everyone,

The more I think about it, the more important it seems that any anonymous e=
mail like communications system *not* include people who don't want to be p=
art of it, and have lots of defenses to prevent its anonymous communication=
s from becoming a nightmare for its participants.  If the goal is to make P=
RISM stop working and make the email part of the internet go dark for spies=
 (which definitely includes a lot more than just US spies!), then this syst=
em has to be something that lots of people will want to use. =20

There should be multiple defenses against spam and phishing and other nasty=
 things being sent in this system, with enough designed-in flexibility to d=
eal with changes in attacker behavior over tome.  If someone can send parti=
cipants in the system endless spam or credible death threats, then few peop=
le are going to want to participate, and that diminishes the privacy of eve=
ryone remaining in the system, along with just making the system a blight i=
n general.  If nonparticipants start getting spam from the system, it will =
either be shunned or shut down, and at any rate won't have the kind of repu=
tation that will move a lot of people onto the system.  An ironclad anonymo=
us email system with 10,000 users is a whole lot less privacy-preserving th=
an one with 10,000,000 users.  As revelations of more and more eavesdroppin=
g come out, we might actually see millions of users want to have something =
really secure and anonymous, but not if it's widely seen as a firehose o' s=
pam. =20

A lot of the tools we use on the net everyday suffer from having been desig=
ned without thinking very far ahead into how they might be exploited or mis=
used--hence spam, malware in PDF files, browser hijacking sorts of attacks,=
 etc.  My thought is that we should be thinking of multiple independent def=
enses against spamming and malware and all the rest, because parasites adap=
t to their environment.  We can't count on "and then you go to jail" as a f=
inal step in any protocol, and we can't count on having some friendly utili=
ty read millions of peoples' mail to filter the spam if we want this to be =
secure.  So what can we count on to stop spam and malware and other nastine=
ss? =20

Some thoughts off the top of my head.  Note that while I think all these ca=
n be done with crypto somehow, I am not thinking of how to do them yet, exc=
ept in very general terms. =20

a.  You can't freely send messages to me unless you're on my whitelist. =20

b.  This means an additional step of sending me a request to be added to yo=
ur whitelist.  This needs to be costly in something the sender cares about-=
-money, processing power, reputation, solving a captcha, rate-limits to the=
se requests, whatever.  (What if the system somehow limited you to only, sa=
y, five outstanding requests at a time?).=20

c.  Make account creation costly somehow (processing, money, solving a capt=
cha, whatever).  Or maybe make creating a receive-only account cheap but ma=
ke it costly to have an account that can request to communicate with strang=
ers. =20

d.  Make sending a message in general cost something.  Let receiver address=
es indicate what proof of payment of the desired cost they require to accep=
t emails. =20

e.  Enable some kind of reputation tracking for senders?  I'm not sure if t=
his would work or be a good idea, but it's worth thinking about. =20

f.  All this needs to be made flexible, so that as attackers evolve, so can=
 defenses.  Ideally, my ppe (prism proof email) address would carry an indi=
cation of what proofs your request to communicate needed to carry in order =
for me to consider it. =20

g.  The format of messages needs to be restricted to block malware, both th=
e kind that wants to take over your machine and the kind that wants to help=
 the attacker track you down.  Plain text email only?  Some richer format t=
o allow foreign language support? =20

h.  Attachments should become links to files in an anonymizing cloud storag=
e system.  Among other things, this will make it easier to limit the size o=
f the emails in the system, which is important for ensuring anonymity witho=
ut breaking stuff. =20

What else?  I see this as the defining thing that can kill an anonymous enc=
rypted communications system--it can become a swamp of spam and malware and=
 nutcases stalking people, and then nobody sensible will want to come withi=
n a hundred meters of it.  Alternatively, if users are *more* in control of=
 who contacts them in the prism-proof scheme than with the current kind of =
email, we can get a lot more people joining. =20

Comments?
