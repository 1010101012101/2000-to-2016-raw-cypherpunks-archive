Good points, all. It may be instructive to consider the case of the
Maryland police officer who was convicted and sentenced to 10 years
recently for turning a police dog loose on an unresisting suspect.

Instead of distancing themselves from this sadistic officer, and saying
that such behavior is beyond the pale, her fellow officers protested
and declared a work "slowdown." The union was all for it.

Don't look for a fast response from 911 calls, I guess, if you live
in certain Maryland suburbs of DC.

The Washington Post wrote an editorial condemning this thuggish tactic
on the part of "Maryland's finest."
