See <http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/sdata/200206/certca.html> for 
recent data re SSL certificate market share; Geotrust, at 
<http://www.geotrust.com>, has 11% of the market, and appears (from their 
web pages; I haven't bought one) to be ready to issue SSL server certs 
without the torturous document review process which Verisign invented but 
Thawte managed to make simultaneously more intrusive and less relevant.
