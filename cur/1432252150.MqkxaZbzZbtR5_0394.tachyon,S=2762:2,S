Subject: Is PGP broken?

Is it just me, or is PGP broken?  I don't mean any particular version
of PGP -- I mean the fact that there are multiple versions of PGP
which generate incompatible cryptography.  Half the time when someone
sends me a PGP-encrypted message, I can't decrypt it.  Presuming that
I'm right, is anyone attempting to fix PGP?

Not to mention anything about PGP keyservers, or the utter and
complete absence of anybody doing point-source PGP signing.
