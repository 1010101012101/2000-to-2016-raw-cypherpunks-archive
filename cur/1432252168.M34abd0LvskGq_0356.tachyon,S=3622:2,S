Hello, 


If your like me, you've already deleted mail from dozens of 
"Get Rich Quick" schemes, chain letter offers, and LOTS of 
other absurd scams that promise to make you rich overnight 
with no investment and no work.  This email was mailed to you 
personally because you are on a select mailing list of a person 
who wants to make money from home online. 


What I am offering is an honest computer-based business that 
you can run full-or-part-time, from your home or office. This 
system runs automatically while you sleep, vacation, or work 
a "regular" job. Our company is a 19 year old member of the 
Better Business Bureau and listed A+ with Dunn and Bradstreet. 


Take our Free no obligation Demo and you'll discover why we have 
an unfair advantage over all the competition.

Thanks for your attention! 
Sincerely, 


Aupacom  Enterprises
