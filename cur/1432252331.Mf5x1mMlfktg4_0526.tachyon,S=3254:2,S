Yes, but I think it's fairly clear that if one needs to dissasemble the 
OC-Ns in the field, you simply need too much gear. It's going to be far 
easier to grab whole swathes of it and ship it back to Montana or wherever 
for it to be sifted through later.

What they probably do, however, is grab specific DS1s/3s locall and switch 
those via CALEA back to optical access points, where all of this stuff is 
pulled together into OC-192s or (very soon) OC-768s. As Variola suggests, 
once you get it back then you can plow through it at your leisure. Got a 
disident you want to shut down? "Surely he's said SOMETHING over the last 2 
years that you could incriminate him on....find it, dammit!"
