Seems this AG needs to be whittled down to size.

                    Online License Peddler Shut
                    Down 
                    Offered $350 International Permits to Bad Drivers, Officials
                    Say 

                    Nov. 17, 2000 

                    By Joe Beaird 

                    JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (APBnews.com) -- The attorney general of
                    Missouri has persuaded an Internet service provider to shut down a
                    Web site that sells international drivers licenses to people,
                    regardless of their driving history. 

                    "Drivelegal.com is now officially road kill," said Scott Holte, a
                    spokesman for the Missouri Attorney Generals Office. "Theyre off
                    the Internet right now. We got their server to pull the plug on them." 

                    Drivelegal.com, which was taken off the Internet on Thursday,
                    allegedly issued international licenses for $350 to drivers with
                    revoked or suspended licenses. 

                    "Its patently illegal for them to be promoting this as a way for people
                    with DUIs driving under the influence convictions and other things to
                    get around the law," Holte said. 

                    Although the Web site is based in California, the Missouri Attorney
                    Generals Office took action against the operation because it claimed
                    that Drivelegal.com was making false claims that violated Missouris
                    consumer protection laws. 

                    Threat of jail, fines 

                    Drivelegal.com says on its Web site that international drivers
                    licenses could be used to drive legally in any state or province. But
                    Missouri contends that the IDL is only a supplemental permit to be
                    used in conjunction with a government-issued one. 

                    "Make no mistake about it," Attorney General Jay Nixon said in a
                    statement. "Anyone whose license has been suspended or revoked
                    who buys one of these IDLs from Drivelegal.com will not only be
                    $350 poorer, they will be running the risk of jail time and fines for
                    operating a vehicle without a valid license." 

                    Few consumers had complained about the Web service in Missouri.
                    The investigation actually started in response to a meeting with
                    officials in the states division of motor vehicles. 

                    Owner: Im just following the law 

                    Tim Thorn, who runs Drivelegal.com, told APBnews.com that his
                    business was legal and questioned why Missouri was attacking it. 

                    "Im just following the law as its written," Thorn said. "So I dont know
                    really know what hes going on about. ... Ive been doing this for
                    years without a problem." 

                    Even after getting Drivelegal.com offline, Nixons office is still seeking
                    a temporary injunction to keep Drivelegal.com from operating in
                    Missouri and is hoping to permanently ban them from the state. No
                    court dates have been set. 

                    Thorn, who lives in Southern California, could face civil penalties of
                    up to $1,000 for each time his company violates Missouri law.
                    Reached after the shutdown, he was despondent. 

                    "I just found out," he told APBnews.com. "It sucks. I didnt do anything
                    wrong." 

                    No recourse 

                    Internet service provider Hypermart sent Thorn an e-mail recently
                    telling him he had 48 hours to remove his site from their servers. 

                    "I cant even log in to download materials," Thorn complained. 

                    Because service providers write detailed terms of service that allow
                    them to terminate their user contracts for many reasons, Thorn said
                    he did not believe he would succeed in fighting the shutdown order. 

                    "I dont really have any recourse," he said.
