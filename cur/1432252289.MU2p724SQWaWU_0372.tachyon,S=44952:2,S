Sorry...I can't get past the title, unless of course there are some kind of 
terrorist gene that can be tested for so that I can know a priori that I'm 
interrogating a terrorist.

This is, of course, aside from the fact that one man's terrorist is the rest 
of the world's freedom fighter theese days.
