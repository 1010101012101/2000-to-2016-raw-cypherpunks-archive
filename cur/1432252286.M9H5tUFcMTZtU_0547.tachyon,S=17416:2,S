I think Bob made some great points about my book, but it's clear that 
this debate
is revolving around a few sentences in Bob's review. Perhaps he miscategorizes
Brin, perhaps he doesn't. I haven't read _Transparent Society_ in some time.

Still, it's important to realize that this isn't just a battle 
between the state
and its citizens. Encryption can provide a practical tool and a great option
for the data management engineers. Brin has a good point about the value
of openness, but I'm sure he doesn't extend it to things like people's credit
card numbers. Brin would probably be interested in the book and the way
it leaves some things in the clear. It's all about translucency, 
which is, after
all, partially transparent. The glass is half empty or full. So maybe there's
something in common here?

The right use of encryption (and any anonymity that comes along with it) can
protect businesses, customers, clients, employees and others. I'm sure it
might also be used to by a few elites to avoid scrutiny, but that doesn't have
to be the case.




For me, the mathematics of on-line anonymity are essential parts of 
on-line security. While I think that there are plenty of personal and 
emotional reasons to embrace anonymity, one of the best is the higher 
amount of security the systems offer. Simply put, identity-based 
systems are more fragile because identity theft is so easy. Systems 
designed for anonymity avoid that weakness because they're designed, 
a priori, to work without names. So I think they're just bound to be 
a bit safer.

It should be noted that the anonymous techniques developed by Chaum, 
Brands and others do not have to be used to avoid scrutiny. You can 
always tack on your true name in an additional field. To me, the 
systems just avoid relying on the the name field to keep people 
honest.

I'm glad Bob sees the resonance between _Translucent Databases_ and 
the world of cypherpunk paranoia, but I would like to avoid a strong 
connection. It's not that there's no relationship. There is. But the 
book is meant to be much more practical. It explores how to use the 
right amount of encryption to lock up the personal stuff in a 
database without scrambling all of it. In the right situations, the 
results can be fast, efficient, and very secure. So the techniques 
are good for the paranoids as well as the apolitical DBAs who just 
want to do a good job.

>>we'll just have to get used to changes in our definition of privacy.  What
>>salad dressing you use may be as widely known as what color sweater you

>>
>>The important thing to remember is that anyone who claims a right to keep

>>The modern debate over information, and who controls it, must begin with a

>>
>>(1) Each of us understands that knowledge can be power. We want to know as

>>want our opponents to know little about us. Each of us would prescribe
>>armor for "the good guys" and nakedness for our worst foes.
>>
>>(2) Criticism is the best antidote to error. Yet most people, especially

>>criticism by crushing free speech and public access to information. This
>>sometimes helped them stay in power... but it also generally resulted in
>>horrific blunders in statecraft.
>>
>>3) Ours may be the first civilization to systematically avoid this cycle,
>>whose roots lie in human nature. We have learned that few people are
>>mature enough to hold themselves accountable. But in an open society where
>>criticism flows, adversaries eagerly pounce on each others' errors.  We do
>>each other the favor of reciprocal criticism (though it seldom personally
>>feels like a favor!)
>>
>>
>>Four great social innovations foster our unprecedented wealth and freedom:
>>science, justice, democracy & free markets.  Each of these "accountability
>>arenas" functions best when all players get fair access to information.
>>But cheating is always a problem because of (1) and (2) above.  It's a
>>paradox, all right.
>>
>>While new surveillance and data technologies pose vexing challenges, we
>>may be wise to pause and recall what worked for us so far. Reciprocal
>>accountability  - a widely shared power to shine light, even on the mighty
>>- is the unsung marvel of our age, empowering even eccentrics and
>>minorities to enforce their own freedom. Shall we scrap civilization's
>>best tool - light - in favor of a fad of secrecy?
>>
>>Across the political spectrum, a "Strong Privacy" movement claims that
>>liberty and personal privacy are best defended by anonymity and
>>encryption, or else by ornate laws restricting what people may know. This
>>approach may seem appealing, but there are no historical examples of it
>>ever having worked.
>>
>>
>>Here are a few themes discussed in The Transparent Society:
>>
>>* Cameras and surveillance devices swarm our technological world,
>>multiplying and getting harder to spot each day. A "Moore's Law of
>>Cameras" shows them halving in size, doubling in acuity and movement
>>capability and sheer numbers, every year or so.  Passing laws won't stop
>>them. Robert Heinlein said: "Privacy laws only make the bugs smaller...
>  >and limit their use to some elite."
>>
>>But there may be another solution.
>>
>>* Knowledge is the ultimate drug, and forbidden knowledge is craved above
>>all. Credit companies, banned from holding bankruptcy records beyond 7
>>years, now ship the taboo information to offshore 'data havens.'  Shall we
>>create an underground economy in contraband information, as we have done
>>with drugs?  Who will benefit?
>>
>>*  One wing of the Strong Privacy crusade wants Euro-style privacy
>>commissions with a myriad laws and clerks to police what may be known by
>>doctors, corporations, and individuals. Dataflow controls may indeed be
>>needed at times! But this solution should be a last resort, not the first
>>place we turn.
>>
>>* Another wing of wing of Strong Privacy likes libertarian techno-fixes --
>>empowering individuals with encrypted cybernetic anonymity. But scientific
>>and social flaws may render these panaceas no more effective than 'ghost
>>shirts'.  Even if they can be made to work, it may just empower a new
>>elite - those who best know-how to use the new masks and armor.
>>
>>*  Is government the chief enemy of freedom?  That authority center does
>>merit close scrutiny... which we've been applying lately with
>>unprecedented ardor.  Meanwhile other citizens worry about different power
>>groups -- aristocracies, corporations, criminal gangs, and technological
>>elites. Should 'suspicion of authority' apply in all directions?  Can
>>anyone justifiably claim exemption from accountability?
>>
>>* Privacy and personal safety are better safeguarded by catching peeping
>>toms. Freedom thrives when we turn 'henchmen' into
>>whistle-blowers.  Elites will always have some advantages, but we're all
>>better protected by knowing than by forbidding others to know.  (It is far
>>easier to verify that you know something, than to verify that someone else
>>is ignorant.)
>>
>>*  Why do our "accountability arenas" work so well?  Science, justice,
>>democracy & free markets are direct products of openness... most of the
>>people knowing most of what's going on, most of the time.  Even individual
>>eccentricity seems to flourish best in light.  Closed societies have
>>always been more conformist than open ones!
>>
>>
>>Many of these points may seem counter-intuitive... but so is our entire
>>rambunctious, argumentative, tolerant, eccentric, in-your-face culture!
>>The Transparent Society explores underlying issues, from the technological
>>(cameras, databases and the science of encryption) to the startling (why
>>all our films preach suspicion of authority), helping foster a new
>>appreciation of our unique civilization.
>>
>>Defying the temptations of secrecy, we may see a culture like no other,
>>filled with boisterous amateurs and individuals whose hunger for
>>betterment will propel the next century. This will happen if we stick to a
>>formula that already works... most of the people knowing most of what's
>>going on, most of the time.

>>"As David Brin details the inevitability of ubiquitous surveillance, your
