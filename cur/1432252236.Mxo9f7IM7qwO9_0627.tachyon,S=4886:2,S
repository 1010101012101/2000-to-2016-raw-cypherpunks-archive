SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

THE 11TH WORKSHOP ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC 2007)

Hosted by
Claude Shannon Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Coding and Cryptography
at
University College Dublin, Ireland

September 5th-7th, 2007

http://www.shannoninstitute.ie/conferences.htm

ECC 2007 is the eleventh in a series of annual workshops dedicated to the
study of elliptic curve cryptography and related areas. Over the past
years the ECC conference series has broadened its scope beyond
elliptic curve cryptography and now covers a wide range of areas
within modern cryptography. For instance, past ECC conferences
included presentations on hyperelliptic curve cryptography,
pairing-based cryptography, side-channel attacks, voting protocols,
quantum key distribution, AES, hash function, implementation issues,
and deployments.

At the same time ECC continues to be the premier conference on elliptic
curve cryptography. It is hoped that ECC 2007 will further our mission
of encouraging and stimulating research on the security and
implementation of elliptic curve cryptosystems and related areas, and
encouraging collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists
and engineers in the academic, industry and government sectors.

As with past ECC conferences, there will be about 15 invited lectures
(and no contributed talks) delivered by internationally leading experts.
There will be both state-of-the-art survey lectures as well as lectures
on latest research developments.
