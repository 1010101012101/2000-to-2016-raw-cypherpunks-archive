Actually its not the wages, which may quite attractive for these workers 
and their skills, but the intimidation and occasional violence used to 
recruit and maintain employees, keep them from organizing and the 
government support or blind eyes which take me aback.  It reminded me of 
the tyranny of the coal mining companies in West Virginia circa 1880's.

I've actually spoken to a few Central American women who worked in these 
factories and the conversations left an indelible memory.  I'm not ready to 
abandon my support of laissez-faire capitalism or globalism.  Perhaps these 
painful personal experiences are all for the best in the long term, I 
certainly don't have a better solution to improving their lot, but it has 
caused me to think about the price some pay.
