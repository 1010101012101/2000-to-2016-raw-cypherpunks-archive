If I remember correctly - the formula is simple enough.  1 part
(unit) cocain for every 10 parts (units) of baking soda.  Mix well - add
water until you have a paste - then smear past on flat baking pan - place
in oven until mixture hardens (no I don't remember the temperture one
uses - but it would be somewhere between 200 - 300 F). When the mixture
hardens - you let it cool to room temputer and then hit it with a hammer
to break it up - and viola - you have crack cocain - the most evil
substance on the planet.
