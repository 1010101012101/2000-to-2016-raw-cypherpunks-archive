So there will be joint prosecutions, with each of the Bloc-ers receiving
indictments for *all* of the "operations" performed. I also think such
aggressive demonstrations will make the police even more trigger-happy than
they are now.

The only logical conclusion I can see to skirmishes between black-clad
anarchists, going on "street operations", and governmental riot control
forces, is that the police are eventually given the right to just gun the
protestors down, irregardless of whether they have *done* anything. Unless
the Bloc actually has enough muscle to overthrow something before then,
which I highly doubt, their raising the stakes seems fairly unwise.
