Sorry, I see from an earlier message of yours that you are looking for
a simple non-crypto solution, so I guess this doesn't fit the bill.

The examples you gave in your earlier message all seem to be
equivalent to having the participants send the data to a trusted third
party who performs the computation, except that the trusted third
party is transplanted to one or more of the participants computers,
which are protected against their owners.  I guess it boils down to
whether or not the level of trust is sufficient.  This seems iffy when
one of the participants is also the trust provider.
