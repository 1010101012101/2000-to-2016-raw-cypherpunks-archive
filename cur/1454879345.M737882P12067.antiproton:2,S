	I would be hardly surprised if 'anarchist' rayzer is in the
	same category as 'anarchist' chomsky.


	http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/authors/noam-chomsky-net-worth/


	http://www.hoover.org/research/noam-chomsky-closet-capitalist

	(I on the other hand live a relatively poor life in a 'third
	world' country...)


	Regardless, it's quite obvious that 'anarchist' rayzer doen't
	have much of a clue about political philosophy. 

	It's not clear why he joined a mailing list that isn't a
	'commie' mailing list, and why he whines when his sick
	'collectivistic' garbage gets the treatment it deserves.

	You couldn't come up with more content-free bullshit even if
	you hired the likes of chomsky to write bullshit for you.

	The only vehicle I bought in my whole life was a bicycle.

	Then again, that has nothing to do with the fact that the only
	thing  you can do is parrot collectivistic garbage - garbage
	you can't justify.

	Problem is, this not your riseup echo chamber...
