That's an interesting set of points...perhaps impossible for mere mortals to 
fully understand the impact of. Of course, the whole Lindar can be made to 
implode if the 2nd Life Managers decide to virtually print up a lot of 
virtual money. Could that impact the actual economy? 'Impossible'....maybe 
not...

I'm still wondering too if the new anti-net-gambling laws are really an 
attempt to crack down on terrorism. Imagine a gambling site set up so that 
someone wishing to move funds can be identified and made to 'loose' 100s of 
thousands, but in small transactions. Hell, the site could be otherwise 
legitimate. I'd bet the Russians already do this.
