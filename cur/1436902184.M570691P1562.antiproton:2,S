It's not just about who cares more about your data.  Most people don't have a solid enough understanding of security to protect their item data.  Just because it's on your computer doesn't mean it's any safer from being grabbed than it is on the public cloud.  Sure,  you could take the time u to learn good security but most people won't.  That's just a utopian dream. 

The more time goes by, the more I agree with Ed Snowden and his statement about the Internet dividing into two groups: those who are part of the technical elite and have the ability to protect themselves and those who don't and must accept that their privacy will be raped at will.
