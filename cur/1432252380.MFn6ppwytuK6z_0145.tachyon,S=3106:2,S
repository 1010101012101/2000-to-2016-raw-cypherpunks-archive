Why not just use gpg to encrypt all the PDFs, using the hostname of the
mirror of the password?

This makes things slightly more difficult for us, but not impossible,
and imposes a large cost on bots trying to enforce the Science
Interdict.

There are any number of small programmatic transformations we can apply
to PDFs that make them not obviously PDFs to bots, but obviously PDFs to
humans. Ultimately, this is how we'll have to go, because it's pretty
easy to say that diyhpl.us/text.pdf is the same as
proprietaryjournal.com/text.pdf, even without watermarks.
