They have every right to be angry.

However, they have no right to sweep the streets and arrest 500-600 
persons and throw them in a hole for 5 weeks. Arab students who merely 
lived in the same garden apartment complexes in San Diego as one of the 
hijackers were arrested, not charged, thrown in a small cell, and are 
being held for some kind of grand jury investigation.

What ever happened to "taking a statement" and releasing them if there 
is no evidence they were complicit? Fear that they'll leave their 
student lives in San Diego and fly back home? (Probably a good bet for 
some fraction of the 500, some fraction who will be so radicalized by 
their treatment that they sign on to participate in a vengeance act.).

Due process has been thrown out the prison windows (oops, there aren't 
any...) in this one.

Amerika is shown to be a nation of angry cops, not a nation of laws.

The next suspect held indefinitely in a stinking jail cell on "material 
witness" grounds could be me, you, or any of us.
