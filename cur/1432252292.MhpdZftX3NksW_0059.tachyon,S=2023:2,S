This seems preety hefty on ambition and pretty low on details.  Is he 
planning on these wal-wart "servers" acting as TOR nodes?  Universally 
accessable wifi spots?  FreeNet nodes, or LAFS servers?  

I think what bugs me the most here is that the basic premise appears 
intrinsically flawed: On Inet-1, everyone can see who you are - it's an 
artifact of the construction goals originally designed for.

I'd want to see some more meat and less fluff before I looked any deeper.
