Thanks to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of our great champions of privacy, 
private property, and limited government, any American buying a gun from a 
dealer or other licensed seller may have their name permanently embedded in 
the FBI's NICS database.

Currently federal law (http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html) 
orders the FBI to "destroy all records" of a gun purchase that is approved 
as lawful. Naturally those champions of individual liberty at the FBI and 
Justice Department have creatively interpreted this straightforward 
requirement -- to mean precisely the opposite of what the law says. Thus 
records have been kept for a period of 90 to 180 days.

Schumer's bill would "allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to access 
NICS audit log records for the purpose of responding to an inquiry from any 
federal, state, or local law enforcement agency in connection with a civil 
or criminal law enforcement investigation." Seems to me that would let the 
FBI access and store records of the vast bulk of firearm purchasers from 
this point on, if this bill were to become law. Here's the text of 
Schumer's proposal:
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:s.01788:

Naturally the section reducing the privacy of lawabiding Americans is 
titled "privacy protection." Glad to know that Schumer hasn't lost his touch.

-Declan

(Note: Not all U.S. firearm purchases must go through a dealer who checks 
in with the NICS database. Private sales are still, for now, allowed 
without federal records kept.)

    Senators Propose 'Gun Owner Registration'
    By Jeff Johnson
    CNSNews.com Congressional Bureau Chief
    December 17, 2001
    Capitol Hill (CNSNews.com) - Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants the
    Department of Justice to keep personal data on law-abiding gun buyers
    from the National Instant Check System (NICS), and to offer the
    information for unlimited use by state and local agencies.
    National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre
    called the move "gun owner registration, plain and simple."
    Making good on a promise he made during a Senate Judiciary Committee
    hearing December 6, Schumer introduced the "Use NICS in Terrorist
    Investigations Act" (S. 1788) after Attorney General John Ashcroft
    refused to allow the FBI access to NICS records of lawful gun
    purchases.

"Terrorism and Guns: Ashcroft's 'coddling' of gun owners,"

by Dave Kopel (http://www.davekopel.com), Independence Institute,

and Prof. Glenn Reynolds (http://www.instapundit.com), Univ. of Tennessee

from the National Review Online, Dec. 17, 2001,

http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel121701.shtml



Attorney General John Ashcroft has come under fire for what Boston Globe 
columnist Tom Oliphant calls "coddling" gun owners.  Oliphant's attack was 
the latest round in the concerted assault on Ashcroft's Second Amendment 
positions, which started this spring when Ashcroft announced his view 
(since supported by the recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision in United 
States v. Emerson, 
http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/99/99-10331-cr0.htm) that the 
Second Amendment protects an individual right to arms.

Ashcroft's stance was consistent with that of the attorneys general for 
Ronald Reagan, Franklin Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Jackson, 
among others (http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel052901.shtml).  It 
was also consistent with most Supreme Court statements citing the Second 
Amendment, including everything the Rehnquist Court has ever said 
(http://www.davekopel.com/2A/LawRev/35FinalPartOne.htm).

Ashcroft's view mirrored repeated congressional declarations of the 
individual right to arms -- including in the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, 
the Property Requisition Act of 1941, and the Firearms Owners' Protection 
Act of 1986.  It's also compatible with a wide variety of gun controls, as 
demonstrated by the Court of Appeals decision in Emerson, which ruled that 
the particular federal gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment.

Ashcroft was, however, out of step with the antigun groups, who recognize 
that a meaningful Second Amendment makes it impossible to ban guns across 
the board.  For the same reason, the attorney general was out of step with 
the position of the Clinton/Gore/Reno administration.  Indeed, the 
difference between the Bush/Ashcroft view of the Second Amendment 
(http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment050500a.html) and the 
Clinton/Gore/Reno view was -- as President Clinton admitted -- the reason 
Gore lost five close states, and thus the election.

Still smarting from that humiliation, gun prohibition groups have decided 
to attack Ashcroft for obeying federal gun statutes and for complying with 
a regulation created by Attorney General Janet Reno.  Last week, on the 
morning Ashcroft was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield turned a press release 
from a gun-prohibition group, the Violence Policy Center 
(http://www.vpc.org/press/0112ash.htm), into a Times article.  Ashcroft's 
opponents on the Senate Judiciary then used the article to excoriate 
Ashcroft for obeying the law.  Predictably, gun-prohibition sympathizers 
like Oliphant and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Cynthia Tucker have 
begun piling on.

At issue was Ashcroft's decision to tell the FBI that it couldn't start 
rummaging though the federal records of *legal* gun buyers as part of its 
terrorism investigation.  Indeed, the law forbids the keeping of such 
records in the first place.  It does, however, authorize the federal 
government to retain records of people -- such as illegal aliens, or people 
with temporary visas -- who illegally attempt to buy guns.  Those records 
are available to the FBI for any and every law enforcement purpose.

Mr.  Butterfield didn't bother to inform his Times readers about what 
federal law actually says.  So let's examine the laws directly.

Since 1998, all federally regulated gun purchases require that the buyer 
obtain approval from the FBI's "National Instant-Check System," which 
ensures that the buyer is not a "prohibited person."  NICS checks the 
buyer's name against a database of felons and other prohibited people.

The NRA had pushed the instant check as an alternative to the Brady Bill's 
waiting period.  As a compromise, Congress made the waiting period 
effective for five years (1994-98) for handguns only, to be replaced in 
1998 by the instant check on all guns.  Determined to prevent NICS from 
being perverted into a gun registration system, Congress -- thanks to votes 
of many Brady Bill supporters -- specifically forbade the government to 
compile records of lawful purchasers.

As enacted, the national instant check law, 18 U.S. Code 922(t) 
(http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=922) 
provides that:

(2) If receipt of a firearm would not violate subsection (g) or (n) or 
State law, the [Instant-Check] system shall --
(A) assign a unique identification number to the transfer;
(B) provide the licensee with the number; and
(C) destroy all records of the system with respect to the call (other than 
the identifying number and the date the number was assigned) and all 
records of the system relating to the person or the transfer.

(Emphasis added.)

This means, of course, that if the feds were following the law, there 
wouldn't be any records to examine, since they're supposed to be destroyed 
once a sale is approved.

It also means that every congressman who voted for final passage of the 
Brady Act in 1993 (including Senators Kennedy, Biden, and Leahy, as well as 
then-Representative Schumer) voted for this explicit ban on keeping the 
federal records of legal gun buyers.

The 1993 prohibition was reinforcing a 1986 Congressional statute, the 
Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), which creates a blanket ban on a 
federal gun registry.  The relevant part of FOPA, 18 U.S. Code 926 
(http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=926), 
provides:

(a) The Secretary may prescribe only such rules and regulations as are 
necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter...  No such rule or 
regulation prescribed after the date of the enactment of the Firearms 
Owners' Protection Act may require that records required to be maintained 
under this chapter or any portion of the contents of such records, be 
recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by 
the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor 
that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms 
transactions or dispositions be established.  Nothing in this section 
expands or restricts the Secretary's authority to inquire into the 
disposition of any firearm in the course of a criminal investigation.

Of the current members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who were in the 
Senate in 1986, only Kennedy voted against passage of FOPA.  Senators 
Biden, Leahy, Hatch, Thurmond, Grassely, and Specter all voted for it, and 
hence for the registration ban.

In addition, the annual appropriation for the Department of the Treasury 
(which controls the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) always 
contains a ban on spending any funds for creation of a federal gun registry.

Quite plainly, all this means that (1) records aren't supposed to be kept 
on legal purchases of firearms, and (2) it's illegal to establish a 
national gun registration system.  This was underscored in the recent case 
of RSM v. Buckles, 254 F.3d 61 (4th Cir. 2001) 
(http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=4th&navby=case&no=001777P), 
where the federal Court of Appeals pointed out that the government's power 
to scrutinize gun records was limited, and that a national gun-registration 
system -- even one established through "backdoor efforts" -- was illegal.

Even so, when preparing to implement the National Instant Check System, 
then-Attorney General Reno announced that the government would keep records 
on lawful gun purchasers for 180 days.  The stated purpose of these records 
was to audit NICS, to make sure it wasn't being misused (e.g., to ensure 
that gun dealers were not requesting instant checks on people who were not 
their customers -- for example, in case a gun-store owner started 
requesting background checks on his daughter's boyfriends).

The NRA sued, arguing that by saying the records had to be destroyed, 
Congress did not mean they should be destroyed "eventually, when the 
Attorney General gets around to it."  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia, in a 2-1 decision 
(http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment081000a.shtml), upheld the 
180-day record retention.  The majority opinion, written by a Clinton 
appointee, claimed that federal law "does not prohibit all forms of 
registration."  The Clinton majority also asserted that because Congress 
did not say the records had to be destroyed "immediately," the records 
could be destroyed sooner -- or later.

Dissenting, Judge David B.  Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, retorted that 
Congress had been perfectly clear.  "The Attorney General's position," 
wrote Sentelle, "strikes me as reminiscent of a petulant child pulling her 
sister's hair.  Her mother tells her, 'Don't pull the baby's hair.'  The 
child says, 'All right, Mama,' but again pulls the infant's hair.  Her 
defense is, 'Mama, you didn't say I had to stop right now.'"

The Senate responded to Reno's machinations by restating its 1993 
intent.  In 1998, Senator Bob Smith (R., N.H.)  proposed a rider to an 
appropriations bill to mandate immediate records destruction.  The Senate 
approved the Smith Amendment, 69 to 31, thanks in part to the support of 
Senators Daschle, Leahy, and Murray.  Later, a conference committee 
stripped the Smith Amendment, as well as some other non-appropriations 
riders, from the appropriation bill.

During the 2000 election, candidate Bush condemned the Clinton/Gore/Reno 
registry of legal gun buyers, and promised to terminate it.

Meanwhile, Reno promulgated a regulation cutting the retention time to 90 
days.  The Reno regulation forbids the use of the NICS registry for general 
law enforcement purposes, while allowing registry use for auditing the 
performance of NICS, as well as for civil or criminal cases arising from 
the operation of NICS.

Thus, it is plainly illegal for the FBI to dig into the NICS registry for 
general investigations.  Had Attorney General Ashcroft allowed such access, 
he would have violated the law.  (This summer, Ashcroft proposed a revised 
regulation to cut the retention time to 24 hours, but even this shorter 
time period violates the congressional mandate that records be destroyed, 
not kept for "a short period of time.")

Fox Butterfield neglected to tell his readers about the 1986 law forbidding 
a federal gun registry.  He also didn't tell them about the 1993 law 
mandating destruction of records on legal buyers.  Of the Smith Amendment 
-- which passed the Senate 69-31 -- Butterfield wrote, "That amendment was 
defeated."

The Senate Democrats had some basis for being angry with Ashcroft after he 
began the Senate hearing by declaring, "To those who scare peace-loving 
people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Your tactics only 
aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve."

Ashcroft may be correct that his proposals are important for antiterrorism, 
and do not violate the Constitution.  But our system of checks and balances 
works best when all potential civil-liberties restrictions are subjected to 
critical public scrutiny.  Indeed, the value of the Leahy/ACLU loyal 
opposition was demonstrated at the Ashcroft hearing, when the attorney 
general promised the military tribunals would not normally meet in secret, 
and would be confined exclusively to terrorist offenses.  (Both positions 
are much more rights-protective than the text of President Bush's November 
13 executive order authorizing the tribunals.)

Ashcroft's harsh words against the skeptics were unfortunately reminiscent 
of Bill Clinton's denunciation 
(http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/LawRev/Preventing_a_Reign_of_Terror.htm) 
of the civil liberties groups that lobbied against his plan to use the 
Oklahoma City bombing as a pretext for a huge expansion of federal 
surveillance and wiretapping, and use of the military in domestic law 
enforcement -- although none of the Clinton proposals would even arguably 
have prevented the bombing.

The Democrats also feel betrayed that the Bush administration announced the 
military tribunals, the eavesdropping on attorney-client conversations, and 
similar new measures before the ink was barely dry on the misnamed USA 
Patriot Act (http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel092101.shtml), in 
which Senate had caved in to administration pressure for even more 
government surveillance, and for the power to conduct secret searches of 
homes and businesses.  These new laws do not sunset and are not restricted 
to terrorism cases; they apply as well to federal enforcement of laws about 
pornography, drugs, endangered species, child support, and everything else.

After the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a much better, and 
properly focused, antiterrorism bill, Tom Daschle pressured Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chair Pat Leahy to surrender to Ashcroft's demands for 
a much broader bill.  Leahy, did so.  Leahy & co.  feel double-crossed now 
that the administration has implemented military tribunals by executive 
decree, after Congress had already given the administration almost 
everything it asked for.

A proper response would be for the Senate Judiciary to commence hearings on 
repealing or sun setting the many non-terrorism provisions of the USA 
Patriot Act, which consist mostly of items that have been on the FBI 
bureaucracy's wish list for many years, and that had never been able to 
pass previous Congresses.

Instead, we have the absurd spectacle of senators denouncing the attorney 
general for respecting civil liberties, and for obeying federal statutes 
and his predecessor's regulation.  At Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, 
Democrats extracted absolute promises that he would obey and enforce all 
the laws, even ones he disagrees with.  Now, he's being skewered for not 
inventing a loophole in federal laws that allow no room for loopholes.

Would it make sense for Congress to change the law to allow registration of 
legal gun purchasers, to assist terrorism investigations?  No one has yet 
made such a case.  The FBI has gone fishing for every possible bit of 
information on the 600 aliens who have been detained.  This doesn't mean 
that we need to drastically reduce the privacy of half our citizen 
population (about half of all households own guns) simply for the sake of 
fishing expeditions.

Remember, current law allows record retention for people who illegally 
attempt to buy guns.  It would also allow putting the name of every alien 
with a temporary visa, and every known illegal alien, into the FBI database 
of prohibited persons -- since those people cannot buy guns lawfully.  [18 
USC Sec. 922(d)(5)(B) & (g)(5)(B) 
(http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ts_search.pl?title=18&sec=922)].

Yet the St.  Petersburg Times, perhaps the most antigun daily newspaper in 
America, wrongly told its readers last Sunday that Ashcroft had cut off 
access to records of illegal aliens who had been stopped from buying guns.

Current law also allows gun tracing -- the investigation of the sales 
history of a particular firearm.  If the FBI finds a firearm in the home of 
a detained person, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is allowed 
to trace the gun (using its serial number) from its manufacturer to the 
wholesaler to the retail store.  From there, the BATF can interview the 
person who bought the gun, whoever he transferred it to, and so on.

As part of the tracing that is already allowed, the BATF compiles lists of 
guns used in crimes, and can trace ownership records.  The BATF has 
successfully connected some of the guns on its trace list with some of the 
detained people.

We don't know if any of the detained people had permanent resident status 
(which would allow them to buy guns).  It's also possible that an illegal 
alien or a temporary could obtain a driver's license in his own name, buy a 
gun, and get approved by NICS.  The problem is that, according to the 
General Accounting Office, some -- but not all -- non-immigrant aliens and 
known illegal aliens are put on the NICS prohibited list.  What we need is 
better record keeping on aliens, not on law-abiding Americans.

Yet -- even for aliens who slipped through the current, incomplete NICS 
list -- if anyone purchases more than one handgun in a five-day period, his 
purchases are reported to federal and local law enforcement, and those 
records are currently available for checking 
(http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=27&PART=178&SECTION=126a&YEAR=2001&TYPE=TEXT).

It might help the FBI to gather information on detained suspects if every 
time a person checked into a hotel or motel, a record were kept by the 
federal government.  They could then study the suspect's travel 
patterns.  Yet we don't register all hotel and motel stays for the entire 
population.  The privacy interests of the American people are held to 
outweigh the possible benefit to law enforcement.

Similarly, we could require the registration of everyone who purchases or 
checks out a book on nuclear physics or biological or chemical 
warfare.  It's hard to deny that it would be helpful for the FBI to be able 
to check this database against the names of the detainees.  But we don't 
keep lists of people who own books -- even especially dangerous or 
incriminating books -- because First Amendment and privacy rights are more 
important.

The case against gun registration is stronger still.  Even besides the 
privacy issue, there is the undeniable fact that gun registration lists 
have been repeatedly used for gun confiscation.  This has happened in 
California, New York City, England, Canada, Australia, and Nazi-occupied 
Europe, among other places.

Before Sarah Brady became head of Handgun Control, Inc. (now renamed "The 
Brady Campaign"), her predecessor, the late Nelson T. "Pete" Shields, 
explained the plan to The New Yorker in 1976:

The first problem is to slow down the number of handguns being produced and 
sold in this country.  The second problem is to get handguns 
registered.  The final problem is to make  possession of all handguns and 
all handgun ammunition -- except for the military, police, licensed 
security guards, licensed sporting clubs,  and licensed gun collectors -- 
totally illegal.  [Richard Harris, "A Reporter at Large: Handguns," New 
Yorker, July 26, 1976, p. 58.]

Gun confiscation is, of course, an indispensable tool for tyranny, as our 
Founders knew -- and as Mullah Omar proved quite recently.  As the Boston 
Globe reported 
(http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/343/nation/How_Omar_led_Taliban_to_power_then_defeat%2B.shtml):

Omar guaranteed the residents a peaceful and secure community if they 
agreed to surrender their arms to him.  If the residents were ever 
threatened by someone from outside, Omar pledged to be responsible for 
their safety.

Within three or four days, everybody in the town surrendered their weapons 
to Omar...

Congress was right to outlaw federal gun registration, and Attorney General 
Ashcroft is right to obey the law.  The media and the Senate -- which 
behaved with such irresponsible passivity when Ashcroft rammed the 
so-called "USA Patriot Act" through Congress -- ought to stop demanding 
infringements of the Second Amendment.  Instead, they should start opposing 
all efforts to further erode the Bill of Rights.  Attorney General 
Ashcroft, meanwhile, needs to stop denouncing those who are defending the 
Fourth and Fifth Amendments with the same commendable scrupulousness with 
which he protects the Second.
