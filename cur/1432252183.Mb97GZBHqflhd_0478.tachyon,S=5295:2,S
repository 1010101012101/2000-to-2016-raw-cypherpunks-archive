WHAT IS MASS MURDER IF YOU'RE AN EX-PRESIDENT?
Wayne Madsen
While CIA agents and US Special Forces are on the hunt for Al Qaeda 
cells   throughout East Africa, a company on whose International Advisory 
Board sits   George H. W. Bush ("41," sire of "43") is applying a full 
court press on  human rights workers and opposition politicians in 
Tanzania. In 1996,   Tanzanian troops allegedly buried alive some gold 
miners at Bulyanhulu mine in northwestern Tanzania. The miners were 
originally invited by the government to mine gold in the region, but in 
1996, the government in Dar es Salaam reversed course and granted the 
Kahama Mining Corporation, an affiliate of Sutton Resources Ltd. of Canada, 
a permit to mine the gold in Bulyanhulu. Sutton was later acquired by 
Barrick Gold, another Canadian firm on whose board Bush pere sits along 
with former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former Clinton First 
Friend Vernon Jordan.
When the Tanzanian independent gold miners refused to comply with a 
government order to vacate the mine for Sutton, they were said by Tanzanian 
witnesses to have been buried alive by bulldozers belonging to the mining 
company. Recent reports and revelations concerning the role of Sutton cum 
Barrick in the massacre have resulted in a law suit against Britain's 
Observer newspaper and a decision by Amnesty International to delete 
references to the massacre in its annual report on human rights.
Now, Barrick, in cooperation with the Tanzanian government, is putting the 
screws to those brave Tanzanians who have dared challenge the official 
record on what happened at Bulyanhulu. Last month, Tanzanian police 
arrested Augustine Mrema, the leader of the opposition Tanzania Labor 
Party, and Rugemeleza Nshala, the head of Lawyers for Environmental Action 
in Tanzania (LEAT). Tanzania also issued an arrest warrant for Tundu Lissu, 
a Washington, DC-based human rights lawyer who has documented witness 
accounts of the 1996 mass murder. Tanzanian police searched the offices of 
LEAT, reportedly looking for a videotape that displays the charred remains 
of the bodies of victims, said to have been burnt by the military after 
they were exhumed from the buried mine.
The opposition politicians and human rights workers have refused to turn 
the tape over to the Tanzanian government wanting to instead get it into 
the hands of an independent international investigation team.
So the deal post September 11 is that if your last name is Bin Laden, Omar, 
or al-Zahrawi and you killed innocent people, you will have a world 
coalition hot on your heels. However, if your last name is Bush, Mulroney, 
or Jordan and it just so happens that another Bush sits in the White House 
and you sit on an international board of a company accused of covering up 
genocide, you will get a free pass and a pat on the back. Welcome to the 
Bush New World Order. God help us all.
