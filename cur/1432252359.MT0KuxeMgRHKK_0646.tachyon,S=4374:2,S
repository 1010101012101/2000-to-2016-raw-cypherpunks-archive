in summary, you need to turn off gzip to mitigate this for now:

http://breachattack.com/

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/aug/06/breach-and-django/

At last week's Black Hat conference, researchers announced the BREACH
attack<http://breachattack.com/>,
a new attack on web apps that can recover data even when secured with SSL
connections. The BREACH
paper<http://breachattack.com/resources/BREACH%20-%20SSL,%20gone%20in%2030%20seconds.pdf>
(PDF)
contains full details (and is a good and fairly easy read).

Given what we know so far, we believe that *BREACH may be used to
compromise Django's CSRF protection*. Thus, we're issuing this advisory so
that our users can defend themselves.

BREACH takes advantage of vulnerabilities when serving compressed data over
SSL/TLS. Thus, to protect yourself from BREACH, you should disable
compression of web responses. Depending on how your application is
deployed, this could take a couple forms:

   1. Disabling Django's GZip
middleware<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/middleware/#module-django.middleware.gzip>
   .
   2. Disabling GZip compression in your web server's config. For example,
   if you're using Apache you'd want to disable
mod_deflate<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html>;
   in nginx you'd disable the gzip module<http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipModule>
   .

Additionally, you should make sure you disable TLS compression by adjusting
your server's SSL
ciphers<http://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/>
.

We plan to take steps to address BREACH in Django itself, but in the
meantime we recommend that all users of Django understand this
vulnerability and take action if appropriate.
