If you intend to argue you need two things you consistently lack,

a point

a line of reasoning backing it up.

Yes, you did. You specificaly said that posts through the CDR were
implicitly usable for commercial use (ie your using them in a article)
without permission or other contact to the author. You also compared it to
USENET with some hair brain claim that USENET posts were public domain.

So far, all you've done is repeat it over and over.

No point, no line of reasoning.
