Perhaps my phrasing sucked... let me rephrase:

The least the people behind this program could have done, was not waste
further taxpayer money on a logo which was described as "A little
sinister!!!" from one the people in charge of approving it. Honestly, as
issued, I consider the logo disgraceful and un-American. The only silver
lining to this cloud is that we have some transparency regarding its
approval, which admittedly is not much of a silver lining.
