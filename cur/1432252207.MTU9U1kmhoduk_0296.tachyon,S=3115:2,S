On the backbone, between BGP peers, one would have thought
that there are relatively few attackers, as the staff are
highly trusted and the wires are hard to access - hence no
active attacks going on and only some passive eavesdropping
attacks.  Also, anyone setting up BGP routing knows the other
party, so there is a prior relationship.

The whole point of the CA model is that there is no prior
relationship and that the network is a wild wild west sort
of place - both of these assumptions seem to be reversed
in the backbone world, no?  So one would think that using
opportunistic cryptography would be ideal for the BGP world?
