With SARS, a large surgical mask covers nearly all of the 
identification markers. Add a pair of sunglasses or tinted eyeglasses 
and nearly nothing remains.

However, the long-term implications are clear: computers become so 
cheap and cameras so ubiquitous that public movements are trackable. 
Many have written on this already. It's a signal detection problem, and 
the odds favor the trackers.

(Which may cause more people to limit public purchases, to limit public 
shopping. Which can help crypto in private places, where the reverse of 
the above is the case: technology favors the person trying to  hide, 
not the watchers. Crypto wins here.)
