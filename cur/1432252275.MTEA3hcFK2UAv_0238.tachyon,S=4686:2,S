When you need a Domain Name it makes sense to think " GoDaddy.com."
GoDaddy.com is an ICANN accredited and approved registrar and is
offering the three most important domain name types (.com, .net,
and .org) at the unheard of prices of $8.95/yr to as low as
$6.95/yr.

There's no gimmicks and no hidden fees.  Domains are registered
in your name.  Once registered you can point the name wherever
you like, transfer it, do with it what you want.   There's no
catches here.  In fact everything's the same as if you paid other
registrars much more.  There's also Free Parking for your name for
as long as you like.

Already have your domain name registered with another company?
You can transfer it to GoDaddy.com and start saving.  Transfers
are only $8.95 (try to beat that price anywhere), with no added
fees (includes a 1 year extension).  GoDaddy.com also provides
some pretty slick tools (at no charge) to help you find a name
that's available and that works for you!

BUT YOU BETTER ACT NOW!  Domain Names are going fast.  REGISTER
YOUR NAME TODAY BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE BEATS YOU TO IT!
