I think its not trespass until you've advised them to leave, if they
approach a door.  Don't know about signage by your driveway; locally
you need a 3 signs per mile (IIRC) on your property to keep people
away.  Not sure about how long you can linger at a closed door.
Does lingering become harassment? 

Aside, on property rights: I learned that in LA county  the
county Vector Control (ie, mosquito) people can come onto your property
to sample standing water, if they suspect it; and even add fish to your 
standing water (eg birdbath) pools.

If you had a gate with sign, probably not.  But an open driveway is
ok.

When I was ~10 my dad, who recognized a server, sent me out to tell the
guy to leave.  (We had a similarly long driveway.)  He left.  It was cool.

Cypherpunks don't talk to strangers.  Except to tell them to go away.
Maybe using a voice-changer to say that.

You could peer from a window with a rifle pointing at the sky, but
I'd be careful about pointing it towards even uninvited visitors.

This thread is an advertisement for big noisy dogs, too.
