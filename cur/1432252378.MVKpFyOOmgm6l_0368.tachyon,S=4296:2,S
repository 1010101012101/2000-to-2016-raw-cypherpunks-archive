[From another list..]

  A charge of "mail fraud" or "securities fraud" doesn't mean jack shit
  anymore.  If you exchange money or other financial instruments a
  prosecutor can nail you for something.  Real fraud does occur, but
  prosecutors prefer to go after targets they want to cut down to size,
  such as Michael Milken or Martha Stewart.  They base their cases on
  obscure subjective laws that violate private property rights and are
  designed to ensnare everyone.

Using the US postal system can be damaging to your freedom.  I was
thinking of re-selling pre-paid domestic, private carrier, envelopes as
this circumvents the USPS and the associated discretionary federal
charges (e.g., mail fraud).  Do any on the list think there would be
interest?  Will not maintain any postal info after ack of receipt. 
Haven't thought about price but it won't be a gouging.
