There's an endless number of ways that malware that don't follow any neat
process isolation model with clean usage of API:s can cause what would be
experienced as glitches. Hiding executables in GPU memory assigned to fonts
can do that. And yes, that's 100% possible.

They might not want to show examples of the injection attacks in order to
not reveal how they're detecting the traffic. Look up NSA's Turmoil and
Quantum Insert.

First of all, it is written mostly for a non-technical audience.

Second, you're a bit stuck on the high-level models of computers here,
you're not considering how the effects of binary level tampering and code
exploits and altering RAM and even firmware for persistence attacks (
http://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/) might manifest
themselves. To somebody who thought he really did secure his systems well,
the signs that well obscured malware will show will make it look like your
computer has ghosts.

One problem is that the attacks change too fast. Holding off until they
change it themselves can allow you to detect even more of their activity
than anybody would if you told the world right away. Otherwise they'll
instantly stop the particular attacks you detected and switch to something
else. At best one could release details of how to analyze your old offline
backups for signs of infections.
