thanks.

  "The Effect of Anti-Circumvention Provisions on Security"

One of the properties of digital Intellectual Property (IP) is that it can
be easily reproduced, modified, and transferred.  In response, IP owners
have created creating new security technologies for controlling the digital
works. Inevitably, this creates an opportunity for those who can circumvent
those technologies.

"PGP Future Directions"

Reconstruction, Instant Messaging encryption, PGP for Wireless, and future
