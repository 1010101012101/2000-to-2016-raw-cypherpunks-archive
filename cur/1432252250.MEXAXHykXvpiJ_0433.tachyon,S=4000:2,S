A vehicle badly out of tune will backfire, as will a vehicle whose driver 
turns the motor off for a few seconds, then turns the ignition back on as 
the vehicle rolls down the road.  This works better in vehicles with manual 
transmissions.  unburnt fuel flushed through the exhaust system ignites at 
once, resulting in a very noticeable backfire-like noise.

While no vehicle you've ever owned has ever backfired, you say, this does 
mean other vehicles are free from the phenomena.

Nice ad hominem, btw.
