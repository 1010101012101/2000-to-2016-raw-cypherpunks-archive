It really isn't a point to be pursuaded, it's axiomatic in democratic
thought. The premise is that the only way to guarantee every person a say
in their society is to guarantee their say.

Not a hard concept at all. Unfortunately it's more than a tad non-PC,
especially to anarchist and federalist (statist by your term I believe).
Merely another observation that those who take oaths to protect our
liberty don't usually themselves believe in it.

Ask yourself (not Tim but the reader in general) why is it that in a
country dedicated to free speech the defendent in a trial doesn't get it
while in the courtroom?
