Britain is doing a lot less than you seem to think.  The RIP act
has been passed, but to a rising chorus of protests from all sides,
including industry.  Actual implementation of the bill will not
occur for some time (1-2 years).  In the meantime opponents of the
bill are preparing their legal cases, arguing that the act is in
violation of various European Union directives.

At the practical level, UK ISPs have seen no change at all.
