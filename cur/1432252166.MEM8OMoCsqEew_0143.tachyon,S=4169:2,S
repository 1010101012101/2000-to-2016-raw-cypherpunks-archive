I used to use them a lot. Great for beans et.c  And not as expensive as
a goode steamer :-)

Pressure cooker much faster to heat up. Also for large samples the water
adds heat to sample faster - food in an oven at 200 degrees is often not
much more than 100 inside while the outside is already roasting.
Personally I would quite like to keep microbiological samples separate
from my cooking equipment :-)

But oxygen is just the thing to be nasty to bacteria.  Hit them with
activated oxygen. Peroxide works wonders - kills all known bacteria
(yes, even spores) and doesn't permanently damage the environment :-)
