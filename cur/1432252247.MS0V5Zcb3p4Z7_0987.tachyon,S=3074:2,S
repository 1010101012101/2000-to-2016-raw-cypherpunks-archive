Dear Canada
 11/4/2004 - New York City


 'dear canada,
now, more than ever, your neighbor to the south(aka-the blue states)needs
you. most of us living in the northern and western parts of the united
states don't feel very connected to the rest of the u.s, so can we bring
our states and become part of canada?
we have a lot of money and some interesting cities and we promise not to be
too much trouble.
the benefits to you:
a-in one fell swoop you can have southern california and new york city!
surfing in canada! suddenly the u.n is on canadian soil! broadway is
suddenly in canada! you could then say that canada is the birthplace of
jazz and hip-hop!
b-money. cold hard cash. the red states in the u.s might have the voting
power, but guess who has the money? yup, your friendly neighborhood blue
states.
 so when/if you accept our offer you will instantly become the richest
country in the world! that sounds pretty good, right?
c-karma. accepting this offer will give you more good karma than you'd know
what to do with(because you would instantly make 120 million people VERY
happy).
so you get warm beaches, tons of cash, and good karma. who can say no to that?
please let us know if you accept the offer. given our enthusiasm to join
canada it's safe to say that the details of the offer could probably be
worked out in an afternoon.
thank you very much,
moby

 p.s-just to put your minds at ease, we do know that we can't bring our
assault weapons with us.'
