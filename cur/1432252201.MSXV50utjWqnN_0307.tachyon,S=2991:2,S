Dear Dave,

Last summer I had a chance to go to Virginia Beach, VA.

Not only do they have "FaceIt" facial recognition cameras on the street
corners http://newsobserver.com/24hour/nation/story/1027482p-7209015c.html
but they have all sorts of other goodies to make it one of the scariest
towns I've been to. All the features of this "family town" were instituted
not after 9/11, but to contain the African Americans during the "GreekFest"
in the late eighties.

I've included an image I took of the "no cussing" signs
