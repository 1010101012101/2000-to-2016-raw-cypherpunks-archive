         I've not had that happen with a single one so far (and as I said,
I've watched quite a few every week for the last two years or so) -- I wonder
if it only works with standalone DVD players, or, if on computer DVD's, if
its a windoze thing, and since I'm using a Mac for that, it doesn't work,
just like other windoze things that they put on some DVD's don't work
