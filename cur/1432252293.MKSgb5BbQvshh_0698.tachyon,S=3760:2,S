This was incorrect:  Eight of the first ten posts were appropriate uses of 
the word "nazi".  Two were inappropriate.

Scanning subsequent pages, a substantial portion were bogus uses of the 
word nazi -- IBM sold Hollerith machines to the nazis, Bush's family did 
business with the nazis, etc.

Strange how such transactions are evidence of nazism, while trading with 
Cuba is not evidence of communism.

However although inappropriate uses of the word "nazi" are common, they are 
not so common that any use of the word "nazi" can be automatically discredited.
