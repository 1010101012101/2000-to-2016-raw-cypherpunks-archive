Any State employee who attempts to oppress free speech, including
video, deserves killing.  Read the Bill of Rights.

Any limitation on financial speech is dubious at best; however, one
imagines that bandwidth is readily donated, for free, as in liberty,
and beer, and code, and other forms of expression.

Any private ISP is free to do as they please; however, when the State
is involved, its minions must respect the BoR or expect a well-deserved
visit
from Mr. Soze, et al.

Render unto Caesar, etc.
