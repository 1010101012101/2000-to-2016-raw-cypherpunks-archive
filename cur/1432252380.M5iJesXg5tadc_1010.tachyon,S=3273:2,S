I've been experimenting with it some this morning - it's a memory and CPU 
hog, turning 10-20K input
files into 20-30M data files, and using 300-500M of RAM and a few minutes 
of CPU time on a relatively fast
Athlon in the process.

Nothing interesting to report yet, other than a hunch that it'd be improved 
by rewriting some parts
in C, and/or using a resource storage format that's more appropriate for 
big data sets, like a database. It seems to want to keep everything in RAM 
at once.
