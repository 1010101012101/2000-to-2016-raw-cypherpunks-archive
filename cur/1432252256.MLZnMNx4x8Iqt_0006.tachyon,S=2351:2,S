A little poking around on google reveals that all but the most recent
Sprint phones don't support GPS at all.  They rely for location on AFLT,
advanced forward link trilateration.  That is, they look for multiple
towers, then report their delay readings to the network, allowing
triangulation.

More recent phones from Sprint must support real GPS, since Qualcomm
offers chipsets with GPS support, which they wouldn't do unless their
only customers (Sprint phone manufacturers) wanted it.
