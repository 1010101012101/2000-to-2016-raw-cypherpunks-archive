Unlikely, unless it's buried deep within files that Snowden took.
Remember, during his very first few interviews, he encouraged us to
continue to use encryption and made the statement "encryption works". He
also trusted RSA enough to use it to encrypt communications with
Greenwald and Poitris (sp?).

Very real possibility. Commercial tech is almost there. Assuming
government is 3-5 years ahead, they might well have that. But I really
don't see that as much of a threat.  It just saves analysts time.

Likely already being done. In fact, there seems to be some evidence that
this has happened in several instances.

Probably possible but not really feasible. Too difficult to filter even
using selectors. But I'm sure they're close. Still, there are ways to
communicate without generating useful metadata so it might not matter.

I'd say this is nearly guaranteed. In fact, I suspect this is why
Congress has been so slow to do anything about it. The NSA has them by
the balls. If you were running a large, illegal, operation, wouldn't you
first gather as much dirt on the people who could shut it down as possible?

Good point. You know what I'd like to see? I'd like to see code. I'd
like someone to drop the code to one of these massive systems online for
us to analyze. But I suppose documents and program details would be just
as useful.
