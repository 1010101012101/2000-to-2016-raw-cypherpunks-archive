I don't see how not saying anything to an inquiry violates the terms of the 
warrant.  Before the inquiry there is no warrant.  So how can you violate 
an order which had not been given and you could not know ever would be given?

It does not matter what the warrant says unless it says you must give false 
information regarding an inquiry. I have not ever heard of a court ordering 
a person to lie.  Have you?
