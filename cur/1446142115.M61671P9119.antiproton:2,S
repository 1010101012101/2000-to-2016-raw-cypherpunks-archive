I'm not sure what the point is. Could you clarify?

My method is selective. Money models reality. I'm just trying to make it
model better. Model complexity has a cost too, but generally more accurate
is better.

I think society as a whole should, where appropriate, set up a mechanism as
I described above. What's the TrueCost of a building being painted white
instead of black? Does white distract, manipulate, affect? Does black? What
about indoor lights turning bluer after lunch? (companies actually do the
latter for improving employee performance)

If you see value in finding out, go for it. But please don't try to charge
me for it. That's just wrong.
