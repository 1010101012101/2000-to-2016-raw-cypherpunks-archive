Companies Are Putting Sensors On Employees To Track Their Every Move

   [101]Vivian Giang | Mar. 14, 2013, 6:23 PM | 16,986 | [102]56

   team work group

   The  idea  of  having employees walk around with electronic sensors to
   track  their  every  move  is  unsettling. There are privacy and legal
   issues, and who wants to feel like they are just a cog in a system?

   But  [112]data  companies  say that the resulting reams of information
   will improve life for companies and employees.

   [113]Sociometric  Solutions has created tracking devices for [114]Bank
   of  America,  Steelcase,  and  Cubist  Pharmaceuticals Inc., and is in
   talks  with  General Motors. It was started by a team of Ph.D students
   from  MIT who decided to study the chemistry behind what makes certain
   workspaces like [115]Google great at building teams. They came up with
   sensors placed in employee identification badges that gather real-time
   information  to  help  companies  measure  productivity.  The  sensors
   identify  a  person's  tone  of voice, movement and even their posture
   when communicating with others.

   "Google  really  cares  about  creating a community because the social
   conversations  --  the ones at the water cooler, coffee maker -- those
   are  the ones that have the biggest impact," says Ben Waber, president
   of  Sociometrics  and  one  of  the  company's founders. "In the U.S.,
   there's  this  notion  that  your  most productive time is when you're
   sitting  at  your  desk  staring  at  the  computer,"  and  that's not
   necessarily true.

   The  sensors  are intended to measure when and how employees are truly
   productive. While individual information is collected, it's anonymized
   to   provide   metadata   and  hedge  against  privacy  concerns.  The
   information  is then used to suggest how employees, and the company as
   a whole, can work more efficiently.

   "The legality behind this," says Arena, "that's the biggest unanswered
   question.  Privacy online is sort of open and privacy issues are going
   to  be  the  stumbling  block  for  a long time. And that's a big, big
   question."

   The tracking sensors

   Waber's  team  places  electronic  sensors in employees' badges, which
   includes a Bluetooth, a microphone (it doesn't record what people say,
   but  rather  the  tone  of their voice, speaking speed, and volume), a
   motion sensor to measure movement, and an infrared beam.

   tracking device sensor

   Sociometric Solutions

   A sociometric sensor device.
   The idea is that these analytic tools can help determine the nature of
   the  conversations  people are having. For example, the microphone can
   measure  speaking  tone,  and  the higher someone's tone or the faster
   they  speak  can  indicate  how  excited or passionate they are at any
   given time.

   The  infrared can also sense if another badge is in sight, which gives
   researchers  an  idea of how people stand when speaking to others. For
   example,  people who usually have others facing them when speaking are
   more  dominant  personalities.  On the other hand, when two people are
   engaged  in  an  interesting conversation, they will likely mirror one
   another, which signals more equality.

   "We've  been  able  to  foretell,  for example, which teams will win a
   business plan contest, solely on the basis of data collected from team
   members wearing badges at a cocktail reception," [116]Alex Pentland, a
   professor  at MIT and also an advisor to Waber's group, wrote [117]for
   the Harvard Business Review. 

   Since   privacy  is  the  biggest  concern  over  the  devices,  after
   behavioral/productivity   reports   are  sent  to  individuals,  their
   identities  are  removed  from the system so the names associated with
   individual sensors are never revealed to employers.

   The testing grounds

   Bank  of America got on board with the sensors a few years ago when it
   wanted  to  study  how  group dynamics impacted performance. It tested
   them  out  on  90  call  center employees. Arena says that the company
   discovered  how  important  it  was  to allow employees to take breaks
   together.  During  that time, employees would often troubleshoot their
   workplace  problems.  While  sensors didn't monitor conversation, they
   did  report  "a  cohesiveness  was shared between the coworkers," says
   Arena, and the company eventually experienced a 10 percent improvement
   in  productivity  by  making  some workplace culture changes after the
   study.

   Although  Bank of America tested its call center employees, Arena said
   he thinks the data "has bigger ramifications in professional jobs than
   anywhere else," because you will inevitably be able to "understand how
   one person steps into the room and influences others."

   "It  has  greater ramifications in leadership than hourly workers, but
   it's  in  the early stages." Arena is now the head of global talent at
   General  Motors,  and  told  us the company is considering "doing very
   similar things."

   [118]Steelcase,  which  makes office furniture, works with Sociometric
   to  develop sensory products for its own merchandise. For example, its
   [119]new   chair,   Gesture,  is  "[120]designed  to [121]support  our
   interactions  with  today's  technologies"  and  was  "inspired by the
   movement of the human body." The new chair can actually tell employers
   how  it's  being used by employees, which will give employers a better
   idea  of what size tables and chairs to buy in order to promote better
   communication and, inevitably, a more productive team.

   "What  we hoped to learn was how things influence interactions and how
   spaces affect those interactions," Dave Lathrop, director of workspace
   futures and strategy at the company, told us.

   Lathrop  says  most  of us don't know how we interact with others. For
   example,  if  you have a dominating personality, you could be "forcing
   people  to  shut down" and make them distrust you without even knowing
   it.

   "[122]Yahoo  and  [123]Best  Buy are asking people to come back to the
   office,  which  does  suggest  that there's a general belief that when
   people  get  physically  together,  it's valuable," he says. "We're at
   this  magical moment where we can do things that we couldn't do before
   ...  having  the  analytics  that  we  do.  ...  As  a researcher, I'm
   incredibly  hopeful that this will give us good data on the quality of
   interactions between people."

   But at the end of the day, employees need to feel comfortable with the
   idea of being tracked, even if it's anonymously -- and that may take a
   while.
