More bad guys will be listening tomorow, because SDR and Moore's law
will drive down the cost.  At some point, we'll hit a knee in the
curve, and cell phones will be either made more secure, or we'll live
with the fact that all our calls are being listened to, much like the
Brits are always on video.
