I expect that "eventually" in this context would == (hours to [one or two]
days)

Even DC can't bail out *all* the airlines.  That kind of boycott *would*
hurt, and hurt badly.  And *fast*.

First of all, this is a *great* example of why flying is an *option*, and
not a "requirement".  That said, option number 4 is the obvious choice -
however, our leggy bimbo's mileage may vary.

The people of this country have long lost their voice for anything but
whining about how bad things are.  Since collectively, our economic voice
is our loudest voice, it is the one that should be used for the effecting
of immediate and comprehensive change.  The various non-arguments against
this all amount to the same thing: "we want change, but we don't want to
have to do anything that might also have any kind of unpleasantness
associated with it".  Fuck that shit.  Either you believe that this shit
is wrong, and you are willing to put your money where your mouth is, or
you can STFU when the nice TSA lady jams her fist up your ass looking for
a reason to show you who's really in charge here.

 Civilization is in a tailspin - everything is backwards, everything is
upside down- doctors destroy health, psychiatrists destroy minds, lawyers
destroy justice, the major media destroy information, governments destroy
freedom and religions destroy spirituality - yet it is claimed to be
healthy, just, informed, free and spiritual. We live in a social system
whose community, wealth, love and life is derived from alienation,
poverty, self-hate and medical murder - yet we tell ourselves that it is
biologically and ecologically sustainable.

The Bush plan to screen whole US population for mental illness clearly
indicates that mental illness starts at the top.
