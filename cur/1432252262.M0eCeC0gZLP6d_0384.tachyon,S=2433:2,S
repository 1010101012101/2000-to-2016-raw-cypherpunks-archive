Wrong.  The origin quote is "Who is Socrates, now that we need him"
written by Richard Mitchell as the title of chapter one in "The Gift of
Fire".  Mitchell may have cribbed the line from another source, but in
this context it is the origin quote.  Ms. Harsh is in posession of the
original physical vector, having stolen it, but only the spooks will be
unofficially aware of that facet of the context.

Any non-spook readers (if any) can identify the copycats as spooks by
virtue of their use of mutations from the original.  The source is rare
enough that it is highly unlikely that anyone outside of English academia
would happen to bring it up of his own accord in 'casual' conversation. 
Google is, indeed, your friend in this matter.

I doubt it.  May has his gun collection for company.
