	That's the thing. So maybe 'subvert' wasn't the best choice of
	word here, but the idea is that if you take into account
	anglo-american surveillance, then tor doesn't perform as
	advertised. 

	Using passive analysis they can undermine the tor
	network without actually 'subverting' a single coma in the code.

	(plus, they prolly can make analysis more efficient by
	tampering with traffic, again without touching the code)

	That really depends on the nature of the backdoor. It's
	certainly risky to backdoor something, but it's less risky if
	the people who create the backdoor (say the nsa) are the same
	and only people who have the resources to access it. And the
	'backdoor' may be simply a less-than-ideal system...like tor.

	But faster relays are used more frequently no?

	Anyway, my point was that as far as publishing documents go
	freenet looks like a a better and more serious design than tor.
