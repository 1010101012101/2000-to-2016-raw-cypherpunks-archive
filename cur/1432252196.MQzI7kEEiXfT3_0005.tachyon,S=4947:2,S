Margulis is always worth reading. "Symbiosis and the cell evolution" was
a huge eyeopener for me when I read it about 3 years ago - not so much
for the symbiotic origin of Eukaryotes (which is pretty much orthodoxy
these days & was taught to me as the standard idea back in the 1970s) as
for all the biogeochemical implications. "Five Kingdoms" is a fun
overview of LAWKI - a good read.

My daughter sometimes! She's 11 now - but bumped into them a year or so
ago. A few days after that I found her installing a telnet server on our
W98 machine...

I can easily imagine that - somewhere between Jane Jacobs and Paolo
Soleri and Bill Mollison.

Why not both? See  "Life and Death of the Great American Cities",
"Arcologies" and "Permaculture" by the authors mentioned above (Of
course nearly all contributors to Cypherpunks would find Soleri &
Mollison to be evil wimpish leftites - but they ought to like Jacobs).

Remember, if we manage to get ourselves an indefinite lifespan (as
opposed to a mildly stretched one) then old people won't be *old* any
more.

That more or less happens these days - there is a sort of lost
generation born between the late 1950s & about 1970 who  managed to be
the first age cohort in 200 years who were poorer than their parents, at
least in Britain (where else did punk rock come from?)
