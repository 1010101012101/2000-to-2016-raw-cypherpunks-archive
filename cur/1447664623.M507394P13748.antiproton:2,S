Baby's got an atom bomb
A motherfcuking atom bomb
Twenty two megaton
You've never seen so much fun

Baby got a poison gas
Baby got a heart attacks
Baby got a pain on tap
Baby gimme some of that

Baby got a Nobel prize
Given for the perfect crime
Baby got an alibi
Baby got eight more lives

Baby got a satellite
Baby got second sight
Baby got a masterplan
A foolproof master plan

Baby got purple hair
Baby got a secret lair
Baby got an army there
I ain't ever seen baby scared

Baby got a crystal ball
Baby doesn't care at all
Baby's having too much fun
Baby got an atom bomb

Baby got a fleet at sea
And a submarine called Emergency
She got a motorcade
She got a monorail
Going coast to coast on a campaign trail
Playing deck of cards in an armored car
She got a kung-fu star as a bodyguard
She got a juju charm
She got a magic spell
She got a genie all three is working well
She got a TV show
She got a shopping mall
She got a miracle, she doesn't want at all
She got a monument at a great expense
She got a head of state and a president
She got destiny, she got supremacy
She got everything from A - Z
She got it all down tight, she got nothing wrong
She got the whole wide world singing baby's song
