NEWS EMBARGO AFTER ISRAELI LINK LEAK

Stern-Intel (Canada). A US military intelligence source revealed
details of an internal intelligence memo that points to the
Israeli Mossad intelligence service having links to the World
Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. The intelligence source, who
requested his name be withheld, confirmed the internal US
intelligence memo circulated four weeks ago described information
that pointed to the threat of a covert Israeli operation on US
soil to turn mass public opinion against Palestinian Arabs via an
apparent terrorist attack on US interests that would give Israel
the green light to implement a large scale military onslaught
against the Palestinian Arab population.

The 11 September attack has been described by experts as being too
sophisticated for a lone terrorist group to execute. This attack
required a high level of military precision and the resources of
an advanced intelligence agency. In addition, the attackers would
have needed to be extremely familiar with both air force one
flight operations, civil airline flight paths and aerial assault
tactics on sensitive US cities like Washington, Stated David Stern
an expert on Israeli intelligence operations.

The attacks targeted the Pentagon, World Trade Center towers, with
the white house and air force also being targets according to the
FBI.

The attacks have certainly turned US public opinion firmly back
in Israel's favor after 11 months of Palestinian uprising, heavy
criticism of Israel

over war crimes allegations and racism by a UN conference in
Durban. The attacks serve no Arab group or nations interests but
their timing came in the midst of international condemnation of
Israel for its policy of death squad assassination of Palestinian
political and police figures, added Stern.

If verified, the news of Israels involvement in the US attack
will come as no surprise to intelligence experts. The state of
Israel has a long history of covert operations against Western
targets with attacks on the King David Hotel, USS Liberty, murder
of a Scandinavian UN envoy as well as espionage against the US
during the Jonathan Pollard case.

On Wednesday the US defense department issued a warning to its
officials to halt the leak of information on the investigation
which it says is happening on a daily basis since the attacks
occurred.
