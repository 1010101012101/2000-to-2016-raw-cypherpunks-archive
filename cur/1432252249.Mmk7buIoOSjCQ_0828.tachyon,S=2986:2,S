Oh, I assumed that this verification 'layer' was disjoint from the e$ layer. 
In other words, you might have a 3rd party e$ issuer, but after that they 
shouldn't be necessary....or, there's a different 3rd party for the 
verification process.

I think that's reasonable, but of course one could argue "what's the point 
if you already need a 3rd party for the e$". But I think that's a disjoint 
set of issues.
