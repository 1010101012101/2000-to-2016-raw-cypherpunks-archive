     Consumerization and Corporate IT Security



If you're a typical wired American, you've got a bunch of tech tools you 
like and a bunch more you covet. You have a cell phone that can easily 
text. You've got a laptop configured just the way you want it. Maybe you 
have a Kindle for reading, or an iPad. And when the next new thing comes 
along, some of you will line up on the first day it's available.

So why can't work keep up? Why are you forced to use an unfamiliar, and 
sometimes outdated, operating system? Why do you need a second laptop, 
maybe an older and clunkier one? Why do you need a second cell phone 
with a new interface, or a BlackBerry, when your phone already does 
e-mail? Or a second BlackBerry tied to corporate e-mail? Why can't you 
use the cool stuff you already have?

More and more companies are letting you. They're giving you an allowance 
and allowing you to buy whatever laptop you want, and to connect into 
the corporate network with whatever device you choose. They're allowing 
you to use whatever cell phone you have, whatever portable e-mail device 
you have, whatever you personally need to get your job done. And the 
security office is freaking.

You can't blame them, really. Security is hard enough when you have 
control of the hardware, operating system and software. Lose control of 
any of those things, and the difficulty goes through the roof. How do 
you ensure that the employee devices are secure, and have up-to-date 
security patches? How do you control what goes on them? How do you deal 
with the tech support issues when they fail? How do you even begin to 
manage this logistical nightmare? Better to dig your heels in and say "no."

But security is on the losing end of this argument, and the sooner it 
realizes that, the better.

The meta-trend here is consumerization: cool technologies show up for 
the consumer market before they're available to the business market. 
Every corporation is under pressure from its employees to allow them to 
use these new technologies at work, and that pressure is only getting 
stronger. Younger employees simply aren't going to stand for using last 
year's stuff, and they're not going to carry around a second laptop. 
They're either going to figure out ways around the corporate security 
rules, or they're going to take another job with a more trendy company. 
Either way, senior management is going to tell security to get out of 
the way. It might even be the CEO, who wants to get to the company's 
databases from his brand new iPad, driving the change. Either way, it's 
going to be harder and harder to say no.

At the same time, cloud computing makes this easier. More and more, 
employee computing devices are nothing more than dumb terminals with a 
browser interface. When corporate e-mail is all webmail, corporate 
documents are all on GoogleDocs, and when all the specialized 
applications have a web interface, it's easier to allow employees to use 
any up-to-date browser. It's what companies are already doing with their 
partners, suppliers, and customers.

Also on the plus side, technology companies have woken up to this trend 
and -- from Microsoft and Cisco on down to the startups -- are trying to 
offer security solutions. Like everything else, it's a mixed bag: some 
of them will work and some of them won't, most of them will need careful 
configuration to work well, and few of them will get it right. The 
result is that we'll muddle through, as usual.

Security is always a tradeoff, and security decisions are often made for 
non-security reasons. In this case, the right decision is to sacrifice 
security for convenience and flexibility. Corporations want their 
employees to be able to work from anywhere, and they're going to have 
loosened control over the tools they allow in order to get it.

Since a fatal crash a few years ago, Boston T (their subway) operators 
have been forbidden from using -- or even having -- cell phones while on 
the job.  Passengers are encouraged to report violators.  But sometimes 
T operators need to use their official radios on the job, and passengers 
can't tell the difference.  The solution: mark their official radios 
with orange tape.  Of course, no T operator would ever think of putting 
bright orange tape on his cell phone.  Because if he did that, the 
passengers would immediately know not to report him.

     More Skein News



Skein is my new hash function.   Well, "my" is an overstatement; I'm one 
of the eight designers.  It was submitted to NIST for their SHA-3 
competition, and one of the 14 algorithms selected to advance to the 
second round.

Last week was the Second SHA-3 Candidate Conference.  Lots of people 
presented papers on the candidates: cryptanalysis papers, implementation 
papers, performance comparisons, etc.  There were two cryptanalysis 
papers on Skein.  The first was by Kerry McKay and Poorvi L. Vora. They 
tried to extend linear cryptanalysis to groups of bits to attack 
Threefish (the block cipher inside Skein). It was a nice analysis, but 
it didn't get very far at all.

The second was a fantastic piece of cryptanalysis by Dmitry 
Khovratovich, Ivica Nikolie, and Christian Rechberger.  They used a 
rotational rebound attack to mount a "known-key distinguisher attack" on 
57 out of 72 Threefish rounds faster than brute force.  It's a new type 
of attack -- some go so far as to call it an "observation" -- and the 
community is still trying to figure out what it means.  It only works if 
the attacker can manipulate both the plaintexts and the keys in a 
structured way.  Against 57-round Threefish, it requires 2**503 work -- 
barely better than brute force.  And it only distinguishes reduced-round 
Threefish from a random permutation; it doesn't actually recover any key 
bits.

Even with the attack, Threefish has a good security margin.  Also, the 
attack doesn't affect Skein.  But changing one constant in the 
algorithm's key schedule makes the attack impossible.  NIST has said 
they're allowing second-round tweaks, so we're going to make the change. 
 It won't affect any performance numbers or obviate any other 
cryptanalytic results -- but the best attack would be 33 out of 72 rounds.

The second-round algorithms are: BLAKE, Blue Midnight Wish, CubeHash, 
ECHO, Fugue, Grostl, Hamsi, JH, Keccak, Luffa, Shabal, SHAvite-3, SIMD, 
and Skein.  You can find details on all of them, as well as the current 
state of their cryptanalysis, at the SHA-2 Zoo site.  NIST will select 
approximately five algorithms to go on to the third round by the end of 
the year.

In other news, we're once again making Skein polo shirts available to 
the public.  Those of you who attended either of the two SHA-3 
conferences might have noticed the stylish black Skein polo shirts worn 
by the Skein team.  Anyone who wants one is welcome to buy it, at cost. 
 All orders must be received before October 1, and we'll have all the 
shirts made in one batch.

     Wanted: Skein Hardware Help



As part of NIST's SHA-3 selection process, people have been implementing 
the candidate hash functions on a variety of hardware and software 
platforms.  Our team has implemented Skein in Intel's 32 nm ASIC 
process, and got some impressive performance results. Several other 
groups have implemented Skein in FPGA and ASIC, and have seen 
significantly poorer performance.  We need help understanding why.

For example, a group led by Brian Baldwin at the Claude Shannon 
Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Coding and Cryptography implemented 
all the second-round candidates in FPGA.  Skein performance was 
terrible, but when they checked their code, they found an error.  Their 
corrected performance comparison has Skein performing much better and in 
the top ten.

We suspect that the adders in all the designs may not be properly 
optimized, although there may be other performance issues.  If we can at 
least identify (or possibly even fix) the slowdowns in the design, it 
would be very helpful, both for our understanding and for Skein's 
hardware profile. Even if we find that the designs are properly 
optimized, that would also be good to know.

A group at George Mason University led by Kris Gaj implemented all the 
second-round candidates in FPGA.  Skein had the worst performance of any 
of the implementations.  We're looking for someone who can help us 
understand the design, and determine if it can be improved.

Another group, led by Stefan Tillich at University of Bristol, 
implemented all the candidates in 180 nm custom ASIC. Here, Skein is one 
of the worst performers.  We're looking for someone who can help us 
understand what this group did.

Three other groups -- one led by Patrick Schaumont of Virginia Tech, 
another led by Shin'ichiro Matsuo at National Institute of Information 
and Communications Technology in Japan, and a third led by Luca Henzen 
at ETH Zurich -- implemented the SHA-3 candidates.  Again, we need help 
understanding how their Skein performance numbers are so different from 
ours.

We're looking for people with FPGA and ASIC skills to work with the 
Skein team.  We don't have money to pay anyone; co-authorship on a paper 
-- and an Erdos number of 4 -- is our primary reward. (Also, a Skein 
polo shirt.)  Please send me e-mail if you're interested.
