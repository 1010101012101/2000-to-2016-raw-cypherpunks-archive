#    Donald Parker, the superintendent of the Chappaqua school 
#    district, said school officials took the matter seriously.
#    
#    "It's just not appropriate to put information about other people 
#    on a Web site," he said. "We all realize that since Columbine, 
#    things have changed."
#    
#    Mr. Parker said that "appropriate disciplinary action" had been 
#    taken against the boys, but would not elaborate further. Several 
#    parents and students said the boys had been suspended for five 
#    days, and had not yet returned for classes.
#    
#    The Web page at which Manhattan private-school students voted 
#    for the most promiscuous girl or boy was created by someone who 
#    identified herself (or perhaps himself) as Nicole Blair, on a 
#    site owned by a University of Washington student and other people.
#    
#    Melissa Jackson, a deputy district attorney in Brooklyn who 
#    investigated complaints about the page, said it did not list 
#    telephone numbers and addresses, and identified many of the girls 
#    only by first name. Her office decided not to pursue the case.
