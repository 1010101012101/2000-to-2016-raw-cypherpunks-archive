Offline means offline with fraud-tracing in event of double spending,
so the efficiency refers to the computation and communication cost of
the withdraw and deposit protocols which do the normal ecash thing,
plus encode identity in the coin in the withdraw protocol in a way
which will be revealed in a double spent show protocol.

The protocols you list are online.  Not that this is a bad thing -- I
kind of prefer the online idea -- rather than the "and then you go to
jail" implications of fraud tracing in the offline protocols.  Plus
you have a risk of accidentally double spending if your computer
crashes or something.
