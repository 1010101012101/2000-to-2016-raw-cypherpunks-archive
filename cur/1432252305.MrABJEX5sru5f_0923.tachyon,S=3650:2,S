Lost on your typically smug Canadian analysis has been any objective 
analysis of markets for power. Do you know, for example, that 
California as a state is a _net exporter_ of power to the Northwest 
and especially to Western Canada at certain times of the year? In the 
fall and winter, in fact, when hydroelectric generation rates in BC 
and Washington are reduced.

In your kind of lingo, "British Columbia failed to build enough new plants."

Markets are not simple. Prices rise, prices fall. To claim that 
California is now the primary cause of your higher heating costs, 
boo-hoo, is childishly naive.

See above. Childishly naive.
