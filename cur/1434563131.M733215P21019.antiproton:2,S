Ah, I stand corrected. Anyway, I think this is BAD.

Yes, my government is not what I would put in power. But I don't have 
much influence (any, really) over who and what get's chosen around here. 
So, to assume that I have anything to do with it is stretching reality a 
bit. But you're welcome to shoot them a mail and tell them how you feel 
about all of it.

Or come and tell 'm in person. The U.S. is wonderful place, safe to 
travel. You make the appointment and I'll buy you a beer after you've 
had your disappointment.

So, it's not like I 'let' them. I am  not the one they ask how I feel 
when the CIA decided they want to torture or murder Harry, Mo or Barry 
for information. They don't even bother telling me really. And to be 
honest I think they'd rather keep it a secret from me.

And remember that chart of US military bases that that other guy put up. 
Who is 'letting' them really, because even if it was me, and it isn't. 
It would be me and everyone else. Because there is such a thing as 
vested interests. And as the saying gos: Rome wasn't build in a day. But 
it sure as hell burned down in one.
