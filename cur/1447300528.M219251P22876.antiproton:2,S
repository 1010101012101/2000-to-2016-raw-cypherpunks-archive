You neglected to identify my response!

Anyway, CMU's attack did manage to compromise some onion services, most
notably SR2.[0] And I'm not impressed with the Tor Project's
performance. They apparently ignored the CMU attack for five months.
Maybe they got blindsided by a zero day vulnerability. Or maybe they
just weren't paying enough attention.

But the SR2 connection came up in a comment, and there's no mea culpa
for the delay, just blame on CMU. It's stuff like this that fuels
conspiracy theories about Tor and the US military.

Also, your comment about port 80 makes no sense in this context. The CMU
attack deanonymized onion services, not users. And port 80 with onion
services is secure. It's non-encrypted traffic through exit nodes that's
insecure. There's no exit node when using onion services.
