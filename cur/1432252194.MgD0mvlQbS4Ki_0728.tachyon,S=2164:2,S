You're a moron Tim. Everybody here probably gets the scammers messages, I get 
e-gold and paypal cons on regular basis-  E-gold never advertised itself as 
anything other than what it is, a bailee. What e-gold is really good is for is 
micropayments and I have personally found it good for making payments 
internationally.

I know the principals involved, and I've personally viewed one of their 
vaults and the gold, etc. is really there.
