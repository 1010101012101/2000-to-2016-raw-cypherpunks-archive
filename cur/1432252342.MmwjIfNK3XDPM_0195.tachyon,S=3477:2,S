Perhaps you are lucky enough to live in an area completely without
building codes, but I doubt it.  [Similarly, some are lucky enough to live in
areas with constitutional gun laws, too, but most don't.  Even if you live
freely now, you remain succeptible to zoning boards and state
legislatures.]  Fact is, there are in many places laws on what you can
build on your own land
and what you need to sell it as a house.  Some places even have
laws about the litres used when you flush ---you can't sell a house with
old toilets.  These are not voluntary
(e.g., CC&R) regs, nor are they anti-fraud provisions, they are laws
backed by guns which prohibit certain private actions.  Unconstitutional
taking.
