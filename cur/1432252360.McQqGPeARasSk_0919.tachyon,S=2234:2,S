NSA backdoor creates security hole in Windows
http://slashdot.org/articles/99/09/03/0940241.shtml

Microsoft NSA key Follow-Up
http://slashdot.org/articles/99/09/09/138209.shtml

incidently both of these went up back in september 1999

The second article has links to both microsoft's response and bruce
schneier's comments...

I don't claim to know who's right, but I do have to admit that 'NSAKEY'
would be a lousy thing to actually name a covert key ;)
but then, the fbi still call's it carnivore, so....
