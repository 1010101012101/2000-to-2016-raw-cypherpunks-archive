There are no restrictions whatsoever...except...

-- you can't give certain kinds of crypto to Bad People (Hizbollah, 
Bader-Meinhof, Kurds in Turkey (OK to give to Kurds in Iraq), and so 
on...consult the List of Bad People).

-- your program may be subject to a Secrecy Order, similar to the one 
that silenced the inventor of the PhasorPhone. If this happens you will 
not be able to disclose your invention to anyone and you may be unable 
to even reveal that you are under such a Secrecy Order.

Other than these possibilities, go for it, dude.
