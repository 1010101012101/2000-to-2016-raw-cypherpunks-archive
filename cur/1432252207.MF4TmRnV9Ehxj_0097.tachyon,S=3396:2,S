Duh. Yes, "arrests" are allowed, and have been in all states and in all 
territories since the beginning of things. The alternative to what you 
say is that all would remain free until their actual conviction and 
sentencing.

There are driver's licenses, for driving. And there are passports, for 
entering the U.S. (and other countries, but we don't care about that 
issue here). Those neither driving nor attempting to enter the U.S. 
need carry no such pieces of documentation. There is no "national ID," 
nor even "state ID."

Period.

Read up on the Lawson case in San Diego.
