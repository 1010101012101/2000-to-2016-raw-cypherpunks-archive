Your site isn't wired.com. Here's a reminder:

#    Hey, Declan... I just love waiting for doubleclick.net when
#    pulling up Politech pages. Word. Paid. Declan.

Your Politech was delayed from delivering pages
because it was stuck waiting for doubleclick.net.

Not the coolest thing.

Technically you're right. It was just slightly unnerving
to think you might have descended further down the road
of selling out to the click recording factories. The URL
was on their system. But you're right, no ad or WWW bugs.
