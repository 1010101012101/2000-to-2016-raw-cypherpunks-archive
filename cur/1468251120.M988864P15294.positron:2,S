Occupy Wall Steeet wasn't a focused protest it was a general
insurrection and it was fun but insurrections either disintegrate or
they are crushed. I'm talking about coordinated action on a single focus
with tens of thousands of people in the streets all across the US and
all sorts of side shows like continual sabotage of the system.... The
"Dave Graebers" and other 'vanguard' types were there to fuck everything
up too, but for the most part they has so little control over
organizations that what happened on the street was not what they
intended, but EVERYONE was FOCUSED ON THE WAR.

EVERYONE knew someone killed or maimed in Vietnam, or their GF's brother
was killed there. The US government was turning college students into
cannon fodder with the draft and if your grades didn't keep up with the
continually changing requirements of the selective service... changed to
suit their manpower needs, off you went and your organized religion
wasn't gonna help you either. They'd be glad to pray over your coffin
and call you a hero though.

This is why AUTOMATED WARFARE. It IS most likely the PRIMARY REASON for i=
t

Americans don't like to see the remains of their loved ones come home in
a sack on a C-5a Globemaster and it undermines the Pentagon's ability to
make war.

Want to change things? Anything. It take two traits utterly lacking in
American society at the moment.

Rage and Focus. Richard Nixon may have sat in to Oval Orifice during the
post-Cambodia invasion moratorium as the WH was surrounded by tens of
thousands of people with a pitched street battle between protestors and
swarms of cop on Pennsylvania Avenue.

But he 'blinked', and the US began negotiating... Carpet bombing VIetnam
at the same time with HUGE protests about that too, but within a few
years it was "Helicopters from the embassy roof".
