BAHHHHHHHHHHH....LOL.... God, that's the funniest thing I've ever 
read.  BY DEFINITION, care is cheaper that coverage in the average 
case.  You've already told us how the insurance companies have 
managed to aquire billions in profits.  Where do you think they got 
them?  They looked at the numbers and realized that for a 
sufficiently large group of people the cost of paying that groups 
medical bills will be less than the amount that groups members will 
be willing to pay on a monthly basis to own a safety net.
