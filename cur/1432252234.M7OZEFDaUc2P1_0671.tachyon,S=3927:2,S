E-protection necessary for nation's security: Kalam

 [Business India]: Chennai, Dec 21 : India was moving into an "era of
e-business, e-marketing, e-commerce and e-banking" and encryption
technology to protect network communication was the only way to ensure the
nation's security, said President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

The president was addressing scientists here Monday evening at the 5th
International Conference on Cryptology in India via videoconferencing.

Reminding his audience that Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujam's work
was being applied in communication networks today, Kalam said:
"Cryptography is a wealth generator and wealth protector."

Noting that India was the only country in the world with a huge linguistic
diversity and more than 3,000 languages, he asked: "Can we make use of this
diversity to our advantage by using different languages as a cryptographic
tool?"

Addressing several hundred delegates from all over the world, who had
gathered here for the three day conference that began Monday, Kalam said:
"Nations that are capable of generating and managing information in a
secure way will become world leaders and economic superpowers"

He called for state-of-the-art technology at competitive costs in India, to
secure Indian e-systems.

Inaugurating the conference, hosted by the Institute of Mathematical
Sciences and the Society for Electronic Transactions (SETS), principal
scientific advisor to the central government R. Chidambaram said the
science of encryption was the "only know-how" technologists had to protect
e-systems.

Information flows over open networks. And to secure this information is "of
social, political, commercial and strategic" importance, Chidambaram said.

He asked Indian scientists for research inputs into standardisation
processes, called 'advanced encryption standard' it could develop quickly
in India.

Experts from various countries, including France, South Korea, Australia,
Belgium and Germany are attending the meet.

During the conference, 147 scientific papers on the art and science of
encryption will be presented.

Cryptology is the science of hiding information through codes. Mathematical
systems provide some of the best encryptions the world has so far
generated. It is also the art of breaking down codes and getting at secrets.
