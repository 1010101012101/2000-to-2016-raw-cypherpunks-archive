Copied from a friend, generally reliable.  NOTAMs are eventually posted
to a few publicly available sites:

    !FDC 1/1763 FDC PART 1 OF 6 TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS OVER
    NUCLEAR SITES. FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. EFFECTIVE
    IMMEDIATELY UNTIL NOVEMBER 07, 2001 0500 UTC. PURSUANT TO TITLE 14
    CFR SECTIONS 91.139, EMERGENCY AIR TRAFFIC RULES AND 99.7 SPECIAL
    SECURITY INSTRUCTIONS. ALL GENERAL AVIATION FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE
    PROHIBITED WITHIN A 10 NAUTICAL MILES RADIUS OF AND BELOW 18000 FEET
    MSL OVER THE BELOW LISTED NUCLEAR SITES EXCEPT FOR MEDEVAC, LAW
    ENFORCEMENT, RESCUE/RECOVERY, EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND FIRE FIGHTING
    OPERATIONS WHEN AUTHORIZED BY ATC:

He continues:

    I've got no idea what the hell they're doing, but damn, a GA plane
    wouldn't do more than scratch the friggen concrete on a nuke plant.

    (It was wondered what a plane crash would do, so a F-4 Phantom II
    was rammed into a containment wall at 600+ MPH, it penetrated 2.5
    inches. (Its a 6 foot wall).

    Grrrr. Insane restrictions. Bullyboys in uniforms pushing around,
    people held illegally.

Sounds like the feds are treating the current "credible threat" as broad
and shutting down all options.  Anyone care to posit a scenario in which
GA could threaten a nuke?

Peace.
