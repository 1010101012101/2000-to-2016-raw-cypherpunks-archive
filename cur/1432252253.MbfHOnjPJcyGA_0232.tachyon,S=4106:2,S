But, sometimes a frog jumps out.  What happens then?  Do the JBTs then point
their guns at the frog saying, "Right, you!  Back in the pot!  Boiling
water is good for you."

I'll invoke the WTO protests and the resulting LEA response as a good example
of how far such unhappiness leads to change.  Now that the army has their
Instant Microwaved Student Ray 'o Death Cannon, demonstrations of that kind
may soon be history.  As for other forms of `protest' such as has been done by
the likes of the Unibomber or McVeigh, the state capitalises on the hysteria
and expands, as per incrementalism.

What, then, is left for the starry-eyed idealist to do?

Write code, says the Cypherpunk screed.
