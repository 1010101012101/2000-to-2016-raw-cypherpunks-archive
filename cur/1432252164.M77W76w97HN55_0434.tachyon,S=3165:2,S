The shit you post is less than spam which has minimal
content and is anonymous or forged and took slim
intelligence to prepare and lob. You send your stinky
asswipe, in your own shitty name, as if having wiped 
your asshole with an article means you need someone
to tell you what's it said. Your momma may have done
that for you, and may still do it, whispering your tiny
brainlessness is so sweet, baby, but it's time Jim 
for you to use the Net for more than a replacement
ofr the slit trench you came out of squawling and 
pissing.

Momma Choate, sober up, your mustardy bastard 
has grown into a mooning buffoon like his lickturd 
daddy. Poke him back uphole till he's fully developed
and housebreakable. Best, back to the future: sneak 
into a clinic and trash the shit machine, coathanger
its solid noggin.
