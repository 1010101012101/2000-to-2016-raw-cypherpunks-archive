He'll probably claim to have never read I Robot.

A God complex. Way Cool. I'll bet his father was Einstein, his mother
Marie Curie. Why do I feel the name Walter Mitty should be somewhere in
this picture too. Wait, here come the men in the ice cream suits!

ROTFLMAO. This sure was a nice little break from CPU guts.
