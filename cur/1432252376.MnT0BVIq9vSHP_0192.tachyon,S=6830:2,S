Librarians Running Into Trouble Monitoring Net Use 

The Associated Press
B E R K L E Y, Mich., Nov. 6 Q Librarians trained in opening doors to knowledge must find ways to slam some of those doors shut, agitating many who donUt appreciate laws requiring them to censor Internet use.
JJJJ RLibrarians are in the business of giving people information, not preventing them from getting it,S said Carol Windorf, Royal OakUs library director. RItUs an uncomfortable position and it makes it tougher for us to do our job.S
JJJJ A state law approved last spring requires public libraries that offer Internet access to keep children from inappropriate sites by installing filters, monitoring behavior or requiring parents to be present.

Not Alone 
Minnesota, Arizona, Utah and Colorado have laws similar to MichiganUs and at least 19 other states are considering legislative action. More than 75 libraries nationwide placed filters on computers last year, bringing the total to about 1,000.
JJJJ The American Library Association has raised First Amendment concerns with the laws. But most of MichiganUs libraries are complying, with filters on at least some of their computers, said Stephen Kershner, executive director of the Michigan Library Association.
JJJJ Some librarians have decided not to use filters Q calling the software unreliable and an inconvenience to everyone.
JJJJ RThe filters can block computer users from obtaining completely acceptable information theyUre looking for on the Internet,S Oxford Library Director Judith Doublestein told The Detroit News for a Sunday story.
JJJJ Doublestein said some computer users were denied football statistics from Super Bowl XXX because a filter confused the Roman numerals with a triple-X-rated pornographic Web site.
JJJJ Moreover, Doublestein said, children are so adept at computer use that they can often easily get around the filters to look at questionable sites.

Surrogate Parents? 
The American Library Association said it sees little merit in filters and believes libraries are more comfortable forming their own Internet policies. Some librarians said the law forces them to act as parents.
JJJJ RIdeally, each person should be able to search the Internet on their own,S Windorf said. RIn the case of children, we feel parents are the best guide.S
JJJJ In Berkley, where filters arenUt in use, itUs up to staff members and library visitors to decide what is objectionable.
JJJJ In Birmingham, which has only one filtered computer, a patron was arrested during the summer after he ignored repeated warnings and downloaded photos from pornographic sites.
JJJJ In Livonia, computers in the adult area donUt have filters and are equipped with privacy screens. Parents must accompany minors under 18 who wish to use them. Unaccompanied children must use computers with filters near the childrenUs area.
JJJJ RI guess the filters are getting better, but we had a case where a patron was unable to research RMars ExplorerS because the TsU in Mars and the TexU in explorer triggered to the word sex,S said Livonia Library Director Barbara Lewis. 

Tips for the Home 
Some tips for parents and children on Internet use:
JJJJ  DonUt give out personal information such as addresses, phone numbers or school names and location without parental permission.
JJJJ  Tell parents right away about any information or message that causes discomfort.
JJJJ  Never agree to get together with an online contact without checking with parents.
JJJJ  Never send a personal photo to a person without parental knowledge.
JJJJ  Decide with parents on the length of time that can be spent online and appropriate sites to visit.
JJJJ  Install software filters on home computers to block inappropriate sites, although they canUt bar access to everything parents might not want children to see and may block information that is helpful.
JJJJ  Place computers in the kitchen, family room, or living room so an adult can see the child using it.
JJJJ  DonUt let young children surf the Web alone.
