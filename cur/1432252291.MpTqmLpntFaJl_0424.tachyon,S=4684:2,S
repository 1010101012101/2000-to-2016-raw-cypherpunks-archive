Which is an irrelevant point for both of your positions. The conflict is
one of fundamental belief and past actions. It crosses national
boundaries. To say (as James is implying) that Pakistani's don't talk to
both Afghani's and say Syria is simply irresponsible, as well as wrong.

He did, he fought during the Russian invasion (I've sent a URL to a
reference seperately). It's almost certain he at some point used US
supplied arms.

No, he just uses a different incompatible definition than you. For example
one of his complaints is that he is not given the freedom to move the
godless (eg US forces) out of the holy lands of Syria (eg Mecca and
Medina).

One solution, only send Muslim US service men. You got any idea how much
good will something like that would buy?...Priceless
