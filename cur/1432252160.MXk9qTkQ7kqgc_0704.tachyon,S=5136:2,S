Well, we were talking about the dangers of companies vs. danger of governments.

Before a girl turns into a prostitute, with the exception of countries like Haiti and Democratic Republic of Congo, she can try and do other things rather than sell her body. Even in the third world, there's plenty of shopping centers, laundry and cleaning works they can try.

It pays less, but it also doesn't violate anyone's bodies. Most prostitutes had a choice at least once.
