Yiqun L Yin writes 21 February 2005 about when the full SHA-1 
paper will appear:

  We have submitted the paper to a conference for peer review, 
  and we should receive a notification of the review results by early 
  May. We plan to publish the paper after incorporating the comments 
  from the review, and will let you know around that time.
