It may well be irresponsible for Tim to talk about his probable
responses to a situation when unidentified black ninjas invade his
home. The reason it is arguably irresponsible is that Tim is endangering
his safety. But he knows that.

Talking about alleged victimless crimes allegedly committed by list
members is irresponsible.* The reason it is arguably irresponsible is
that you are endangering someone else's safety. Big difference.

-Declan

* = As differentiated from victumful crimes. For instance, if someone
steals Sandy's car or Tim's motorcycle from a cypherpunks meeting, nobody
would raise eyebrows if they call the cops.
