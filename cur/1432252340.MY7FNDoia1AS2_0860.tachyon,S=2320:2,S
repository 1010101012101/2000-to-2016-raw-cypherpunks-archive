it's scary just how much mission-critical stuff runs on windows. i'll
confess right now to being a unix zealot, so the thought of anything
mission critical (beyond hotmail and freecell) on windows is scary.

i know of some fairly large installations running control systems for power
generation on windows. these same sites then give the vendors access to the
system via vpn across the internet. sure there are firewalls, but i don't
have faith in the long-term maintenance of the vendor sites.

the power lines are certainly low-hanging fruit...
