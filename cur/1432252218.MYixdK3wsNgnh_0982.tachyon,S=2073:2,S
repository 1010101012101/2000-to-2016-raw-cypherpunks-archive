Come visit SoCal some time.  I'll show you some roads built as
investments.
Many of them.  Sometimes, if they fail as investments ("hey, we're
losing money, lets
raise tolls"), the investors will sell to the govt ---the opposite of
your assertion.

But it shouldn't matter to a socialist like you: if I've driven on a
taxpayer
road, I'm therefore a slave to anyone's (or everyone's) 's need.  Anyone
who can convince a politicowhore to give them a slice, that is.
