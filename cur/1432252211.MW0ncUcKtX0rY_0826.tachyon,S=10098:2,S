    <P>&nbsp;Dear Investors, Traders, and Speculators:</P>

    <P><BR>
    <B>XENICENT INC.</B> <B>(OTCBB: XCNT) IS UNDER OUR RADAR THIS
    WEEK</B>. The Company, develops, invests in, and operates technology
    and land development related companies within the US, China,
    and Taiwan. XCNT's <B>immediate strategy</B> is to accelerate
    the success of its technology division by acquisitions and development.=
</P>

    <P><BR>
    <B>XCNT </B>recently announced the signing of a definitive agreement
    under which the Company will <B>acquire a 60% interest in Giantek</B>,
    a Taiwanese corporation for U.S. distribution of Giantek's LED
    Display Systems and additional Giantek proprietary technologies.
    &quot;By joining forces with Giantek, we will <B>accelerate our
    entry</B> <B>into attractive new technology markets</B>, and
    add critical breadth to our line of innovative products,&quot;
    Said CEO Duane Bennett of Xenicent. <U>As a result of this important
    acquisition, XCNT will receive exclusive rights to market Giantek's
    products within the United States</U>. Giantek reported over
    $2 million in revenues for 2001, has approximately $3 million
    in assets and currently employs a workforce of 30 employees.</TD>

    <P>&nbsp;<B>IN THE NEAR FUTURE</B>, management will announce
    its new strategy to capitalize on the growing technology sector
    exploding in Asia. Xenicent has assembled an outstanding team
    of management personnel, all with proven leadership and management
    skills in working with larger &quot;hyper-growth&quot; companies.
    The Company's strategy includes the <B>internal development and
    operation of subsidiaries</B> within the XCNT family, as well
    as investment in additional technology companies directly, and
    through other venture capital arrangements.</P>

    <P><BR>
    <B>THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ASPECT OF XCNT IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT
    PROVIDES </B>by the limited amount of shares within the public
    float now available for individual investors. It has been our
    experience, that as word gets around the street of new technologies
    being acquired by Xenicent Inc., limited shares, (presently under
    1M), <B>USUALLY </B><U>causes rapid price increase as increased
    buying occurs in these type of smallcap bulletin board companies</U>.=

    &nbsp;<B>IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, XCNT</B> at a present price

    market share by its current strategic objective of acquisition

    family of companies is expected to increase dramatically</B>&#133;hence
    greater revenues equals price appreciation.</TD>
