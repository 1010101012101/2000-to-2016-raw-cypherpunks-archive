(Oooh!  six hundred!  Impressive! :)

I don't see anything on their site about the technology, but I do
question if 4 colored buttons, with a probable pin length of 4-6, is
worth 10-70 pounds per year..For that price you can get securid cards,
which aren't nearly as pretty, but that's nothing Ideo couldn't fix in
a week.
