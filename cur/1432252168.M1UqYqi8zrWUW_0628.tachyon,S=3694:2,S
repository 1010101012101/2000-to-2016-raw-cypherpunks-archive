Well, I am a nobody (perhaps a new acronym, IAAN, ok, bad joke.) I'd
imagine that it would be something against whoever sends them the bomb
plans, rather than the list itself, feels kind of like them throwing a
fishing line into a huge pond and waiting for a bite, so to speak.

Well, if you send someone bomb plans and it is widely documented that
you are the source of the bomb making plans, then perhaps (I guess
wildly here.) you could be held liable in some way, kind of the like the
MacGyver reference someone made awhile back about that show's accuracy
in depicting different chemical mixtures and their affects and kids
doing stupid things. Also, they could have nothing to do with Cops(tm)
of Gangsta Nigaz(tm) and they could just be stupid kids...Let the flames
roll. --gabe
