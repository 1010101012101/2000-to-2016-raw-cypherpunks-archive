+1. And for those that don't believe shit can be hacked on policy level=
, look=20
at ACTA, or at censorship debates in Poland. For instance:

nsorship-debate-ever

The opsec, as you say, is "usual". As in, cpunks more or less know how =
to=20
handle it. The FUD and divide-and-conquer is a whole different ball gam=
e, and=20
that's a huge problem.

Absolutely. And to start doing that, we *REALLY* need to see that "The =
Man" is=20
not really a single entity, but a dynamic system of co-dependant people=
,=20
institutions, interests, etc. Once we stop seeing "Teh Gummint" as a si=
ngle=20
entity that Has A Plan, cracks start to show. And we all know what we c=
an do=20
with cracks, don't we?

As long as we allow ourselves to drink the Kool-Aid of how mighty and=20=

monolithic "The Man" is, we're fucked.
