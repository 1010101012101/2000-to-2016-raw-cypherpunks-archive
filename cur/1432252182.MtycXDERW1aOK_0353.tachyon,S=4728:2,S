Actually, in most places in UK, the railways precede the development of
the town. So the industry & cheap areas follow rail, rather than vice
versa.  

What you say is often true about new road building though. Everyone
wants big roads a couple of miles away - no-one wants them on their
doorstep. That's how Labour took over London in the 1970s - the old Tory
GLC committed political suicide by road-building.  Roads do not make
votes.

Of course, what /should/ happen is that the people who need the roads
pay the people whose towns they go through...
