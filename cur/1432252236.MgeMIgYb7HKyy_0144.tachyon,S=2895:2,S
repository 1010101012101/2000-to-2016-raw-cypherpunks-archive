Sampos original claim was that famine was caused by private enterprise and 
free markets.  My original counter claim (which you dishonestly altered in 
each post) was that all famines were caused by socialism or war.

You on two separate occaisions have edited my original claim to make it 
easier to rebut.  Each time I edited it back, and each time you deleted 
what I wrote to change the meaning.

The first time was just careless editing.

The second time was a lie.
