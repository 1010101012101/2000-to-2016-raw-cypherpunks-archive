I admire many negroes. Shelby Steele, who wrote "The Content of our 
Character," for example. And Thomas Sowell, an even more prolific 
author (and Stanford professor). And Niger Innes (son of the lefty Roy 
Innes...a lot of children of 60s liberal negroes are now libertarian or 
conservative, e.g., Adam Clayton Powell's son). And Clarence Thomas 
(who has argued forcefully that the Supremes ought to do a very 
thorough review of gun laws, with the hint that the right decision 
would be to restore the Second Amendment to first class status). And a 
bunch of others, including Ward Connerly, of California, who has been 
leading the effort to have "race" removed as the basis for _any_ 
government actions, including hiring quotas, special admissions 
requirements for negroes and Asians (at opposite ends of the test score 
spectrum), and so on.

I don't admire the politics of Condie Rice and Colin Powell, but there 
is little doubt that they are accomplished, bright people.

My problem is that negroes are 80% in solidarity on a bunch of 
disgusting, anti-liberty things: affirmative action, racial quotas, 
minority setasides (but not for successful minorities--they want limits 
on the number of Asians admitted to UC schools), welfare, increased 
benefits, etc.

Further, they, as a whole, have a "plantation mentality": always 
demanding that Massa in the Big White House give them more stuff. 
Instead of excelling and grabbing the stuff for themselves, as Chinese 
and Korean and Indian people have done in America, they think setasides 
and quotas and special favoritism is "owed" to them.

I used to not care much about what they did or thought. When I entered 
college in 1970 I expected to mix with a bunch of different sorts of 
people. What I found was that the negroes all sat at the same tables in 
the dining halls, that whites who sat near them were chased off, and 
that we non-blacks, including Asians, Indians, South Americans, whites, 
etc., could mix with each other, but not with the "Panthers."

And they ghettoized themselves into "Black Studies," which they had 
"demanded" a couple of years earlier and had just gotten in 1969.

In 1972 they formed various militant groups on campus. One obnoxious 
woman named Judy became the student association president. When she 
didn't like a decision, she ordered the Panthers, her enforcers, to bar 
the doors and not let anyone out until the decision was reversed. It 
was.

I am not exaggerating. I included this, and the theft of ASU funds, and 
the henchmen, and similar leftist actions by others (including the 
MeCHA "Aztlanos"), in a letter to the Regents of the University of 
California. It was published in the school newspaper, in a full-paged 
spread, and I got replies from the governor of the state, Ronald 
Reagan. I met with the Chancellor and he agreed that the situation at 
the campus was deplorable, but that in the interests of keeping the 
peace with the negroes and Mexicans, given the time (1973), there was 
little they could do. He promised that his office was looking into the 
allegations and already knew about most of them.

When I joined Intel in 1974, I saw plenty of Chinese, Indians, a 
handful of Koreans and Vietnamese (more later), but only one negro 
engineer. And he had a major chip on his shoulder. When he was let go 
in one of the RIFs, he claimed discrimination on the basis of his 
melanin levels.

Meanwhile, the excuses mounted all around about how "science is sexist 
and gynophobic," about how the ancient Egyptians were actually black 
Africans and had their advanced civilization (electricity, flying cars, 
etc.) stolen by the "ice people" and similar such malarkey. The 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, a racist hustler, tried to shake down Silicon 
Valley corporations for payoffs to his Rainbow scam. (Meanwhile, 
negroes avoided science, math, engineering, technology and preferred to 
focus their efforts on lawsuits to get standards lowered, via "race 
norming." The bullshit went on and on.)

I look at the 75% bastard rate (compared to about 25% for whites and 
about 5% for Asians in America), the black on white crime, the black on 
black crime, the crack hoes, the disrespect for learning....all this 
and I can draw only one conclusion" that though there are many fine, 
competent, bright negroes, on the whole it is a gutter race.

Harsh phrase, but true. A race that, in America in the last 40 years, 
has become a race of beggars, whiners, wheedlers, chiselers, whores, 
crack addicts, dropouts, and unwed mothers.

Charles Murray laid out a lot of the reasons in his book "Losing 
Ground." ("Dat be a racist book!," said his detractors.)

The seminal event was the arrival on the scene of the collectivist JFK. 
Kennedy ordered his bunch of eastern elitists to look into the "relief" 
system which had provided very limited and very temporary economic 
assistance to folks in bad situations. For those few here old enough (I 
am, just barely), this used to be called "general relief," and it was 
mostly administered at the county level, in the states that offered it. 
What Kennedy's brain trust found was that "relief" was seen as an 
embarrassment, as a negative thing, something to avoid getting on if at 
all possible and to get off of just as fast as one could. Which is as 
it should be, of course.

So Kennedy's liberals scratched their heads and came up with a new 
plan. "Relief" would be converted to a series of state and national 
programs, no longer handled locally. And the bad connotations of 
"relief" would be changed by the new and positive name "entitlement."

Money handed out to various folks would be their "entitlement," 
something they were _owed_. Other related names would be "social 
services" and, of course, liberal mention of "children" and 
"nutrition." Ergo programs like WIC ("Women, Infants, and Children"). 
Ergo, "Head Start." Oh, and meddling in foreign countries with things 
like the Peace Corps (which, the feministas are slowly coming to 
realize, did much to break "primitives" of things like breast-feeding, 
while giving the baby formula industry a new world market).

Kennedy got zapped for his many crimes, but the Good Ole Boy who took 
over turned out to be just as big a collectivist as Kennedy had been, 
and LBJ continued the Kennedy welfare/entitlements/handouts and called 
it "The Great Society." (I don't recall if Kennedy had formally named 
his progressive plan.)

And that year was the year that negroes got to vote in all 50 states, 
which of course was a good thing. The part of the Civil Rights Act that 
dealt with voting rights was good. The Constitution applies to all 
people.

However, most of the Civil Rights Act was terrible, for obvious 
reasons. Between it and new interpretations of the 14th Amendment 
(lawyers can quote the language), and some terrible Warren Court 
decisions (*), the effect was to interfere in the ability of people to 
choose who to do business with, who to rent to, who to associate with, 
all of the things which liberty means.

(* The Supreme Court took a case where a negro had been denied service 
at a diner in the south and used a weird series of logical steps to 
argue that if negroes couldn't buy food at this diner then napkin and 
ketchup and hot dog sales might be affected, and since some of that 
stuff came from other states, that would be interfering in interstate 
trade and only Congress can regulate that, blah blah, and so racial 
discrimination was outlawed under the fucking Commerce Clause of the 
Constitution! Of course, by the same logic, if Apple decides to change 
suppliers of disk drives, and this means Illinois gets the business 
instead of Idaho, this has also changed interstate trade. But logic was 
not the point of what the Court was doing...they were looking for any 
excuse to stop "discrimination.")

OK, what of discrimination itself? Good or bad?

Most of us probably agree that telling a black person he cannot shop in 
some bookstore, told by the bookstore owner that is, is not cool, to 
use a technical phrase. We might call it tacky, or unethical, or just 
plain dumb. (And if the government tried to say blacks could not enter 
a bookstore, this would be both interfering with the property rights of 
the bookstore owner AND violating the colorblind standards of the 
Constitution.)

But libertarians argue--and this was the natural system for 170 
years--that what a property owner does with his property is, assuming 
he is not violating real rights (*) of others, up to him to decide, 
whether his decisions are uncool, stupid, unwise, etc.

(* I mean real rights, as in property, personal safety, economic 
ownership, etc., not some "right to enter the stores I wish to enter." 
No more so than anyone has a "right" to be invited into someone's 
house, or into a club, etc.)

So, during just a couple of years of the Great Society, this confluence 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the new interpretations of the 14th 
Amendment, and Supreme Court decisions, the ability of people and 
corporations to choose whom they wished to deal with, or hire, or fire, 
ended. "Racial discrimination" became the new word to demonize anyone 
or any group. When civil libertarians like Barry Goldwater said this 
restriction on liberty was a bad direction to move in, he was dubbed a 
"racist."

I could write much more on this whole sorry episode. It's a sorry 
episode not because I have any desire to exclude negroes or women or 
cripples or queers or any other of the "protected groups" (added over 
the years), but because it erases the concept of liberty. If I can't 
rent to whom I choose, I have no control over my own belongings.

If I can be told I must hire a certain percentage of negroes (later 
dubbed "tokens'), this not only interferes with freedom of association 
(which applies to groups and corporations, obviously) but it also has a 
corrosive effect on those hired and how those around them think about 
them. ("Token blacks" in departments of companies are often thought of 
as having been hired to get the EEOC stooges off the company's back.)

I have the fundamental right, via ownership of my property and my 
freedom of association, to hire or fire based on merit, based on whim, 
based on astrology, whatever. It may not be wise, but it's my choice.

I have the fundamental right to have only Muslims in my company, or 
only Jews working in my bookstore, or to have only buxom women working 
at my strip club. (Recall the "discrimination" suits filed over such 
policies, including males claiming they were discriminated against, 
women in wheelchairs or with mastectomies claiming they have a "right" 
to be hired by a strip club that doesn't want them, and so on.)

The can of worms that was opened when liberty was cancelled is still 
with us, getting worse and worse. Feminista attorney sued a California 
gym for excluding women, and the courts ordered gyms to admit 
women....ah, but the same order did not ban women only gyms, and these 
are now common in California.

A church which refused to hire a Satanist was ordered to do so. (This 
was later rescinded...apparently even the courts can't deal with the 
Alice in Wonderland-like situation where discrimination is banned.)

This is what Shelby Steele, the black I referred to earlier, is saying 
in "The Content of our Character," that blacks should be judged on the 
content of their character, not the color of their skin. (He is quoting 
Martin Luther King, of course.) This does NOT mean that this maxim gets 
enforced by the government, and that discriminating on the basis of 
color should be illegal. He, and King (some think), is arguing that 
this is the "right" thing to do, but is not something government should 
be enforcing.

Note of course that most businessmen will not turn away customers. 
Things in the deep south were skewed by the War of Northern Aggression, 
and it took time for sentiments to change. But in many cases the 
apartheid in the south was managed and enforced by local _governments_, 
with the public restrooms being "White" and "Colored."

(As in South Africa, where companies like IBM wanted to hire blacks but 
were ordered not to by the RSA government.)

Anyway, I resent deeply being told I may not associate as I wish, may 
not rent or sell my property as I wish, must meet certain hiring quotas 
or face EEOC fines, must promote based on race not character or skills, 
and so on. I resent deeply the whole can of worms that involves 
"discrimination against gays" and "handicapped-friendly" policies, and 
the whole enforced "niceness" bullshit (which is not actually making 
people nicer...just the opposite, as when I had to deal with a token we 
had in our department and was ordered to not do anything that might 
cause him to file a discrimination lawsuit against us).
>

I see the success the Chinese and Indians and other Asians have had in 
America...none of it do to quotas, to forced hiring, to the nonsense 
the negroes keep pulling.

(I haven't talked much about Mexicans, by the way. Many Mexicans are 
perfectly fine...hard-working, friendly, etc. Often they are not very 
academically-oriented, so few are in engineering positions. And many 
are as bad as many of the negroes. Worse, the issue of "illegal 
aliens." As Tom McClintock pointed out so cogently in his debate with 
Schwarzenegger, et. al., the real issue is that these illegal aliens 
(perhaps as many as 10 million now) are CUTTING IN LINE, cutting in 
line ahead of those waiting patiently and legally to enter the U.S. 
from Russia, Romania, India, Thailand, etc.  And we gave the Mexican 
and Latin American illegals an "amnesty" in the mid-90s: 
Simpson-Mozzoli, a promised one time only deal. Ah, but the cynics, 
including me, were right: more aliens swarmed in, looking for another 
amnesty. As a pure libertarian I would have no problem with truly open 
borders, provided there were absolutely no taxpayer-funded programs or 
services, and provided the piles of rotting corpses were not used as an 
excuse to give "services." But open immigration is not going to happen. 
Meanwhile, giving these illegal aliens permanent residency status would 
be a fucking disaster. As with the Simpson-Mazzoli illegals, once 
amnestied they have a strong tendency to sign up for all of the 
"entitlements" JFK and LBH and RMN established. Which is why my local 
town has a hospital that is facing insolvency, as the swarms of 
Mexicans use the services mandated by law and collection is nearly 
impossible. And the State of California is facing insolvency, as you 
all know. Enough about Mexicans.)

So, to wrap this up, I see plenty of brown-skinned people from India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. doing very well without chanting about 
"racist discrimination" and demanding that some version of "Ebonics" be 
used to teach their children (just the opposite, they really WANT their 
children to be fluent and precise in standard English). And I see 
Chinese, Korean, and other Asian immigrants doing well, not bellyaching 
that the reason they're failing is because The Man is holding them 
down, that Massah has passing out enough freebies.

And the black libertarians and conservatives I cited earlier share this 
view. They don't put it quite as bluntly as I do, that the negro in 
America is becoming a gutter race, but they obviously think the trends 
of the past 40 years are disturbing and not good for the bulk of their 
fellow negroes.

"According to the FBI, there's a new wrinkle in prostitution: suburban 
teenage girls are now selling their white asses at the mall to make 
money to spend at the mall.
...
Now, you see, the joke here, of course, is on White America, which 
always felt superior to blacks, and showed that with their feet, moving 
out of urban areas. "White flight," they called it. Whites feared 
blacks. They feared if they raised their kids around blacks, the blacks 
would turn their daughters and prostitutes. And now, through the 
miracle of MTV, damned if it didn't work out that way! "
