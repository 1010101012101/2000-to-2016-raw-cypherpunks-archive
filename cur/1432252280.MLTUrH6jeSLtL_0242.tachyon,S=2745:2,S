I don't think this is possible --the inputs (e.g., scan
newsfeeds for "bin Laden" and "funeral"; or require
a weekly warm-biometric check from the dude) could always be spoofed.

 The program has to be such that even if the seller knows

I don't see how this is possible; some set of inputs must trigger
a payoff.
