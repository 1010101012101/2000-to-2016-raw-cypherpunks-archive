Well, apparently you haven't been getting any of my posts to the Al-Qaeda 
node, otherwise the context would be clear.

security. That's the whole name of this game here, and probably a big 
(though arguably unconscious) motivation for the Iraq war. Peace is bad 
business for the military industrial complex.

Huh? I've been on the list since 2001 and this may be the first I've seen 
this acronym. meanwhile, I'm the guy who initiated the "Stash Burn" thread 
amongst a myriad of enabling ideas, whereas the only stuff I've seen come 
through with your name on it is second hand, Hettinga-esque "reporting" 
(though Hettinga's has auto-edited himself to the point of being fairly 
interesting of late). So I can only wonder as to your motivation here, Mr 
"JBT".
