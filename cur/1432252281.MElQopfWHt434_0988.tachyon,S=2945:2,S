Do you mean "Is threatening people with violence to get them to 
obey you a morally acceptable form of behavior" is the question, or
do you mean "Does threatening people with violence successfully
get what you want often enough that it's worth the risk 
of having them fight back, or do the peasants usually do a lousy job
if you keep whipping them so it's not worth the bother"?
				Thanks!
