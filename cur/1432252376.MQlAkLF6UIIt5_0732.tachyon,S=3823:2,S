I understand the capabilities below already exist in the US< in terms of
real time access to ISP/Telco customer records?

Communications Capabilities Development Programme
http://action.openrightsgroup.org/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=1422&ea.campaign.id=8227
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism/communications-data/

"Details of every phone call and text message, email traffic and
websites visited online are to be stored in a series of vast databases
under new Government anti-terror plans. 
Rather than the Government holding the information centrally, companies
including BT, Sky, Virgin Media, Vodafone and O2 would have to keep the
records themselves.
Under the scheme the security services would be granted breal timeb
access to phone and internet records of people they want to put under
surveillance, as well as the ability to reconstruct their movements
through the information stored in the databases."
