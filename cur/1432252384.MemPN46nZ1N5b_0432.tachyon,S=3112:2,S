And the antonym? Odyssielded. Rhymes with shielded.

http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Odysseus.html

Odysseus was the first to learned the Palladium Oracles from the Seer Hellenus.
Odysseus neutralised (neutronised?) Palladium's defence for Troy.
Odysseus invented the first Trojan Horse.

Incidentally public revelation of the Palladium is supposed to be on
Seventh Day to the Ides of Jun, i.e. 8th. June. The Newsweek article was
a bit late.
