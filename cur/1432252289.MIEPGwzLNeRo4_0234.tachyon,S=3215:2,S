Later. (Actually, I didn't 'keep asserting this', but that's a separate 
matter)

Well, that's a good point...I think I viewed your previous analysis on a 
more philosophical level (because that's how it was phrased), but when you 
put it this way it starts to make some sense. In other words, avoiding 
travel whenever possible will (when added to sheeple starting to do the same 
because of all the terible screening stories) eventually start putting some 
squeeze on the airlines. (But then again, DC has plenty of our tax dollars 
ready to bail out an incompetent set of airline managers.) It won't hurt at 
least.


As for the former, I am suprised you even need examples...asking for them 
weakens your main point.
There are plenty of examples to be had, and I'll give you an easy one. 
You're a hot looking, leggy and not super-bright saleschick that ALWAYS 
makes the sale in person (read: Big Bonuses), and much less frequently over 
the phone (read: failed sales quotas and eventual layoff). Your territory is 
"Northwest" meaning Oregon, NO Cal, Washington, Vancouver, and lots of those 
weird states over there like Idaho and whatnot. You can't possibly drive 
fast enough to make all your meetings in your territory. Will you...

1) Phone it in
2) Do some kind of lameass video conferencing
3) Fly
4) Get a job at McDonalds
