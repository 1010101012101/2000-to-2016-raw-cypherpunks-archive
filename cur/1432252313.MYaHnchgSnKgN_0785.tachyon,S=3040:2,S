Just to clarify this, so you need a multivalued CN, with one containing the
expression "(a|b|c)" and the remaining containing each of "a", "b", and "c"?
Is it multiple AVAs in an RDN, or multiple RDNs?   (Either of these could be
hard to generate with a lot of software, which can't handle multiple AVAs in
an RDN or multiple same-type RDNs).  Which hack is for MSIE and which is for
Netscape?

Peter.
