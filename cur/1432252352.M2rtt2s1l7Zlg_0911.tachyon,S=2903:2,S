I actually strongly suspect Vodaphone cooperation in this.

"Seeding" a remote software upgrade to a switch like this is extremely 
difficult if you're coming in from another vendor's gear. Right now I 
believe they would've had to gain physical access and install the software 
in person, otherwise they'd have to go through the local Greek NOC.

I suppose it's POSSIBLE they modified the Vodaphone software and remotely 
seeded it without anyone being the wiser, but what? No one noticed a bunch 
of DS0s were all of a sudden provisioned with unknown traffic?

But no doubt they had copies of the gear, no doubt they had access to the 
firmware code, no doubt they had telco gear coders (something that's 
practically nonexistent in Greece right now)...

If you ask me, Vodaphone's playing dumb in light of EFF suing AT&T. They 
realized there's no way they code hide that if someone was inspired to start 
looking more closely.
