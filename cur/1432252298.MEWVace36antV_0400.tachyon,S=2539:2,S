hi,

i would like to use a Pseudo Random Number Generator,
that generates 32 different permutations of numbers
between [0-360]. In each permutation all numbers
0<=x<360 should appear exactly once.

A full period linear congruence generator with modulus
360 was used to obtain what is required with the help
of 40 different seeds. The problem is that i find the
data too correlated. 

Hence a much better linear generator,mersenne twister,
mt19937's 32 bit  implementation was used. It gives
integer outputs between 0 and 2^32 -1. 360 consecutive
outputs were taken and (each_output modulo 360) was
computed. It was found that there are repetitions in
the output. However i like to have them without
repetitions.

Is there anyway to get 'good' uniform pseudo random
integers between 0 and user_given_limit, such that it
generates all the numbers between 0 and
user_given_limit?

Thanks,
Sarad.
