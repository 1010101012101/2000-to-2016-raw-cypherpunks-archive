While this is certainly a value judgement, almost every other nation thinks so.

Its fair if each party is free to select its own basis for selecting 
candidates.  That way voters can take into consideration both the party and 
individual ideology and any geographical interests before deciding what 
party to vote for.  The most important thing, in my opinion, is that the 
number of seats is awarded by, in our situation, state election results and 
not solely by district where independent candidates will almost never 
represent a majority and thus never get elected to office.

In some countries parties select candidates to fill seats awarded in an 
election, in others candidates for each party are selected in a primary 
election and (e.g., based on votes per candidate received) seat the 
candidates in order of popularity, in still other countries voters are free 
to write in candidate names.  I prefer some combination of the last two 
methods plus some localization means to prevent the major population 
centers from monopolizing candidate selection.  This might involve some 
sort of district rotation or randomization so that primary election 
candidates would be required to come from only those districts in the 
rotation.  I am sure there are other means to address this issue.

I agree that without geographic adjustments other unfairness would become 
problematic.
