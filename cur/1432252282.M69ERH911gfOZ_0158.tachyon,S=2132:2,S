Hum...I've been thinking about that...seems to me one could set up anonymity 
using even Hotmail and Yahoo by a careful selection of completely improbably 
emails addresses. The timing might be tricky, though:

1. Think up two email addresses no one would have utilized...a random list 
of letters and numbers.
2. Go to Yahoo mail and sign up using one the email addresses. Plug in the 
other as the 'reference' and point it at, say, hotmail.
3. Open another browser to hotmail, do the reverse.
4. Hit send.
5. Hit send.

This should cause the two email accounts to reference each other. Mightn't 
this work? If not, perhaps there's some way to delay one of the emails.
