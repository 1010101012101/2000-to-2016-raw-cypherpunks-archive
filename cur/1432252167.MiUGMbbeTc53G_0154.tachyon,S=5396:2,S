Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.

The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
gov-com-org-edu.

http://cryptome.org/2013/10/nsa-tor-dingledine.htm

Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.

Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.

Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.

Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.

So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the
revelations "under legal pressure" and "FISC orders."
That has been a fundamental feature of crypto and
comsec wizardry.
