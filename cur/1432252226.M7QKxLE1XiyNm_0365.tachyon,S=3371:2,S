""The views you have acquired about Darwinism, evolution, and the struggle 
for existence won't explain to you the meaning of your life and won't give 
you guidance in your actions, and a life without an explanation of its 
meaning and importance, and without the unfailing guidance that stems from 
it is a pitiful existence. Think about it. I say it, probably on the eve of 
my death, because I love you."
Tolstoy.
