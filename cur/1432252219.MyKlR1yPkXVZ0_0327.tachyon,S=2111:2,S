James Risen on the NSA "Program:"


http://cryptome.org/nsa-program.htm

Risen doesn't offer much new information in his book, out
today, but this is a handy summary of how the NSA siphons
data. The telecom and Internet giants are the ones to be 
hammered for secretly doing the dirty work against their
customers. 
 
He fingers the international telecom hubs in NYC through 
which NSA grabs most of the data purposely sent through them
to transoceanic cables worldwide. Hmm, the hubs on
the West Coast are not mentoned. Wonder if that traffic is
now redirected through New York too for easy watching.

There are six or so of the giant facilities in Manhattan, and
cable landings along Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Many
more along the New Jersey coast. Most of the cable landings
worldwide show up on nautical maps due to conflicts with
mariners.
