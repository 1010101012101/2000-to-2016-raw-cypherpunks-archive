NEW YORK (AP) - For years now, Americans who happen to use a credit card 
or order a magazine have left a financial identity trail that has been 
catalogued by database companies like ChoicePoint Inc., then resold to 
the U.S. government.

Federal and state governments pay about $50 million a year to comb 
through ChoicePoint's databanks, also marketed under such names as 
AutoTrack, KnowX.com and ScreenNow.

The company compiles and sells personal information on U.S. residents, 
such as motor vehicle and credit records, car and boat registrations, 
liens and deed transfers and military records.

The files can be used by the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service or Internal 
Revenue Service to check employee backgrounds, track fugitives or piece 
together clues to a person's potential for terrorism.

Journalists, including The Associated Press, also use ChoicePoint's data 
for researching stories.

New federal demand for the data can be seen in forthcoming programs such 
as Total Information Awareness and Computer Assisted Passenger 
Prescreening System, or CAPPS II, which seek to prevent acts of terror 
by poring over financial transactions, court records and government 
watch lists.

ChoicePoint president Doug Curling said in a conference call with 
financial analysts last month that the government prohibited him from 
discussing any role in the CAPPS II program.

Privacy experts are dismayed by the U.S. government's use of such 
commercial data. They say it circumvents the spirit of the 1974 Privacy 
Act, which prohibits routine data collection on ordinary Americans.

"The Privacy Act passed because of fears in the 1960s of a federal data 
center. That data center was created after all, but it's in private 
hands," said Chris Hoofnagle of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

After the Sept. 11 debacle, law enforcers and government agencies 
clamored for data from commercial data merchants. The new Transportation 
Security Agency used ChoicePoint to screen some 300,000 job applicants, 
airport workers and pilots.

ChoicePoint, a publicly held company, was spun off of credit reporting 
company Equifax in 1997 and quickly began gobbling up competitors, 
swallowing over 30 to date.

Earnings climbed 62 percent in four years, from $466 million in 1998 to 
$753 million in 2002, with its stock price up some 300 percent since it 
began trading.

The company's computers in Boca Raton, Fla., and Alpharetta, Ga., are 
stocked with more than 100 terabytes of storage. A forthcoming data 
center will add tens of terabytes more, said marketing director James Lee.

ChoicePoint is the U.S. immigration officer's favorite private data 
tool, but it's not the only one, said Thomas Durand, assistant chief 
inspector of the new U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, which 
absorbed some of the INS functions. Inspectors also use LexisNexis, a 
top competitor. Durand said marketing data company infoUSA is also 
looking to sell to the government.

"They've given us free passwords and user accounts to see if we find it 
interesting," Durand said.

Problems with accuracy have dogged Choicepoint.

In the most famous case, a ChoicePoint subsidiary mistakenly flagged 
hundreds of eligible voters for removal from Florida's voter rolls in 
2000. The voters were unable to cast ballots in the presidential 
election that brought George W. Bush into the White House.

If ChoicePoint's data are used to block foreigners from entering the 
United States, Lee said he hopes immigration officials give travelers 
the chance to challenge the accuracy of information used to confront them.

Only the subject of the background check can verify the information, not 
ChoicePoint or the U.S. government, Lee said.

"The key to any of this is giving the actual citizen the right to see it 
and fix it," Lee said. "We do everything to ensure our customers are 
following privacy policies. But there is still going to be human error. 
And the outcome isn't going to be what people would like."
