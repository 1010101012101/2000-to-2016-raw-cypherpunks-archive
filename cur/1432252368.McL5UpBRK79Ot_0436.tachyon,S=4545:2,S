An old friend of mine summed up the basic physics of the situation:

You mentioned that "concerted action" would have to be more than
everybody doing their own thing.  Not necessarily, if "doing your own
thing" means conducting one's affairs in such a way that minimizes the
net benefit to those who would restrict your freedom, while still
providing a net benefit to yourself.  That goes to the heart of my
friend's point.

He goes on to say that notions like "mass action" or "mass
enlightenment" are just more collectivist drivel, and he's rather
emphatic about it:

It's all about the physics, though discussing the specifics can be
delicate.
