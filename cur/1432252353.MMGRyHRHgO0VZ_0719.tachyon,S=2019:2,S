ABIT has come out with a new motherboard, the 
"IC7-MAX3" featuring something called 'Secure 
IDE', which seems to involve HW crypto in the 
onboard IDE controller:

>From the marketing fluff at
http://www.abit.com.tw/abitweb/webjsp/english/news1.jsp?pDOCNO=en_0307251

	"For MAX3, the ABIT Engineers listened 
	to users who were asking for information 
	security. SecureIDE connects to your IDE 
	hard disk and has a special decoder; 
	without a special key, your hard disk cannot 
	be opened by anyone. Thus hackers and 
	would be information thieves cannot access 
	your hard disk, even if they remove it from your 
	PC. Protect your privacy and keep anyone 
	from snooping into your information. Lock 
	down your hard disk, not with a password, 
	but with encryption. A password can be 
	cracked by software in a few hours. ABIT's 
	SecureIDE will keep government 
	supercomputers busy for weeks and will 
	keep the RIAA away from your Kazaa files."

No, I have no idea what this actually means either.
I'm trying to find out.
