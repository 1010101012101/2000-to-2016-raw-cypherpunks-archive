Let me say it again...

Economics is technology, government is technology. Neither are a 'fact of
nature' or a 'natural law'. They are a direct result of the way we look at
the cosmos -and how we *interpret* natural law-. To put it another way,
they are each -primarily- *ego*. -WE- -make- the world by the -choices-
-WE- -make-. Stop acting like a -victim of circumstances-.

If other technology changes then economics change. It is not immutable.

Don't confuse 'economics' (which is a function of psychology) with 'supply
and demand' (which is a function of the 3 laws of thermodynamics). Not the
same thing.

Use the right technology and the problem is -removed- from 'economic'
consideration.

You're using the wrong technology.
