There was a young lawyer named Rex
Who had a diminutive instrument of sex
Charged with indecent exposure
He pleaded with composure
"De minimus non curat lex"

"DE MINIMUS NON CURAT LEX-Literally, "The law does not cure trifles." The 
rule that a minimal or trifling injury to a person, property, or rights 
does not justify the time and trouble of a lawsuit, and that the courts 
will refuse to hear such a suit. See damnum absque injuria."
