Well, I'd consider it secure in the following sense: NSA can probably break 
it via manipulating some microscopic vulnerability, but it will take time 
and money. For all but Al Qaeda, that's going to be good enough: NSA won't 
reveal what it's got to even local law enforcement, unless it's really 
really necessary (ie, they'll lose lots of funding or bigshot jobs). This 
means that, unless I've got a special delivery for the beltway area, local 
thugs won't come pounding at my door. (And if I did have such a special 
delivery, I won't be using any technological channels at all.)
