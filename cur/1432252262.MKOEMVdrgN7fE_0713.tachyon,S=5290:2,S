The implicit coercion is the protection racket of the state lurking in the 
background and attempting to monopolies money.
Best fought with anarchism.Now jamesd;

Nonsense.
If you do not like one guy's prices or wages, you can go to
another, or start your own business"

  Again:Who cares? its low level market and
 >trade

"Without property rights, the specialization of labor has to
take place by something very like a state telling people what
they must do, and what they may consume. Thus to suppress
capitalism requires centralized terror, and lots of it.
Nothing less will suffice. Been tried."

Without property rights enforced by coercion by even the most minimal state 
using stone axes and spears.
Again best fought by anarchism.
Property rights may ebb and flow in a free society not a capitalist force 
propped society.How else are we to digitize the ' mass hallucination of 
money without anarchism? Something never really been given a fair 
go.Centrally directed terror is an obvious feature of modern capitalism.Do 
you suggest its about to wither away?

"And indeed that terror is a large part of the attraction of
socialism. Observe the popularity among socialists of books
by those who have murdered helpless captives. Many
socialists even name their ideology after mass murderers, for
example Trotskyists. One can hardly imagine some faction of
neo-nazis naming themselves after one of Hitler's more
prominent goons."

No one enjoys bashing authoritarian 'socialists' more than I,james,but its 
getting off topic.Crypto anarchy.
Not cryptocapitalism.Remember? Famous anarchist Bakunin predicted the 
murderous folly that bourgeois marxism would lead to.
Marx was an capitalist along with engels all his life.Show me some 
anarchist mass murderers.There must be one,somewhere on your site.Its pure 
straw man to try and mix anarchy with marxist-leninism.

"Similarly, when socialists celebrate great moments in
socialist history, it is not the heroic battles they recall,
but the murder of the helpless and powerless -- for example
they recall not the last days of the Paris commune, but the
first. "

James is flirting with hate speech here,I dont know what socialist soirees 
james attends,possibly national socialist.
Libertarian socialists celebrate much about the commune and mourn much.Way 
off topic now,like its a manichean thing with you james? You are either for 
capitalism or your a cold war era commie?Thats your consistent response.Its 
old.

"Similarly observe how the Soviet Union, Mao's china, and the
rest ceased to be loved when the terror ceased. When the
terror in the Soviet Union was in full flow, it was described
a glorious paradise where the concept of a policeman was
strange and unknown. When the terror eased, then they
started to describe it as regrettably wicked, but nonetheless
a much lesser evil than the USA. "

You've  really lost me now james,Is that the secret? Baffle them with 
bushit? Is it fun in your bubble boy world?
