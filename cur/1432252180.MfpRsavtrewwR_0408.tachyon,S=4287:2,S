  The Smoking Gun

  Man Busted For Cursing Agent's Mother

  Feds: Threatening messages left on informant's answering machine


  FEBRUARY 12--A New York man, enraged that his girlfriend had been ensnared
  in a drug probe, is himself facing a felony rap for a vulgar telephone
  tirade directed at the parents of a federal agent. According to
  investigators, Joshua Haggerty, 24, began ranting soon after a Bureau of
  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent contacted his girlfriend to
  discuss her surrender in connection with drug distribution. Amy McDonald,
  Haggerty's squeeze, was charged late last month in Maryland with cocaine
  distribution. According to an ATF affidavit (a copy of which you'll find
  below), Haggerty left an obscene voice mail message for an acquaintance
  named Pat, who is identified in the court document as an ATF "confidential
  informant." Referring to ATF Agent Ben Wright, Haggerty told Pat, "Call
  your little boy fucking Ben, tell him I will fuck his fucking mom and slap
  his fucking daddy." Haggerty continued, "Tell him I will fuck his fucking
  mom right in the fucking ass, raw dog. Tell him to go fucking suck my
  fucking cock." The snitch dutifully forwarded the message to his federal
  handlers. And while the recorded rant could have been dismissed as the
  frustrated ravings of a guy whose girlfriend is facing judicial peril,
  prosecutors opted to charge Haggerty with a felony count for threatening to
  "assault a member of the immediate family" of a federal law enforcement
  officer. Haggerty, who has been in custody since February 8, is scheduled
  for a bail hearing this morning at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. (3
