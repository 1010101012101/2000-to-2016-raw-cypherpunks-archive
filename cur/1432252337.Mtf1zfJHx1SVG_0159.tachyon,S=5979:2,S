If I had known that to you "computer crunching" is synonymous with "brute 
forcing large keys" I certainly would have expressed myself differently.

Backpedalling has nothing to do with it. "trying to break Cypehrpunks-
interesting ciphers" does not equal "using supercomputers to brute-force 
large keys." "Interesting cryptograhic applications" does not equal "brute-
forcing large keys". Why is this so difficult.

The "as I had anticipated would be the case" refers to being allowed to 
build it in someone else's facility, on their dime.  I never said the first 
thing about having done any of the calculations mentioned in your post. 
It's their facility, I anticipate they find it interesting enough to let me 
build it there, they foot the power bill. What's so tricky about that. In 
fact, I meant for the passage to serve as a sort of explanation of the 
circumstances in which power costs weren't enough of a central issue for me 
to have considered them. The end of the sentence you omitted, "where's the 
downside?" might make this clearer. Obviously, not clear enough. 


>When some adds a gratuitous "As I had anticipated would be the 
>case" under these circumstances we know we are in the presence of a faker.

You interpreted it as referring to what you thought it ought to in order to 
bolster whatever view you want to have of me. Nothing new.
