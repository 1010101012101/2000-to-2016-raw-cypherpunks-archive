If you call for the release of Saddam, or you justify 9/11, as 
the "anti-war" posters in this thread have  been arguing, then 
indeed you are with the terrorists.

You are stupid evil, and a loser.

A popular anti-colonial nationalist movement which he led from 
Moscow?   Somehow I seriously doubt that Stalin's Moscow was 
the place to find nationalist movements, let alone popular 
ones.

When Ho came to power in North Vietnam, he treated the 
population as though they were the enemy, and himself the 
quisling leader of a hostile alien occupation force.  In his 
terror against the Vietnamese, he set execution quotas.  His 
servants had to kill such and such a number of "class enemies" 
in each village.

I deleted most of your lies without comment, as too obvious and 
stupid to merit rebuttal, but this lie, though equally obvious 
and equally stupid, is significant, as it links the fans of 
Saddam, with the fans of Stalin and Soviet expansionism.

You accuse the US of not merely being allied to bin Laden, but 
of "creating" him, which presupposes that the US created the 
Afghan resistance, and indeed every resistance to Soviet 
tyranny.

Hey, if it had not been for that nasty CIA the afghans would 
have been happy as pigs in mud enjoying the vast benefits of 
being uplifted by the Soviets to the superior level of 
civilization enjoyed by the beneficiaries of Soviet alliance
:-)

That is a lie we have heard over and over again, with thirty 
different wars of Soviet aggression, starting in the 1920s.  We 
heard it most infamously uttered against East German 
resistance, and every time we heard that tired old lie, those 
servants of tyranny uttering it were less believable, and less 
believed.

oh come on.

The Baathist coup was part of a pan arab conspiracy for 
simultaneous coups in all major arab countries, to create a 
united pan arab socialist government modelled on Stalin's 
dictatorship, which would supposedly make the arabs strong in 
the way that Stalin had supposedly made the Soviet Union 
strong.

It is plausible that the CIA might support an ordinary military 
coup against a pro Soviet tyrant, but it is unbelievable that 
the CIA would support a pan arabist coup, intended to unite the 
arab world and subjugate the drunken fat princes of Kuwait, 
Saudi Arabia, etc.

Plus, if you really believed that Saddam was a CIA agent, how
come you are calling for him to be released, or turned over to
the questionable justice of his fellow tyrants and mass
murderers running the court in the Hague?
