zenaan it is a beyond beautiful planet... life is exquisite

art is life

it is my pleasure beyond my pleasure really to have words flow thru me ...
ideas are just in the air i just catch them for a moment and put the words
on the computer

i need to work on how to shift out of the blood lust though ... need to
figure out daily functionality to do that as it is too pervasive cant sit
one day without doing something against it ... all ideas for that are
welcomed -  you are all so smart ya know ....even the ones i argue with are
smart
