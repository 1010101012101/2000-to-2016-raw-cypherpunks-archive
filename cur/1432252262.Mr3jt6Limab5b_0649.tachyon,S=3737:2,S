In Choate-Prime (aka Choate'), the parallel reality that Choate lives 
in, Hayek' practices this form of Austrian' economics.

In our own reality, where history, physics, math, and economics are all 
as we know them to be, Choate is lost. In Choate' I hear he is quite 
well-respected, even on the Cypherpunks' list.


When he travels to our reality, though, it is not worth our time trying 
to understand his communications about his reality.

Bluntly, when Choate makes strange claims about math, history, physics, 
and economics, it's never worth the time to try to correct his many 
wrong-headed (in our reality) ideas and definitions.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only 
exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
