The firestorm which began a few months back in the 9th Circuit is now 
before the Supreme Court.  At issue is whether a child can be forced to 
recite a pledge which is abhorrent to either the student's or the parent's 
religious convictions.  But if thought of another reason to reject the 
Pledge: its a fraud.

"I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

There hasn't been a Republic is 150 years.  Not since the illegally passed 
14th Amendment made Federal law supreme in almost all areas over State 
laws.  The states are now little more than Directorates or Districts (using 
the French term) of the Federal government.
