Sandy is of course right. I almost added a parenthetical remark to my 
"tent" point about how RVs, for example, are only "homes" for the 
purposes of this law when _parked_ (and maybe when parked for the 
purposes of sleeping, blah blah). So, no guns not locked up while 
rolling down the road, or parked at McDonald's for a burger. (Obviously, 
there is vanishingly small chance of being "caught" if the gun is not 
brandished. Applies to cars as well.)

In this case, the common sense interpretation is what the law actually 
supports, strangely enough.
