On 15th July, a bunch of people from activist groups Rising Tide and 
Critical Mass met up on London's South Bank for a climate change bike ride 
round the city centre. We were going to stop at five evil companies around 
the capital to give them an award for fucking up our planet. Our first stop 
was the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank. 
It's right next to the Houses of Parliament - coincidence or what? We made 
some noise outside, handed out leaflets and gave them the award. Next we 
cruised off round Parliament Square. The 'Countryside Alliance' had a stall 
there, and I gave them a couple of shouts of 'get a job'. Then it was up 
Whitehall, through Trafalgar Square and on to the National Portrait 
Gallery, which is sponsored by BP. Next we moved off to Enterprise IG in 
Soho. These are the people responsible for BP's Helios awards, the in-house 
awards given to BP employees who do a good job of making the company look 
green and nice. We got a baffled response from the company's workers. They 
had to be told by their boss to get back inside and close all the windows 
(in case we bit?). We were on our way to Cromwell and Sullivan when some 
dude in a BMW ran over one of the guys on a bike. Luckily he wasn't hurt, 
even though the car had gone over his back wheel. The guy in the car looked 
like he was gonna shit himself when thirty bikers pulled up around him. He 
called the cops, who soon came and pestered everyone. Last of all, we went 
to the BP Head Offices in Finsbury Circus. Here the cops were waiting for 
us. British Transport Police had a dog unit and meat wagon ready. The 
security people from BP were also waiting, even though we'd no intention of 
raiding the place. The Azerbaijan PR man Ð sorry, 'Community Relations' 
officer - came out to talk to us (the demo was mainly about BP's proposed 
Azerbaijan pipeline). Eventually, everyone except from a couple of the 
hardcore went off to the London Activist Resource Centre (LARC) in 
Whitechapel. The hardcore stayed to play with the cops and nearly got 
stopped for cycling the wrong way round a roundabout. It was a nice protest 
- Critical Mass is so fucking empowering, I recommend everyone to try it.
