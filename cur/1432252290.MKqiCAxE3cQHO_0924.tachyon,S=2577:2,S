H2K2, 2600's conference, is at Hotel Penn in New York
July 12-14.  http://www.h2k2.net

CP contributors who are scheduled include
John Young and yours truly.  Maybe others I
didn't recognize or see yet.  I heard of a few other
tentatives.

The full conference schedule should be online within
the next couple of days.  I'm thinking of a CP
meet Saturday night July 12.  Anyone else gonna be there?
