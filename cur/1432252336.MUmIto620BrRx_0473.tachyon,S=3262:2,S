<html><P>ive been reading the tidbits of mail from cypherpunks for a while and was&nbsp;wondering everyone elses opinion on something. the term crypto-anarchy is used alot in these discussions and was wondering if crypto-anarchy or any anarchy for that matter is not total confusion and chaos with no pattern or system but maybe it&nbsp;is a pattern that we (humans) at such a low level of intelligence and understanding, compared to what could be possible, that we have not developed the mathematics or skills to&nbsp;understand what we&nbsp;always label as anarchy because of its apperance as such.</P>
