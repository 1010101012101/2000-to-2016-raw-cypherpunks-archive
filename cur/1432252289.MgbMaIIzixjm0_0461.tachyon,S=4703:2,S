Run a raw tcpdump on a machine with 2 cpus, maybe filter online
with something simple (like IP addr) and reconstruct offline.

You're not analyzing on line, you're recognizing addresses and
DMAing buffers which are flushed to nonvolitile storage.

Re: monitoring an OC-XXX with overt access is just a matter of how much you
can pay for fast electronics.  

Take a look at the Caida.org folks' work on monitoring backbones.

Carnivore in its current state may well be a point-tool intended
for leaf-node ISPs, but you can certainly extrapolate to Carnivore 2.0
for Gigabit Ether.   "Just plug your boxes through ours and you'll be
CALEA-compliant, and no more hassles from us.."  An optical tap
(essentially a fiber optic beamsplitter) would be fairly fail-safe to the ISP.
