Scalia on originalist constitutional philosophy, versus the "living
document" approach, in reference to recent Choate-spawned questions and
threads.

<snip>
But Scalia also insisted that only his approach - interpreting the
Constitution based on the Framers' precise words and the meaning they
intended at the time - can preserve the Constitution's guiding principles.

"The Constitution is not an organism," the justice said, "it is a legal
document." <snip>

<snip>That "living Constitution" approach, Scalia observed, has led to U.S.
Senate hearings in which candidates for federal judge or Supreme Court
justice are grilled about which rights they believe are in the Constitution.
Eventually, voters will choose and demand judges based not on their ability
to interpret the Constitution but on the political positions they hold, he
warned.<snip>

Eventually???? Somebody toss out the link for the Ashcroft hearings....
