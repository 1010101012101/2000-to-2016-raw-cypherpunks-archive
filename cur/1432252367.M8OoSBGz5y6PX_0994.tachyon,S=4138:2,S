Welcome to the list! It's good to see so many new members coming on  
board. I'm new myself.

Because GnuPG is open source, it's been extensively peer reviewed and  
found safe and secure.  That doesn't mean it's perfect and has no  
errors. But they are much less likely to exist in GnuPG than in some  
other solutions; particularly proprietary ones.

One of the best ways to learn about tech topics is reading RFC's. The  
entire way SSL/TLS operates is detailed in an RFC. Read I'd and you  
will be infinately more informed.

Unfortunately, I can't really recommend any good crypto list because  
I've not found many. To learn about FnuPG and practice, you might want  
to look at the PGPNET list. Another of interest might be Cryptography.

Regards and Welcome!
