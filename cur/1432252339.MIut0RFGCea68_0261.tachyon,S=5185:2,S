basically, the potential for:  HUMAN TEMPEST

reading signals off the nervous system to potentially correlate
this with EMF emissions of equipment, diagnostically. however
unlikely, under certain conditions could data be gleaned this way,
say if a modulated tone imprinted itself onto a brainwave or body
field and could provide information about environment interactions

then to imagine a robot or android able to siphon data this way,
if listening to CPU or other equipment, frequencies, modulations
(if recording or through mimicry) or whatever. the possibility of it.
though if observed by another there would be no perceived threat,
other than what is input and output via the monitored channels

okay, certifiably nuts. though in a realm of possibility or within
particular parameters could it exist as a threat or exploit, etc.

akin perhaps to reading lines-of-force for navigation by birds,
what if 'sensing' of computing equipment could glean data as
if a TSCM review of data structure, yet not visibly indicate this,
and for the purpose of attacks or espionage not its defense

too blade-runneresque, yet with biometrics and the rest, at
what point does a security threat model peak or go beyond
what is discussed to address the sci-fi potentials involved,
and answering this with, whatever it is: it remains classified
