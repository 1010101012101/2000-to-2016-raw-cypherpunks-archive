Can we change the subject? My girlfriend is Chinese, I've already eaten
things that I wouldn't have considered to be food, she doesn't like my
cat, and I don't want her getting any ideas.

However, to answer Robert's question, cat probably wouldn't taste like
chicken. Carnivore and herbivore meat tastes much different.
