proposes-retroactive-immunity-for-phone-companies.html



"Retroactive immunity from prosecution is a beautiful thing if you're  
a major telecommunications provider in the US, and phone companies  
are about to receive it if the Bush administration gets its way. The  
administration's new appropriations request for intelligence agencies  
was recently disclosed at a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on  
Intelligence, and it includes a massive gift to the phone companies  
who have been (can we drop the "allegedly" at this point?) helping  
the NSA and other agencies."
