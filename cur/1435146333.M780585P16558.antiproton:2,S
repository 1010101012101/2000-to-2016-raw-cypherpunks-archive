Soo sophistamicated.

I thought CIA was meant to be an intelligence agency - not seein much from ya :)

Nice to see you guys exposing yourselves though, I genuinely
appreciate all the insights and the apparently genuine attempt at
intelligent discourse. Seeing things I never saw before. I believe.

You might need to charge yourself with indecent exposure, since you
probably messed up in undressing quite so publicly. Guess that's why
we get your delicious rant now. Mmm, yummy.

Went back and read the photo-ops eh?

Better luck next time, folks will be lookin out for your new fake I-D
hey! I never liked "Beelen" anyway...
