  Issue 1                                                March 7, 2001

   Today's Issue                                              [Image]

   Despite the loud clamor of earnings warnings, stocks were up
   across the board today as investors and analysts wondered if a
   bottom had been reached. The Dow Jones industrial average closed
   up 138.38 to 10,729.60; the Nasdaq composite rose 19.47 to
   2,223.90 and the Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 8.09 to 1,261.89.

   It was a strange day for the markets as investors shrugged off bad
   news and bought in a manner eerliy similar to recent months where
   good news was  ignored and sold into. The Nasdaq is now up 5
   percent since last Friday, withstanding a number of large
   technology companies warning about poor earnings.

   Breaking News                                              [Image]

   We held the publishing of this newsletter until later than
   expected as we know that an enormous amount of our database are
   Yahoo users and investors and the stock, as most of you know, was
   halted around 10:00 a.m est. pending a company announcement.

   Just a few moments ago The Financial Times announced that Yahoo
   CEO Tim Koogle will step down and warn of lackluster quarterly
   earnings. Yahoo confirmed this report atfter the market's close,
   making for what will undoubtedly be an interesting Thursday
   morning for the stock. Today, the stock traded off $1.44 before it
   was halted.

   Conversely, Quintek (OTCBB: QTEK) announced 2nd Quarter financial
   results with a revenue increase of 57% and a profit increase of
   100%. Quintek also announced their client roster in the release
   which includes Imation,  TRW, Lockheed-Martin, U.S. Navy, Boeing,
   and a multitude of others also noted in the release.
