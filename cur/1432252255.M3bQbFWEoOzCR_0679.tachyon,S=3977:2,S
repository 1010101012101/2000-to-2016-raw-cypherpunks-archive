Subject: APM: GnuPG and Perl GnuPG Interface for (En/De)cryption Question

I have a question. I want to use GnuPG (or any suitable open source
alternative) to encrypt a credit card to store in a database. The client
wants to decrypt them on the server and view them over an SSL connection. I
can encrypt without a problem, but to decrypt I know I at least need the
passphrase, but then that makes me leave the private key on the server
(bad!). Is there a way to send both the passphrase and private key to the
Perl GnuPG interface and have it decrypted in memory to send via SSL?

We're trying to avoid having the client install the decryption software on
their desktop (client's being such as they are) and just provide either the
private key or the passphrase/Private key.

Thanks-

David
