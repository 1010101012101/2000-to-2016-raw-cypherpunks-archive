The code bloat of <bitcoin-privacy-of-the-week>, the blockchain bloat of new
addresses all the time, and the biggest one:

The god damned mental anguish I have to deal with because the fricking bitcoin
client generates a new address for every damned transaction. I just want a
couple of well known addresses to keep track of my stuff.

If I want privacy (and for the record, I don't), I can hide in high-frequency
automated trading and buttonwood exchanges. Otherwise known as 'tradecraft'.

The software attempting to 'do it for me' makes for worse privacy and opsec
for EVERYONE, at substantial mental, storage, and computation cost. I dunno,
maybe I'm missing something here, but then, if I am missing it, how the hell
are non-coders (aka, the real world, or journalists, or dissidents) supposed
to figure it out?
