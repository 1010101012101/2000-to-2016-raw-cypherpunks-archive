How? Not if you get something like a Sharp Zaurus and compile your own
environment.  "Hey, I want to get as much performance out of this shitty

What makes you think they'll have enough of a clue as to how to read the 
files off your PDA without booting it in the first place?  99% of these 
dorks use very expensive automated hardware tools that do nothing more 
than "dd" your data to their device, then run a scanner on it which looks 
for well known jpg's of kiddie porn.  

If you're suspected of something really big, or you're middle eastern,
then you need to worry about PDA forensics.  Otherwise, you're just
another geek with a case of megalomania thinking you're important enough 
for the FedZ to give a shit about you.

And PGP won't stand out because.... ?
