That's because non-US licenses constitute automatic permission for minor
traffic law violations.  The scenario is something like the following:

[Driver gets pulled over].

Driver: "Gidday mate, hows it going?"

[Cop asks for license, looks at it]

Cop: "Ahhhh, screw it, too much paperwork.  Don't do it again.  HAND".
