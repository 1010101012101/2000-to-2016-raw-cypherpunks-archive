yes, with "you" I meen "you being an hardware maker"

not a backdoor, we forget to much that every system is only 1 and 0
through electricity and physical circuits. If you can make them you can
watch them (with time and monney i agree). Perhaps thinking that datas
(certs, instructions) can be "hidden" behind a physical thing is only a
dream ? I ask myself if not every cryptosystem where you must have
something "hidden" or "physically not accessible" in point of the
process is not sure ?
