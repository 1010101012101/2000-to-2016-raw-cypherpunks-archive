Personally I haven't seen this in the commercial world but on the 
government side (at least NASA and DOD, heard DHS and DOE also but can't 
confirm them) they pushed organization wide PKI smark card initiatives 
(DOD CAC and NASA HSPD12) which by default encrypt and sign all emails 
to allow sensitive data to transverse public networks without snooping 
or alteration.  Now we can argue how effective it is or how many folk 
disable it BUT thats a different issue (e.g. its more in use in non-DOD 
agencies than DOD and disabled less regularly in the finance and 
personal shops than combat arms)
