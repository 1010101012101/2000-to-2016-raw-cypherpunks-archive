Safeweb has provided an explanation for why its
Anongo.com has a DoD IP address:

  http://cryptome.org/safeweb-anongo.htm

Other peculiarities of Anongo are not accounted
for.

The description in the same message of Safeweb's 
policy for storing users' surfing data and responding 
to subpoenas will likely raise eyebrows even higher 
than Anongo whereever that is.
