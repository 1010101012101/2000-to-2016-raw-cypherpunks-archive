Actually you can sue a government official (cop, clerk, etc) who
violates your rights knowingly, and under 'color of authority'.
The trick is convincing a jury that it was suitably malicious
and obvious violation.  E.g., false arrest because you look like
a suspect won't cut it almost always.

BTW, Calif is the 'other' state to have a proposition this year to dissolve
the 'drug court' infrastructure and replace it with a medical (vs punitive)
structure. Needless to say, the drug-court-workers don't like the
possibility of taking their teat away.

Interestingly, Tom Cambell (R from San Jose) who is running against
Feinswine supports this proposition, and the Swine doesn't.  Cambell also
doesn't want to do Vietnam in Columbia, and the Swine does.  Interesting
reversal, eh?
