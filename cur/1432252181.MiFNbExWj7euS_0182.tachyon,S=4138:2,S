How fate, and Stalin, finally dealt the 'ace of spies' a losing hand
The order to kill Sidney Reilly - the "ace of spies" whose exploits 
supposedly provided inspiration for James Bond - came directly from Stalin, 
according to the author of a new biography of the MI6 agent.....( Guardian 
Unlimited, 6 Sep 02)
"To the best of my knowledge Reilly never killed anyone in the course of 
his spying. The only killings he carried out were with a view to lining his 
own pocket. He was a good spy but also a criminal who perfected confidence 
stings. He was a scoundrel who spoke seven languages and exactly the type 
of person SIS needed."
--Andrew Cook, author of the new book, On His Majesty's Secret Service - 
Sidney Reilly ST1
