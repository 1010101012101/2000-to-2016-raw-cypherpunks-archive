This analysis neglects consideration of several points:

  - Nation-states (even authoritarian ones) will likely want to create
    both a sustained program, not merely crank out a few crude nukes,
    and preserve the talent involved.  One-offs are almost always easier
    to complete than a production effort, but the lowered total cost is
    offset by a higher unit cost.  The terrorist organization can
    accomplish its goals with crude tactics and marginally effective
    devices.  Credible military threat isn't as simple.

  - Credible military weapons have minimum requirements of both efficacy
    -- efficient use of supercritical energy -- and predictability --
    having the damned thing go off in the silo / bunker / hanger /
    munitions dump rather than the chosen target isn't particularly
    useful.

Tighter constraints => Longer fulfillment time.

The original US project, as described by Feynman, involved much
radiation exposure and high risks of criticality incidents at Oak Ridge,
some of which are documented in his biographical essay collections.  The
Hanford reservation is still a glowing waste zone, much of which greatly
postdates a fairly deep understanding of radiation hazards.

Peace.
