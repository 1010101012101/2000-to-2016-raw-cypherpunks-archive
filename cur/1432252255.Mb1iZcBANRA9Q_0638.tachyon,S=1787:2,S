I might have my (rented, colocated) redgene Tor server,
which isn't due to expire before 12 December and has so
far been spared by the recent German Tor crackdown been seized by law
enforcement as evidence. Then, it might just be down. More as this
develops (when I get an answer for my trouble ticket, that is).
Needless, to say, there are no logs, and not even any content
there at all.
