Just days after Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton pledged a
crackdown on motion picture piracy, department investigators on Tuesday
helped arrest an LAPD captain suspected of selling bootleg DVDs.

Julie D. Nelson, a decorated patrol captain and a 28-year veteran of the
Los Angeles Police Department, was arrested at the Hollywood station
following a sting operation in which she allegedly sold counterfeit film
titles such as "The Cat in the Hat" to undercover officers.
