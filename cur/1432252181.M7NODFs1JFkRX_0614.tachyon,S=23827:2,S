a general situation and condition has been described,
relating piezo film (PVDF) with issues of free energy
and also 'non-electromagnetic' if not 'non-acoustic'
transfer of power and perhaps information likewise.

yet there is a problem encountered as mentioned,
regarding challenges to achieving an ~8 Hz vibration
at the given scale, which may be an issue connected
with do-it-yourself approaches versus a manufacturing
approach, and the technological tools and equipment
available to investigate these dynamics at the scale
of breadboards, microcontrollers, and PVDF elements.

can the existing 'size' of an PVDF electronic component
actually register the approximate ~8 Hz vibration of the
Schumann resonance?

from what i have read in the technical manual (p.2), the
piezo film material is capable of registering vibration at
this frequency [1] and in fact is so sensitive in its use
as in contact microphone applications that shielding is
required to reduce unwanted vibrations [2] in a context
of 'vibration sensing' which also applies when attached
to music instruments [3]. with this in mind, it appears
that the PVDF film element is hypersensitive to any
vibration depending on the surface it is attached to.

in other words, if there is an ~8 Hz vibration occurring,
it would seem likely if not probable that the PVDF film
tab is potentially capable of sending it, given enough
knowledge and whatever equipment required to do so.

so enough of the hypotheticals, i may have forgotten
to emphasize if not mention an important observation.

several weeks ago there was an (urls) list sent that
had information about a NOVA science program that
just aired on Public Television (PBS) in the U.S. and
i saw the last 20 minutes or so of that show, as was
conveyed on that post. [4] [5] the expert interviewed
for the program, Earle R. Williams [6] mentioned the
Global AC Circuit and described research occurring
in a rural Rhode Island experiment that has been
studying this for decades, based on groundbreaking
ideas of a previous researcher who pioneered the field
of atmospheric electricity.

and what Mr. Williams said and demonstrated in this
interview was astonishing to hear. basically, if memory
serves: any antenna on earth picks up this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, which he said was ~8 Hz.

(presumably equates to 'metal antennas' i am guessing,
of the kind found on radios and televisions.)

the very interesting aspect about this, 'context' as it were,
is that this research hut for atmospheric electricity was
old technology -- basically an antenna in a very remote area
to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) from what is
the buzzing infrastructure of wired and wireless civilization.

the other aspect is that Mr. Williams stated, if remembering,
that all that is needed is an antenna and oscilloscope to
verify the signal is there. meaning: get a metal antenna,
have it grounded or whatever is necessary, and then attach
it to a visual feedback system and locate the 8 Hz signal.

"spikes" that occur within the signal, atop the frequency
of the Schumann resonance, are lightning strikes. as if
the earth-ionosphere cavity may have some aspect of an
echo chamber (my phrasing), though also it was stated,
again, if remembering correctly, that lighting strikes can
travel up to 2.5 times around the earth, which feeds this
resonance and supports and sustains this wavelength
that is vibrating on all antennas everywhere the same.

so in some sense these are clues, signs of what exists,
what the parameters are. people who know how to use
an oscilloscope and basic antenna are that much closer
to the issue than those who do not, and likewise, those
who can program a microcontroller and write code, etc.


so incorporating this as additional information into the
existing approach and ideas, along with helpful feedback
that questions the starting investigation in its parameters,
it seems possible that experimentation could begin within
a PVDF film sensor context, if having the tools, technology,
and ideas to shape and evaluate and test these conditions.
though further, it is also probable that specifically designing
a PVDF sensor for this particular application would be the
more direct investigation. both approaches could be viable.


in other words, the as-is approach relying on existing
piezo sensors could yield some interesting and unexpected
discoveries, and perhaps break this open into another realm.

and so how to do that is a question: how to tune the element,
how to approach it, what are the actual issues involved, etc.

for instance, consider the PVDF film itself as a rectangle
that can register vibrations via touching a vibrating surface;
this versus having the PVDF film itself resonate, vibrating
based on its being a quasi free-standing antenna. these
different approaches both could potentially access 8 Hz
though via different strategies and frameworks.

my assumption is is that rectangle of the sensor itself
is capable of picking up 'multiple frequencies' at a given
time, depending on what exists as a signal. and thus, if
in a musical approach, it may have 'multiple tunings' even
that coexist on the vibrating surface, whether freestanding
or registering movement from an attached vibrating surface.

and so the issue can be of filtering these signals to focus
the sensor into a given range. and how this is done could
effect its 'efficiency' in terms of energy collection, because
a stronger versus weaker signal could exist, if muddled by
others that counteract its pendulum-like wave movement. if
this way, dampening of the vibration via weights may allow
no movement in certain frequencies, whereas a software
filter could only edit them out while they still exist as an
active force, perhaps removing energy from or competing
with a given frequency or signal from the wanted range.\

so capturing different frequencies simultaneously (good
for crypto and energy harvesting, perhaps) vs. focusing on
a given range (better for Schumann resonance seemingly)

and yet here's the thing--

like a drum skin, how is this elusive jabberwocky of the
Schumann resonance of ~8 Hz ever going to be accessed
if it cannot be readily encountered. what can capture that
wave vibration, at that particular very long wavelength. and
(due to no memory, i get to ask such rhetorical questions)
this is what triggered my memory about the antennas, that
all antennas vibrate at this frequency, or so the expert said.

though also, considering the drum approach, this then got
me thinking- instead of a free standing 'energy antenna',
would it not be possible to use a PVDF sensor to measure
and also pick up this 8 Hz vibration on an antenna instead?

in that if the antenna is vibrating at 8 Hz, could this vibration
be 'harvested' and establish mechanical vibration in these
highly sensitive piezo films, to then build up AC current in
via their capacitance, building up and storing this charge...

in other words: PVDF + ~8 Hz antenna freq. => energy


if there were no limits to exploration and equipment could
be used to custom manufacture prototypes for this purpose,
what would an antenna look like that vibrates only at this
targeted frequency... and thus, another strategy could
involve custom manufacture of the piezo film element,
such that its surface has an antenna etched onto it,
that is made to vibrate at the Schumann resonance,
for instance a particular geometry, grid, array, pattern.

i have read about antennas and they are based upon
geometric proportion to the wavelength, so 'size' does
not necessarily correlate to frequency in terms of larger
antennas for bigger wavelengths, (if i am not mistaken).

instead, the issue of alignment between a signal and
an antenna involves a matched or paired geometrical
structure that can effectively map signals onto antennas
and then coherently deliver this signal into a circuit. likely
as cleanly and crisply as is possible, mathematics then
determining these models and design approaches. thus,
fractal antennas are an area where 'scale' is exampled
other than a yagi or dipole. and cellphones in particular
appear to make very tiny antennas or utilize unique
approaches to make them invisible even, via how the
device is grounded and where the wires are hidden,
perhaps related to signal strength and also 'length'.

so in some sense, maybe size and scale do matter
and in some sense maybe size and scale are not the
most critical factors in given applications. maybe a
larger power source requires a larger antenna and
smaller applications only need smaller antennas.


what i want to convey is that this 'etched on' approach
where an antenna structure could be engineered onto
the piezo film surface -- (such that it would vibrate at
the given frequency and then stress the sensor, in
turn generating power via its constant movement) --
has correlation with a circuit - perhaps soldertrace,
that is the antenna. so imagine a rectangle with a
single loop of a given geometry that would somehow
function as a single-frequency antenna and vibrate,
and thus stress/strain, compression/decompression
of that metal structure would flex the piezo film that
it is attached to, and be designed to maximize the
surface area with this specific tuned geometry that
can focus in on just those signals or vibrations, as
simple as an anode and cathode attached to it, yet
if correlating other approaches, perhaps etched to
a nanosurface-level with fractal patterns even that
could maximize voltage, if possible, or increase
capacitance or whatever else may be optimized
for energy harvesting of ~8 Hz signal vibrations.


so, to simplify, imagine 'the cantilever' that is the
concept already for the piezo film tab, a rectangle
that moves back and forth on axis, and in doing so
creates and stores charge that then can be dumped
into a circuit, bit by bit if momentary, and seemingly
constant alternating current if the signal is constant.

the additional etched pattern atop the sensor, this
being an additional layer, could be considered 'the
antenna' for accessing Schumann resonance. yet,
it could also be conceptualized as a cantilever that
is in addition to the piezo device itself, also this.

my vagueness here is not intentional, trying to write
into a particular direction and context whereby this
'tuned antenna' atop a cantilever instead becomes
this cantilever via a different manufacturing process,
whereby the PVDF device is itself tuned to ~8 Hz,
& moreso, perhaps taking on the form of cantilever.
such that, the piezo elemen becomes a tuning fork
that is tuned for this specific vibrational frequency,
and then anode/cathode, into associated circuitry

precedent, and note 'the scale' here, is with MEMs
devices and micromachines and nanoscale devices
where such extreme miniature 'antennas' can already
be constructed and vibrate at known frequencies, and
they take on the form of a cantilever (same functioning
as energy harvesting sensors, as vibrating pendulums)
and thus micro and nano radios can be made and
other devices, where under microscope a furious
activity is observed of what is basically a tuning fork
that is naturally vibrating via its 'tuned resonance',
(if not mistaken in interpretation of these events).

so at this unobservable visual scale, little cantilevers
can be made to vibrate via their tuning, and function
essentially the same as cantilevers that at this scale
are not envisioned or conceptualized to auto-vibrate
via paired resonance. why is that i wonder, (embargo
on thoughts, experiment, or secret domain perhaps)

just consider a watch, the mechanisms required to
wind and keep the watch spinning its intricate gears,
as this relates to pendulum movement. now what if
a cantilever existed that could vibrate automatically
at ~8 Hz, and thus no more batteries, solar cell, nor
wind-up mechanisms would be needed to provide the
motive power need for its clockwork movement. and
in this way, likewise- the cantilever is the antenna.

the concept of the sensor as mechanical cantilever
in its multiuse form, instead being reimagined as a
tuned rectangle with additional layer of antenna, this
as cantilever, or further, no rectangle and instead the
PVDF is made into a cantilever, tuning fork vibrating
at the frequency of the Schumann resonance, and in
this way, potentially replacing batteries given the size
of the cantilever and its effectiveness or efficiency.


another way to consider this in terms of electronics
and circuits is the (radio again) crystal oscillator that
is included as a stand-alone timing device, matched to
a particular frequency, lets say ~8 Hz for example...

as i understand it, electrical current in a circuit - say
involving resistors, capacitors, relays, switches, and
wires on a prototyping breadboard - moves throughout
this maze of components and can send electrons into
the crystal oscillator, a timing device, that is activated
by this electricity and generates a particular frequency
in response to its being electrified, formatting resulting
output as a given frequency, here 8 Hz, back into the
circuit, where it could be used say by an IC chip that
uses it to count cycles that trigger other activity, say
an LED display that moves up a number every million
cycles and continually counts 0-9 and starts over again.

so the idea here is that this electronics component is
partly doing what the PVDF sensor is, only in reverse.

what the crystal "quartz" oscillator does is vibrate at
a particular frequency (~8 Hz) which is the goal, and
this is already achieved in a device related in some
way already to piezo sensors (see: quartz). the main
difference is that it requires external energy to generate
the signal or the vibrations, (though if it were tuned to
~8 hz, might it vibrate without any external power?)...


     energy (in) ==> crystal oscillator ==> 8 Hz vibration (out)


to put it another way, in terms of active concepts...


     electricity ==> vibration ==> timing


in other words, in traditional radio or other timing circuits
reliant upon crystal oscillators, electrical current (power)
is input into the component that then "vibrates" at a given
frequency, and then this signal is output as 'time' into the
circuit, whereby the electrical current has this geometric
patterning mapped into its structure which is then utilized
by related or connected components, to format other action.


what the piezo film sensor does is exactly the opposite:


    timing ==> vibration ==> electricity


it takes some regular mechanical vibration when attached
to a surface, and this vibration strains the sensor which in
turn generates electrical charge via piezo electric properties
and then stores this charge via its capacitance, which then
can be output into the connected circuitry as AC electrical
current. the main issue appears to focus upon controlling
the timing or frequency, via TUNING the device (that is,
creating a cantilever or antenna to automatically vibrate)


in other words, if the 'timing' between the PVDF or other
piezo sensor and the Schumann resonance could be
established, matched in shared resonance (A=A) such
that the 8 Hz signal would directly map to an antenna
or cantilever structure tuned specifically for 8 Hz, then:


    matched-timing ==> perpetual vibration ==> free electricity


where 'matched-timing' is pairing of signal with antenna
of the piezo sensor (cantilever or not) in that the geometry
is aligned (A=A) which then accesses and sustains this
connection of 8 Hz vibration via 'shared resonance' that is
a transfer of energy from the earth/ionosphere cavity, to
the surface of the earth. the critical issue appears to be
~adjustable tuning of an antenna to allow for drift, such
that "tuning" differences both small (Aa=Ab) and large
(A=B) can be adjusted for, which also occurs in a realm
of electronics and watchmaking, if not mistaken, that an
additional level of fine-tuning and adjustkbility is involved
and required in such intricate small scale technological
if other ecosystems, because variances may exist/persist


does this mean also that a crystal oscillator [7] is a step
or two away from providing power to a circuit if only tuned
to ~8 Hz - it would probably involve whatever piezo aspect
of crystals, if they could output current as piezo sensors,
when vibrating at this frequency, thus an issue of locating
or manufacturing such crystals, tuning them as antennas.

(should Superman be mentioned here, or metaphysics of
crystals, predecessor to electronics, original components
of nature, such that this is the foundation of the study, in
this way, so too amber and lodestone, known or unknown)


the key idea then is of tuning piezos, whereby the piezo
element is itself the antenna, and this could be explored
in various ways, etched onto the surface of an existing
sensor element, such as with PVDF film tabs, or made
into a cantilever such as a tuning fork vibrating at ~8 Hz
that outputs energy into a self via its perpetual motion,
and further, crystal oscillators tuned to this frequency
of the Schumann resonance, if capable of generating or
outputting electricity via alignment with this frequency,
tuned into it in terms of energy harvesting versus timing
for circuits or for receiving or transmitting radio waves.

note: again, this is non-electromagnetic vibration that
is accessed, so oscillators and piezos are functioning
in an undescribed realm at macroscale, though within
effects _known within music (as natural philosophy),
described by composer/filmmaker Helen Hall. [8]

the mythos involved includes a realm of the forbidden
and of the fringe activity of outlawed energy research,
access to 'free energy' that is believed to have earlier
been accessed on earth by its inhabitants yet since
disappeared within civilization, vanished along with
its cosmology (of the aether), the plenum seemingly,
edited out, removed from view via Michelson-Morley.

and yet the idea of limitless energy, locating it as if an
issue of dousing within the electromagnetic framework
with various strange machines and contraptions, those
seeking to tap into it, upon relating to and realizing its
mystery that surrounds, encompasses, defines and yet
cannot be tangibly defined in these same terms it exists
because the basic model and approach are off, and just
enough to send things in another direction, still unaware

in other words, there is potential energy all around, the
issues of dead cellphones after 5 hours moot should a
small cantilever antenna find geometrical alignment that
replaces its power source with one non-electromagnetic,
non-polluting, attuned to nature and mind, in harmony
and related to the larger order, not existing to destroy it.

how to tap into it, where is it. how do you get there if
electromagnetism is off-limits to investigation beyond
an ideology of a protective technological priesthood.
and then, how to imagine beyond electromagnetism
if concepts are not understanding of this condition
firstly, to realize what the encountered issues are,
so that reasoning is possible in a shared framework

the larger question, how to tap into the infinity that is
within the electromagnetic circuit, open up that seam
between zero and infinity, and use it to turn things at
higher speeds and momentums or with greater force,
limitless power of any magnitude, seemingly. this is
essentially to break out of relativity and back into a
non-warped model of nature, so anti-gravity and other
such issues are basic and easy to advance beyond,
though if living within lies of a false perspective this is
not possible. so the worldview has to be taken down
before any landspeeders are going to arrive in town
