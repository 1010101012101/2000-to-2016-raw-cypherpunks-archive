I think that's pretty specific about what they want, and broad about the
technology... "circumvention technologies".

If I were managing the project I'd be limiting improvements that would
allow such things and it wouldn't be secret or underhanded (which is why
I never aspired to that sort of position... my underhand toss is lousy),
but unless there's something in the full bill in addition to that, it
doesn't require deprecation of existing code in the product. Because
those things were already paid for and done. It does put the product at
a disadvantage against software meant to undo tor's security in the long
run however, and government excel at doing things that have their effect
in 'the long run'.

I think that's pretty specific and If I were managing the project I'd be
limiting improvements that would allow such things, but unless there's

    I think that's pretty specific and If I were managing the project
    I'd be limiting improvements that would allow such things, but
    unless there's something in the full bill in addition to that, it
    doesn't require deprecation of existing code in the product. Because
    those things were already paid for and done.<br>
