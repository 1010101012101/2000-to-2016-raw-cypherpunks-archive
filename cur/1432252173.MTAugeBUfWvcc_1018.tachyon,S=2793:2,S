     And you will, presumably, post the availability of same when done? I too
am readying a remailer, but am holding back until I can build a cdrom based
server, for one so I don't need to worry about hackers, for two so I don't
have to worry about logs. Also want to make that box a freenet and mojo
server. I'm running 2.9beta23 now, seems to work okay, but haven't
published the keys yet because of the above. And since they'd be changing
soon anyway.
