d-by-the-nsa/


In his Q&A to his keynote address at the World Hosting Days Global 2014=

conference in April, the world=E2=80=99s largest hosting and cloud even=
t, Julian
Assange discussed encryption technology in the context of hosting
systems. He discussed the cypherpunk credo of how encryption can level
the playing field between powerful governments and people, and about 20=

minutes into his address, he discussed how UNIX-like systems like Debia=
n
(which he mentioned by name) are engineered by nation-states with
backdoors which are easily introduced as =E2=80=98bugs=E2=80=99, and ho=
w the Linux
system depends on thousands of packages and libraries that may be
compromised.

I recommend watching his 36 minute Q&A in its entirety, keeping in mind=

my recent warnings about how GNU/Linux is almost entirely engineered by=

the government/military-affiliated Red Hat corporation.

The Voice of Russia website has an article on Assange=E2=80=99s address=
 with a
few quotes:

    =E2=80=9CTo a degree this is a matter of national sovereignty. The =
news is
all flush with talk about how Russia has annexed the Crimea, but the
reality is, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, principally the United=

States, have annexed the whole world as a result of annexing the
computer systems and communications technology that is used to run the
modern world,=E2=80=9D stated Julian Assange in his keynote address=E2=80=
=A6

Don=E2=80=99t just read the short article, listen to the address yourse=
lf,
because Assange goes into many areas, and the work being done in these
fields.

Assange mentions how Debian famously botched the SSL random number
generator for years (which was clearly sabotaged =E2=80=93 a known fact=
).
Speaking of botched security affecting Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo,=

SuSE, *BSD, and more, the nightmarish OpenSSL recently botched SSL agai=
n
(very serious =E2=80=93 updated comments on how a defense contractor in=
 Finland
outed the NSA here?) It=E2=80=99s very hard to believe this wasn=E2=80=99=
t deliberate,
as botching the memory space of private keys is about as completely
incompetent as you can get, as this area is ultra-critical to the whole=

system. As a result, many private keys, including of providers, were
potentially compromised, and much private info of service users. Be sur=
e
to update your systems as this bug is now public knowledge. (For more o=
n
how OpenSSL is a nightmare, and why this bug is one among many that wil=
l
never be found, listen to FreeBSD developer Poul-Heening Kamp=E2=80=99s=

excellent talk at the FOSDEM BSD conference.)

From=20the start, my revelations on this blog about Red Hat=E2=80=99s dee=
p control
of Linux, along with their large corporate/government connections,
hasn=E2=80=99t been just about spying, but about losing the distributed=

engineering quality of Linux, with Red Hat centralizing control. Yet as=

an ex-cypherpunk and crypto software developer, as soon as I started
using Linux years ago, I noted that all the major distributions used
watered-down encryption (to use stronger encryption in many areas, such=

as AES-loop, you needed to compile your own kernel and go to great
lengths to manually bypass barriers they put in place to the use of
genuinely strong encryption). This told me then that those who
controlled distributions were deeply in the pockets of intelligence
networks. So it comes as no surprise to me that they jumped on board
systemd when told to, despite the mock choice publicized to users =E2=80=
=93
there was never any option.

A computer, and especially hosting services (which often run Linux), ar=
e
powerful communication and broadcasting systems into today=E2=80=99s wo=
rld. If
you control and have unfettered access to such systems, you basically
control the world. As Assange notes in the talk, encryption is only as
strong as its endpoints. eg if you=E2=80=99re running a very secure pro=
tocol on
a system with a compromised OS, you=E2=80=99re owned.

As Assange observed:

    =E2=80=9CThe sharing of information, the communication of free peop=
les,
across history and across geography, is something that creates,
maintains, and disciplines laws [governments].=E2=80=9D
