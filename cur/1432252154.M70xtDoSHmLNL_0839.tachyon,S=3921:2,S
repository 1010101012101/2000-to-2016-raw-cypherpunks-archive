Sounds quite like a web access filtering problem.

Try a list of hashes of the IDs. Of course this would work only if the
bruteforcing of the index would be impractical; eg, it may somehow work
for longer email addresses, but probably won't work for phone numbers.

Good hash (MD5, SHA1, etc. - their other advantage is that their code is
out there and you don't have to write it) can't be reversed. However, they
can be bruteforced, if the input set isn't impractically big (eg, a set of
phone numbers from one area code is less than 10,000 possibilities, which
is trivial to take, calculate a hash for every one of them, and check if
the database contains it).

Yes. Hash is there / hash is not there.

I suppose so. Similar approach is used for accelerating searches in long
lists of data.

Maybe there is better approach, my crypto-fu isn't good enough yet to do
more than kibitzing.
