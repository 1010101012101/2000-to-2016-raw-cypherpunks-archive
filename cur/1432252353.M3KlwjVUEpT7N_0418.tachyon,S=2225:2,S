Class? Class??? [...] Thenk yew...


Since modern financial cryptography proves that one can either sell one's
electronic vote and be perfectly (okay, more or less perfectly) anonymous,
or not sell one's electronic vote and be perfectly identified, neither of
which is politically tenable, can anyone tell me a situation under which
the former is perfectly fine?

Hint: It's financial.

For extra credit, offer an actual political solution using the "financial"
answer above? Okay, not necessarily, political, more of a political
singularity.

Yes, this is an easy one for the older kids... Play nice.
