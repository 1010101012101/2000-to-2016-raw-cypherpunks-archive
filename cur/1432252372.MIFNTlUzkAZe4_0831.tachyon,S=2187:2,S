"He won because 53 percent of voters approved of his performance as
president. Fifty-eight percent of them trust Bush to fight terrorism. They
had roughly equal confidence in Bush and Kerry to handle the economy. Most
approved of the decision to go to war in Iraq. Most see it as part of the
war on terror."

In other words, he won because some hillbilly was afraid that the guy at the 
local 7-11 was going to blow up his chicked farm. Those of us living close 
enough to "Ground Zero" to smell it back in those days are apprarently less 
than convinced.

So: A 'moral values' question for Cypherpunks. Does this election indict the 
American people as being complicit in the crime known as "Operation 
Freedom"? (I notice everyone forgot about that name.)
