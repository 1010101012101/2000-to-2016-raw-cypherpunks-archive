I suppose if some of the more vocal cypherpunks subscribers were
to forward their messages to Mr. John B. Thompson, he might be
persuaded to denounce this list in a letter to Ashcroft too.

The usqueers.com page in question:
http://www.usqueers.com/commentary/die_soon.html

Excerpt:
>Ronald Reagan, ex-President, deserves to experience a horrible death soon, 
>and is getting what he deserves. We're listing him as wounded because the 
>way he is dying is horrible (Alzheimer's) and irreversible, even if he 
>isn't aware of it anymore, and not soon enough we will happily add him to 
>our Good Riddance! section.

Attorney John B. Thompson, who wrote the letter to DOJ, has a fascinating 
history of, for instance, reportedly attacking CBS over what he viewed as 
threats the network's comedy show made on the life of George W. Bush:
http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3992e0b40d02.htm

Thompson wrote a letter to FCC complaining about Howard Stern:
http://www.cluebot.com/articles/01/09/14/2010224.shtml
>a special tip-of-the-hat to [Thompson] who, in the face of the death of 
>thousands of Americans, has taken time out of his busy schedule to 
>petition the FCC to censor Howard Stern, whom he terms a 'child molestor' 
>and 'pornographer'. It's nice to know some people have their priorities 
>straight.

I'm not sure why CNSNews.com would call Thompson a "prominent First 
Amendment lawyer." He seems to be a prominent 1A lawyer in much the same 
way that Louis Freeh was a prominent privacy advocate.

In his email below, David Burt is talking about when the ACLU's Oregon 
affiliate (not the national ACLU) filed an amicus brief arguing that a 
federal judge close the Nuremberg anti-abortion site 
(http://www.politechbot.com/p-01860.html).

I'd like to hear what the Oregon branch of the ACLU thinks about this,

Attorney Calls on Justice Dept to Close Hate Site
By Lawrence Morahan
CNSNews.com Senior Staff Writer
November 26, 2001

(CNSNews.com) - A prominent First Amendment lawyer called on the U.S.
Justice Department to conduct an immediate investigation of an Internet
site that advocates "a horrible death by any means" for people who
oppose homosexual activism.

The web site, usqueers.com, is in violation of state and federal law for
advocating the murder of specific individuals, including former
President Ronald Reagan and Sen. Strom Thurmond, First Amendment
attorney John B. Thompson said.

"This is clearly left-wing domestic terrorism which Justice [Department
officials] and the FBI must move on immediately with a shut down of the
site and an arrest of B. Allen Ross, who operates the site from San
Diego," Thompson said in a Nov. 25 letter to Attorney General John
Ashcroft.

Former President Ronald Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) are among
those described as "het supremacists" by usQueers.com.
