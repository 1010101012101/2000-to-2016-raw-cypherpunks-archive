Bumashkas belong between the highest-caliber weapons of the 
bureaucracy-centered governments. You don't want to meet the adversary 
armed with them. They are deadly and should be banned.

should invoke the associations to Soviet-style bureaucracy, requiring a 
stamped permission for just about everything.)
