And if your neighbours are simply malignant? Since when did people need a

Yep. That would be my point. This sounds deceptively like holding someone at
a gunpoint. It has little to do with liberty.

Well, just debunk it. The point was, really, that even while I do have great
reservations about treating shunning and physical violence as equivalent, I
do not accept the notion of specific liberties being absolute, either.

Nor do I intend to. The point about shunning is simply about laying out some
of the well known problems of thorough libertarianism. I do not think such a
wide application of basic freedoms is automatically the best alternative.

There is no essential reason why those freedoms couldn't be defined in some
more limited form. It's not like these concepts are black and white.

Perhaps. Just as we force people not to do some things, like engage in
physical violence. If we give people full control over all aspects of their
association and on any conduct on their property, as you would probably
like, you will most likely end up with the same restrictions (or even more),
only this time enforced by way of lynch mobs.

Look at it this way: if for some reason the survival of each and every human
being is conditioned on some part of the population doing thing x, wouldn't
you say it is fair to demand that x be done even if the individuals would
not want to? It's not a huge leap from this to limiting such 'inalienable'
rights as the right to property.

Not really. I have no essential trouble giving certain parts of my freedoms
away if that gains me the actual possibility of applying the remaining
parts. And yes, this is the point where you cue in the talk about expanding
governments, Big Brothers and whatnot.

>"Oh, but if they'll just 'play nice' then everyone is free to do as

Free as in having certain freedoms, which in this case have been more
narrowly tailored. Besides, I've not quite committed to actually advocating
such a model, yet. I'm just asking questions.

If we, for some reason, have an (in)action, some damage and a strong proof
of causality, it is difficult to justify differential treatment based on
whether the damage comes from action or inaction. And as for *your own
property*, it simply isn't given that 1) all things can/should be privately
owned (scarce resources, like the radio spectrum, are a classical
example) or 2) owning certain things or using them in certain ways shouldn't
perhaps come with extra obligations (like using RF communication with extra
responsibilities to minimize interference).

Some of the above, perhaps. If people are indeed dependent on shopping for
their survival, I do think their right to live sort of preempts the shop
owner's property rights.

Those are particulars of the social contract in effect in the corresponding
society. They need not be universal.

That is an extremely good question. In fact a central one to liberal theory.
I most certainly do not have an answer.

So, essentially, if somebody can oppress others, why not? Especially if
there's profit or fun to it? Again this has little to do with liberty as I
understand the concept.

But even when you're *real* nice to them, they still have the incentive to
exploit you. If you go this way, all the nice talk about liberties and
freedom don't matter squat. Could you explain how this differs from fascism?

They got limited. That is what happens when you live in a society. Whoever 
said life is fair?
