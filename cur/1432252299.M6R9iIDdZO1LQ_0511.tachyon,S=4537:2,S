I was brought up not to gossip. *batty eyelashes*

I was also taught not to turn over rocks.

Good point, I was just gigging you, Reese. Lighten up. :)

Show me proof that you don't have a brain, and that you shall never use it.
That might keep you out of trouble.

I wouldn't know about that.

I wouldn't know about that.

Why then, the subterfuge regarding the identities? Why not be
straightforward about it to begin with?
