Both ns1.secure.net and ns2.secure.net are returning SERVFAIL for A
record queries for cryptome.org. That almost certainly indicates a
misconfiguration on those two machines. John, you may want to start
harassing your new provider to fix this.

Alternatively, it could be that those two servers are not the correct
ones for cryptome.org; then getting a SERVFAIL would make some sense.
