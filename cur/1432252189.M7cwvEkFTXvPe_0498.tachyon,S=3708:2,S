Movie theaters prevent me from watching movies I want to see by 
censoriously not showing them, frequently as a result of critics' or 
reviewers' comments about those movies and their quality or subject or 
genre. Those bastards!

And the video store near my house doesn't have all of the DVDs I want to 
buy, either. Don't they know about the First Amendment? And some of the 
ones that I want are too expensive. Help! I'm being censored! Will you buy 
them for me, Jim?

I am beginning to suspect that perhaps the newspaper is deliberately not 
printing all of the news . . .
