I would actually like to make a smaller point here. Broadly I 
agree with BU, but I'd like to analyze it a little.

If software actually cost money per every unit produced, products 
liability would make more sense because then it could become "part 
of" the production costs.

However, given that copying bits is in fact free (copyright issues 
aside), adding a real per-unit expense has the potential to 
*dominate* the production cost.  Open-source software would become 
impossible to produce, because the whole open-source paradigm 
depends on copying bits being free.

I think MS would like nothing better than having products liability 
attached to software in general; it would solve a massive problem 
for them by putting open-source stuff out of production.  Even though 
the open-source stuff is better from a security standpoint, there 
is effectively no one who is making enough money from it to bear 
the costs of product liability. 

Some security consultants *do* bear the cost of product liability 
on software they install and configure; they are paid obscene amounts 
of money to take that risk and do the solid configurations that 
minimize it, and that is as should be.  The effect of product 
liability on the industry as a whole would be to remove the only 
secure products available (open-source products), making it 
effectively impossible for security consultants to do their jobs.
