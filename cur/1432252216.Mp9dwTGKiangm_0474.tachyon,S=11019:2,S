(Szasz is right, but this is SO much fun... :D ~F.)

"Constant criticism, nit-picking, no empathy, control freak, charm, devious,
manipulative, intimidating? Read this..."

The serial bully

Identifying the psychopath or sociopath in our midst including the socialised
psychopathic manager.

"All cruelty springs from weakness."
(Seneca, 4BC-AD65)

"The truth is incontrovertible; malice may attack it, ignorance my deride it,
but in the end, there it is." Winston Churchill

"Most organisations have a serial bully. It never ceases to amaze me how one
person's divisive, disordered, dysfunctional behaviour can permeate the entire
organisation like a cancer." (Tim Field)

I estimate one person in thirty, male or female, is a serial bully. Who does
the following profile describe in your life?

The serial bully:

is a convincing, practised liar and when called to account, will make up
anything spontaneously to fit their needs at that moment

has a Jekyll and Hyde nature-- is vile, vicious and vindictive in private, but
innocent and charming in front of witnesses; no-one can (or wants to) believe
this individual has a vindictive nature-- only the current target of the serial
bully's aggression sees both sides; whilst the Jekyll side is described
as "charming" and convincing enough to deceive personnel, management and a
tribunal, the Hyde side is frequently described as "evil"; Hyde is the real
person, Jekyll is an act

excels at deception and should never be underestimated in their capacity to
deceive

uses excessive charm and is always plausible and convincing when peers,
superiors or others are present (charm can be used to deceive as well as to
cover for lack of empathy)

is glib, shallow and superficial with plenty of fine words and lots of form--
but there's no substance

is possessed of an exceptional verbal facility and will outmanoeuvre most
people in verbal interaction, especially at times of conflict

is often described as smooth, slippery, slimy, ingratiating, fawning, toadying,
obsequious, sycophantic

relies on mimicry, repetition and regurgitation to convince others that he or
she is both a "normal" human being and a tough dynamic manager, as in extolling
the virtues of the latest management fads and pouring forth the accompanying
jargon

is unusually skilled in being able to anticipate what people want to hear and
then saying it plausibly

cannot be trusted or relied upon

fails to fulfil commitments

shows an arrested level of emotional development; whilst language and intellect
may appear to be that of an adult, the bully displays the emotional age of a
five-year-old

is emotionally immature and emotionally untrustworthy

exhibits unusual and inappropriate attitudes to sexual matters, sexual
behaviour and bodily functions; underneath the charming exterior there are
often suspicions or hints of sex discrimination and sexual harassment, perhaps
also sexual dysfunction, sexual inadequacy, sexual violence or sexual abuse
in a relationship, is incapable of initiating or sustaining intimacy

holds deep prejudices (eg against the opposite gender, people of a different
sexual orientation, other cultures and religious beliefs, foreigners, etc--
prejudiced people are unvaryingly unimaginative) but goes to great lengths to
keep this prejudicial aspect of their personality secret

is self-opinionated and displays arrogance, audacity, a superior sense of
entitlement and sense of invulnerability and untouchability

has a deep-seated contempt of clients in contrast to his or her professed
compassion

is a control freak and has a compulsive need to control everyone and everything
you say, do, think and believe; for example, will launch an immediate personal
attack attempting to restrict what you are permitted to say if you start
talking knowledgeably about psychopathic personality or antisocial personality
disorder in their presence-- but aggressively maintains the right to talk
(usually unknowledgeably) about anything they choose; serial bullies despise
anyone who enables others to see through their deception and their mask of
sanity

displays a compulsive need to criticise whilst simultaneously refusing to
value, praise and acknowledge others, their achievements, or their existence
shows a lack of joined-up thinking with conversation that doesn't flow and

arguments that don't hold water

flits from topic to topic so that you come away feeling you've never had a
proper conversation

refuses to be specific and never gives a straight answer

is evasive and has a Houdini-like ability to escape accountability

undermines and destroys anyone who the bully perceives to be an adversary, a
potential threat, or who can see through the bully's mask

is adept at creating conflict between those who would otherwise collate
incriminating information about them

is quick to discredit and neutralise anyone who can talk knowledgeably about
antisocial or sociopathic behaviours

is also quick to belittle, undermine, denigrate and discredit anyone who calls,
attempts to call, or might call the bully to account

is highly manipulative, especially of people's perceptions and emotions (eg
guilt)

when called upon to share or address the needs and concerns of others, responds
with impatience, irritability and aggression

often has an overwhelming, unhealthy and narcissistic attention-seeking need to
portray themselves as a wonderful, kind, caring and compassionate person, in
contrast to their behaviour and treatment of others; the bully sees nothing
wrong with their behaviour and chooses to remain oblivious to the discrepancy
between how they like to be seen and how they are seen by others

is mean-spirited, officious, and often unbelievably petty

is greedy, selfish, and a parasite

is always a taker and never a giver

is convinced of their superiority and has an overbearing belief in their
qualities of leadership but cannot distinguish between leadership (maturity,
decisiveness, assertiveness, co-operation, trust, integrity) and bullying
(immaturity, impulsiveness, aggression, manipulation, distrust, deceitfulness)

often fraudulently claims qualifications, experience, titles, entitlements or
affiliations which are ambiguous, misleading, or bogus

often misses the semantic meaning of language, misinterprets what is said,
sometimes wrongly thinking that comments of a satirical, ironic or general
negative nature apply to him or herself

is constantly imposing on others a false reality made up of distortion and
fabrication

sometimes displays a seemingly limitless demonic energy especially when engaged
in attention-seeking activities or evasion of accountability and is often a
committeeaholic or apparent workaholic

Responsibility

The serial bully appears to lack insight into his or her behaviour and seems to
be oblivious to the crassness and inappropriateness thereof; however, it is
more likely that the bully knows what they are doing but elects to switch off
the moral and ethical considerations by which normal people are bound. If the
bully knows what they are doing, they are responsible for their behaviour and
thus liable for its consequences to other people. If the bully doesn't know
what they are doing, they should be suspended from duty on the grounds of
diminished responsibility and the provisions of the Mental Health Act should
apply.

The serial bully exhibits behaviours congruent with the diagnostic criteria for

Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)

The serial bully exhibits behaviours congruent with the diagnostic criteria for
