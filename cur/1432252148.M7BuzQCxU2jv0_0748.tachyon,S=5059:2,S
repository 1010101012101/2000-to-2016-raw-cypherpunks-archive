How dare you?
...and don't get me started on guns.

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), long a defender of 
human rights, is in an historic battle with the Pacific Maritime 
Association (PMA). The PMA bosses are trying to slash hard won health 
benefits and break the union. [...]

In au,since the defeat of a union(MUA) in a major struggle,'ships of shame' 
have been running into our priceless coasts and reefs.Its only a matter of 
time before we have an exxon valdisaster downunder.The whole worlds losing.
I'm going DD'ing.
