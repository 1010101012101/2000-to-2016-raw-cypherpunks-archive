  The strongest networks will be those in which the organizational design 
is sustained by a winning story and a well-defined doctrine, and in which 
all this is layered atop advanced communications systems and rests on 
strong personal and social ties at the base. Each level, and the overall 
design, may benefit from redundancy and diversity. Each level's 
characteristics are likely to affect those of the other levels.
These are not idle academic issues. Getting a network form "right" - like 
getting a hierarchical or market form "right" - can be a delicate 
enterprise. For practitioners trying to organize a new network or adjust 
one that already exists, various options may merit consideration - and 
their assessment should assure that all the organizational, narrative, 
doctrinal, technological, and social levels are well-designed and integrated.
This applies to netwar and counternetwar actors across the spectrum. 
However, our discussion emphasizes evidence from social netwar actors, 
mainly activist NGOs, because they have been more open and expressive than 
have terrorist, criminal, and other violent, secretive actors. The 
discussion draws on some of the cases presented in our new book, but also 
affords an opportunity to bring in other recent examples.
Each of these levels of analysis deserves more elaboration than we give 
here. Our goals are to get people to think in these terms and point the 
way, even though we cannot pretend to offer final methodological guidance.
