"Target"? Anyone who is strong-willed and has a provocative writing style 
is going to get flamed here, period. If a person didn't enjoy the back-and-
forth, they probably would have left a long time ago. 

It's the Tom-Turkey-and-a-bunch-of-Jakes phenomenon.

Why give it any significance, then? Who cares, if it's just an anonymous 
pot shot? If people didn't endow it with credibility, it wouldn't have any 
impact at all. You turn your own imagination into your worst enemy. Don't 
be so gullible. 


9. Anybody have any good defenses against this attack.

Yeah, a top-secret SCI weapon known as "a filter file". 

More seriously, learn not to lose your head over unattributed insults and 
accusations. Whenever you find yourself tempted to reply to a "you poopy 
head" thread in kind, don't. Give it up, move on to something more 
rewarding. If every tiny little insult is enough to work you into a red hot 
lather, before you know it, the more cold-blooded are going to have you 
dancing like a galvanic frog. Which would you rather be? The choice is just 
a mouse click away. 

And if you're wasting your time bickering over nonsense, you have only 
yourself to blame.
