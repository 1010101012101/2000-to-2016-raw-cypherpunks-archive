A GA (general aviation) pilot friend has been bitching endlessly about
various FAA regulation restrictions imposed in the wake of 9/11.  I've
suggested a reality check.  rec.aviation.piloting makes for some
interesting reading, not without a few blowhards (not that we'd know
what these are).

http://www.aopa.org/ tracks NOTAMs (notices to airmen).  Among the first
restrictions imposed, and still somewhat in force, are restrictions on
agricultural flights.   These are far less organized than might be
expected, and citations by those unfamiliar with the NOTAM format are
hard to come by.

However, the page currently lists the following NOTAM:

    FAA bans Part 137 agricultural operations
    09/23/01 4:39:10 PM, ET - FAA banned Part 137 agricultural
    ("cropduster") operations [link] once again on Sunday. The ban
    includes all aircraft "capable or equipped for agricultural
    operations," whether they are flying under Part 137 or any other FAR
    (for example, Part 91). The ban remains in effect until 12:05 a.m.
    local time Sept. 24.  AOPA again reminds pilots that they must check
    all notams immediately prior to starting any flight.

The link points to:

    http://38.200.9.137/010915tfr.html#0398

    !FDC 1/0398 FDC ATTENTION ALL OPERATORS - SPECIAL NOTICE. EFFECTIVE
    IMMEDIATELY UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. PURSUANT TO 14 CFR 91.139
    (EMERGENCY AIR TRAFFIC RULES), FOR REASONS OF NATIONAL SECURITY ALL
    PAR 137 (AGRICULTUREAL/CROPDUSTER) OPERATIONS ARE PROHIBITED ON
    SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 23,2001, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND UNTIL 12:05 A.M.
    LOCAL SEPTEMBER 24,2001, IN EACH TIME ZONE. IN ADDITION, NO AIRCRAFT
    CAPABLE OF OR EQUIPPED FOR AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS MAY OPERATE UNDER
    ANY OTHER F.A.R.  PART CERTIFICATION DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. THE ONLY
    EXCEPTION IS FOR PART 137 FIRE FIGHTING TANKERS FLYING UNDER PUBLIC
    USE AND EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION FOR FIRE FIGHTING PURPOSES. THIS
    NOTAM APPLIES TO THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES IN U.S.DOMESTIC AIRSPACE.=20

(Yes, the FAA, in its infinite wisdom, uses highly unreadable AOL CAPS
TO ANNOUNCE CRITICAL MESSAGES).

I've also heard rumors that cropdusters are being told to *disable*
their aircraft or equipment, though I cannot substantiate this.

Peace.
