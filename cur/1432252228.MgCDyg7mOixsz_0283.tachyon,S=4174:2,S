Unfortunately the situation is more multi-variant than a simple two-axis
graph...

There needs to be at least a time axis added as well as splitting out the
'cost of transaction' from the 'cost of anonmymity'. By combining the two
a whole zoo of behaviours are ignored. Your graph, and any point from it,
isn't worth looking at in anything less thana 5-axis phase space.
