In the past year considerable resources were affected to increase the
ease of use and to resolve compatibility issues with Freedom. Improvements
in the interoperability area, improvements in the qa testing area, and
alot of refactoring has greatly improved the overall quality. So yes, it
has improved alot. Any 2.0 installation woes during Beta were far and few
between.
