I encourage everyone reading this, regardless of where you live, to
contact California
Assemblyman David Chiu
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chiu_(politician)>.  Chiu is a the
California state legislator for the district including San Francisco.  He
is a mainstream elitist/financialist Democrat, but historically he has been
close to the Silicon Valley tech community.

When you call Chiu's office, explain the Murdock case if the staffer you
speak with is not familiar.  Politely mention that the SFPD is widely known
to be corrupt.    Then ask that the Assemblyman work to have the incident
investigated *by an independent investigator from outside the San Francisco
Police Department*.  A state assemblymember does not have direct legal
authority to appoint an investigator - but for sure, if an elected
legislator speaks out, many people will listen.

Assemblyman Chiu's office phone number is (916) 319-2017.  You can also
contact him electronically thru his official website
<http://asmdc.org/members/a17/>.

Some members of this list may criticize this suggestion as naively
optimistic.  Maybe it is; but I guess I haven't completely given up all
hope for our "democratic" political institutions.  Anarchists will call
that foolish; the rest will, I hope, call Assemblyman Chiu's office.
