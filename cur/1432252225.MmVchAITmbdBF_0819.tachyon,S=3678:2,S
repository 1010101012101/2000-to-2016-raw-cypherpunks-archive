Subject: blooberging singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was, or had been, a party to the appointment 
of Mdm Ho Ching as Executive Director of Temasek, not on merit, but in 
order to indulge the interests of the Lee family, or for some other corrupt 
motive relating to the promotion of the Lee family's interests, and in so 
doing had failed to discharge his duties as Prime Minister and / or to act 
in the best interests of Singapore.
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had 
procured the appointment of Mdm Ho Ching and were therefore guilty of 
nepotism.http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/apology.html
