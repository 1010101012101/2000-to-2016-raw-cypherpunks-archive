Tom Clancy did a good job of describing how to make a low-yield nuke in 
one of his novels, the one about a nuke in the Denver stadium. (I think 
it was "The Sum of All Fears.") It's been many years since I read it, 
but my recollection is that one of  the actors gets sick.

As Eric C. pointed out in his follow-up to your article, this business 
of "staying alive" is probably the easiest of the problems to solve. The 
biggest hazard is from ingestion of the materials, either from some 
grinding or machining stage, or liquid compounds (molding the 
fissionables).

(The "apron" you mention at some point is almost totally beside the 
point. Working in a good fume hood or laminar flow hood would be a 
better safety precaution. Wearing a moonsuit and gloves would be extra 
protection. Not eating sandwiches or Doritos while mixing the stuff also 
helps.)

Why so complicated on the detonation geometry? Without doing some 
experiments and getting the fast ignition triggers (on the real 
munitions list), I'd doubt strongly that your scheme would work the 
first time.

And gunpowder is almost guaranteed to not work.

It's really _not_ this easy. It took China and India a while before they 
successfully tested an A-bomb (many years after they had the raw 
materials from their reactor programs). It may have taken the South 
Africans and Israelis a few years after getting materials, too. So, why 
didn't they just hammer U-235 into stainless steel mixing bowls and do 
it the way "anyone on this planet can build a nuclear device," one 
wonders.

I'd guess that the "tall pipe" version is the most buildable of the 
basement nukes. (In a nutshell: a tall drainpipe, perhaps 40 feet tall. 
Set up in an apartment building, warehouse, etc. At the base the pipe is 
reinforced with copious amounts of concrete. The subcritical masses are 
at opposite ends of the pipe. The mass on top is piled on with several 
hundred pounds of ballast, to "tamp" the early critical mass action. To 
explode the bomb, drop the mass from the top of the pipe. The critical 
mass is briefly contained by the concrete collar around the pipe and the 
inertial mass above. Is it enough to produce a real chain reaction? 
Well, it's all relative. Still, not very efficient.)
