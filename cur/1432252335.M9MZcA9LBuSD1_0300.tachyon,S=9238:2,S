Yes and no, precision of language can be greater and smaller. It's much
overlooked. I find especially computer-related law lacks precision. I also
find that precise law is essential, lest it is not law at all. We also see
that the "intention of the lawmaker" is an important factor.
Finally, we even see laws that depend upon interpretation yet to be given
by judges that may oppose directly. Often we see "fundamental law", eg
human rights, opposing more readily changed law. And the readily changed
law wins easily if polticians interpreted laws in ways that make it simple.

Ah, but that wasn't the question. A judge must always give precedence to
constitutional laws. How could a judge explain the second amendment such
that machine guns could be illegal?

I suspect that ruling should be exceedingly controversial and dangerous.
