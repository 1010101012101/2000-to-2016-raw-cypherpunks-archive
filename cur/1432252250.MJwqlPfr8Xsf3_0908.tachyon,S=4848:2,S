Superb flame. Of course, from the point of view of 'external' viewers, a
great many
of the subscribers on cypherpunks appear to exibit PAPD with respect to
their
attitudes towards government authority. Jim is unusual in that his
resentment is
also directed towards the consensus position on how people should behave on 
the list (the closest thing to a 'authority' which exists in cypherpunks).
