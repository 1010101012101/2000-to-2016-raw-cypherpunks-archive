The recent advances in law enforcement made by a frightened ( for their
asses and their careers ) Congress are not phantoms of lost liberty :
substantial changes have been made. Ashcroft expresses his opinion that
questioning the civil liberties implications of those policy changes is
an attempt to "erode our national unity and diminish our resolve" as if
it is a truth. He mischaracterizes the goals of his critics so that he
can associate them with an extremely unpopular position. The technique
being employed by John Ashcroft is to fallaciously polarize the
discussion as one of Patriotism vs. Treason, Good vs. Evil with the
intent of suppressing the speech of anyone who might be an impediment to

his agenda. Ashcroft's approach smacks of the techniques used by the
late and not-at-all-great may he rest screaming forever in flames
Senator Joseph McCarthy. That is Ashcroft's rhetorical trick.

Nomen's trick is to mischaracterize what people object to in what
Ashcroft has said. I don't for a minute think that there is, today at
least, even a veiled threat that those who openly criticize Bush and
Ashcroft are likely to be accused of treason. Nomen has set up an easily

torched strawman which he uses to say see, Ashcroft's critics are
clearly wrong, so they're probably wrong about the administration.

I'm not buying Ashcroft's tricks or Nomen's. I'll stick with the simple
interpretation of the motivations and goals of those who question the
actions of the Bush administration : some people see those actions of
the Bush administration and John Ashcroft as Constitutionally
questionable and their goal is to debate the issues and protect, in so
far as it is possible given the state of the populace, everyone's
liberties from enemies both foreign and domestic. Unity and resolve
don't enter into it.

Sometimes I think that people feel that because shameful or horrific
events in our history happened so very long ago and we seem to have
survived them that we must have some type of increasing immunity
conferred upon us by the passing of time. I'm afraid that quite the
opposite is true, that our immunity diminishes with time leaving us open

to reinfection by the ideological descendents of the perpetrators of
earlier outrages.

Can an Attorney General be censured? Drawn and quartered?
