Sweet syphillitic Jeebus!  I have *got* to stop glossing over the stuff 
in comp.encryption.general.  I saw a bunch of items on this go by, but 
didn't see the MLAT mentioned in the headlines.  (maybe RSS isn't all 
that great?)

Note that the MLAT is actually between the US and Canada, and 
according to 
http://travel.state.gov/law/info/judicial/judicial_690.html, it's been 
in effect since Jan. 24, 1990.  So while Hushmail is pwned, it's pwned 
by Canada, which is in turn pwned by the US.  But then, a difference 
which makes no difference isn't really a difference.  I'm just glad I 
never used/trusted Hush.
