Upon re-reading the paragraph I wrote, I can see how the text might have
been ambiguous. I was trying to express that there was a cost constraint
on the part. Adding the cost of an EMBASSY or SEE environment to the
purchase of every new PC is more than the market for bare-bones or even
mid-range PC's will bear.
