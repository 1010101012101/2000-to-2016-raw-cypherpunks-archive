Anyone got any information good ways to set up filters for this list, =
setting up a filter on the from address is giving me a huge list of =
addresses to block and I am constantly having to add addresses to it. =
There has to be a more effiecent way of doing it. This is the only list =
I am subscribed to that i get spammed on.

Any ideas

Cheers

Stuart
