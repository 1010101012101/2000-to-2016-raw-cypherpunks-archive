No need to use something so targeted at the cop camera, just install 
rear-facing infrared floods and keep them on all the time.  (Cadillac 
drivers with the new night-driving, IR, heads-up displays will be 
particularly upset..) The IR cut-off filters of most cameras are too broad 
to block invisible near IR, so the floods will cause the AGC to greatly 
darken the image as described above.
