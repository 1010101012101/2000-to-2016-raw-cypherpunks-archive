Places without infrastructure doesn't mean places without
mobile access. The mobile phone is the de facto computer
in most of Africa and Asia. Some poor villages have only
one phone (with multiuser OS) they paid for.

It's pretty obvious that the mobile phone will become
a payment system shortly, also in the developed world.
Notice that a mobile phone with NFC or accelerometer 
bumping or audio modem or even Bluetooth would allow
local transactions, including Bitcoin clients.
