[decades ago when a gradeschooler went on a museum tour of Glensheen
Mansion, located in Duluth, Minnesota. what amazed me was at that age was
the level of luxury achieved by the extremely wealthy, in comparison to
ordinary people. this was captured in a magnificent shower that had twenty
shower heads and body jets, in 1908 (potentially involving gold). this is
context for a recent 'typological' discovery when on Amazon, where these
kinds of shower arrays are now being sold as normal fixtures (example url
follows)...

810472011

Glensheen Historic Estate
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glensheen_Historic_Estate

what i think is interesting about this is how over time these values or
luxuries even, migrate towards the larger population, once-middleclass, and
that a level of opulence exists where ordinary people live like kings and
queens via these vary many details of conventional life. in that, you do
not need to be a baron to have 10 showerheads if that is a significant
priority yet it may be one of many and eventually establish itself as a new
standard for bathroom fixtures and so it can be tied to how it is valued,
its use, is it really better than a simpler solution. and under this is an
unrecognized issue of infrastructure, water ecosystems, regulatory
policies, water quality, and water conservation that cannot be disconnected
from the artifact as idea.  so too computers with powerplants and pollution
and energy wars, and so on.

it just surprised me to see this on Amazon after several decades, and
remembering how amazing that shower was of a wealthy person from
yesteryear, and now an approximation of that technology exists as another
choice for shoppers, more than a century later. and how it seemed to
indicate various parallels, yet how underlying factors may also not be
dealt with at the same time something appears as if progress when removed,
isolated from its context. in other words, perhaps it is like an electric
razor that had efficiency to replace a safety razor, yet today they are
sold with chemicals that need to be repurchased again and again to keep it
working (auto-cleaning cartridges) and thus a secondary 'blades'
requirement, more and more to keep the thing working, and it involves
additional effort to _manage the device. thus, what of televisions from CRT
to digital and increased bureaucracy or other technical issues related to
computers, making them less efficient or effective as tools, or more
involving time and energy to manage or configure settings. and thus, what
if there is hard water and not only one nozzle gets blocked, but eight, and
all need to be cleaned or replaced, etc. perhaps that is the essence of
friction-free purchasing without connectivity to other ecosystem issues. it
can be excluded from the analysis, the innovation occurring in some ways,
efficiency, while in others it may be a loss of function or additional
routine that is more trouble than its worth. so too, technology in general,
additional settings, versus artifacts and tools that actually work as they
are designed to and are exceptionally well functioning, removed of errors,
etc. who knows if the 'advanced options' of the shower panel are worth the
investment, though the question may be- do you need to be rich to keep up
with the eventual upkeep expenses, if not troubleshooting and maintenance.]

Study reveals potential breakthrough in hearing technology
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-reveals-potential-breakthrough-technology.html

[quote]  "That means that hearing-impaired people who had the benefit of
this algorithm could hear better than students with no hearing loss," Healy
said.  [unquote]

(note: once read a remarkable statistic now forgotten regarding the
projected need for hearing aids in young adults due to mp3 players and
personal audio electronics, perhaps to include cellphones even, that was
resulting in hearing loss issues on a massive scale. in other words,
hearing aids are the future for entire generations, due to noise &
listening to loud music whether on headphones or at concerts with huge loud
amps, etc. guess when the musicians playing are themselves dealing with
hearing loss it might be considered a side-effect of the approach to
musical production even. though perhaps everything, TV, phone, traffic,
(now cannot even take a walk without having someone alone who is talking
out loud to themselves, only to realize they are using a cellphone involved
in a remote conversation. combine this with those who view screens while
walking outside, and a form of willful blindness and deafness appears to
exist as people move in private bubbles of reality).

http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20014372-10391704.html

(note: this is an example of the statistics though what i remember included
examination of multiple generations, all having increased and severely
premature hearing loss specifically due to electronics and the noisy
environment, where nerve cells for hearing are being killed off via
sound-based activities; the irony that music 'listening' leads to loss of
hearing, etc.)

Researchers Turn an Ordinary Canon 5D Into a Hyperspectral Camera
http://petapixel.com/2011/12/19/researchers-turn-an-ordinary-canon-5d-into-=
a-hyperspectral-camera/

note: this last issue has potential relevance to solar astronomy, because
solar telescopes today using h-alpha filters (such as Coronado Solarscopes)
need to be tuned to one area of the sun, its surface or its edges, which
results in other regions becoming less focused. my question for this has
been if a holographic chamber could be made that can focus in multiple
'tuned regions' simultaneously and then merge them optically in a single
image that then is the basis for capturing images of the sun and its
activity. should be possible though a double focusing mechanism or another
approach with mirrors is likely required to allow for it.

across the electromagnetic spectrum. These 'fingerprints' are known as
spectral signatures and enable identification of the materials that make up

A Neuroscientist=E2=80=99s Radical Theory of How Networks Become Conscious
http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/11/christof-koch-panpsychism-conscio=

[note: i had a computational model for achieving this through parallelism
of matched patterns, local-global computing to function beyond the capacity
of the human brain, all 'transistors' interconnected structurally, via
looping N-value logical evaluation into shared scaffolding that exists as
an ecological computation; concept of crystal ball computing.]

[note also: permeability of surveillance within todays bounded, finite PCs
could indicate a type of emergent consciousness that is surveillance, as
collective awareness or tending toward super- or supra-organism, yet again
bounded, constrained to few parameters vs. unleashing potential
interconnections, allowing that to govern, thus keeping it contained and
under control, to keep things in the existing paradigm, manageable by a
given ideology etc]

iPad Mini displays fewer colors than does iPad Air, says report

s-than-does-ipad-air-says-report/

[to me there is something 'meta' about this that translates into a larger
framework. perhaps at its most abstract, how tools themselves are bounded
by the ideas held inside of them, and thus more and more speed of
processing may still be rely upon a particular limiting approach, even
while appearing as if an upgrade or greater functionality. so what if the
fundamentals are off or something is constrained. and how much of planned
obsolescence in manufacturing is based on similar techniques, if locked
CPUs or software or non-innovating product categories that could likely
include most everything electronic, if sustaining false or warped ideology]

the bigger idea involved venn logic and various balloon colors as a way to
visualize a model of consciousness i was exploring via 'balloon octopii' to
translate ideas of pseudo-truth and of various limits (and processing of
concepts as molecules) and parameters. here are some of the octopus images.
i wanted to make a 'brain' of multiple colored balloons for each octopus,
having different venn color compositions, and then photograph them together
under the same color light, as if ~resonance of /shared patterning/ to
model this relation via thinking.

Platonic forms, ideas as molecules, tuned into as consciousness
https://www.dropbox.com/s/by6ix6rvgnfllj2/ballooning%20ex23.jpg


so here was the larger idea... looking at balloons (translucent, opaque,
and transparent) as set combinations that have various color-based
permutations based on their configuration. that this could be explored, the
videos here only tests, first steps never developed further.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/81qdyvffejtuht3/P5020013.AVI


two things to note: as mentioned, the venn issue and set theory, and
ultimately experiments for balloon-in-balloon experiments (red balloon
_nested inside blue balloon, then illuminate with various color sequences)
as this relates to balloon-by-balloon dynamics (overlapping of colors, even
picking up of colors by transparent balloons or tinge or color-casting).
 -and- also, the molecular aspect as if electron-tunnel microscopy or some
other device looking at atomic formations at some level of abstraction. so
the balloons were also going to be explored for these molecular forms (none
of that in these images, though it is a natural attribute of latex balloons
(tap the maple tree -> maple syrup, tap the rubber tree --> latex for
balloons).

se solar telescopes today using h-alpha filters (such as Coronado Solarscop=
es) need to be tuned to one area of the sun, its surface or its edges, whic=
h results in other regions becoming less focused. my question for this has =
been if a holographic chamber could be made that can focus in multiple &#39=
;tuned regions&#39; simultaneously and then merge them optically in a singl=
e image that then is the basis for capturing images of the sun and its acti=
vity. should be possible though a double focusing mechanism or another appr=
oach with mirrors is likely required to allow for it.<br>
