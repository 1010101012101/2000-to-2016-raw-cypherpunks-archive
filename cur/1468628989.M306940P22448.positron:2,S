Psychopaths are opportunist guys, able of really disgusting acts  -
supporting other psychopaths, like Donald Trump, for example -  just for
having benefits.

Exactly what Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un did few months ago, do you
remember?  If not, search about.

You should search about KGB methods of torture and about Russian LGBTQ
rights too, please.  Putin has much more in common with Trump and CIA than
you would like to know.

Oh, and when it is convenient, Putin really appreciate USA a lot!!!  :D

Psychopaths never are very coherent, because they care only about their own
interests, not about real values and honor.

Please, consider using the "Put In panties" all the times when making PR
for Putin.  The Russian government will appreciate your cute act of
tenderness and the propaganda will be more effective, really unforgettable
for everybody.

At least, we will laugh several times in a week and all this stupid Russian
propaganda finally will be useful...  All governments and politicians are
really disgusting, ugh!!!  (>_<)*
