I don't think you have a choice. The state is supposed to provide you the
MINIMAL amount of legal protection as described in the C & BoR.

The point isn't to play procedural games.

A lawyer is supposed to pass a bar exam which 'certifies' them as
competent to practice law. Now if your lawyer happens to be ignorant of
the relevant laws you might be able to get them changed because in that
case it would be clear they could not 'assist' you with your defence.
