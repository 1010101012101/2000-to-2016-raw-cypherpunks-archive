Employ a GPS jammer. Most U.S. jets, bombs and ships use the satellites for 
navigation and timing.
The squadron built one jammer small enough to fit in a cigarette pack. It 
had a weak signal and would have to be close to the antennae to work.
Another jammer, about 15 feet tall, could interrupt the signal from farther 
away.
It was relatively easy to build. The airmen bought the plans online for 
$35. The amplifier came from an electronics store, the generator from a 
ham-radio operators convention. The rest - PVC pipe, copper tubing, wood 
supports and hardware - came from a home improvement store. The total cost 
was less than $9,000.
"This is not something cosmic," said Lt. Col. Rad Widman, who until 
recently commanded the squadron.
GPS jamming usually can be defeated by changing a channel frequency, but 
operators must realize they are being jammed, Widman said.
