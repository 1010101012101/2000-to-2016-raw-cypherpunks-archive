Don't overlook what is reportedly happening on the back side of 
the moon. The URL for an IF-mooncam was posted here a while
ago. The stream is encrypted but with weak crypto -- the 
crypto-processor is 1968-9 vintage. The cam is part of a data
package placed on the dark side in a classified operation. Signals
bounced off a reflector stationed at the very edge of the moon's 
profile.

What else is being done there remains to be disclosed.

Didn't somebody mention also mention here that there's a group 
which intercepts the stream?

I believe the Smithsonian has an archive of the small amount of 
public material, and NARA has some of the classified stuff needing
clearance for access.
