Ah, yes. There are many -- dozens, perhaps hundreds -- of well-known,
published nuclear engineers with practical experience in designing,
engineering, and constructing atomic weapons posting on
cypherpunks. I'm sure those folks in the audience will be delighted to
answer your questions at greath length.
