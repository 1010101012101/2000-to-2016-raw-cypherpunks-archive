Can we please get out of the regional fixation? The cypherpunks list isn't
about the US, US pissant wars, and similiar boring backwater shit.

It's too bad this list is dying a death of a thousand paper cuts inflicted by
moronic posts, as so many others had. I haven't used a
.procmailrc in a couple years, perhaps we can postpone this with a little
collective effort.
