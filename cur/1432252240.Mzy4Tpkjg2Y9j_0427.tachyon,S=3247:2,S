The limitation to international terrorism in existing law is an impediment 
to the effective use of national security letters because it may not be 
apparent in the early stages of a terrorism investigation-or even after it 
has continued for some time-whether domestic or international terrorism is 
involved. The Oklahoma City bombing and the anthrax letter incidents 
illustrate this point. Moreover, in the current circumstances, domestic 
terrorists who attempt to ally with or are inspired to emulate 
international terrorists are an increasing concern. The dangers posed to 
the national security by such persons may be comparable to those posed by 
international terrorists, and national security letters should likewise be 
an available tool in the investigation of their criminal activities.
