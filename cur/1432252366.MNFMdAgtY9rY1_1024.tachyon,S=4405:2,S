I'll be happy to let you talk to my lawyer (he used to be an Asst.
Attorney General) and you can call APD directly if you'd like. They DO
include burglary with respect to using deadly force. In fact, in say a
case like somebody breaking into your car and stealing CD's, to be legally
protected you MUST see them with your property, simple 'belief' is not
enough. Of course there is nothing to stop you from planting between the
shooting and the arrival of your local LEA.
