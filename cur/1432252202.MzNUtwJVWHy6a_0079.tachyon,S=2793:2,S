The shrub-putin puppet show was saved by a rainstorm,my sources in chiapas 
tell me.The nuclear tipped scud on the burro drawn mobile launcher couldn't 
get a lock on target.Its a fairly high kiloton yield but theres only one 
bullet.So better luck next time campanero's.St Petersburg rang and plan 
some hannsen files and microsoft source code release's.Blows against the 
empire continue on another mindblowing front with a possible 'crack of the 
century' in the offing.We live in inneresting times.Stock up on fake ID's 
and uniforms.This could be the one.
