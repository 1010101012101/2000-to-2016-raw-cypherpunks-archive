I like a lot of what you say, and it's great to read the perspective of
someone who is completely outside the western propaganda-sphere, but I find
your devotion to Putin to be both baffling and concerning. There is simply
no way a former intelligence agent and director of an intelligence agency,
ANY intelligence agency, who then somehow rose all the way to be President
of a large, powerful country is "unimpeachable." The rest of the things you
say about him may well be true, except perhaps for the "better world" part.
Nobody can unilaterally stand for the rest of the world unless they are
willing to collaborate and compromise with a lot of other people.

This is not to say that Putin is any worse than any US leader, of course.
But substantially better? I seriously doubt it. I'd be equally concerned
about any US or European leader who inspired a level of devotion similar to
what Putin inspires in his followers. Of course, it is in large part the
West's fault that Russians look to someone like Putin in the first place.
We failed to dissolve NATO after the USSR collapsed, which is part of a
pattern of the US acting like it "won" the cold war (the same way it thinks
it "won" WWII) and thus now owns the planet.

Agreed, though I am not sure about the "nationalistic" part. Multipolar, as
an acknowledgement that not everyone wants the same thing, but I'd prefer
we were all skeptical of our own nation and accepting of others.

"Major war" in the sense that this may be when the world finally realizes
it is not, in fact, unipolar. Once nations start realising the US cannot
keep its promises to protect them, they will start looking elsewhere and
taking more responsibility for their own defense. I feel like the US's
turning to Iran for help with Daesh, along with asking countries to
continue to invest more in their own militaries, is a pretty strong
indication that the US realizes this is happening and that many here are
actually willing to accept that fact. But this is by no means a popular
view here, with both Trump and Clinton promising in their own ways to "make
America great again". I'd prefer "Make America part of the world for the
first time."

I imagine there are those in the US who would welcome a new cold war. They
are obviously trying to create (have created) a new one. It seems like
there's a pretty big risk of taking us back to a bipolar world rather than
a unipolar one.

Not sure I buy this particular theory, considering how strongly GWB pushed
for the invasion from his first day of office. I think it comes down to
simple revenge for the plot to assassinate his father.

Oil is obviously strategic, but I think you overestimate the US's belief in
the risk of the decline of the petrodollar. I think the US convinced Saudi
Arabia to keep pumping despite declining oil prices in order to weaken
Russia economically while propping up its own flagging, net-oil-importing
economy. This plan only works in the short term, though, and it will end up
making Russia stronger in the long term, since Russians aren't idiots and
will diversify. I think Putin's decision to ditch tech and focus
exclusively on energy was a huge mistake that made it more vulnerable to
this strategy than it would have been otherwise, but there is still time to
reverse that mistake.

I don't have a strong opinion on this, other than that it is a matter of
opinion. You request facts, and you state a couple, but you actually need
references. And even with references, accepting bribes is not the only form
of corruption. I consider benefiting from bad things done on your behalf,
even when you did not order them, to also be a form of corruption if you do
not denounce them, investigate them, prosecute them, etc.

It is always true of politicians and cops that it's very hard to point to a
specific evil thing they did. After all, if you could prove it, they would
have been impeached, no?

Well, if it passes, you can always hope the various western countries pass
similar laws. I don't think the US is likely to succeed, but you never
know. The FBI keeps hammering on this "going dark" bullshit.

I don't think the USG has a single intention. But at best, they have
seriously underestimated Russia and been incredibly disrespectful toward
them. But it does seem plausible to me that there are elements in the US
government who wish to pull all of Russia's old partners away to isolate
them. Which seems idiotic to me.

I certainly won't attempt to dispute it. Just the part about Russia's or

Certainly.

Politicians are never "really fine humans." But I have no doubt that Putin
loves Russia and wants to make it great again. But I have similarly little
doubt that Donald Trump loves America and wants to make it great again. The
devil is in the details.

Maybe, compared to other politicians.

Multi-polar with relatively high freedom of trade and movement, yes.
Bi-polar with strong nationalism and economic isolationism? No.
