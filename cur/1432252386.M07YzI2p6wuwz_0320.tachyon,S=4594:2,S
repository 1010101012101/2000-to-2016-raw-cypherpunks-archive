Consider this: An inarticulate, politically inexperienced man with family 
links to a previous national regime comes to provincial leadership. 
Subsequently he gains the highest national office without winning the 
popular vote. The election in which he was declared the victor is 
considered compromised by his brother's province. He appoints a chief law 
enforcement officer who has repeatedly called for constitutional revisions. 
Regulatory agencies are filled with those previously regulated. Soldiers 
patrol transportation centers. International treaties are abrogated. 
International legal organizations are shunned. Roles of police and military 
are blurred. Law enforcement agencies are centralized. Individual civil 
rights are reduced. A "shadow" government is created.
Domestic surveillance is increased. People are encouraged to spy on each 
other. Military budgets are increased. The military establishes a 
disinformation program. Media access to government is limited. 
Consultations with the legislative branch decline. Connections to corrupt 
corporate sponsors are disavowed. Efforts to further plunder natural 
resources for profit are initiated. Access to past administrations' 
documents is limited. A war mentality is established with imprecise 
enemies. Nebulous fear- inducing alerts are periodically released. National 
level profiling is introduced. People are imprisoned without public charges 
and unknown others are "disappeared."

Don't mention the war.
