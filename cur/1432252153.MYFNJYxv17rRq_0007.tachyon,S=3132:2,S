We are talking about mercs, not selling bits on MercNet.  Mercs are
physical.
Thus their resources (satellites, rockets, tanks, etc) are *controlled*
by Men With Guns.   Who don't like to share the shiniest toys.

Cheaper info cuts out middlemen, sure; but it does nothing to
permit mercs access to physical-technology that they need
in the physical world.

Devices are physical.  MwG control the physical.

Sure, meshes mean you may not need satellites or fixed base stations
for your comms.  Big deal.  The mesh-radios may be controlled,
and regardless, you need more than radios to be a merc.  Get
that through your head.

You're too stuck on bits and forgetting about atoms.

Yawn.  Disintermediation will happen, its just not enough.  Atoms
matter.
