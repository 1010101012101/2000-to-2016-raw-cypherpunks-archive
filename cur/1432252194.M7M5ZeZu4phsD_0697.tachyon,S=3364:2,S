Fair enough. You can remove the list, as far as I'm concerned.
I don't give a damn about posting copyrighted content; no point posting to a

Which part of "collaborative news filtering" you don't understand?
Ideally, one should a producer and consumer in one person.
Alas, most people are passive slobs, so it takes a lot of them to become

Transhumantech has 300 subscribers. Five of them are active posters.
I consider the list a success, and read it daily. It took several years to
get there.

Cypherpunk agenda is supposed to be a _widely_ held secret.
