LD50 for KCN is about 3mg/Kg.  Not only a good way to eliminate
homeless people (leave a packet around) but if the cops still do
gum-numbing
tests you'd want to crush some Castor seeds and extract the water
soluable
protein.  A few days later his ribosomes stop working, no more proteins
mean no more fascism.  Also a good plan if you are a vendor to the
children
of D.C. fascists.
