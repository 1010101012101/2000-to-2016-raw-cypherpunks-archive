 > have to choose soon between use of the words anarchy and punk and some

punk <> anarchy

'>>punk' actually means 'anti-establishment' and 'activist' in viewpoint.
 >anti-establishment/activist <> anarchy either.

Im sorry,  I MAY have made a blue here.PUNK in the cypher context clearly 
means jail house punks getting served like hell.

One or two get taken away and they bleat and whinny and turn round and 
round before whimpering themselves to sleep.

At least bin ladens a MAN! Long live BIN LADEN.Millions of dead 
amerdikkkers.KILL THE PRESIDENT,FUCK CHENYS WIFE!

Anarchy means getting into the sweet spot of alpha baboons rainbow 
asshole.Thats all folks.The great crypto rock and roll swindle.Oh you can 
peddle your keister over at the cato dontchaknow.Live off your pork belly 
futures and kid yourself till the cows come home.The circle of eunuchs 
circle their wagons.Punctual as a lethal injection.Was there never a 
fucking WILD BUNCH!
