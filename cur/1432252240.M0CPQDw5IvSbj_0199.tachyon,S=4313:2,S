Of course it's unsurprising, most people are ignorant, and like to stay

Some people have put two and two together, and finally understood what you
can do with with realtime machine vision biometrics, wireless WAN and data

It's not just a new surveillance tool, that thing turns quantity into
quality. And, of course, there's much more interesting stuff in the
pipeline, so what we have is just a dot on the plot.
