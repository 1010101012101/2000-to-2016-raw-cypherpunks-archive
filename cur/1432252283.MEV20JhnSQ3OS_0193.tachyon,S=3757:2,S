Jew groups have "demanded" that Microsoft modify its symbol font sets 
to remove swastikas.

Part of a CNN report on this flap:

"The swastika, which was made infamous by Nazi Germany, was included in 
Microsoft's "Bookshelf Symbol 7" font. That font was derived from a 
Japanese font set, said Microsoft Office product manager Simon Marks.

"Microsoft said it will release other tools at a later date to remove 
only the offending characters.

"A form of the swastika has been used in the Buddhist religion to 
symbolize the feet or footprints of the Buddha. The symbol, which was 
also used widely in the ancient world including Mesopotamia, 
Scandinavia, India and the Americas, became common in China and Japan 
with the spread of Buddhism."


So, the racialist demands of a sect of dreidl-spinning weirdos is now 
being used to affect even academic scholarship: the day will soon be 
upon where swastikas are removed even from Buddhist, Scandinavian, 
Indian, etc. texts, and where scholars who wish to write about them 
must blank out they symbol and refer to it as the "s symbol," analogous 
to the way negroes freely call other negroes "niggers" and "niggaz" and 
"nigga hoes," but "demand" that whites refer to the words as "the n 
word."

Now that the Jews dominate Germany once again, time for book burning of 
any book which offends the Jews?
