That is a correct claim by 2600.

The

The judge needs to buy steal or rent a clue, as we both know.

Its not *illegal* access since *they paid for it*.  (For the license
to play it; to copy it to other media for play in their cars; to back
it up; etc.)

We both know that's an incorrect ruling that will be reversed.

The SEGA ruling said that whatever you need to do to interoperate
is legal ---even including the string "(C) SEGA" in your ROM if the
host platform requires it.

You bought the DVD, you can play it how you want.

The EBay advert could have been selling "cp" because there was nothing
about playback implied.  Presumably you would copy your DVD files
from CDs onto a hard drive and then play them back.  As the ad said,
perfectly legal.

You don't need to decrypt to copy.

Can data backup be done legally? Of course.  

Playback, again, is not what is being offered, in my reading of the ad.

I'm surprised that any ordinary file manager wouldn't show the
DVD files much as they'll show audio CD files as files.  [I don't
have a DVD player to try this..]
