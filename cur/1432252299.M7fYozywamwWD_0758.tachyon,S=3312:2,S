     Yup, by far the most intelligent analysis I've seen. I do think,
however, that the authors seem to have a bit of a pollyannaish attitude
re the actions of police, et al and civil liberties in the US, and what
that might mean in terms of domestic reaction. Also the idea that there
would actually be a "political culture change" on the part of Canada and
Mexico, which they see as absolutely necessary for real in-depth
homeland defense, seems rather hopeless.
