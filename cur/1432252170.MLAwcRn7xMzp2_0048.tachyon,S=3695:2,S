Really?

Go back to the archives and look at my original attempt to set a policy
that SSZ subscribers posts were 'public domain'. It was immediately after
Igor and I put up the original two-site CDR.

Note who was arguing in the contrary.

No, there is no 'implied consent'. I own SSZ. I own the copyright of my
words. There is no 'meeting of minds' between you and I for example, so
there can be no 'contract', implied or otherwise (since I've said publicly
I won't agree).

There is no fine print that states 'we reserve the right to edit all
submissions'.

Go fuck off god-$ fascist.
