Airport chemical "sniffers" apparently look for the signature of nitrogen
compounds, not "explosives," per se.  I've often wondered how many weekend
gardeners have gotten hassled and delayed because of trace amounts of
ammonia-based fertilizers on their person and effects.  If you plan to fly,
be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before heading out for the airport if
you have been shoot, gardening or house cleaning.
