Is there a name for the planet that was the asteroid belt before it was
an asteroid belt?

Mars' Marina Canyon/ trench, may have been from rain of some composition,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris
but perhaps was an interplanetary energy warfare result where ultimately
Mars succeeded and that other planet became the asteroid belt. To my
eye, that trench looks more like target practice (for a somewhat intense
version of 'practice') rather than river delta...
