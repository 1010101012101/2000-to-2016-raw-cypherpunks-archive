I am not sure why you suspect it is covered by Chaum's patents.

You said in response to anonymous and I quote:

| Wagner's scheme appears to reply on Chaum's (original) patents, so it
| wasn't relevant.

I explained to you in the post you are replying to why I don't think this
claim is accurate.  Wagner's scheme was designed explicitly to avoid being
covered by Chaum's patents by people who have read Chaum's patents.

Wagner's scheme is clearly not a signature, blind or otherwise.

I have not personally asked a lawyer for an opinion.  Neither have you I
take it.  This was why I suggested "unclear" was a better description of the
current understanding than "appears to rely on Chaum's patents" which you
appear to have made up.

Perhaps the berkeley lawyers opinion could be tracked down?
