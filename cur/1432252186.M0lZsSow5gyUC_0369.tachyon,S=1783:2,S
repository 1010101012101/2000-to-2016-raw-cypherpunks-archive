It's unknown to which extent the Adversary can detect presence of
steganography in images being sent over the Net.

But whatever capabilities they have, they can be jammed.

Imagine a worm that spreads from machine to machine, and on the infected
machine it finds all suitable JPEG files, generates some random data as
source and encrypts them with random key, and stegoes them into the files.

In few days or even hours, a sizeable portion of images on the Net
contains potentially detectable stegoed encrypted data.

Any Chinese want to get immortalized in Internet history?
