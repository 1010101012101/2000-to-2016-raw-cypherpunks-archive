If a LEO thinks you've commited a crime, they can bust you, and ultimately
have to charge you with something, or let you go. If, OTOH, you're simply
regarded as a whacko, you can be institutionalized, perhaps forever. Try
convincing a LEO that a) you're not crazed, and b) you don't have to tell
him/her your name. Seeya.

So the assholes simply move on to sleeping on the courthouse steps, paying
cash, buying throwaway cell phones from the local convenience store, and
stealing cars. They stole whole fucking airplanes full of humans; they'd
likely not have a moral problem stealing a car or paying a crack fiend to do
it in their stead. WTF, if you're going to DIE for the cause, who needs a
hotel room? If we are to believe the news-holes, alot of the folks behind
this used-to-be/are/will be sleeping in caves anyway.

Sort of sounds like the "final solution to the homeless question"....

Well, yeah, "properly done", in the eyes of some, would probably allow the
cop to scan your smart-card from fifty yards. No "felony stop" tactics
req'd.

Don't mistake this post as having disagreed with you in any way.....not at
all. Just adding my U$D.02

There's no shortage of people that hate our guts and are willing to die for
the cause.........a long time after we're all dead and gone people will be
causing us the maximum grief that they can at home, abroad, and probably
low-earth-orbit and beyond, as technology allows. If all they could cause us
was nail-fungus or pre-mature greying of our hairs, that is what they would
do. Such is not the case.
