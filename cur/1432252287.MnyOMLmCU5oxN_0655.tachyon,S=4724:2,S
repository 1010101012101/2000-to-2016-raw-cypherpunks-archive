And I should have pointed out that many of these places I lived in 
during the 50s, 60s, and 70s, HAD BEEN BUILT IN EARLIER DECADES, 
precisely the decades during which Ray assures us basements were the 
norm.

Nope, no basements. No basement in the house I lived in in San Diego 
in the 1950s. Built on a slab. No air conditioning, either. No need.

And the buildings I lived in during the 1970s had neither basements 
nor air conditioning. No need for either.

Further, more and more Californians live in multi-story apartment 
buildings and condos. No basements, though underground parking 
garages are common. (No "natural cooling" effects, natch.)

Where Ray gets the idea that houses in California used to commonly 
have basements--and "thick adobe walls"--is beyond me. They didn't, 
not counting certain old historical Spanish-era buildings which had 
thick walls (but almost never basements!).

Office buildings typically have air conditioning, but this has to do 
with having hundreds or even thousands of people working in a sealed 
enviroment. Basements have nothing to do with this.


The "solution" to "shortages" is, as with all things, market pricing.
