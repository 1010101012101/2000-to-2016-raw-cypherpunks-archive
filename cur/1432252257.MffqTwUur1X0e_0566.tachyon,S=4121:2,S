   Military Expands Intelligence Role in U.S.

   By [2]ERIC LICHTBLAU and [3]MARK MAZZETTI

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 The Pentagon has been using a little-known power
   to obtain banking and credit records of hundreds of Americans and
   others suspected of terrorism or espionage inside the United States,
   part of an aggressive expansion by the military into domestic
   intelligence gathering.

   The [4]C.I.A. has also been issuing what are known as national
   security letters to gain access to financial records from American
   companies, though it has done so only rarely, intelligence officials
   say.

   Banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions
   receiving the letters usually have turned over documents voluntarily,
   allowing investigators to examine the financial assets and
   transactions of American military personnel and civilians, officials
   say.
