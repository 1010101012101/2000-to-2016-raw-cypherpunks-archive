Ray,

Please tell the make and model of the laptop, where it 
was lifted and other details that would help a good
samaritan recognize it as what you say it is and has
in its innards.

No disinfo now. No risk insurance scamming, we've
been stung by that. Damn hi-value secret-rich laptops 
are a menace to the underworld and time wasters for
undercovers overloaded with a leak-ploy of the spooks 
copied by the thousands, when even pawnshops 
have signs about laptops "who you kiddin."

The dame chopped and shopped your secrets if 
they were that, copying spooks ploying a bonus
from likeminders with the same venal bosses eager
to steal when profits peter, copying the boss spooks
copying the leaders of the earth and heaven.

Yrs,

No. 38769
