Presumably the contrast between this and their other recent declaration
(that their code is so insecure releasing it would be a national
security risk) doesn't occur to them? Or maybe they think the two
compliment each other (eg "look, our code is so insecure that we can't
release it, and we can't believe anyone is any better than us, so theirs
must be so insecure it can't be released too")
