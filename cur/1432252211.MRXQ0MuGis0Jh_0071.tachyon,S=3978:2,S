The way to beat session fixation is to issue a 
privileged and impossible to predict session ID in 
response to a correct login.

If, however, you grant privileges to a session ID on the 
basis of a successful login, which is in fact the usual 
practice, you are hosed. The normal programming model 
creates a session ID, then sets variables and flags 
associated with that session ID in response to forms 
submitted by the user.  To prevent session fixation, you 
must create the session ID with unchangeable privileges 
from the moment of creation.   Perhaps you do this, but 
very few web sites do.
