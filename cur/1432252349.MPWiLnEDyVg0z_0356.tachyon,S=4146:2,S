First, users raving about a service typically has very little to do
with quality of the service as a security product. I believe that's
why you posted the original question, after all.

Second, the unusual stress of ideology in such a service is very
relevant to product's security in this case. When I read RiseUp's
social contract page [1] some time ago, I found the mild creepiness
and passive-aggressiveness quite amusing, but immediately thought the
following: these guys seem pretty radicalized in whatever hippie
ideology they seem to be adepts of. This probably indicates that in
their closed group, they value ideological loyalty at least as highly
as technical expertise. It means that one of them could be incompetent
and still have administrative access to security-critical systems, or
that one of them could be recruited at some point under a suitable
ideological pretense — compromising the service in either case.
