Well, hell, that's what I said. But you make it sound so much more _clear_.
I don't remember who was saying that geodesic definition is based solely on
local information, but that appears to be the major roadblock for our logic.
If I could find out where this stipulation is coming from and figure out the
necessary logical proofs, you could possibly have a water-tight buzzword. I
don't believe I have ever heard one of those (the marketing favorite,
"paradigm shift" is an excellent example of why buzzwords don't have to be
logical anyway).
