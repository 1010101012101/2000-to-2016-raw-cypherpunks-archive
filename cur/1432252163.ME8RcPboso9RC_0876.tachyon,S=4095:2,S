Not only is EM correct, but:
* many attacks are possible without worrying about keylength.  Got
Scarfo?
* NIST/NSA picked the lamest AES.  If I told you what "lame" meant, I'd
have to kill you.
* (Lack of) User motivation (related to man-machine issues) is still the
spooks' best friend.  As
well as legacy systems, and inadequately designed total systems.  Got
Redmond?

However, stego and decent opsec and cash and leo buffoonery still let
you coordinate the occasional urban skyline
reconstruction, poking holes in boats, etc.  Got Dead Drops?  Mr.
Hanssen?  Mr Ames?
