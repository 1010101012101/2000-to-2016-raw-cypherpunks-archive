Britain deploys 'cybercops' to fight Internet crime
By NICK HOPKINS
The Guardian
November 15, 2000

LONDON - The rising tide of Internet crime - hacking, porn rackets, 
extortion and fraud - is to be tackled in Britain by a squad of "cybercops."

British Home Secretary Jack Straw said the unit will be headed by 80 
officers recruited from the police, customs service, national crime squad 
and National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS).

Money is also being provided to help fund a 24-hour international hotline 
for detectives from different countries to "trade information on potential 
attacks on the national infrastructure."

The initiative follows intelligence that shows terrorists are increasingly 
using the Internet for recruitment and planning.

Internet crime has soared in the last three years as criminals have begun to 
realize the opportunities it offers.

The dissemination of computer viruses, such as the "I Love You bug," which 
wreaked havoc last summer, is also on the rise. Medium-sized businesses are 
particularly vulnerable to these kinds of attacks because they cannot afford 
protective filtering systems.

Recent research showed that 60 percent of Britain's online businesses have 
suffered hacking while worrying new trends include evidence of an 
international Internet trade in body parts.
