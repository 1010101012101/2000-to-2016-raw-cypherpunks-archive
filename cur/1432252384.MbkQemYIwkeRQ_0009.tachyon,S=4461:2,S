I've not indulged, but I've heard of this program (my data is
several years old).

The Feds do have a farm (in kentucky? west virginia?) 
where a small amount of pot is grown under high security
for licensed researchers. IIRC, the marijuana
is graded, washed, mixed with tobacco(!?) as a filler, 
and rolled  on standard cigarette machines. The article
I read noted that some felt that the differences from a
'real' hand-rolled joint put research done using these
standardized doobies into doubt.

If Mr. Rosenfeld had put his legal joints into checked
luggage, there's a chance that a DEA dog would have
narced him out. Though he presumably would not have
gotten into trouble, it could be an enormous hassle. 

What I find curious is that the joints came to Delta's
attention at all. Maybe the packaging makes it clear
what they are. Anyway, Delta deserves whatever it
gets over this.
