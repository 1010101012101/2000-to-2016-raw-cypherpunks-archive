I saw the first two episodes, they weren't half bad; somebody
obviously did their homework.  But then, I'm easy - Archer had me
at Jessica Walter, and the bits and pieces of spookish history
they throw into the scripts amuse me more than they should.

I would would endorse a little independent film called Algorithm
to the Cpunk crowd:  Surprisingly realistic, including the
radically political angle; I like it when a movie leaves me asking
myself, whose propaganda was that anyway?
