RIAA Pit of Confusion (Culture)

By salimfadhley
Fri May 16th, 2003 at 10:13:06 PM EST

After reading about the RIAA threatening to sue yet another innocent
archive operator, I decided to take some direct action: It occurred to
me
that the RIAA keep falsely accusing others of piracy because they put
their
faith in an unintelligent spider - a fact which can be simply exploited
to
make my servers into an RIAA no-go-zone...



Whilst spidering is nothing to worry about (and only to be expected on a

public site), the way the association fires off legal threats based on
this
spider results alone seems wrong. Since this spider does not actually
look
at the whole title of the file, or even it's content, I figured I could
have some fun at their expense:

What if I could write a `tarpit' script that could create a large number
of
interlinked automatically generated web sites. If their spider tried to
scan my server it would be fooled into thinking that it had found a
treasure trove of MP3 sites. Anybody who took the time to look at the
site
could see that the site contains no pirate content at all.

How might the RIAA react to such a thing?
