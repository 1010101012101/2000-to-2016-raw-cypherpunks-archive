	"Repeat after me - You have the right to remain silent."
	(Droid either gets it or doesn't, repeat as needed)
	"Anything you say can and may be used against you in a court of law"
	Droid: dittos...
	Droid: "You have the right to remain silent"
	"You have a right to a lawyer.  If you cannot afford a lawyer,
	one will be provided for you"
	Droid: dittos...

	"OK, so I'm planning to remain silent, and you can
	bring me a lawyer if you want to talk more."
