I used to use freedom, but i kept forgetting my passphrase..lame i know but
hey.

I was wondering if there are any open source projects that perform a similar
function (pseudonym based ip traffic anonymising, and remailing) out there?
I've had a look on google, but i can only find discussions on the theory of
this sort of stuff, rather than any working implementations.

Freedoms product was excellent (as far as i understood, im no security
expert ;) in many ways but the real reason i dumped it was that it was just
too slow on my old 400mhz pc with a 56k modem....

... and I just got a press release from ZKS this morning trumpeting the
virtues of Freedom 3.0; sounds like maybe they're abandoning the network
and shifting their consumer-product focus to software alone. I looked at
their website after seeing Ben's message and was struck by how much they've
shifted away from selling service to consumers at $49 each, and are now
targeting businesses who are allegedly concerned about their customers'
alleged concern about privacy. They did appear to be willing to sell the
consumer software, but it clearly wasn't the focus of their business as
presented by the website.
