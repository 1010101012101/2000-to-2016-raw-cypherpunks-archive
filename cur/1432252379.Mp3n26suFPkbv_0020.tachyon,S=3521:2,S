Not really .  Mojo is not a file sharing system, its a publication based 
distributed file system.  Each client mirrors but a small part of the 
10**192 chucks of file space. Whether a client downloads content or not is 
only indirectly related to the chucks stored on their HD by their 
client/broker SW.

And there in lie the problem.  Without significantly reducing a user's 
effort to publish and/or providing some sort of encouragement to tweak the 
content meta-data (Kaaza has recently done that to help address leeching 
and hacker attempts to reduce content quality through spoofing and other 
tricks).
