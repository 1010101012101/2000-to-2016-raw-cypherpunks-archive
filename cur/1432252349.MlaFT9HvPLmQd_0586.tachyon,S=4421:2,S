   No, not really. It's far too irregular for that, sometimes goes for over a
month, then sometimes 2-3 times in a week. More like them doing work on the
system. Not really dhcp anyway, it's Eoppp. Cable is usally dhcp, and is better
because it authenticates on the mac address of the cable modem. And dhcp can be
set up to always give the same ip to a certain mac address, but I don't think
the eoppp can, or at least they don't -- it always has to negotiate a
challange/passwd response which can be quite problematic -- sometimes the only
way to get it to work again is to unplug  the modem for 30 seconds or so, which,
of course, frustrates any script you have to automagically reset dns for your
domainname, or even just keep you online.

   This would probably work okay, even ssh works despite ip changes, although it
stops to ask.
