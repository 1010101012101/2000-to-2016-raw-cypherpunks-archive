The US army would be wholly in compliance with international 
law even if it nailed Saddam's head to a post in central 
Baghdad with a nine inch nail.  Saddam is not entitled to POW 
protections.  He was running the war effort out of uniform and 
hidden amongst civilians, which has always been a 
shoot-on-the-spot violation of the rules of war, and his war 
effort consisted largely of terrorist attacks directed at 
civilians, which regrettably has not been a shoot-on-the-spot 
violation, but arguably should be.

The title of this thread is 'I am anti war.  You lot support 
Saddam"  I don't defend the war on Iraq.  Why are you 
supporting Saddam?

You have just told us that poor little Saddam is a victim. Care 
to give us your take on the two towers?
