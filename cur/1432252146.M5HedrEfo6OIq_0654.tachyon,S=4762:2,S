One interesting aspect of using proof of work (POW) to protect 
against denial of service attacks is that it can be implemented and 
demonstrated without the need for widespread adoption. The basic idea 
(as I see it) is that the servers that handle end-user PCs have the 
ability to demand proof of work from the end users before accepting 
packets and give priority to the delivery of packets where required 
work has been demonstrated. Higher level servers then give priority 
to packets where POW has been demonstrated.

To establish an initial system, large user, such as the Federal 
Government, a large corporation or a consortium of universities, only 
has to insure that there is chain of POW-aware servers between 
several of its sites. The selected sites should then enjoy protection 
from DOS attacks for inter-site communications and this would be 
evident when such attacks occur. Additional sites could be added 
incrementally and, as long as proper standards are created and 
observed, different networks that adopt POW antiDOS can be linked 
merely by establishing a POW aware path between the nets. Since 
POWawareness would likely be just a software upgrade the technology 
should spread quite rapidly.
