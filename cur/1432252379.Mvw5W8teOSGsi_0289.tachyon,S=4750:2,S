I like the way you're thinking.

> If you want to know what's actually standing in the way of a global p2p filesystem, try to persuade your technically minded friends to use Tahoe (or Freenet, or OceanStore, or CFS, or PAST, or FARSITE) for sharing files.

Of the ones you listed only Freenet and Tahoe-LAFS are things you can
use and are being actively developed, right? Also there is GNUnet. On
the Tahoe-LAFS wiki we have a page of links to related projects [1].

This is something we're doing in the Tahoe-LAFS project, for example
on our ticket #1024 "introductory docs are confusing and off-putting".

You would be more than welcome to jump in and help. Try following the
"quick start" instructions [2] and tell us how it works for you.

Heh heh.

We have plans to do something along those lines, too:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/Ostrom

Again, we'd love help! You can get major kudos points (which are
redeemable for gratitude tokens and awesomeness levels) by doing some
fairly simple hacks like "collect server capacities and put them on
the welcome page" (ticket #648). On the other hand if Ostromism and
warm fuzzy social encouragement isn't your thing, you might be able to
get cold hard cash (U.S. Dollars or BitCoins) by contributing patches
to Tahoe-LAFS in return for bounties. :-)

Regards,

Zooko
