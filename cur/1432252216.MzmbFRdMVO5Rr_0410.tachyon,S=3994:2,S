Yes, you've said similar things in the past.

And yet you ask very basic, easily-answered questions, questions 
best-answered by spending a minute or two entering words into a 
search engine of your choice. (In the age of the Web, a page which 
has photos, descriptions, etc. of such a device is worth a lot more 
than someone giving vaguely-remembered comments.)

We used to hear the expression "Look it up."

When a child asks what a word means, "look it up."

When someone asks where Borneo is located, "look it up."

When a list member asks what a KG-84 is, "look it up."
