But this is trivial. Since the traffic is encrypted, you just have a bit
that says "this is garbage" or "this is traffic".

OTOH, this can leave you open to traffic marking attacks. George Danezis
and I wrote a paper on a protocol (Minx) designed to avoid marking
attacks by making all packets meaningful. You can find it here:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/gd216/minx.pdf.

Cheers,

Ben.
