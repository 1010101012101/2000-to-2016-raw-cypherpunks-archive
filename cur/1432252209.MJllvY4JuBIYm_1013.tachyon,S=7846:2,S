James, you are so violently skewed, I'm sea-sick just reading this.
Anti-Semite or indifferent to child murder? Is there a third choice? And I
might also point out that if you are choosing (correctly, from a technical
perspective) to include the Arabs in the general grouping of "Semites", then
you must also point out that to avoid being someone who is indifferent to
the murder of children, one must be anti-Pope, anti-Jesus,
anti-early-Christanity, and anti-cryptanalysis. I don't really buy your
generalization, so if you are going to be a vocal bigot, please at least be
a little more clear.

When Jews are murdering small children in reprisals against stone throwing 
by young men, and Arabs are blowing up school buses, then anti semitic 
statements against both Arabs and Jews become legitimate, indeed required.

Are you an anti semite, or are you indifferent to the murder of 
children.  Choose one.

Yes, Virginia, not only are there individual evil people, but there are 
entire evil nations that demand and expect that their members do evil 
things, a demand widely supported and forcefully encouraged by the people 
of that nation.
