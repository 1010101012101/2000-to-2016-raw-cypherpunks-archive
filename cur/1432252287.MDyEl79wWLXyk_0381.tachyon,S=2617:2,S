I am painfully aware of it.

Or use the off-the-shelf modules for industrial applications that already 
do it, and add some glue logic.

Check the Gumstix and the Enfora Enabler specs. The first is the 
equivalent of a grossly stripped-down laptop (80x20x6 mm, few mA sleep, 50 
mA command-wait, 250mA full power w/o Bluetooth), the second one is the 
equivalent of a comm card (GSM/GPRS, 50x30x3 mm, tri-band 5mA standby). 

The laptop approach is good for prototyping, though.

I'd try the Enfora module in that case. RS232 for data and control, and 
analog I/O for voice.

The PDA approach definitely has its merit.
