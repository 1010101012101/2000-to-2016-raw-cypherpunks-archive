You are applying pure logic to a very complex subject. I'd bet this is 
already routinely done by TLAs and whatnot, at least as a pre-screen before 
human photograph inspectors.

The most obvious hole in your statement is with respect to 2D Spatial FFTs 
of the image...you can probably greatly increase your match probability via 
certain masking criteria applied to the 2D FFT. And from there there's lots 
of stuff that can be done with colors and other indirect stuff such as 
(perhaps) camera signatures in the photo (eg, If there's text that says 
"Hamamatsu Synchroscan Streak Camera" then don't bother doing the FFT--it 
ain't a picture of your dog).

Look...a human being can recognize the side image of a person a lot of the 
time. There should be no reason this intelligence can't be encoded somehow.
