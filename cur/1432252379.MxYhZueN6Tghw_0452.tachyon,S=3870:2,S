Hardly.  A bazooka is a shoulder-held tube from which you fire a 
missile, the fuel in the missile burning as it goes through the air.
When the missile is gone, you put another one in.

A recoilless rifle fires a conventional artillery round.  The 
motive force is supplied by fuel which burns in the barrel of
the gun.  When you have fired, you open the little door at the
back, pull out the empty shell casing, and put in another one.

Depends on the war.  I believe that in Vietnam it was common to
mix beehive and HEAT 50:50.  Beehive rounds contain zillions of 
little darts about half an inch long.  HEAT is what you are talking
about - High Explosive Anti Tank.

Yes.  The gas comes out of the back of a recoilless rifle a lot 
faster than the shell goes out the front.
