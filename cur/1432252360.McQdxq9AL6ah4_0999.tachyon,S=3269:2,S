Why should it?
Is there a "reasonable supply" of original Van Goghs?

Nevertheless, there is a market for them.


If there are shortages, then the price will go up.
If it goes up enough, then people will look for ways to produce more.
[ In the art market, these are frequently forgeries, but for water,
that's not a problem. ]
