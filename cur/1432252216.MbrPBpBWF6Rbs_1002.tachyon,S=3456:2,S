    My feeling is that Kerry won't be really any different, except possibly in
the areas of environment and education. He'll be about like Klinton, maybe
worse. And like Klinton, he's a lot smarter, so a lot more people will be
fooled. One thing about Dubbya, et al, is they make a lot of really dumb
mistakes. Look at Cheney telling Sen. Leahy to fuck himself -- these morons even
turn off a lot of Republicans.
