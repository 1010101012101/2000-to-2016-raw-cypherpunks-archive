Angular momentum.   Putting waste into the Sun requires the removal of
nearly all of the angular momentum associated with the revolution around the
sun, about 66,700 mph.  Since energy is proportional to the square of the
velocity, that's about 6 times greater energy than achieving earth's escape
velocity, or maybe 15 times greater than low-earth-orbit energy.   Extremely
inefficient.

A far better solution, I'd think, would be to drill a 5-mile deep hole
(perhaps on the ocean floor, for good measure) and fill the bottom couple of
miles with waste, and the rest with concrete.
