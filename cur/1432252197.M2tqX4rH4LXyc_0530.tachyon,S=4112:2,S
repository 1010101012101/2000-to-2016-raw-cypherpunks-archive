This may yet be attempted but even so success is not a given.

I think you mean "palpable." I don't think pulpable is good usage but if
by that you mean able to be made into pulp well, OK, it's funny.

I haven't read the mixmaster source but it seems to me that end-to-end
encryption protects the contents. The traffic analysis part seems
vulnerable on two basic fronts : subversion of a node and overall low
traffic levels. 
Nested encryption protects a subverted node from being able to trace the
entire chain in one fell swoop. 

As long as there is one uncompromised node in a chain subversion doesn't
guarantee a matchup of "from" and "to" but it improves the odds.

With low traffic levels through a chain the statistics of traffic
analysis are also improved.

I like the idea of making a remailer part of a worm but it might be just
as well to make it an inherent part of a product since people will
attempt to eradicate a worm. Just imagine if Napster were still going
full steam with a built-in remailer - huge node count and shitloads of
traffic.
