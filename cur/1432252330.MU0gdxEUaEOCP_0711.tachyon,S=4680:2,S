Absolutely.  I may trust you, but I might not trust (or even know) your

Yup, apparently there have been recent cases of high-rep sellers on ebay
who when ready to give up the ebay game put up auctions for high priced
items that they never deliver, effectively stealing the money.

It would be interesting to figure out an effective way to prevent

against this type of fraud, but they usually just eat the losses of the
bidder.
