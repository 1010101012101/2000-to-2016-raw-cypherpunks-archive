I fooled around with the filtering but the source data is pure crap.
It's a low quality JPEG and there are artifacts everywhere, especially
around the "towers" and the rider. Has anyone found better source
material : higher resolution, lower quantization?

BTW - there's lots more art, mostly sinister if you care to see it that
way. Look at the one in gallery 4 :

WTF is a wooden shoe ( sabot ) doing next to an Indian elephant? 

Also in pic 0110 there is a nice death's head in the clouds to the left
of the flying cherub thing..

I have some trouble with the interpretation of yellow as a biowar, since
it seems to be something he horse is wanting to graze on.
