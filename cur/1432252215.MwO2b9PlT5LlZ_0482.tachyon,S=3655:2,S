You do not need to live in a slum.

Indeed most slums are poorly sealed, and most poorly sealed
buildings have no mold problem.

If you live in a well sealed building, and are energy
conscious, and always keep the doors and windows closed, and
the weather outside is cold, there will be chronic
condensation on windows and and some parts of the walls.
Mold will then grow, very possibly harming or even killing
the inhabitants.

The recent attack of the killer mold in California is a
result of the recent big energy conservation measures.

The correct response is to wipe down the highly visible mold
with dilute bleach solution, then leave a window cracked open
whenever you see condensation.
