Indeed.  Despite all of Tim's rage, we're still just rats in a cage, and
despite Tim's urging of necklacing ISP owners, or other foam at the mouth
arm-chair solutions, Occam's razor still supplies the better, and cleaner
solutions:

If your MTA has it, turn on the START TLS option.  If it doesn't, either
compile it in, or get a new MTA for your server.  Also add GPG/PGP, and
hard drive encryption, to both your client and the server.

(Since the discussion is about ISP's, we can assume that you own the
server either hosted by or fed by your ISP - if you don't - i.e. you're on
a dial-up PPP, you're at the ISP's mercy anyway, and the ISP can
read/forge your mail unless you PGP every piece of email.)

Don't have secure IMAP/POP capabilities?  Use ssh as a secure tunnel to
transport IMAP/POP/SMTP from the client into the server.  Even when your
client lives on the same network segment as the server.  If you don't
realize why this is useful, get clued in as quickly as you can.

Of course, as usual, this discussion will next focus on physical security
(hint for the above paragraph for those in need of a clue), then detecting
black bag operations, with the usual "Read the Fucking Archives" coming
from the usual source(s).

And you know what?  This indeed has already been dealt with, so yes, by
all means, "Read the fucking archives" does apply.  So go and read the
fucking archives - all of you.  That's your homework.  Do it!  There will
be a quiz tomorrow!  Be sure to bring your #2 pencils!  :)
