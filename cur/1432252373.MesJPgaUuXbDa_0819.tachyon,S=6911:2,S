The rush to the security pork is only eclipsed by the ratfuckers attempts 
on penguins

Sun casts long shadow before major Linux gathering

REUTERS [ SUNDAY, AUGUST 11, 2002 3:20:34 AM ]
SAN FRANCISCO: Is there a wolf in penguin's clothing? That is the theme of 
a spirited discussion among supporters of the Linux operating system, a 
freely available piece of basic software with a penguin mascot.
The wolf potentially lurking just outside the door, some Linux-boosters 
say, is Sun Microsystems Inc., the high-end computer maker, which is 
expected to unveil its first general-purpose, low-end Linux machine, and 
its own version of Linux, on the eve of a major convention for the 
cooperatively developed software.
Linux, which will be debated and celebrated at the Linuxworld exposition in 
San Francisco Aug. 13-15, must prove itself in the rarefied world of 
running crucial corporate applications, like huge databases, analysts said.
Linux is a new version of Unix, the mainstay corporate operating system, 
though it does not yet have the reliability and power of older Unix 
systems, analysts say.
"Linux and Unix combined are competing with Microsoft," whose Windows 
program is graduating from personal computers to powerful servers and which 
offers its own, mostly-Microsoft view of the world, dubbed .Net," said 
Pierre Fricke, an analyst at research firm D.H. Browne.
Sun also remains one of Microsoft Corp.'s biggest rivals, and its latest 
move has been blasted in advance by competitors.
"They are trying to control something which inherently isn't designed for 
that sort of control point,"
