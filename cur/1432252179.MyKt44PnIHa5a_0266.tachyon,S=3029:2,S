   The Solidaros movement was a democratic movement where they
   wanted to impliment a government that had representation and guaranteed
   civil rights (I don't know exactly how far along they've come). But at no
   point was their goal the continued management of speech, work, income,
   etc. through a central government mechanism.

That was precisely my point: socialism doesn't necessarily mean centralised
statism, wage controls or limited speech. Its roots are in democratic
organisation, and Solidarity was an example of that. Bolshevism took
the idea of 'power to the people', capitalised that last noun, and redefined
it to mean 'the vanguard revolutionary party.' You always know you're screwed
when perfectly innocent words are capitalized. Church, Property, Patriotism,
Strong Goverment, History, Socialism, what Joyce called 'those big words that
make us so unhappy.'


   BAD comparison. The Fortune 500's can't kill me and they can't throw me in
   jail for not buying their products or participating in their programs. 

Well, they might pollute you to death, but they haven't got firing squads. In
the States. South Americans or Africans might have a different story to tell.
Consider the depredations of Shell in Nigeria.


All the best
