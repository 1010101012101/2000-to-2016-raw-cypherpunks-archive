So Ministry of Economic Development reacts negatively on that draft,
says definition of "money surrogate" is too broad, in current redaction
that can lead to ban on almost everything (gift cards, loyalty programs,
etc.).

It's not like they vote for Bitcoin, as RT says in title, seems like
they just want more realistic definition.

> According to regulations, the Ministry of Finance can either re-submit
the revised bill to the Ministry of Economic Development, or submit it
to the government without changes, enclosing a table of differences on
the project.
