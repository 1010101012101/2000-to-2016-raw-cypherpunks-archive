I generally like being disagreed with, so this was interesting. I don't
blame anyone for not getting into my response, or even for getting angry
from it. I hope I'll get some insightful responses, that help me think the
subject through better.

(@Juan, try more patience and depth - I think it will make you seem less
aggressive and help you get the point across. This cheerleading is fun but
less useful.)

Truecost one or two dead 24 year old foxconn/Bangladeshi sweatshop
> worker's body into that equation when you do that cost comparison.


Truecost being some unrealistic form of cost determination? We are in a
real world situation when I buy something made in a sweatshop. Governments
skew everything all over the place and cause grave injustice in doing so.
Wealth imbalance is the other great evil, that could be limited by
something like Basic Income, but it is hard to implement.

Other than excessive coercion following wealth imbalance, and government
unmarkets, the price I pay is the Truecost.

The difference between "what I pay now", "what I pay later", "what I lose
in opportunity" etc is very difficult to keep track of, and explains my
desire for "advanced finance". In fact, this is so important that a hedge
fund manager can often make a very big amount, just by fixing wrong
pricing. It offends our natural understanding of things, and that is also
why we suck at it. (And the insane earnings on the markets are also a
direct result of us sucking at markets)

Not sure what this is supposed to evidence. Collectives are still in the
individual's advantage? I'm not sure that follows, humans act in bizarre
ways and our power allows the absurdities to be reality.

I disagree. The purer a system the greater our understanding, and a thing
understood is exceedingly more useful. Fuzziness causes us to make
mistakes, and for mistakes to stack atop mistakes.

Capitalism is definitely murder. It's a natural system, with evolutionary
effects. It kills the weak, flawed, unfit. We can make it kinder, but doing
so makes it less effective. We've already made it a lot kinder. (note: less
effective, but kinder. It's not clear which one would prefer. Truthfully I
think Basic Income is the ideal way to guarantee kindness, but it's hard to
implement.)

 I argued that time expended readily outweighs cost saved. Not anything
else. (I have fixed things for fun and cost savings, like Razer argued
makes sense, but then it's entertainment - not economically wise choices)

No. In my idealized model politics is quite a different game. There is most
definitely still a "government mafia", that harasses everyone to 1. stay
out of each other's hair and 2. invest in the advancement of the human race
(think space travel, science). But, there is no nations. Interest groups
are inevitable and should not be encouraged or discouraged, merely
understood. That way no interest group can offend justice (meaning:
fairness).

But, the government *must not* thread into the financial services field. It
will either reduce freedom, or be out-competed. Both are happening in the
real world.

That is to say, a mixed economy. Again.
> mercantilism/fascim/state socialism/state communism.


I think some products are best rendered without competition, and some are
best rendered with competition. So long as the drive to do best exists we
do not really need to replicate effort. Eg: Patents are only good for
preventing people from using the best available methods. It's a hack to
make investments more worthwhile, and secrecy less important. If we didn't
need a profit incentive there would be no need for patents.

A similar argument is possible for shrewd advertising, why lie to people if
you do not profit from it? One helps everyone most by providing correct
information. (*this is not true, people regularly need to be coerced to act
in their best interests. But coercion for the better is really not that
bad.)

In the real world we oft encounter duopolies. Basically a monopoly with a
state-protected laggard. The monopolist ensures the laggard continues
existing, for example by increasing it's own prices to a kind of
unreasonable height. That ensures sales for the laggard, and maximum
profit. Basically this whole system is then fucked, as there is no real
drive for advancement (the laggard cannot overtake the monopolist, it has
not the funds. But it also cannot fail, the monopolist prevents it. So why
even put up a fight?) and humanity is helped no better than the laggard
performs. It happens with all our huge markets, from shipping to silicon to
telecom to food to housing to government to diamonds, etc, etc, etc, etc,
etc.

I'm too minarchist to be a facist, but otherwise you're spot on. Try not to
confuse my designs with the current world. I am not a supporter of the
status quo, but I will attempt to understand it, and I will say there's
hardly an evil actor out there. We just collectively fuck up according to
our fuckingly retarded tastes.

You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the

Money is liquid value. Value is the game. It's not at all about money,
money is useless. It's the value it denotes that's what it's all about.

You seem to ignore how seriously amazing pure liquid value is. In an ideal
world; when faced with two choices, the most profitable one is the one
that's bottom line better for humanity. You make an egoistic choice, and
improve the world.

A more profitable solution is either more efficient or provides greater
value. Error is introduced in judgement of value, and unmarket effects can
distort the picture of efficiency.

Other unmarket effects include excessive wealth (where more or less wealth
simply doesn't matter), limited lifespans (who cares if you lose? You'll
die anyway), extreme fuzziness of value, etc, etc.

Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?


I'm happy you're happy. I'm sad you'll not advance and will get your ass
handed to you by an aggressor who does. Real life is competitive by nature.
You may lose happily, and disappear. It doesn't really matter. The universe
dies a heat death anyway.

Not flying high is also a survival tactic though. Who knows, maybe things
will work our okay for you. (probably still better to fly a little higher)

You made some mention of thrift stores providing great value, and
satisfaction/fun from repairs also being value. I agree. I bought things
from thrift shops, and I repaired things for fun (and learning).

You mentioned "true" fair trade. I believe in labor markets, and therefore
do not think fair trade is a thing at all. "Fair trade" is mostly just
stupid trade, unless we get something for it. And NO not just a good
goddamn feeling. I mean "The Formula" like improvements, people causing
less disturbance if they get paid more kind of things. (note: things can
get extremely unfair in a sufficiently unbalanced situation, but so long as
coercion is limited it's fine)

Yes. I'm saying that the price tells me if it's more efficient or not. If a
European person wants to live like a princess, or wouldn't work at all,
then perhaps I'll just ignore him and have someone else do the work.

Pollution is a difficult subject. It is easily solved:

1. All the earth is vested into a legal person
2. The legal person will auction destroyable earth - licenses to dump
pollutants, manipulate land, cut rainforest, fish, hunt, etc. such that
auction profit is maximized - yet earth preserved as per politically
determined rules. (must support X panda's, Y biodiversity units, Z
radioactivity level, etc)
3. The auction's profits are diverted to causes of common interest (donated
to the world government)
3. ALTERNATIVELY The auctions profits are transferred into (a) fictive
good(s) and destroyed - causing inflation/deflation to distribute the
finances over the owners of the fictive good. The choice of fictive good is
as important as the choice of a cause of common interest - it is merely a
way to exclude government from the process. There is atm no suitable
fictive good.

There's some issues regarding compensation for those most affected.
Chernobyl's responsible legal people (Russian gov, whatever exploitation
company, etc) will be forced to buy the destroyable earth licenses, likely
causing a massive bump to the price. It would have been dearly paid for.
But it would make sense for people more affected by the nuclear fallout to
see a bigger cut of that value. It's complex and political but can be done
decently.

Most importantly this preserves the real cost/risk/benefit relationships.
It preserves the markets. It means that if anyone makes the cheapest
choice, it is also the best choice. Drive a car if you think it's worth it!
It all works out in the end.

I don't "want any money", but I do want to travel here and there and

Obtain as much money as you can. Then, if you don't use it, donate it to
causes you care about. Causes that help people. Not earning money is just
sloth, really.

Is the essence of your point to "be mindful" - whether travel, food,

Meaningful? Idk what you mean by that. I think you mean "gives the feeling
of living meaningfully and relaxed". Perhaps Yoga and drugs are your keys.
Drugs to kill any suffering, perhaps heighten joy. Yoga because it
apparently helps people find meaning.

> I say money is not something a sane person should want or not want,

>
> Sane...yes.  Well that explains the Wall St vultures, then!


Perhaps not money, but the value it denotes. Perhaps a massage, an
icecream, soylent, a solar panel, etc. I'm sure you want /something/ of
value.
The "Wall St vultures" may be greedy assholes (idk) but the reason they're
effective is because our markets are not. The better our financial system
works, the less money people in the business could make. Perhaps now it
explains everything :P? (I think the obscurity, complexity, gravity of the
subject matter and legal restrictions caused by the aforementioned is why
the financial markets don't work better)

We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.


Or not together, that's the problem. (Also, sometimes people don't care)


Sorry for being verbose. It's very hard to get these arguments across. I'm
quite sure we're all on the same side, it's just so damn hard to speak.
