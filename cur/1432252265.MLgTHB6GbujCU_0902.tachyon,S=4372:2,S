	No. The one *shooting* is the one to be afraid of.

	Without governments Companies (not corporations, corporations 
are inherently creatures of the state) would have to do their

A quote from Petro's Archives:   **********************************************
Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
