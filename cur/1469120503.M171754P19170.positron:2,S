Good question, i actually don't know the answer.. I expect the relationships get pretty incestuous at the higher levels. The top 10 "public" relays are all doing in the range of 50MB/s+.... You can browse the public relays here -

https://atlas.torproject.org/

For comparison, my relay, when it's up, is capped at 200KB/s.
