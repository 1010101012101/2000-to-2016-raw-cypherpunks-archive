I agree, and I fear that this is why StreamBox settled in the _Real
Networks v. Streambox_ case.  They didn't necessarily feel optimistic
that their commercial speech would be protected in the view of the
courts.  The outcome of that case is certainly troubling for this one.
For those who don't want to protest Adobe on Monday, why don't you go 
protest Real Networks?  Goodness knows they could use it. :-)

Streambox VCR is useful in some of the same ways as AEBPR, although
there are perhaps more legal uses for AEBPR and more illegal uses for
Streambox VCR.  They are both proprietary commercial software and many
people do argue that there is a free speech right to sell them (as
there is a free speech right to sell books!).  But it would be more
immediately obvious if they were free/open source.

Unfortunately, courts already seem to have a hard enough time
believing that electronic publication of free/open source software is
protected by the first amendment.
