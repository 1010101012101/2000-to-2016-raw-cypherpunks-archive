A very sound prediction about the behavior of a subset of potential
employees. I would bet that 40-50% of SW people haven't even heard of
the DMCA and Sklyarov or don't see it as a problem. 

While I'd like to think Adobe's behavior will limit their access to
people who fall on the high side of the curve, I've met plenty of bright
people who just don't care about certain issues.

Another counter-factor for your prediction would be continued economic
decline and a scarcity of jobs which while not a certainty is certainly
a possibility. The all-consuming Bay Area monkey-on-the-back mortgage
might tend to eclipse the politics for all but the most stallwart
technology freedom fighter.

Mortgage low, 
politics intact,
Mike

PS - I can't fault Adobe for wanting to protect their business but the
DMCA has got to go. It's the tech version of the war on drugs ain't it?
An excuse to storm and destroy without even trespass to justify it. Pure
evil.
