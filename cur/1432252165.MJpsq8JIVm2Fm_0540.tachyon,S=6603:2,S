With Brands digital credentials (or Chaums credentials) another
approach is to make the endorsement key pair and certificate the
anonymous credential.  That way you can use the endorsement key and
certificate directly rather than having to obtain (blinded) identity
certificates from a privacy CA and trust the privacy CA not to issue
identity certificates without seeing a corresponding endorsement
credential.

However the idea with the identity certificates is that you can use
them once only and keep fetching new ones to get unlinkable anonymity,
or you can re-use them a bit to get pseudonymity where you might use a
different psuedonym for a different service where you are anyway
otherwise linkable to a given service.

With Brands credentials the smart card setting allows you to have more
compact and computationally cheap control of the credential from
within a smart card which you could apply to the TPM/SCP.  So you can
fit more (unnamed) pseudonym credentials on the TPM to start with.

You could perhaps more simply rely on Brands credential lending
discouraging feature (ability to encode arbitrary values in the
credential private key) to prevent break once virtualize anywhere.

For discarding pseudonyms and when you want to use lots of pseudonyms
(one-use unlinkable) you need to refresh the certificates you could
use the refresh protocol which allows you to exchange a credential for
a new one without trusting the privacy CA for your privacy.

Unfortunately I think you again are forced to trust the privacy CA not
to create fresh virtualized credentials.  Perhaps there would be
someway to have the privacy CA be a different CA to the endorsement CA
and for the privacy CA to only be able to refresh existing credentials
issued by the endorsement CA, but not to create fresh ones.

Or perhaps some restriction could be placed on what the privacy CA
could do of the form if the privacy CA issued new certificates it
would reveal it's private key.

"Also relevant is An Efficient System for Non-transferable Anonymous
Credentials with Optional Anonymity Revocation", Jan Camenisch and
Anna Lysyanskaya, Eurocrypt 01

These credentials allow the user to do unlinkable multi-show without
involving a CA.  They are somewhat less efficient than Chaum or Brands
credentials though.  But for this application does this removes the
need to trusting a CA, or even have a CA: the endorsement key and
credential can be inserted by the manufacturer, can be used
indefinitely many times, and are not linkable.

As you point out unlinkable anonymity tends to complicate revocation.

I think Camenisch's optional anonymity revocation has similar
properties in allowing a designated entity to link credentials.

Another less "TTP-based" approach to unlinkable but revocable
credentials is Stubblebine's, Syverson and Goldschlag, "Unlinkable
Serial Transactions", ACM Trans on Info Systems, 1999:

	http://www.stubblebine.com/99tissec-ust.pdf

(It's quite simple you just have to present and relinquish a previous
pseudonym credential to get a new credential; if the credential is due
to be revoked you will not get a fresh credential.)


I think I would define away the problem of local breaks.  I mean the
end-user does own their own hardware, and if they do break it you
can't detect it anyway.  If it's anything like playstation mod-chips
some proportion of the population would in fact would do this.  May be
1-5% or whatever.  I think it makes sense to just live with this, and
of course not make it illegal.  Credentials which are shared are
easier to revoke -- knowledge of the private keys typically will
render most schemes linkable and revocable.  This leaves only online
lending which is anyway harder to prevent.
