  The question you have to ask yourself is, not how *I* got a story from
  "Pink News", but how *Free Republic* go it. :-)

  Spain grants transsexuals new identities


  The move by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government, is
  being welcomed by transsexuals

  12-May-2006
  Marc Shoffman

  Transsexuals in Spain will be allowed to change identity documents without
  undergoing sex change operations, according to reports.

  The law is expected to be produced this summer and will allow a man to
  undertake a woman's identity and vice versa if they can live as the
  opposite sex for 18 months and be approved be a psychiatrist.

  The move by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government, is
  being welcomed by transsexuals and activists.

  It comes just a year after Spain introduced gay marriages for same sex
couples.

  Although it will not apply to social security , the law will avoid problems
  transsexuals usually encounter with identity documents.

  Meanwhile the Spanish Province of Malaga has had one of its first case of
  domestic violence in a gay marriage this week.

  Police patrolling the island saw a fight between the lesbian couple, who
  were one of the first to marry on the Island, and intervened after one of
  the women had fallen to the floor and was being kicked, officials claim.

  However, the victim has decided not to press charges, claiming her partner
  is depressed.

  In July 2005, Spain became the third country to legalise same sex marriage,
  after the Netherlands and Belgium.
