A couple of more words on this issue:

Granted, the conference gets publicity. But, presumably, the magazine or 
other outlet gets readers and viewers. A two-way street, right?

"Wired" and "Wired News" are businesses. If covering CFP is good 
business, paying their costs to attend sounds like a sound business 
decision.

Honestly speaking, I see a lot more economic justification for 
Terra-Lycos to pay $600 (or whatever) for Declan's registration fees, 
and then count these as business costs, than I see economic 
justification for Tim May, say, to pay $600 to attend (and not be able 
to deduct it in any way).

Which is why conferences like CFP mostly end up with a predictable mix 
of lawyers, government officials (probably comped to attend, though I 
don't know this), and journalists. And which is why the panels end up 
with a lot of journalists pontificating to each other.

(Based on the two CFPs I attended...)

Frankly, I don't understand why CFP doesn't just accept the inevitable 
and move the conference to Washington, D.C. permanently.
