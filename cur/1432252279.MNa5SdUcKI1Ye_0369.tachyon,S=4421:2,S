The canonical example is of an escrow agent handling a deposit by a 
buyer of an untraceable killing. When the killer presents the 
appropriate form of evidence that this happened, and that he or she 
was "there" (*), the escrow holder pays.

"You slay, we pay!"

(Details of what the evidence might be are for the market to shake out.)

(I have been using this example since 1988. Not as an advocacy of 
contract killings, but as an illustration of the issue. This scheme 
is different from AP, which is a lottery form.)


Can the buyer of the hit renege? The  escrow agent already holds the 
digital cash. (This assumes nonrepudiable digital cash.)
