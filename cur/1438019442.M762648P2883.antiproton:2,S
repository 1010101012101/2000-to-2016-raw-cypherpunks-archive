The HackRF contains a LPC4320 which has unused capacity for light DSP and other =
tasking. For any heavy DSP it could use a FPGA. It has an internal header for =
expansions like this (and/or a higher resolution ADC and its CPLD can be reflashed =
to accomodate such changes.

The HackRF, like all wideband, direct conversion, receivers, can suffer  LNA =
saturation from nearby/very strong out-of-band signals (pagers and  FM broadcasts). =
A cheap, simple, solution is a coax notch filter, in  line with the antenna. =

Here's my idea for a probe for an RF device.  The wavelength of a 2.45 GHz =
signal (WiFi) is about 12 cm.  A quarter-wave antenna would be 3 cm.  Or, that =
3 cm could be in the form of a loop, at the end of a piece of.'hardline', or =
other coaxial cable.   (hardline would be best, I think, because it is a small =
diameter.  )        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable   So, the diameter =
of the loop would be a bit more than 1 cm diameter, which is appropriate for =
finding tiny RF sources.  One side of the loop would be connected to the center =
conductor of the coax, and the other side of the loop connected to the shield =
of the coax.
 
Note:  The coax should probably have many dissipative RF beads strung along =
its length, in order to prevent the cable itself from picking up RF, and delivering =
to the loop on the end, thereby to be detected.  http://www.amidoncorp.com/small-ferrite-beads/ =
    There are many different kinds of materials that such beads are made from; =
perhaps we can have an RF engineer chime in on the subject.  He can also tell =
us if the loop is too-badly mismatched (RF impedence) to the coax to function =
well.
