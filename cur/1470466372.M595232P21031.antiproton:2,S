I will explain what I think they are doing in the fiber-optic version of th=
e experiment,at least so nobody is permanently misled by my previous analog=
y.
Imagine a central location on earth, let's call it Location B. =C2=A020,500=
 meters west of=C2=A0that is Location A, and 20,500 meters to the east of "=
B" is Location C. =C2=A0There's anoptical fiber going from "A" to "B", and =
another optical fiber going from "B" to "C".Two entangled photons are produ=
ced at Location B, then one is launched into=C2=A0fiber going to "A", and t=
he other photon is launched from "B" into the fiber going to "C".
After about 100 microseconds later (since the speed of light in that fiber =
is about=C2=A0'c'/1.4584, where 1.4584 is the index of refraction of infrar=
ed in silica, thus 205.5=C2=A0meters /microsecond), those photons emerge fr=
om their respective ends. =C2=A0Notnecessarily at the same time, because th=
e length of the fibers may not be quiteidentical. =C2=A0They do the detecti=
on at Location A, and through prior arrangement theyschedule the detection =
at "C" a few nanoseconds later, possibly adjusting the physical=C2=A0length=
 of the fiber to get the timing close to being correct.. =C2=A0Good synchro=
nization=C2=A0could be achieved by GPS-controlled clocks, or perhaps a thir=
d fiber being used to=C2=A0synchronize local clocks at "A" and "C".
They first detect at "A", and then detect at "C". =C2=A0And they might reve=
rse the order, forcompleteness. =C2=A0But that's not the end:To determine t=
hat there has been more than a 50% correlation of the measured spins, they =
haveto transmit the type (angle) of measurement they make by ordinary optic=
al fiber. =C2=A0(Although,it wouldn't have to be on an optical fiber: =C2=
=A0It could be a USB memory stick glued to theshell of a fast snail, I supp=
ose. =C2=A0the important thing is that the information eventually getsto th=
e other side, not how fast it takes to get there.)
=C2=A0=C2=A0The information eventually gets to the other end, and they do t=
he calculations andverify that SOMEHOW, the fact that a measurement at "A" =
somehow affected themeasurement at "C". =C2=A0 If they "schmoo plot" (meani=
ng carefully adjust, then plot on a graph)=C2=A0=C2=A0https://en.wikipedia.=
org/wiki/Shmoo =C2=A0=C2=A0, they can determine how fast some affecting par=
ticle or signal would have to travel to affect the receiver at the=C2=A0oth=
er end. =C2=A0Since the delay from Location "A" to "Location "C" would be (=
100+100) =3D 200 microseconds=C2=A0in a fiber, it would be 200/1.4584 =3D 1=
37.136 microseconds from location A to location C,by air. =C2=A0(or in a va=
cuum, or by radio, etc.)
That figure I found from an article a few years ago, that said it would hav=
e to travel at=C2=A0least 10,000x that of 'c' to affect the measurement, wo=
uld require that the delay is measured by:137.136 microseconds/10,000 =3D 1=
3.7126 nanoseconds. =C2=A0 If the measurement at "A"=C2=A0occurred only 13.=
7136 nanoseconds before the measurement at "C", and yet there wasstill corr=
elation, this shows that a velocity of at least 10,000 'c' to affect the ou=
tcome at "C".
Therefore, I conclude that it would be easy to measure the minimum effectiv=
e speed of the=C2=A0
hypothetical interfering particle or wave. =C2=A0That particle or wave woul=
d have to travel 41,000meters in less than 13.7 nanoseconds, to achieve tha=
t interference. =C2=A0Time measurement to 1=C2=A0nanosecond is easy, to 1 p=
icosecond is doable, and in fact measurement of time valuesfar less than 1 =
picosecond can be accomplished.
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Jim Bell
