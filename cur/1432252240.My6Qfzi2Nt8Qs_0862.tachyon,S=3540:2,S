According to the Reuters account below, it was Robertson, not 
Mowbray,  who called for the State Department nuking.

A Virginia citizen who would be nuked if State is, has reported
Robertson to the FBI TIPS, observing that a Muslim cleric who
made such a comment would surely be arrested or detained.

Robertson's fatwah, even so, is worth admiring as a frustrated
fundy fire and brimstone featherduster. Whether he would call 
for the same atomization of other useless breastbeaters like 
himself is a question for Tammy Faye.

State Department Protests Televangelist's Remark
Fri Oct 10,10:48 AM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department has protested 
to televangelist Pat Robertson about his "despicable" suggestion 
that someone blow up the department with a nuclear bomb, an 
official said on Thursday.   

Robertson, a former presidential candidate, made the remark in 
an interview with Joel Mowbray, author of a new book entitled 
"Dangerous Diplomacy: How the State Department Endangers 
America's Security." 

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked to comment, 
said on Thursday: "I lack sufficient capabilities to express my disdain.
 ... I think the very idea is despicable." 

The department has made its views clear to Robertson, added a 
State Department official, who asked not to be named. 

Introducing Mowbray on his Christian Broadcasting Network, 
Robertson said that a person who read Mowbray's book would 
reach the conclusion that a nuclear explosion at the State 
Department was the best solution. 

"I read your book. When you get through, you say (to yourself): 
'If I could just get a nuclear device inside Foggy Bottom (the State 
Department's main building), I think that's the answer' and you 
say: 'We've got to blow that thing up.' I mean, is it as bad as you 
say?" he said. 

"It is," Mowbray replied. 

Mowbray himself did not make the suggestion, either in his book 
or in the interview. According to the network's Web site, Mowbray's 
book "exposes the mixed allegiances, hidden agendas, and 
outright anti-Americanism found in the State Department."
