Whoa.

Permuting word choice in opening sentences seems like a way more
resource intensive way of doing things than most journal publishers
could do -- especially since the source materials are a mix of Word and
latex.

I wonder if this is because Andrew gets PDFs from government agency-type
places, as a Tor Project staff member.

This is scary from a leaker's perspective -- you'd have to get two (or
more) different copies of any given watermarked document and merge them
in some way to obfuscate the original source.
