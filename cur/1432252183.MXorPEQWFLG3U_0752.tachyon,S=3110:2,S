 >>> Fisk is one of those rare beasts,a truthful journalist.

 >>I was filled with rage when I read him piously declare that he 
understands why they're angry and doesn't hold it against them at all.

Doesn't seem to take much does it jimmy?,communal,libertarian socialists 
pick that up on subtle signals from you.{ I vigorously  declare that Im 
sorry the 4th plane didnt wipe out the W/house.or Congress/rest of 
pentagon.btw.}

 >> Such saintly piety reminds me of Heng Samrin. --digsig James A. Donald

Hengs famous for that , I guess.What a journo! Sure you dont mean Wilfred B?

All roads led into a morass,in my days.
Words gave us away to the executioner.
There was little I could do.yet our rulers
would have been happier without me,I hoped
Thus passed the time
allotted to me on this earth.

"For those born after us",by Bertolt Brecht.
