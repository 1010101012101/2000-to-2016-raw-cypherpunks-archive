Fair Warning: I never, that I recall, responded to some of the inanities 
here that got a few people prosecuted. I think that this save me from 
being subpoenaed. I will respond below to the "mattd" rainman because I 
choose to. And if it results in a subpoena for me to fly to Australia 
for some trial, I will of course ignore it.

I have no idea who you really are, "mattd," except that I hear you 
deface McDonald's restaurants and may or may not be under indictment or 
whatever by the Australian cops. Your calls to have George Bush Jr. 
killed have likely drawn interest from the polizei.  From your posts 
here, you look to have the same mental state that C.J. Parker had/has, 
and that maybe other have. To wit: fragmented sentences, discombobulated 
logic, weird juxtapositions of words. I'm beginning to think there's a 
"Rainman Syndrome" at work.

But in the event that you are not too addled to think straight, the very 
idea of a "libertarian socialist" is an oxymoron.

It doesn't compute.

Sure, we are "libertarian socialists" in a sense within our families or 
circles of friends, in a manner of speaking, but we are not coerced by 
external agents to be nice, or socialist, to our family and friends. 
Therein lies the reason why "libertarian socialist" is such an oxymoron.

If you think about this in a lucid period, you will realize why this is 
so.
