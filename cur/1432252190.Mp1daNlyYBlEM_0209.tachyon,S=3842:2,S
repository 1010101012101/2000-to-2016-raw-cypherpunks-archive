I don't have to whitelist anyone. If mail doesn't get to me, less junk 
to read. I certainly won't be running some "Pennyblacknet" scam 
promulgated by Microsoft.

This "pennyblack" silliness fails utterly to address the basic 
ontological issue: that bits in transit are not being charged by the 
carriers (if by their own choice, fine, but mostly it's because systems 
were set up in a socialist scheme to ensure "free transport"...now that 
the free transport means millions of e-mails are charged nothing, they 
want the acapitalist system fixed, they hope, with either government 
laws or silliness about using memory speeds to compute stamp 
numbers...silliness).

I haven't looked closely at the Pennyblack scheme, but I expect 
cleverness with caches and background tasks will fix things. For 
example, maybe people with idle CPU/memory time will sell their time to 
spammers, at suitably close-to-zero rates. (Essentially equivalent to 
Joe Sixpack selling his machine as a spam machine, which is probably 
likely, and still cheap for the sender.)

Fixing the fundamental market distortion is the best approach to 
pursue. Not my problem.
