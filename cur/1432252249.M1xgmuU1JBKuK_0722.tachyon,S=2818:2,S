The question is: why should we bother? Tall buildings have intrinsically
bad volume to crossection ratio, by definition. Both the static and the
infrastructure is vulnerable, so the efforts would be far better spent by
decentralizing the society. Monkeys want to see monkeys, fine. We have
video projectors and AR avatars for that, and last time I looked most of
the fiber was idle.
