I asked a lawyer who does real estate development: 

>> I'm having a prolonged flame with someone, and I'm afraid they're right.
>> I'm claiming there are regulations about what you must have *in your house
>> (single-family dwelling) right now* vs. when you sell it.  But I may
>> be wrong.  I've searched online law resources for regs about houses,
>> but they all seem to be enforced only when you sell.  Know any rules
>> about equiptment you must have in modern houses?

He replied: 
>The rules are generally construction rules set forth in the state and local
>building codes; they are regulations, not statutes for the most.  They cover
>everything  from structure (foundation thickness, earthquake requirements in
>CA, wind load engineering standards in FL.  As far as equipment, I don't

>Then there are equipment specific regulations, such as the 3.5 gal toilets,
>the safety garage door openers.  There are also separate electrical codes
that
>mandate wall outlets every  so many feet, what kind of wiring can be used.
>There are plumbing codes that will require a bathroom with a toilet, tub,
>lavatory, etc. in each house.  Some building codes go so  far as to require

So Tim is right --there are no constraints on his property, unless he wants
to improve or sell it.  

Or the government needs it for a freeway...
