Not always.  If you refused to have your site "reviewed", then they would
literally make one up.

Yes, you are stating that implicitly.

I agree with this ONLY as far as they have actually had an encounter to
review.  To "review" my site as a series of open relays, as retailiation
for my refusing to let this asshole connect to my site, is bullshit.

And it remains bullshit whether or not you try to muddy the waters with
completely off topic references to Choate.

And to allow them to MAKE UP what they say is pure libel.

Good riddance to bad trash.  Now that ORBS is dead, when are you going to
follow their fine example Declan?

Yours,

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
