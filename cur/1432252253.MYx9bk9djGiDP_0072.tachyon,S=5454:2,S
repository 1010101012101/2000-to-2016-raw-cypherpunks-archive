STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

Attn:   DEAR PARTNER

    Seeking for a Dedicated and Committed Partnership
in a Business Proposal Worth US$26.5m. Through some
discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, you
and your organization were revealed as being quite
astute in private entreprise. On this premise, we have
no doubt in your ability to handle a financial
business of considerable amount, which will form the
bedrock of an extensive business partnership in due
course.                                               
   In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on your

status, as a respected executive of your company to 
believe that you will handle it with all sincerity and

accord it absolute confidentiality that it deserves. 
Being the secretary to the panel that is reviewing 
the award of past project that discovered this fund, I

have been mandated to open a business relationship 
with you on this mutually beneficial opportunity. 
This business involves the remittance of US$26.million

(Twenty Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand dollars) 
only into your bank account from our apex bank where 
this fund has been lying idle in a suspense account. 
The money accrued through deliberate over-invoicing of

old project executed for the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation by some foreign firms. We have 
worked out this scheme to benefit us along with any 
foreign partner who obliges us the materials 
and channel to transfer out the fund into his/her 
nominated account with a view to traveling down to 
meet you thereafter so that we can have our share. 
  If you would assist or participate in this deal,
then please endeavor to get in touch with me
immediately through email,my telephone or fax line as
stated above. This is my personal and confidential
line and though the route might be busy, just keep on
trying until you get through. In picking on you for
this business, please note that your expertise has
been taken into consideration, as you will be required
to guide us through a wise investment of our share of
the fund in a viable and profitable venture in your
country. 
   In the world over, bigger firms who bid for various

contracts especially in third world countries like
ours can sub-contract some of them to other firms for
execution. That is your firm will be regarded as one
of those that executed one of such projects and
therefore entitle to receive the contract value. Be
rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free
as there is actually no risk involved either now or in
the future for we are well connected in official
circle. 
   Given our level of commitment at the moment, we
want to assure you that with full dedication on your
part, the objective of having this fund remitted would
have been realized within a period of two weeks. It is
hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end
of the transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the
entire sum, which you are free to withdraw as soon as
you confirm that the fund has been remitted into your 
account. 
  I am awaiting your response most urgently whether
you are interested or not to enable me know the next
move to make. Endeavour to contact me as soon as
possible so as to expediate action on this
transaction.  Thanks.
 
Best regards, 
Mr Tunji adebowale.
