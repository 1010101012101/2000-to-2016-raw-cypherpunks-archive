Osama et al suffer from the belief that Americans chose their leaders
and thus are responsible for their actions.  They also observe that
the only language americans understand is dead civilians inside the
CONUS.
Ergo WTC feedback.

Tim McV may have somewhat analogously assumed that all Feds would
take notice of his feedback.

(In addition, the WTC demolishion got a disproportionate number
of jews, just as Okla did get a few BATF goons.  But the message was
more generally intended.)

Consider: If a crip whacks your homey, you needn't pop *that* crip to
make your
point.  Any crip will do.  Snipe a few tax collectors and all Caesar's
centurions
take note.

Capiche?
