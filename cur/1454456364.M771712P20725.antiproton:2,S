Racism and nationalism are two sides of the same coin. The Nazis were first
and foremost nationalists. They tied race and religion into their national
identity, but those were secondary to their notion of the German Nation.
The fact that this person leaves out the race part and instead focuses on
language doesn't make this speech any less fascist. The part about
"individual identity" is absolute nonsense; what if your ethnic identity
happens to be important to you? Too bad! This principal only cares about
your "individual" identity if that individual happens to identify as
Australian.

I'm glad this is actually a hoax. I'm also glad that I'm not the only one
pointing out the nationalist elephant in the room. There ARE legitimate
problems with multiculturalism, but the real problem is when people refuse
to acknowledge one another's identities, and instead try to erase them the
way the fictitious principal in this speech does. When people stand along
the street at Cinco de Mayo celebrations and wave American flags, as they
did this year in a small town near where I live, what they're saying is "My
own sense of identity is so weak that I can't handle other people
expressing identities that are significantly different from mine." Those
are the kind of people who vote for Hitlers. And Trumps. And Putins.
