The RIAA execesses are bad, but my point is that government is worse:
imagine what the government could do to the music industry if it
converted it into a state-run monopoly.  What is worse about
governments is that they are not even optimized for profitability (of
the economy as a whole, viz 50%+ marginal tax rates with most of the
proceeds burnt off with no retained value for anyone).  Also virtual
monopolies on the business side are not monopolies in the same way
that government is: you can buy independent music, you can not buy
music distributed by the most abusive distributors etc.
