the report

includes the following from the above ...

The "real-world" viability of the proposed ANSI X9.59 standard concept for
electronic payments using public/private key pairs, which is also known as
Account Authority Digital Signature (AADS), was validated by the ISAP Pilot
results. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using PKI without
digital certificates, thereby minimizing infrastructure requirements and
costs for utilizing the ISAP process.

Welcome to NACHA

Welcome to the web site of NACHA - The Electronic Payments Association.
Here you will find the latest information on the innovative and dynamic
world of electronic payments.

Electronic payments of all kinds are used frequently by people, companies,
and government agencies as a safe, reliable and convenient way to conduct
business. Direct Deposit is used for payroll, travel and expense
reimbursements, annuities and pensions, dividends, and government payments
such as Social Security and Veterans benefits. Other types of electronic
payments are frequently used for bill payments, retail purchases, Internet
purchases, corporate payments and treasury management, and for the
provision of food stamps and other government cash assistance.

NACHA is a not-for-profit trade association that develops operating rules
and business practices for the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network and
for other areas of electronic payments.  NACHA activities and initiatives
facilitate the adoption of electronic payments in the areas of Internet
commerce, electronic bill payment and presentment (EBPP), financial
electronic data interchange (EDI), international payments, electronic
checks, electronic benefits transfer (EBT) and student lending. We also
promote the use of electronic payment products and services, such as Direct
Deposit and Direct Payment.

NACHA represents more than 12,000 financial institutions through our
network of regional ACH associations.  We have over 600 members in our
seven industry councils and corporate Affiliate Membership program.

I hope you will find this web site to be a valuable resource.  Please come
