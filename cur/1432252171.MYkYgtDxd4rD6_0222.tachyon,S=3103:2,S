If I understood it correctly, they want to keep "only" the
traffic-analysis data, the SMTP server logs, not the messages themselves
(though I'd bet they would love to, if it would be reasonably practical).

I am curious if this applies even on provately-operated servers; eg, if
you aren't cheap and instead of an account you buy a colocation server,
with your own mailserver, when the ISP provides only the connection
itself, without additional services.
