Or not - if you weren't who they thought and there really was nothing more
than the gay porn.

Innocents could be a good "cannon fodder" that can bring a lot of
backslash and alienation aganst the goons, stripping them from public
support.

You are one of the few who are familiar with it.

Are there any decent implementations for Linux/BSD/NT? Some time ago I was
looking around for something (not necessarily stego, "standard"
single-layer encrypted filesystem would be enough) for removable media,
and would like to share them between machines running several operation
systems. Didn't manage to find anything usable. The requirements are
security, stability, and portability (at least read-only) between
platforms.

There are magnesium rods on the camping market, sold as firestarters for
very bad weather. Very high temperature of burning, with proper mechanical
configuration (card strapped between two such rods?) could be enough to
melt the chip.

Maybe could be used together with some kind of break-and-shake chemical
ignition even for eg. the USB drives. Their casings typically have
considerable amount of space (few mm, enough for a Mg strip) over the chip
that carries the data themselves.


Which reminds me there are toilets designed for burning the waste using
propane burners or electrical heating elements. Could be possible to use
them as a basis for the "ultimate document shredder", if combined together
with a standard lower-security one, within $2000 total.
