I wasn't singling out Anguilla, just noting it is hardly a 
libertarian paradise.

Having spent a week in Nassau in 1980, that's a close as I want to 
come to moving to the Bahamas or places like that. (The sandy beaches 
were O.K., but not significantly better than here in Carmel--though 
the water's warm enough to snorkel and scuba dive in. But the crimes 
by blacks against whites were horrific: living in a walled compound 
on Paradise Island or on one of the outlying islands was the only 
hope a white man had.)

The "nym" approach to online obscurity is hardly sufficient, Adam. 
After all, I don't want to face hanging for having a firearm. Or 5 
years in the local jail for having a copy of "Penthouse." Or 
deportation for offending the Seven Families. These little Carribean 
potentates are far, far, far worse than what we face in the U.S.

But enough about Anguilla, Nevis, St. Barts, all of the other little 
rocks on the Caribbean.
