They overflew San Jose and Santa Clara, too, headed westbound.

What would a trailing wire like that measure or receive? My limited 
understanding of RF says it'd be good for picking up very low frequency 
emissions or transmissions - but I don't know of any sources of those that 
I'd expect to be of interest, other than those used by US subs and I'm sure 
they have better ways to pick those up.

I'd have expected the interesting intel to be up at the other end of the RF 
spectrum, in the 800-2400 Mhz range with cell phones, cordless phones, 
pagers, 802.11b, etc.  Any ideas?

5000 dead in NYC? National tragedy.
1000 detained incommunicado without trial, expanded surveillance? National 
disgrace.
