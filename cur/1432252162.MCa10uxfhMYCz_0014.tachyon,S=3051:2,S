Papierien, bitte.

Arbeit macht frei is next, I suppose.


Anyone who uses "workers" with a straight face is, for all practical  
purposes, a communist.

But that's okay, Chuckie's only gonna put the *head* in, you see.  
You'll still be a virgin, he promises.


Cheers,
RAH

Bulletin: Democrats in Congress Want Biometic National ID Card for All  
Workers

Washington Post: http://bit.ly/iQ11z

"Reassuring" words from Chuck Schumer:

    "I'm sure the civil libertarians will object to some kind of
     biometric card -- although ... there'll be all kinds of
     protections -- but we're going to have to do it.
     It's the only way."

Isn't that last sentence what Darth Vader said to Luke when trying
to get his son to join him, just after revealing his relationship?

Here we go again.  At least in regards to certain topics, when
it comes to Congress, it's:

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss!
