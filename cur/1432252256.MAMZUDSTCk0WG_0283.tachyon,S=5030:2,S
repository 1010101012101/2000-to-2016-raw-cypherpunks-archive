You think it unlikely they're monitoring your e-mail? How quaint.

The nature of Carnivore has been to "gulp down" with a very wide mouth. 
I expect that those who set up the watch lists simply take all the lists 
they can--of Arabs, of people like us, of political activists, etc.--and 
merge them into a master list. Probably something like 50,000 or so 
names. It costs little to tag these messages.

But I expect the real issue is not Carnivore, which is a fairly clumsy 
way of putting a box at an ISP. Ever so much easier to just sniff the 
networks and grab it all, then filter.

Remember the hoopla about whether the NSA could sniff domestic networks? 
Remember that we have known for many years that the UK/USA agreement 
lets GCHQ sniff our networks, we sniff theirs, and an office at Fort 
Meade then consolidates. Also recall some informed speculation that AT&T 
LongLines were deliberately routed across Indian reservations 
specifically to skirt this issue (according to the source, reservations 
qualify legally as beyond the restrictions on domestic survelliance a la 
Minaret).

And it's all pretty silly to think the Big Ears are *not* listening and 
sniffing. Congressvarmints have already blabbed that the NSA has been 
intercepting _all_ cellphone traffic and it will only be a matter of 
computer crunching to retrieve the cellphone calls from the passengers 
on the doomed flights (and from the suspected terrorists).

Legal niceties about snooping and sniffing are being swept aside in this 
American Jihad.
