Confirmed by 'spycatcher',peter wright.Mi5.Used against the greenham common 
wimmin anti-cruise protestors.
 From Green Anarchist, issue 10, February March 1986, page 4.
Strong signals of up to one hundred times the normal background level of 
electro-magnetic radiations have been detected on a number of occasions. 
They are almost certainly capable of producing harmful effects on human 
beings.
Although high signal levels are to be expected near a military base, the 
highest signals found are some ten times above anything we have recorded on 
the same instruments at other sites.
We have also found that the strongest signals generally appear at those 
places where the women say they have suffered ill effects, and they 
followed a well defined path. Strong signals recorded on one occasion near 
the green gate were found to cover the womens' encampment but stop abruptly 
at the edge of the road leading up to the gate. The signals were also 
absent in the area around the nearby house.
The strength of the signals has also been found on occasion to reflect the 
activity of the women. Signals at scarcely more than the background level 
have been found to increase rapidly when the women start a demonstration.
