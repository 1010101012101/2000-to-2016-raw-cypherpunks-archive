Dear oddodoodo,

Thank you for registering for the Adult Friend Finder site at 
   
    http://adultfriendfinder.com.

*** YOU MUST LOG IN AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE YOUR PROFILE WILL BE LISTED! ***

Below is the handle and password you need to access the site:

          Handle: oddodoodo
        Password: 97875

After you have logged into the site, you may click the
"Update" button to change this password to something
easier to remember.

Your profile will then go to our review team.  Profiles 
are typically reviewed within 2 business days.   We update the 
site every friday - all profiles submitted by noon monday will 
make it into the site on friday.   We will email you when your 
profile is viewable on the site.  You can start emailing 
people as soon as your profile is approved - just remember 
to attach your profile with your email (this will make 
more sense when you see the form on the profile pages).

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact 
us at team@adultfriendfinder.com. 

Thank you,

The Adult Friend Finder Team
