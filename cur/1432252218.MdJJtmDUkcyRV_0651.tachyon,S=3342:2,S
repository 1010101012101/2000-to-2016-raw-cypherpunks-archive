Bullshit, I am not.

I am saying that if you want to print them in such places you can't print
them outside of the 'fair use' clauses. Under current law that is limited
to about 200 lines total in any one work.

If you want to print several of them, or all of them, then you DO need my
permission.

As usual, you couldn't get the point right if it was on top of your head.
