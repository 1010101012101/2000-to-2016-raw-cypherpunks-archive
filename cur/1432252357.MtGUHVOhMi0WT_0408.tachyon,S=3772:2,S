         It's always refreshing to see someone with such a staunch moral 
compass. You would no doubt write excellent Captain American fan fiction.

         Perhaps people should pay better attention to the actions their 
government takes in their name - after all, you never know when somebody 
might take seriously all that talk about the actions of the government 
merely reflecting the will of the people, and in so doing hold your 
blissfully ignorant ass accountable.
