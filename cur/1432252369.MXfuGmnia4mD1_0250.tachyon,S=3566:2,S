An interesting point:  There are ancient inscriptions in Wales  
that no one has been able to read in modern times.  Deciphering 
an unknown langauge, not related to known languages, when it is 
written in an unknown script is a feat of linguistics that 
transcends mere cryptanalysis and has, so far, rarely or never 
been done.  

And, as language, doubtless it has regular structure, patterns, 
grammar, and the flexibility of use that people in everyday lives 
need in speaking - and presumably they're not even encrypted. 

"Poor Man's Crypto", possibly even better than digital crypto, 
may consist in creating an artificial language together, and 
then using it whenever you don't want to be eavesdropped on.
