On the other side of the Iron Curtain, it wasn't the duck and cover
exercises (that never happened, or was before my time), but the
nuclear weapon education posters on the walls. Yeah, these did really
cheer you up.

I also found the AK-47s in the weapon education chamber in
our school slightly unnerving. No idea where the older kids
got trained on weapon handling if at all, that must have been
at higher grades than 7th.
