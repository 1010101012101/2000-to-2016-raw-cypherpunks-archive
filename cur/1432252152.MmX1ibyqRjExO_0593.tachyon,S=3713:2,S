Something interesting happened yesterday, here a summary in case someone
would like to get on it again

* After few hours the pad was vandalized insulting nadim
https://pad.riseup.net/p/silentcircle

* A Backup of the Pad content has been put read-only online (with some
comments and further analysis to be done)
  * http://pastebit.com/pastie/12001
  * http://pastebin.com/dKRPrGMN

* SilentCircle source code has been temporarly removed from Github:
https://github.com/SilentCircle/silent-phone-base

* Nadim opened a ticket to ask about the code back:
https://github.com/SilentCircle/silent-phone-base/issues/1

* A new (different) version of the code has been uploaded online:
https://github.com/SilentCircle/silent-phone-base

* Someone in the meantime put the original code back online (as a zip
archive):
http://jednorog.sneakyness.com/1U060B2S3I1P

* A diff between the "original SC opensource release"  and the "modified
SC opensource release" reveal some code difference
 * Output of git diff "original/silent-phone-base new/silent-phone-base/
> sc.patch" is available at
    http://temp-share.com/show/f3Yg95cXn
