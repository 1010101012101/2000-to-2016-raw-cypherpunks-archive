I don't believe this will suffice.  As I understand the intercept 
methodologies (from both the public perspective and the ISP perspective 
back when the fedz first came calling in 2002/3), NSA is intercepting at 
layer 1: your "hidden services" are waaay up the stack, and have been long 
intercepted by the time you are discussing "hiding" them.

This could be done, in theory at least, but it would require setting up a 
fully meshed vpn with strong encryption to any from all possible 
endpoints.  Think of a COIN, built as a virtual internet, implemented 
completely via VPN backbones and drops.

This is not a simple undertaking.
