As far as any authority is concerned , one bit of SSL traffic is
indistinguishable from any other bit of SSL traffic.  So while current
anonymity models may not be workable in 5 or 10 years, if people are
generating strongly encrypted traffic to arbitrary hosts, _some_ models
will be workable.

Multinational, corporate interests will not allow information security
(SSL, VPNs) to just go away.  Further, if TPTB have "broken" SSL, they
aren't going to tip their hand to the rest of the world to blow the nym
you access twitter with.

I am pessimistic about the march of freedom and the limits of state power,
but these are now basic to all commerce and infrastructure worldwide.  The
cats out of the bag, I'm afraid.

He's lobbying.  He sees the money that cisco, et. al, have made building
the great firewall and he wants a piece of the action.

Let's say this is successful ... it will simply lead to a parallel, mostly
wireless network that is even more decentralized than the current
Internet.  How much does it cost these days to link 10mbps across 10 km ?

In a few years, with "n" hardware flooding the market, how much will it
cost to link 100mbps across 50 km ?

Will there really be any intersection between end users using reactionary,
clueless, least-common-denominator snake oil like this, and users of Tor ?
