So legislate the ACTS, not the speech.

But one *is* guaranteed a whole bunch of privacy rights and
self-determination. If one *wants*, for one reason or another, to engage in
the production of porn, who are you to say it cannot be done? The stuff that
results is then just speech.

Of course it's wrongheaded -- you're confusing the act, and the act of
distributing a record of an act.

Not speech, but not relevant either. What results from recording the acts
*is* speech, and should be treated as such. In fact, even if the original
acts constitute a felony, I think it is a separate issue whether
dissemination of the resulting speech can be controlled. Punish the
pornographer for any provable violation of other people's rights, but do not
touch porn that was produced.

Then there's the nagging question of whether all of the so called child
pornography actually calls for a violation of a minor's rights. I won't go
there here.
