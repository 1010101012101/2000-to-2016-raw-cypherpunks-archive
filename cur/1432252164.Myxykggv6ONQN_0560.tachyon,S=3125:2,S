Don't you hate it when the issues are tangled. It would much nicer if
there were a clean and simple case of free speech but no, it has to be
impure. OTOH the police could be lying about the firecracker and the
struggle knowing that the Constitutional issue is clear ( today anyway )
and wanting to punish the unbeliever. The neighbor is a real piece of
work too. Let's all pitch in and send him a brown shirt.
