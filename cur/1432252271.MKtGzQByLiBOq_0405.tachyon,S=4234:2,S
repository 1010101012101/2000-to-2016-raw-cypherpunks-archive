Christ, Choate, it's bad enough that you spam us with whatever you 
think is of even slight technical interest, including stuff exported 
en masse from Slashdot.

But could you _please_ knock of the spamming of us with junk from 
government announcement lists?

I was doing some consolidating of very old documents, files, etc. 
from several of my older computers and I came across a tickler list 
I'd set to launch on my old Mac IIci when I booted it. The file was 
last edited in 1994, nearly 7 years ago. It had your name on it, 
along with half a dozen or so other names.

"Jim Choate is clueless."

Not much has changed in 7 years, except perhaps that you're more 
stridently clueless.
