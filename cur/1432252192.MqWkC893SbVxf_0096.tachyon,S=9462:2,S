I actually do this for a reason. If I'm not doing a line-by-line response 
(or sometimes even if I am), I want the original post from which I am 
excerpting to be visible, so that it can be referred to and determined I am 
not taking this particular quote out of context.

Well, part of me doesn't entirely disagree. At least, high school teachers 
should be teaching and not babysitting. I actually consider it hard enough 
to develop true competence in math or science (enough to teach on the HS 
level), and then even harder developing the skills necessary to communicate 
the ideas effectively. A math or physics teacher can't be an effective 
babysitter, pal, AND guidance counselor. Or at least, not in the kinds of 
quantities liberals imagine the schools should be filled with.

On the other hand, given the current state of world education in math and 
science, by 9th grade it's not necessarily too late for a kid to turn into a 
good mathematician (actually, I myself am an example: in 9th grade I was in 
a lame but famous private school pulling down low Bs and high Cs in math 
because I was bored. By 12th grade I was in what was and is regarded as THE 
top-notch school for math and science in the country, pulling down 100 in 
calculus...but don't get me wrong, I still know the difference between me 
and true genius in mathematics).

However, the fact is that the school system sucks. It's a joke. Repeat 
offenders get bounced from school to school, wrecking classes and the 
environment everywhere they go. Teachers in most states have 25 classroom 
hours a week, a number matched nowhere in the world (as far as I've ever 
heard), and THAT'S in addition to homeroom and other duties. The cirriculum 
is a silly joke, watered down and watered down so that only someone who 
never shows up couldn't graduate. (And in black schools you'd be suprised 
how many times I've heard 'these kids can't learn...don't try'.)

So your whole "burnoff of the eaters" theme misses one critical element: 
direct contact with kids. If you yourself had seen and met kids you KNEW 
might actually have quite a talent for math, YES EVEN YOU might be tempted 
to give a crap, and see if just one or two might somehow be inspiried merely 
to do some homework. This is particularly true when you realize that you 
actually LIKE some of these kids, which are as fully human as you are, by 
the way.

Or, it might just make you even angrier...give your rage some real, 
practical real-world "fuel" rather than being the theoretical cloistered 
construct it at least appears to be. At least, 'talent' doesn't seem to be 
the problem. Inner-city black kids have proven that they can do extremely 
well in whatever they view as important (I'd argue that some of this is due 
to genetic superiority)...a well-run school system could easily produce the 
kind of math and engineering talent needed without brain-draining from other 
countries (and which is probably not a relaible long-term option).

I don't remember reading any von Neumann where he discusses the idea of 
"general assemblers"....I'm still not convinced the general physics of that 
idea works out, and I believe Freeman Dyson has had some similar doubts. But 
despite that there's a point here...

Hell, you don't have to go that far. Food is already cheap enough that we 
might regard it as being nearly free. I mean, for a couple of bucks you can 
buy enough beef to stuff a welfare family of five, and to feed a rural 
Chinese family for a friggin' week. (Well, at least in the US...) People 
from mainland China would still regard most welfare families as "rich" by 
Chinese standards.

I've also witnessed this trend, but I currently believe it only holds in 
certain segments. There are various "craft" industries (as I call them) 
where this equation seems to be held in suspension. Like it or not, hip hop 
is one of those, though I suppose you could argue that the number of hip-hop 
'artists' that make it is tiny compared to the audience. But the point is 
that in a craft industry, we're really referring to specific and local 
tastes, as opposed to Darwinian selection (ie, the 'most fit'). In a craft 
there may be room for many to contribute. (Other examples of craft 
industries are US high-end audio, the wine industry, high-end marijuana, 
organic foods and cheeses, and the current German-centered board game 
renassaiance.) What's desired in such an envornment is not necessarily the 
best/fastest/brightest, but something with a particularly 'quality' that 
corresponds to local vagaries of culture and taste. (At least, there's no 
other way to explain the success of "Snoop Doggy Dog"...)

This is certainly possible. On the other hand, depending on how technology 
unfolds we might all of a sudden find ourselves caught short and looking for 
talent. And certainly, the have-nots will actually have more and more as 
time goes on, though perhaps not much land or space.

Well, if they have access to general assemblers they'll be with us forever. 
And such a burnoff won't be glorious, it'll be a fuckin' shame.
