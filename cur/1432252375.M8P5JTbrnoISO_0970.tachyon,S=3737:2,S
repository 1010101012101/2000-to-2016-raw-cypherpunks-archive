New Info on Student With Pilot Radio

By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK (AP) - An Egyptian student charged with lying about an aviation
radio found in his hotel room near the World Trade Center on Sept. 11
was in the United States as part of a government-funded program.

Abdallah Higazy was in the United States on a student visa through a
program arranged by the U.S. Agency for International Development,
agency spokeswoman Susan Phalen said Monday. The program trains Egyptian
students in business, health, English and education, often by placing
them at American universities.

Higazy, 30, was enrolled in Polytechnic University in Brooklyn as a
graduate student in computer engineering, according to the university.

Higazy allegedly told the FBI to know nothing of the radio found in a
room safe, but later admitted it was his. Prosecutors said he
acknowledged knowing how to operate the radio, which pilots use to
communicate with other planes and air traffic controllers, but gave
conflicting accounts of how he got it.
