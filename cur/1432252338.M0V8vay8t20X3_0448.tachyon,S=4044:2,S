(yes, this is a long-delayed relpy, as I am just now going over some old
and put-off-till-later emails.)

I have tried several times over the last year or so to reach the PCC via
email, with no success.  Their site has been fairly static, with no
changes I can detect for about the same period.  

It is terribly unfortunate, as they have done some good work, but I
believe this site is dead...

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
