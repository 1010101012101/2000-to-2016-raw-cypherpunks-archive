Why these 'social launches' work for crappy apps is becuase the windows
writers cater to and know the forum using, bling ridden, pop, idiot-sphere.

While cpunk writers / good apps such as might be found below have
historically shied away from that catering/knowing, there is no reason
they cannot engage it, or that they cannot partner with people that do
to enable their own social launch.

I don't agree. If you do not design for say 2bn users upfront
(as is the general subject of this thread re: nexgen global p2p solutions)
and instead target 200k or less, you will hit major roadblocks that
are very difficult to rip out and cure becuase your entire mindset
from day one was only scaling to a dreamy 200k. Mindset and failure
to think big traps projects like these, and if they somehow capture
and grow users they'll get overloaded to the point of unusability.
The best case they then embarrasingly have is to take a year
basically rewriting from scratch, or they fail and users move on.
And once a project hits unusability issues, that is a hard image to
shake... fool me once. This is a classic issue in systems history,
where better upfront design would have prevented it. The examples
are plenty, there's really no excuse anymore.

The p2p pooled anon secure model is interesting. I think MaidSecure
was the most recent thing making the rounds in this area. Maybe
FreeNet is also similar.
