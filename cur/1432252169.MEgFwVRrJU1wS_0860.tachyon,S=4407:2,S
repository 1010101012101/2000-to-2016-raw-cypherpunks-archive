Anyone doing "security" had better assume software can and will be
broken.  That's where you *start*.

Yes, this the problem with security today.  That's why lots of people
are advocating that the OS should be built from the ground up with
security as the prime goal rather than ad hoc addons as it is now.
Nobody wants to pay for it tho :-)

So what's the point of TCPA if a few hackers can steal the most
expensive data?  Are you now admitting TCPA is broken?  You've got
me very confused now!

I'm actually really confused about the whole DRM business anyway.  It
seems to me that any data available to human perceptions can be
duplicated.  Period.  The idea of DRM (as I understand it) is that you can
hand out data to people you don't trust, and they can't copy it.  To me,
DRM seems fundamentally impossible.

Patience, persistence, truth,
