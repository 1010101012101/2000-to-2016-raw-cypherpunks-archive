DNI et al... looking and waiting for "the perfect example"... cue the
911 conspiracies...

So let’s not be taken in by false flags flown by anonymous officials
trying to mask bad political decision-making. And let’s redouble our
efforts to fight bad policy which seeks to entrench a failed ideology
of mass surveillance — instead of focusing intelligence resources
where they are really needed

The Enabling Act, when used ruthlessly and with authority, virtually
assured that Government could thereafter constitutionally exercise
dictatorial power without legal objection.
They offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not
to threaten the Lawmakers, the President, the States or the Churches
if granted the emergency powers.
