Witness the awesome 11km high CO2 destructive power of Eyjafjallajokull:

Donations can be sent to my personal account.

Thank you and regards,
Zenaan

PS 11km high is quite impressive, even for a volcano - this beast must
be stopped!

PS2 The following is a rather interesting link, bringing into question
a few things, hopefully its purported facts are factual:
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/climate.php

PS3 But do note the precise wording by the Professor below - one would
hope his wording is precise since he is a professor and all...

Where Does the Carbon Dioxide Really Come From?

Professor Ian Plimer could not have said it better!




PLIMER: "Okay, here's the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in Iceland.
Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS,
NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to
control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.

Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying
to suppress - it's that vital chemical compound that every plant
requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans
and all animal life. I know it's very disheartening to realize that
all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while
suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids,
buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your
kids "The Green Revolution" science project, throwing out all of your
non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet paper,
putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and
speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad.   Nearly getting hit
every day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs
with $10.00 light bulbs.

Well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes
in just four days. The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's
atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in
Iceland has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce
the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on
the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.

I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should
mention that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines
in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than
the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.   Yes,
folks, Mt Pinatubo was active for over One year - think about it.

Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment
and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the
well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps
happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect
climate change. And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic
ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season
across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your
efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years.
And it happens every year.

Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping
carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused'
climate-change scenario.   Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't
mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just 'Climate Change'- you know
why?

It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century
and these global warming bull artists got caught with their pants
down. And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions
Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will
achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer. It won't stop any
volcanoes from erupting, that's for sure.   But, hey, relax and have a
nice day anyway.
