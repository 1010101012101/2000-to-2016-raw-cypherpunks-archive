  New RIPA Act powers puts data security at risk

  Posted by Rene Millman at 10:52AM, Monday 27th November 2006

  Encryption expert warns that new police powers will open up "a host of
  management problems" for companies


  New powers to allow police to decrypt data for evidence will risk
  compromising data confidentiality and security, an encryption expert warned.

  New powers under Part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
  2000 (RIPA), which comes into effect in the next few months, allows law
  enforcement officers to gain access to encryption keys needed to decrypt
  data which could be vital for a conviction.

  But according to Dr. Nicko Van Someren, chief technology officer at
  nCipher, the new powers open up "a host of management problems".

  "Company executives will have to disclose encryption keys without opening
  up security holes or face up to five years in prison; while law enforcement
  officers face legal action if they fail to adequately secure evidentiary
  keys leading to loss or consequential damage," said Van Someren. "It is
  clear that sophisticated key management systems will be needed to avoid the
  possibility of the misuse of disclosed keys or breaches of data protection
  laws."

  Many financial institutions and other organisations are concerned about
  data security and conflicts with data privacy rights as a result of RIPA
  part III. Since companies can be held liable for the accidental or
  negligent disclosure of customer information, the keys used to protect
  customer data are just as valuable as those used for banking transactions.

  The new legislation means businesses have to implement strict control over
  encryption and to provide authorised access to keys. According to Van
  Someren, making copies of cryptographic keys is "not a safe option".

  "Businesses and authorities need to adopt best practice already used by
  many banks and security conscious companies," he said. "RIPA part III
  places a heavy duty of disclosure on companies and organisations; but it
  also places a burden of care and security on the law enforcement
  authorities."
