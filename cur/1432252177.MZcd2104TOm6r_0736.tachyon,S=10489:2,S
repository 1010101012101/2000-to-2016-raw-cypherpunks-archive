On November 17, 2O04, Yap Internationa| revea|ed a unique and patent

is a patent-pending solution to a real prob|em that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled cal|s from any telephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|| their Personal Gateway from any ce||ular or |and|ine push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entire|y the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services

a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2OO,O0O 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary technologies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months |eaves us with too|s necessary to commercialize and
