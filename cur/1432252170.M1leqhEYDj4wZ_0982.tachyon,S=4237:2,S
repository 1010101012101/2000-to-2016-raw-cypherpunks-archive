Because the consumers really want it. The fatal mistake of thinking it is 
because "They" put it there misses the far more unsettling aspect that *we* 
are voting with our wallets to produce a transparent, trackable world with 
smart gadgets.

Some of that is an accidental side effect (consider EFFs interesting  
demonstraiton that our browser customisation makes us identifiable:  
https://panopticlick.eff.org/ ) - many of these side effects suprise the  
Powers That Be too (consider all leaks due to improper redaction of PDFs). 
But I think what most people honestly do want is a world that has "magical 
properties" of transparency and services for them that also produce 
transparency for others - and they are not willing to pay much money or 
effort to reduce this information leakage.

If it was just They who did things, we could in principle stop Them. But  
now it is *us* who are doing it, and we are unlikely to stop ourselves.

At least that is the common assumption. Given the growing number of more  
or less embarassing mistakes, there is a realy issue of false positives.  
Plotters are rare: people looking like plotters are far more common.

The really interesting thing is when this ability percolates downwards.  
Right now companies like Acxiom and Facebook are using similar methods. In 
a few years it will be feasible for smaller groups and individuals to do 
big data mining too.

I suspect the best strategy is to get people aware that we are careening  
into the transparent society, that we better get ultra-tolerant, and that 
we better get strong accountability measures into place to keep  
governments and other concentrations of power safe and sane.
