So I have two types of issuer.  The currency issuer (let's call them mints
to avoid confusion).  Ray has every one a mint (potentially, some users may
choose to use other peoples mints to avoid having to manage the reputation
of their own).  Floating exchange rates based on reptuation of the mint.

Then we have an issuer of one use (and hence unlinkable) credentials
representing the reputation of the mint.  So these are reputation credential
issuers.  My thought was that there would similarly be reputation credential
issuers -- (potentially) everyone a reputation credential issuer.

Also Stubblebine et al have a paper about abuse control with unlinkable
anonymous credentials.  They way they do this is to have one unlinkable
credential which you can show only once.  Then you can trade it for a fresh
unlinkable credential if there have been no complaints against the current
credential.  Because the fresh credential is freshly blinded it's not
linkable.  And yet you retain some scope for abuse control, if the proof of
misconduct arrives before you've handed over the new credential.  (The
Stubblebine paper doesn't say much more than that.  Do a web search if you
want the paper.  It was in the context of unlinkable subscriptions to
services, where you want to renew, but the service operator wants the
ability to cancel abusers of their AUP's subscriptions.)

Seems like this might be usable here.

This seems like a technology trust issue.  It seems just to do with
branding, advertising and common acceptance.  A mag-swipe card could fail, a
bank could empty your acount, their security could fail and someone else
empty your account via ATM.  People trust the systems because their friends
trust them and seem to use them without incident and they want to use the
system because of convenience or some other useful attribute.

Ray's scheme sounds interesting because it's a computer mediated Letts
scheme.  Letts schemes seem to exist with manual book-keeping.

Also trust levels needed to trust in something as a value store are much
higher than purely as a immediately cleared payment mechanism.  With the
reputation system you could even have insurance.
