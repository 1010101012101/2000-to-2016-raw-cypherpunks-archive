Nice.  Right on.

I would file pro-se suits arguing various types of malfeasance, perhaps one 
for every database and document that I wanted.  And encourage others to do 
so.

For one thing, the US government is limited in what copyrights they can 
hold.  It used to be said they couldn't hold copyrights at all, and I've 
seen documents explicitly put into the public domain by NASA and others on 
that grounds.  Copyright validity is less certain for a government agency 
than for an individual or corporation.

http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/apr09/Klein.shtml

Additionally, you can argue fair use and public right to know.

Pay for a document and sue to get a refund.  Appeal the inevitable brush off.

File claims against agencies with the agencies, the prerequisite to filing 
a suit against them.  When you do file a suit, file creative pre-trial 
discovery.  Subpoena relevant tax records.

There's more than one way to fix a broken system.  While you may have to 
pay some small court fees ($50, $74, etc.) and spend some time watching on 
hearing day, they'll have to pay for expensive attorneys.

There seem to only be a few thing places where you can't represent yourself and even those are something that should be tested.
