Some folks who didn't send theirs in did get visits by (otherwise
unemployable) censusworkers.  They went away when told to do so,

My favorite census story was the (true) one where the (nice old lady
working for the Fedz) census worker got literally eaten by the dozen or so
dogs some nonresponding dude kept in his yard.
