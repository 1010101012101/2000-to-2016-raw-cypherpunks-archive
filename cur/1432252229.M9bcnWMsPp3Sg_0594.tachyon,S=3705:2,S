Back when Osama bin Laden was accused of the African US embassy bombings,
the Clinton administration decided they had to Do Something Decisive,
so they fired off about 75 cruise missiles at
"Osama's Chemical/Biological Warfare Factory" (somebody's legitimate
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan) and another place he was rumored to hang out.
It's not clear whether this sets him up for Double Jeopardy protection
if anybody takes the $5M reward and rats on him, because they didn't
bother with the formalities of a trial, just a declaration of guilt
followed by punishment, but it was Constitutionally pretty dodgy.
And if it's not strictly targeting innocents while knowing they're innocent,
failing to find out the facts before attacking people with missiles
is sufficiently negligent that I'd count it in the same category.

I think the US did pay off the factory owner after finding out
that they'd screwed up.  I don't know how many people got killed
in the process, though.
