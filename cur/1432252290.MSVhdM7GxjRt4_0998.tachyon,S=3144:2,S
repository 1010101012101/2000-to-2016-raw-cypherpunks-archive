I'm on minder, specifically because I don't like someone else
determining what I read, even with the best of intentions.

Most mornings I come in to see 5-10 spam mixed in with the
real traffic. It's usually very easy to spot, based on subject
line, and gets deleted unread. Every 2-3 months, some 
spammer gets in a loop and plasters many, many identical 
messages, but that's easy to delete. ('Sort by Subject' is your
friend). 

It costs me less than 30 seconds/day to get an uncensored
list,  which I regard as a bargain. YMMV. If I was on a 
slow dialup, or paid by the byte, I might think different.
