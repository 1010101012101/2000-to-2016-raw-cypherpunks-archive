My understanding is the Islamic banks have a 'workaround'. Instead of
charging interest you simply owe the loan amount plus whatever the
interest is. If you borrow $100 and the interest is 5% you've borrowed
$105 dollars. Except for the more extreme fundamentalists, it's been
accepted that way for a long time.

No one said "point 5" was gonna be easy...

Ps. As I was reading Gadaffi's 'Little Green Book' online a while back I
noted his ideas had a lot in common with Anarcho-Syndicalism.
