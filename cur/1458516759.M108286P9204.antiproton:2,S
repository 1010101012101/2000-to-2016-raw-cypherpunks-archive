Yes indeed, all the world's a security theatre stage. What part are you
playing? How many of your fellow actors are collecting paychecks both 
from Apple, and from foreign and domestic government services?



The only part here that's surprising is the blatant public admission
by the FBI that they can't afford to pay the market rates for apple
insiders. Or was that an intentional leak by the FBI's Snowden, who,
unlike Snowden, seems to know how to stay hidden and cause a lot more
damage.


I also find it hard to believe that Apple's employees would be so willing 
to sacrifice themselves to save the user's private keys. I find it more
likely the cost-benefit calculation determined that locking out 
unauthorized apple cloners exceeds the cost of litigation, and the 
marketing and PR side-show was a brand-building bonus of a lifetime.

The FBI just got the short end of the stick, and is now getting an
education of why it's a bad idea to try to bully a smarter bully
with a bigger bankroll.
