'michael' has reviewed "True Names and The 
Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier" over on
slashdot. I won't discuss the review or the book
in detail other than to say that the book should
be considered Required Reading, and the review
is also good.

michael has this to say about our Resident
Author:

"Timothy May, who is perhaps best
known for his ranting posts about crypto anarchy,
has a lengthy and astonishingly well-written essay
titled "True Nyms and Crypto Anarchy". The
essay reads as if an editor with a firm hand
extracted most of May's characteristic wild-eyed
prose and yet kept the insightful ideas behind it - if
only all of his writing was like this essay. It's a
great introduction to what May means by "crypto
anarchy". May is one of the most optimistic writers
in the book, and he, as well as the other writers,
believe that we are at a fork: either we'll move
toward a surveillance state, or toward what May
calls an anarcho-capitalist state, but the middle
ground is unstable - we'll end up at one extreme or
the other. May believes we're already firmly on
the road toward anarcho-crypto-utopia."
