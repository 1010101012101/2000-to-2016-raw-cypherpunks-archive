One of the ways to model a 'black body' radiator is using this technique.
The point being that the energy of the photons emitted through the hole
have a statistical energy distribution that matches (at least close enough
for experiments) the radiation emission of a black body at a
characteristic temperature.

Actually statistical mechanics, not quite the same thing as quantum
theory. But you can't talk about QT w/o SM.

That should probably be the amount of energy it radiates at particular
frequencies.

Actually not, as Y cools its emissions drop (looking at your example in
reverse). At some point X becomes hotter than Y and the net travel of
photons goes the other way. It's worth remembering that what is actually
happening is that both bodies are emitting radiation continouly, only the
statistical 'average' of the results model this 'one way' flow. Eventually
they'll reach a point where the average energy emitted by one, and
absorbed by the other, equals. From that point both objects will emit
radiation into their surroundings and both will cool until that exchange
balances.

The flat radiation of the surface isn't the same as with the hollow
spheres. For the hollow spheres the greatest part of the radiation is
re-absorbed by the relevant body (and re-emitted, and re-absorbed, ...).
This re-adsorption is what leads to the black body behaviour. It acts as
an averaging mechanism. The plates just emit into space and the majority
of radiation is lost, not reabsorbed.
