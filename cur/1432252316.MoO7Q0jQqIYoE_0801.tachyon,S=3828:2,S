There are lots of open proxy servers, which will let you access
other sites by setting your web proxy to use them.
I don't have a list handy, but most search engines will make it easy
to look for them.  

Also, does the proxy block the IP address, or only the domain name?
If it blocks by name, use the IP address.  If it blocks by IP address,
write the administrators of anonymizer.com to see if they've
got alternative IP addresses.


Also, see if your proxy blocks spaceproxy.com.
				Thanks!
