In the late 70s, I was at TRW we built inflatable (beach ball) antennas for 
a black project.  About 1/3 of the balloon's inside surface was aluminized 
and the feed was simply snapped into place at the opposite side.  The 
antenna could either be used hand-held or place in a ring mount on a flat 
surface.  This sort of approach could work well for cell phones and WiFi 
cards with external antenna port.  For cell phones the entire instrument 
could be placed in at the reflector's focus and operated via a mic/headset 
adapter (some older Nokia models have an external antenna port behind a 
small rubber plug on the rear.)
