 >>mattd recently babbled incoherently:<<

Yet you dont quote anything I said.Que?

  >>"Liberty without socialism is privilege,injustice;
socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality."
Bakunin.

 >>Another dead russian. Why not Stalin? "One death is a tragedy. A million 
deaths is a statistic." <<

And if you go quoting chairman mao?

 >>Still trying to define anarchy by your own anti-social agenda, eh matt?<<

Im anti CALC,thats the almost opposite of anti-social.Your welcome to Tim's 
poverty stricken definition.

  >>"Let's all be anarchists, just like me!"
                     -- mattd twit.<<

No lets all stay pigeonholed as right wing twits.A much easier target for 
the smarter spooks that will be here soon.
And I was talking to declan the libertarian pod anyway you idiot.

_Please_ don't feed the troll...or the nasty knee jerk weasl.Now 
declan,give us your thoughts on Treis last posts.
