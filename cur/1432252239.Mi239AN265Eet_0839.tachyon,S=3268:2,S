Sealand would be a perfect place for a group of suitably motivated persons
to attempt to place experimental class rockets with can-sat's into orbit.
They could of course apply for a slot in the orbital parking orbits or buy
one from one of the S. Pacific islands whose major incomes is sales of
same. A more optimal mechanism is put them in a short term parking orbit
that decays in about 2 months. Then put another bird up with new keys and 
potentialy capabilities. Then you wouldn't necessarily need anyone
permission to play.
