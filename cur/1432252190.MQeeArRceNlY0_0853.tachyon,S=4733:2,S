Hey fuck you if you cant take a joke...
The United States continues to dominate the Internet population with 166 
million users, or 30 percent of the total, followed by Europe with 24 
percent, Asia-Pacific with 14 percent and Latin America with 3 percent. 
Germany, with 32 million users, the United Kingdom, with 29 million, and 
Italy, with 22 million, are among the largest non-U.S. markets
Worldwide, Hong Kong residents are embracing broadband at a rate far higher 
than people who live anywhere else. About two-thirds of all Hong Kong Web 
users have high-speed connections, compared with just 17 percent in the 
United States.
Mr lee's greater Hong Kong,don't mind us rats.
Meanwhile, NetRatings said in a separate report that traffic to home and 
real estate sites has been peaking of late as mortgage rates continue to 
drop. Century21.com saw a 25 percent increase in traffic between the first 
and second quarters of this year, while Homestore.com (Nasdaq: HOMS) saw a 
12 percent gain.
Retail sites also saw gains, driven largely by promotions and 
back-to-school shopping. OldNavy.com was up 56 percent, with 35 percent of 
all visitors registering for a chance to win US$10,000. A similar 
sweepstakes at CompUSA.com helped that site see a 43 percent jump in traffic.
