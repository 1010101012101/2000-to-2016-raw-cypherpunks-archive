 | In practice, it is pretty obvious that most practitioners of civil 
 | disobedience believe they are above the law, that they usually *are* 
 | above the law, and that in particular Swartz believed he was above the 
 | law, and was shocked to find that he was not.
 | 
 | There might be some sincere practitioners of civil disobedience, but 
 | Swartz was not, and the big heroes of the civil disobedience brigade, 
 | Ghandi and Thoreau, were not.


A long time ago, I spent a couple of weeks in jail for
trespass (occupation of the site where the Seabrook reactor
now stands).  Nearly everyone eventually pled not guilty
with a notable exception: every single Quaker pleaded guilty
on the grounds that in doing so and only in so doing did they
bear witness.
