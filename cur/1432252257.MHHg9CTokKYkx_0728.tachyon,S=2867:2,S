  The Wall Street Journal


  Liechtenstein Bicentennial
  May 30, 2006; Page A15

  In your May 25 editorial "The End of Yugoslavia1" you refer to the
  Principality of Liechtenstein as a city-state. Though Liechtenstein is the
  fourth-smallest state in Europe, within Liechtenstein's borders lie 11
  communes including Vaduz, Liechtenstein's capital. I would urge your
  readers, and especially your writers, to visit www.liechtenstein.li to
  learn more about Liechtenstein, which is celebrating 200 years of
  sovereignty this year.
