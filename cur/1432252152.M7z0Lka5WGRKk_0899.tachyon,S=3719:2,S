Hello !

Your site talk about Nostradamus. 

I'm very sorry but in quatrain X 72, Nostradamus didn't talk about Mongols, 
Cassini, comets, wars, eclipses, JFK, the Antichrist, or Osiris !

If you want to learn the truth about Nostradamus' prophecy for 1999, there's 
a good address :
http://members.aol.com/AlainThuot/e_nostra2.htm

Nostradamus' prophecy came completely true : the final explanation of the 
quatrain word by word !

Now, the truth is at last available in English ! + en français  + em português

(I can read an email in english but I can't reply in english because I don't 
speak english. It's not me who made the translation in english on my site. I 
can reply in french if you want.)
