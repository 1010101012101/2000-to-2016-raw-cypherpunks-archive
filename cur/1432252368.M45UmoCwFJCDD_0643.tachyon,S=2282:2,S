Odd that that was still an issue, during the Auckland blackout in 1999 the
same thing happened, generators that were tested every six months and kept
topped up failed when they were run over a longer period because the fuel
level got down to the sludge at the bottom which got drawn into the generator.
I'd have thought they'd have taken steps do deal with this by now...
