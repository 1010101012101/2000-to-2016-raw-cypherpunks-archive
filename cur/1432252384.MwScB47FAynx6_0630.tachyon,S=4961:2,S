Here's my recollection as to how this was supposed to work:
1) people who participated in the beta got free mojo as a
reward for participating (they'd keep their mojo when the
beta period was over)
2) In the non-beta, people would have to pay (or something)
to get a starting stash of mojo
3) I don't think the "Evil Geniuses" ever expected to act as 
mojo-cash brokers; rather, anyone who had a supply of
cash and mojo could act as a cash-mojo broker, and mojo
would find its own price.

Right. If the tokens are EVER going to be worth anything, there
can't be a way to accumulate then for free.  If people have this
psychological block against paying "real money" for tokens,
maybe it's a good idea to make them trade CPU time for them
in one of the seti-like projects.  Somebody mentioned something 
about one involving protein-folding that sounded like it might 
actually be useful.
