I received a few URLs pointing to cell phone pictures
stored at pictures.sprintpcs.com.  The URLs contained
long seemingly-random strings, though with my sample
(of 2) I only saw 5 identical characters in the same locations.

Has anyone done any less casual cryptanalysis on these
kind of URLs?  One wonders how much protection from
(non-sprintpcs.com and ISP) snoopers that the "random" strings
actually provide.
