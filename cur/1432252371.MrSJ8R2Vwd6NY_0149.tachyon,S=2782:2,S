An interesting way to increase background encrypted traffic and
bypassing NAT tunneling braindeadness is to package the crypto
inside the consumer router brick.

I've just reflashed a couple Linksys WRT54GS with OpenWRT,
and OpenVPN and Tor are in the standard package depository
(there are many others, including Asterisk). The hardware is
so cheap that you could easily distribute preflashed
routers to end users as authentication token and part
of a darknet-like product.

Some of the Linksys even have crypto accelerators (largely 3DES, I think).
I'm not sure how much this is supported already.
