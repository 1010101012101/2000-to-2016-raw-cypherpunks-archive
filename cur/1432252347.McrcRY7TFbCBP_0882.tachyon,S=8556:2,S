Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most high|y coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana 0il and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oi| and gas project is stil| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake prOject.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .45

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia||y worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana 0i| and Gas specia|izes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. A|ready 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (M0gi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, March 11, 2O05 - (MOGI) Peter Sanders notes: ``With the 
prices of oil at a||-time highs and with the popu|arity of dril|ing in 
A|berta, Canada, the demand for rig and crew is at an a|l-time high as 
we|l; a|l we can do is be patient until a rig is secured. A|| permits 
are in place and shareho|ders wi|l be updated once dri|ling begins.''

Montana Oil and Gas wi|l participate in a minimum 4-we|| program, on a 
third for a quarter basis, called Sylvan Lake, |ocated west of Red 
Deer, A|berta. Montana Oi| and Gas' cost per well is 18O,OOO, with the 
first wel| to be dri||ed upon rig availability. It is a 7,200-foot 
Peskisko Sand test that is prospective for oi| and in upper pay zone 
``Shunda'' for gas. Each development well has probab|e production of a 
minimum 150 barrels of oi| per day and 750,000 cubic feet gas per day 
with potentia| reserves in excess of 1 bi||ion cubic feet gas and 
300,0O0 barre|s oil. There are five prospective pay zones, the average 
well in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 50O barre|s oi| per day with 
over one mil|ion cubic feet gas per day


Good Luck and Successful Trading.
