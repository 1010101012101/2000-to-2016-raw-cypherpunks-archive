In Baltimore, during an anti-fascist action this morning (at a gathering 
point for nazis heading off to Washington DC), about 30-40 individuals were 
arrested.
Of those, we have confirmation that 6 are from NEFAC (4 from Boston, 2 from 
Baltimore), 1 from Claustrophobia, plus an undetermined number of people 
from Anti-Racist Action.
Although it is unclear who is being charged with what, overall the charges 
are reported to include aggravated assault, disorderly conduct, concealed 
weapon, and property destruction. All felonies.
Once more details are sorted out, we will post information on how people 
can donate financial contributions towards bail for the arrests.

Keep an eye on dc.indymedia.org
the Progressive Action Center is currently beseiged by police, trying to 
get in , without a warrant. any and all legal help is NEEDED to contact the 
center at 410.467.9388. they're holding out, and trying to leave, since 
they have not, at last contact, been detained.
the bloodshed (Baltimore Anarchist Show/Community Space), according to a 
few frantic phone calls, is being monitored, and any people approaching are 
sternly ordered to leave immediately.

parent ] We have gotten word that the Bloodshed has been raided twice now, 
and there remains a strong police presense around that neighborhood. Also, 
when the police visited the Progressive Action Center they attempted to 
match up faces of people present with video footage from this morning. 
Apparently unsuccessfully. The shit seems to be hitting the fan in 
Baltimore, with cops looking to come down hard on militant antifas.

jt writes on Saturday August 24 2002 @ 06:41PM PDT: [ reply | parent ] The 
Bloodshed has now been raided twice. It's uncomfirmed, but there are no 
known arrests. At the Progressive Action Center, the cops arrived and 
wanted to enter. They did not have a warrant, and were not permitted to 
enter. They said that they had a video from this morning's altercations at 
the Baltimore Travel Plaza and wanted to ID people to see if they could 
match up people at the PAC with faces in the video. Also at the PAC this 
evening, cops pointed a gun at members from one of the midwest ARA groups 
(cleveland or columbus?) and detained them for questioning. no known 
arrests, and they have been released. The press was called, and a member of 
ARA Columbus and a local Baltimore activist gave interviews to ABC news. 
The white power show is still going forward tonight at a National Guard 
Armory. Eastern Hammerskins are providing security. Any organized ARA 
response to the show is unkown. Of the individuals arrested this morning, 
no one has been charged with anything as of yet, even though many rumors 
are flying around. Still 6 confirmed from NEFAC, 1 from Claustro. Again, a 
plea for legal support -- I will be sending cash tomorrow around noon and 
any financial help would be great. If anyone from other cities would like 
to send money on your own, contact me directly and i can tell you who to 
send the $ to. jt
