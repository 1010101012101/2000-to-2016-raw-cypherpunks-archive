No way it's Dave Emory...they did an IP Traceroute and the guy appears to be 
in Germany. If you've listened to Emory's shows, you'd know from some of his 
technical statements that he most likely wouldn't be capable of this. I also 
simply can't imagine him bothering with something like this.

On the other hand, the perpetrator of this hoax knows a decent amount about 
a variety of subjects (including technical ones). After sleeping on it, I'm 
starting to think he's actually some kind of German conspiracy 'theorist' 
who's actually been snooping the WiFi, etc...of some interesting locations. 
He probably saw a "pattern" and convinced himself he had to save the world.

It's a very interesting thread to say the least. Forget whether Paul 
Wolfowitz has some "Hidden Hand" master plan...it'll probably make 
Dis-information History one day.
