Dave,

Can you put this out on wide-scan: it's important.

All the best,

Bill

We have less than 48 hours to stop our nation from having a National  
ID card scheme.

The US Senate is scheduled to vote either today or tomorrow on two  
amendments that will remove Real ID provisions from the immigration  
bill.

Real ID is a very, very real national identification card.  Sixteen  
states have passed legislation rejecting REAL ID: now it's time for  
the Senate to do their part.  You can fax your Senators and take  
immediate action by visiting:

safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
