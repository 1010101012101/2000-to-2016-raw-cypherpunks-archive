This outcome is compressible because it has a short description.

Our best current description of randomness is that something is random 
when it has no _shorter_ description than itself. (A point of view 
variously credited to Komogoroff, Chaitin, and Solomonoff.)

But, as I said in my last post, before you try to understand 
algorithmic information theory, you need to learn the basics of 
probability. Without understanding things like combinations and 
permutations, binomial and Poisson distributions, the law of large 
numbers, standard deviations, etc., your philosophizing will be 
ungrounded.

You can read articles some of us wrote here about 10-11 years ago by 
using Google on the obvious terms.

"We should not march into Baghdad. To occupy Iraq would
instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab
world against us and make a broken tyrant into a latter-
day Arab hero. Assigning young soldiers to a fruitless
hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning
them to fight in what would be an unwinable urban guerilla
war, it could only plunge that part of the world into ever
greater instability."
