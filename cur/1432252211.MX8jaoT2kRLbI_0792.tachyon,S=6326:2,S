I've always used a special vmware instance whenever I wanted to do
something anonymously, as I assumed my OS choices and customizations 
might give me away to the other end as well, especially for anything I
don't notice (a good attack would be trying a well-known 0-day OS
vulnerability on an interactive counterparty, seeing if his machine
drops off the net -- you could do this several times and figure out
which OS is running).  

Running a pretty much standard win2k/xp virtual machine with whatever
anonymity functionality running on the windows side OR the unix side 
seems to deal with that, as well as making it easier to sniff all
output from the machine in realtime to make sure nothing else is going
through.  And it would then be very obvious which nym you're using.

I don't think gmail would work well with a 500MB archive -- I've used
it, and their UI seems inefficient past a certain point.  

General web indexing of html archives works pretty well --
("from, "to" searching would be equivalent to author searches, and
keyword + or - terms can be done through a web ui as easily)

I think I'd also prefer being able to do LOCAL searches on most of the
topics on cypherpunks, vs. web searches on someone else's machine, so
I'll just let people download raw archives when reconstructed, with a
5Mbps cap or something.

I am not sure how safely spam can be filtered from the list -- each
person would have his own view of what is spam.  I think ideally there
would be all messages in the spool, broken up by month or quarter or
year, and then a way to run various filters on it, like kill certain
senders, kill keywords, "traditional" spamassassin/bayesian type
systems, etc.  Then the ability to search over any subset.

Google doesn't support enough negative keywords to do this, and it
would be computationally expensive to do the filtering and reindexing
in realtime for each user.

If you had all the spools yourself locally, you could run whatever
spam elimination you considered proper once, and then search index,
with negative keywords for specific senders (or just excise certain
senders permanently as spam)
