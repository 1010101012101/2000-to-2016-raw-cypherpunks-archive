She and her friend were on their way to speak in my town, Santa Cruz.

And there had been a power outage a few months earlier, caused by 
power lines being blown up, and claimed to be an action by "Earth 
Action Night." Many of us here in Santa Cruz assumed that Judy was 
transporting another bomb down to this area.

I don't believe her friend was killed in the blast, though. Let me go check...

Nope, her passenger, Darryl Cherney, did not die.


I have no knowledge one way or another about whether the FBI did it, 
rivals did it, or they were transporting a bomb to the Santa Cruz 
area for another "Earth Action Night" bombing. I tend toward the 
latter view.
