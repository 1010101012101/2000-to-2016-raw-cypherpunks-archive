	I recently got into an argument with an (apparently) elderly lady on a Firearms rights mailing list who was incredibly annoyed that because of her arthritis she was going to have to "live with the pain" the rest of her life. 

	She somehow thought that this was a new and unique thing. 

	The only thing new about it was that *she didn't expect it*.

	My father grew up during the depression, he lived in what today would be called a ghetto, except most of the people there weren't black. He often went barefoot in the summer so that they wouldn't spend money on Shoes. His father died when he was 14, and his older brother supported him and their mother until my father dropped out of school (at 16) to work. 

	There was a *lot* that the non-specialized, non-personalized media pushed in those days that many people couldn't afford, that they saw in the newspapers or heard about on the radio, or saw in the stores that they couldn't afford, and for the most part their parents *told them so*. They learned, as my parents taught me, that you can't always have what you want.  

	The pressures of commercial advertising--in the sense of mass media--have been with us for as long as there has been mass media. 

	You either deal with it as an adult, or you deal with it as a child. To complain that people are making you want something and they should stop is definitely in the realm of the latter. 

	I say this as someone who has a bit more credit card debt than he really should, so I understand the consumeristic drive, but it's really all about self-disipline, now isn't it? 

	Which is one of the things people who rail against capitalism are really complaining about.

	You left out one word in there. 

	Won't.

	Mostly to stop their children from wailing about wanting one. 

	Children are, almost by definition, not sane people.

	As someone who has 12 computers laying around his "office" along with innumerable parts, piles of half-read books, 2 motorcycles, 3 bicycles etc.

	I couldn't agree with you more.

	Nonsense. 

	Advertising only works on adults (or rather rational people) when it shows them something they already want.

	Marketing has not gotten anywhere near that personal. 

	I don't receive car commercials with a picture of a buxom oriental woman wearing red PVC undergarments, while my neighbor get his with a picture of one of maplethorpe's models. Now, granted part of this is because it's not commercial feasible, and I doubt it ever will be. 

	No, the most that "modern advertising science" has been able to do is to direct clients NOT to advertise in places where they won't get a ROI, in favor of places that WILL. 

	That, and these days you rarely get mail addressed to "Dear Customer" as laser printers can now make that "Dear Mr. CypherPunk". 

	If you can't see through something like that, you *deserve* to be deep in debt.

	It's not a question of being "smarter", it's a question of self disipline. My generation (well, most of them) didn't need it, so we never learned it (like I said, most of them). From what I've seen, the generation following us doesn't have it either.

	Funny thing, one of the guys I work with, a reasonably competent Systems Administrator (meaning that he has the ability to think logically when pressed) rants about corporate greed and all that, but he's working at (at least) his second start-up, stock options and all.
