heh, i'd love to see sante fe & necsi soundly trashing tsa no fly
lists and ssss labeling, nsa's tia reborn, and every other program the
vast majority of "security" bureaucracy/funding is porked in.

rapid repair is key, and att's ndr program a model with some success. 
perhaps cognitive wireless radios (software defined? fuck the fcc!)
will provide a good last mile in the near future...

as for other industries / organizations - some systems are just broken
against a skilled asymmetric attacker.  time to move on...
