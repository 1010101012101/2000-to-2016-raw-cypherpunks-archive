The suits are in the court before the 
certifiying deadline. They then have
all the authority in the world.

To not let the certification process complete itself 
tomorrow certainly is not good for the Bush camp. 

And I do believe Miss Secretary of State will wish she
has not done what she has so far. She in her statements
has not given a case by case reason for rejection. It certainly 
will cost her the office she holds in the next election, or any
other public office she might run for.

It's called contempt of court not to comply.
