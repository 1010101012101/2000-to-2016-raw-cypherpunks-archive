Potentially even more infringing on rights, though, at least in the
US. We have the 2nd Amendment, which keeps some of the police
state behavior at bay. I can't think, offhand, of any provision in the
US Constitution which would prevent City Hall from mandating a hair
sample from every pet. New York constitution neither, though that's so
cumbersome and poorly organized that there might be something tucked
away.
