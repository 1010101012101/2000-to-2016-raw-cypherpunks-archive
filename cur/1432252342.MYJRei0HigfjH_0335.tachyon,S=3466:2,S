I agree... this remains a problem with my thesis.  Perhaps it is
from an earlier time, before they randomly chose short words or word-pairs
from lists as opaque labels?  

I just finished Rowlett's _Magic_ and in there, someone
had to point out to the SIS cryptanalysts that you shouldn't refer to what
the ca. WWII Japanese called "Cipher Machine, type A" in English as the
"type A machine".   Thus their arbitrary designators ("red", "purple") were
chosen.
