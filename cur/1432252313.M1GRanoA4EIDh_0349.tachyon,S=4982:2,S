Makes you want to dress up like an Indian, storm aboard a moored British
sailing vessel, and chunk cargo into the harbor, doesn't it? Domestic
"property" terrorism is increasingly directed at corporate/private
interests; and you see those interests addressed in spades here.

Section 19 creates an affirmative duty to disclose information to
authorities if the information is "suspicious" as to past or future
violations of Sect. 15-18. The duty to fink is limited to a business or
quasi-business relationship, defined as ‘information which comes to his
attention in the course of a trade, profession, business or employment’.

Under the old UK terrorism law [read: IRA], the acts had to be political,
now they can be religious or ideological [read: ELF, ALF - speaking of
which, is there a Privacy Liberation Front?]).

Act @ http://www.blagged.freeserve.co.uk/ta2000/fhome.htm

Definition of Terrorism under TA2000

(a) the action falls within subsection (2),

(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to
intimidate the public or a section of the public, and

(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political,
religious or ideological cause.

(2) Action falls within this subsection if it-

(a) involves serious violence against a person,

(b) involves serious damage to property,

(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the
action,

(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a
section of the public, or

(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an
electronic system."
