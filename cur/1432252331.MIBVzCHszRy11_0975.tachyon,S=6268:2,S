Many people think that if Facebook and Wikipedia use PHP, then PHP may be secure enough to work with money. Meanwhile raw money provides a much bigger bounty than hacking Facebook or Wikipedia, which probably have security holes in numbers that are orders of magnitude more than any small Bitcoin exchange.

That's why properly coded C and Cobol are used by most financial institutions, yes Cobol, as incredible is it may seem, it powers most financial transactions behind fancy web browsers.

Because even if a banking system is simpler than a Wikipedia, its security will be tried many, many, many more times than Wikipedia. While a hack into Wikipedia is something to be concerned about, it won't destroy it, while taking all the money away will destroy a business.

When I referred to games, I was referring to simpler and non-serious systems that people will try to hack in for fun. If you build such system, any system, that's training for some serious stuff in the future.

Ulbricht only knew some PHP coding and looked for help in order to create more advanced stuff, worse yet he had his servers discovered and mirrored and probably exploited before he would even notice it.

How can one be so low in their opsec that he doesn't ship a server for colocation with its USB ports desoldered and plied away? Or at least disabled in the firmware?

All your concerns are valid, meanwhile think about how you could work around every single one of them and note them down. Then once in a while you review your list, until you have solved most theoretical issues.

Then you build a non-serious system and offer bounties for finding exploits and people will find them, because you will never manage to plug all holes and the invader has just to find one hole open.
