DEA getting close to *banning* hemp foods and cosmetic products!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To help, please visit http://www.SaveHemp.org


Dear Friend,

The DEA has now officially announced
that it intends to ban most hemp
products in the United States,
including food made from sterile
(non-psychoactive) hemp seeds and
hemp-based personal-care products.

Whether or not you expressed your
outrage in October when we first
heard about the DEA's plans, please
visit http://www.SaveHemp.org now to
send an updated pre-written letter to
all of your elected officials and the
DEA.

(Many legislators who are now in
office were not in office in October.
In addition, legislators who
contacted the DEA in October on
behalf of their constituents were
told that there wasn't any official
proposal to ban hemp -- which is no
longer true. Please visit
http://www.SaveHemp.org to send your
second round of letters today!)

Under the DEA's proposed regulation,
literally millions of Americans will
be criminalized for possessing
shampoos, lotions, and soaps that
have the slightest amount of
naturally occurring THC, the primary
active ingredient in marijuana. (It
is impossible to get a psychoactive
effect from hemp-based shampoos and
soaps, but the DEA is proposing to
ban them nevertheless.)

Those who are arrested for shampoo
or soap will face up to one year in
federal prison and a $10,000 fine --
the same penalties they would face if
they were arrested for possessing a
small amount of marijuana.

If someone is arrested with a
stockpile of (currently legal) hemp
products that weighs hundreds of
pounds, it stands to reason that the
defendant would face a 5- or 10-year
mandatory minimum prison sentence --
or even the death penalty -- under
federal law.

There are already 700,000 arrests
every year in the U.S. for marijuana
offenses. Our nation's beleaguered
criminal justice system doesn't need
the additional strain of processing
100,000's of additional arrests that
will result from the illegal
possession of non-psychoactive
shampoos and soaps.

We don't need another front in our
nation's failed war on drugs. Please
oppose the DEA's hemp ban before it
is allowed to take effect.

Please visit http://www.SaveHemp.org
right away. Thank you.
