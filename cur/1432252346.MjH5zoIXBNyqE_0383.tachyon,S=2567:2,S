I never figured out how to use a certificate to authenticate a
client to a web server, how to make a web form available to one
client and not another.  Where do I start?

What I and everyone else does is use a shared secret, a
password stored on the server, whereby the otherwise anonymous
client gets authenticated, then gets an ephemeral cookie
identifying him..   I cannot seem to find any how-tos or
examples for anything better, whether for IIS or apache.

As a result we each have a large number of shared secret
passwords, whereby we each log into a large number of
webservers.  Was this what the people who created this protocol
intended?
