Precisely. Nor can the government or an intruder, provided the keys are
encrypted on disk. I don't see how users risk anything if you provide a "*Print
backup"* option - no trojan can steal a letter in the safe. You might be
glad one day if you get raided by "authorities" or broken in.

Well, I can. For example users can come to Fikisha office in Lagos and buy
a printout of a Mini (Casascius) key for cash, which they can fax to the UK
or the EU, for example. At Intersango or MtGox, they can redeem that key.
I'd very much like it if those keys can be redeemed in more ways.*

I'd understand it if it were only Casascius coins. After all who in his
right mind is buying an expensive coin to redeem it shortly after. If
Bitcoin price hike continues, this may also be an interesting feature.

Cheers

* They'll be able to redeem it at Fikisha, but that only makes sense if
they get 2nd thoughts about the transfer
