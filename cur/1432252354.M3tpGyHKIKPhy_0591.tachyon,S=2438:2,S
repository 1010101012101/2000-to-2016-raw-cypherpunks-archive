Stormin' Norman (tm) leaked the following: the US
can ID humans in the *cold* desert.  And its getting *buttcold*
in certain parts of the world.  If we can't find him, we can starve
and freeze him.

One nice bit of karma: the Mullah's house burned down.
Probably without warning, and only his house.  Nice
hand of god fireworks, general.
