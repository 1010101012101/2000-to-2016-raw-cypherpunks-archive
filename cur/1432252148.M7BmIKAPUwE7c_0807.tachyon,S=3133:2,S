And whats to stop an untrustworthy virus from making the same claims, 
placing the 'trustworthy' virus on the system and deleting itself?
How are you going to define a 'trustworthy' virus with this scenario in mind?
There is no such thing as 'trustworthy' automated software.  At best, you
have software that does what its supposed to when used responsibly.  I
have yet to see responsible usage of a virus.. and doubt I ever will.

#include <honesty.h>
