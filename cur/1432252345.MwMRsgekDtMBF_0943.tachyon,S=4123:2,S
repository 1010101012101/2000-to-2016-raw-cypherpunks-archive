The optics used for focusing are NOT mirrors, they are (hopefully)
transparent at the frequency under use. A mirror on the other hand is
required to be OPAQUE with respect to transmission, we want full, 100%,
reflectivity. That means that every photon that hits that mirror
interacts, loses some energy, and gets re-emitted.

I have a half dozen lasers, thank you very much.
