I bathe regularly.  All else is gloss.

/me retreats to iron w/ thermometer.

Black and Decker "Light 'n' Easy" iron, cotton dishtowl (folded quarto),
"Good Cook" dial thermometer inserted under top fold.  With four
minutes' preheat, temperature is off the scale (220=B0F), extrapolating,
it looks to be 270=B0-280=B0F.  After about two minutes, there's a slight
yellowing of the dishtowel.

The filtration offered by an envelope and moistened towel should
minimize this.

References online suggest that claving cycles are ~2h at 140=B0C+.  A WHO
document on animal carcass processing suggests rendering cycles range
from 10-60 minutes, though whether or not this is sufficient to
disinfect the carcasses isn't clear from a quick read. =20

I'd say that for paranoics with a low risk threshhold, ten minutes of
steam might provide some assurance.  And neatly creased correspondence.
It's a bit hard on the pre-approved credit cards though.

Peace.
