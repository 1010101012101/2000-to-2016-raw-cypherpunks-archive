So what're the sentencing guidelines for harassment of federal officials?

I hope James will argue that he was gathering addresses so that he could 
picket them (which is legal).  Petition the government for redress of 
grievances...

I know James gets carried away with rhetoric.  It' better to say things in 
such a way that you are immune to prosecution.  You can say and do pretty 
much the same things.  It's all in the words.

Mods vs. Trads.  Mods are much less likely than Trads to form lasting 
family relationships, they kill themselves and others much more frequently, 
they suffer more from drug and substance abuse, they are more prone to 
disease, they even have a higher accident rate, they have lower family 
incomes, their MMPIs are much more jagged, their life expectancy is 
shorter, and they score lower on tests designed to show levels of personal 
happiness or satisfaction.  Sounds like a maladaption to me.
