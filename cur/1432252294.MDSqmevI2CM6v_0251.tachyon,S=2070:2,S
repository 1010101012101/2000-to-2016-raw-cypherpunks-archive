I work as a programmer at a company that writes software to handle 
switch functions and bill cellular and gsm customers.  (I work in the
billing part) It is a simple matter to get access to the files that 
store these records.  To my knowledge there is no direct audit trail, 
though I don't know what records the switch itself keeps, if any.

The security is rather silly.  It is a simple matter to write a few 
lines of code to dump the name, address, phone number, social security 
number, mother's maiden name and credit card number of millions of cell
phone users.  I imagine adding or removing a call record would be 
simple, as well.
