Congratulations!  You've finally discovered the Secret Ulterior Motive
behind the Cypherpunks Grocery-Store-Frequent-Shopper Card Exchange Ritual,
which is to discourage them from knowing who's *really* buying
all that chocolate and beer.   

(We used to do it relatively often; now it's more of an occasional thing,
especially since the Albertsons/AmericanStores merger means that
Lucky no longer uses cards, but Safeway still does.
Safeway started doing "Thank you for shopping at Safeway, Mr. Cypherpunki"
a while back, and they're currently usually mispronouncing the
person whose dietary habits I'm also disparaging. :-)
