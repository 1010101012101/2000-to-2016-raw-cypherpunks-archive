Hi Isaac.

I've just subscribed to the p2p-hackers list and I'm reaching out to all 
the other groups and projects that have been mentioned. I've also been 
invited to post the PeerPoint proposal on the P2P Foundation Blog.

The idea is to invite a wider community to crowdsource further evolution of 
the specs. I added an intro to the specs that I and others can easily email 
with the link to the full doc:

Greets, p2p peeps!

 I am not actually trying to start another development project. PeerPoint 
is an open, high-level functional specification for where I think all the 
open p2p projects are eventually heading as a group. I want to get as many 
of those current projects as I can to participate in evolving the PeerPoint 
spec further and adding increasing levels of detail that are beyond my 
competence. 

Any suggestions?
