#    Defying the I.R.S., Anti-Tax Businesses Refuse to Withhold
#    
#    By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
#    
#    LAKE SHASTA, Calif. - Al Thompson squeezed most of his 
#    manufacturing company's 28 employees into a conference room here 
#    in October to say he had good news: Income taxes must be paid 
#    by only a few Americans, mostly those working for foreign-owned 
#    companies. So, he told the workers, they would not have to pay 
#    income taxes ever again. His business is exempt, too, he said.
#    
#    No Social Security or Medicare taxes, either. The company was 
#    no longer withholding taxes from their paychecks, he said, or 
#    telling the Internal Revenue Service how much they made.
