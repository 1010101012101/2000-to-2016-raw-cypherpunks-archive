You're very description argues against your own assertion.

Comment #1:

I don't. I'm simply stating that you're trying to seperate out concepts
that are not seperable. You are treating 'components' of a characteristic 
as seperable and individual from the characteristic itself. This is a
false distinction when talking about human psychology (which is what we're
talking about when you get right down to it).

Bravo!!!!! I salute you. That I can respect.

Agreed. It's also worth noting that at some point you have to ignore what
other people think or want as well. At some point you have to say "I don't
care". A good example is that many people will critize actions because
they hurt other peoples feelings. Not realizing that by complying your own
feelings get hurt. It's a conflict of viewpoint, the belief of an absolute
when no such exists.

I put this a different way,

It's good to have an open mind, just not so open your brains slosh out on
the floor.

Ah, he wants a date...;)

No, confused. It's not the dataset and their manipulation but rather their
axioms I find distasteful, the goal they are looking to reach and the
base assumptions they leave unsaid (eg almost w/o exception we have
mind/body duality as well as human beings somehow 'above' or 'seperate'
from the cosmos - raging, rampant, anthropocentracism). This harks back to
the comment I made about Newton and pebbles on a beach. Newton once made a
comment that when he went in to solve a problem he had no pre-concieved
notion of the end result. He simply played (that's a very strong
paraphrase). It's a rare view that just looks at what is there and doesn't
try to prove/resolve some aspect of themselves in the process.

In many ways I agree. However even he has a fundamental problem with
respect to his base philosophy. He was an atheist yet was understanding of
Christianity and other relgions (eg his exploration into Vedic
philosophy). This represents a mind/body duality problem though, which
seriously undermines the applicability of his views. Why? He fails to
recognize that being an atheist, christian, whatever is nothing more than
anthropocentricism. His fundamental assumption isn't that humanity somehow
stands on a divide but is that divide. He took a stand to resolve
conflicts as a result of his world view, not recognizing that the world
view WAS the problem. He didn't step out of his humanity (in fact this is 
the failure of all Utopian sojourns). The ONLY exception to this failing
in philosophy that I've found is Pantheism, which is very rare. Only a
handful of non-antropocentric philosophers have written (and no I don't
even agree with all of them, Spinoza for example was of the belief that
'rights' were an extension of society and that irrespective of social harm
one should submit - then compare this to his life ling running from
persecution, he was excommunicated from the Jewish religion as a result).

Both Schopenhauer and Spinoza almost got there.

> That's a pretty heavy dose of Platonism, no?

No. Socrates.

> ...whole lotta reification goin' on...

Not really, there is no concept of 'universality'. We're not making a
statement about that which we are answering question, only how we answer
questions. The Socratic Method isn't about finding 'reality' or
'fundamental essence' (ie crap) but rather about finding conflicts in the
thought process. In the Socratic method the discussion is more on how you
got to the conclusion, not how you carried it out.

> Just because an event is nonlinear and non-determined doesn't mean it

No, but they obfuscate any hope of actually determining what that
causality is. The distinction between 'there is no causality' and 'there
is no way to determine causality' isn't that great a void from a
pragmatic perspective. Either way, it's a dead end road.

That's as good a definition of 'faith' as I've ever run across...;)

Now we're into that 'free will' discussion I don't want to have...our
answering the question iwth a flat 'of course' isn't good reasoning. You
are in effect presenting an axiomatic assumption as a derivative
conclusion. Arguing in circles.

{and yes, I fully recognize that the basic tenets of 'science' are nothing
more than the basic tenets of 'religion' - faith. The distinction being
the acceptance, and management thereof, of the concept of
'transcendence'. Which is another aspect of the 'human condition' that I
think every philosopher to date has skipped merrily around.)

You are confusing 'understanding' with 'holding'. The killer word in your
assertion is 'ambivalent' you are admitting you hold no opinion (and that
'no opinion' is itself singular).

[About contradicting yourself, see 'Para-consistent Logic'. Note that at
no time have I asserted that paradoxes are not real. In my mind the
question is whether one sees this conflict as a 'universal' or something
that is unique to the 'human perspective'.]

If you can use the 'understanding' to make accurate predictions then you
have some sort of handle that others who can't don't have.

Empathy and consideration are great tools, provided they don't become
singularly important (eg politicaly correct). Given the choice of hurting
your feelings by saying something that is real and concrete and not saying
it and hurting myself in the process, you're feelings are toast.

People have a right to 'pursue happiness', the unsaid assertion is that
peoples natural state is 'unhappy'. A person has no right to interfere
with anothers pursuite of that happiness, but they don't have a
responsiblity to help nor do they have a responsiblity to hurt themselves
to minimize the others discomfiture.
