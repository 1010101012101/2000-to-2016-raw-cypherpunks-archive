Worlds Worst Weapons...Kenfucky speech.A freudian slip? I don't think so.
The Internet on probation (PDF)
'One year after the tragic events in New York and Washington, the Internet 
can be added to the list of "collateral damage" caused by the general spate 
of security measures. As a result, basic cyber-freedoms have been cut back. 
The countries usually criticised for not respecting human rights and 
freedom of expression ... have encouraged its growth as a tool of state 
propaganda or economic interests, but at the same time moved to control it 
and clamp down on criticism, argument and hopes for democracy expressed 
online ... It is also threatened in Western democracies, where many 
countries have passed laws, taken measures and adopted practices that are 
putting the Internet under the ferrule of the security services'
( RSF )

ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI
Q - What is France's position on Moussaoui who's just admitted his 
responsibility in the September 11 attacks? Knowing France's position, what 
action can France take? Is it going to seek extradition if he's sentenced 
to death?
That's a purely hypothetical question.
Q - Yes but still?
The matter is in the hands of American judicial officials and comes under 
the Justice Ministry.
Mr. Moussaoui is being tried in the U.S. We have a general position on the 
death penalty: We oppose it. That holds true for Mr. Moussaoui. The 
American authorities have been clearly informed of this.
Q - A few days ago, Mr. Moussaoui asked to meet with a French diplomat. Has 
he made any specific requests? Can you tell us about them? What did he ask 
for?
Mr. Moussaoui asked to have the benefit of French consular protection. This 
was granted and, as we've said, the consulate general in Washington has 
asked to be able to visit Mr. Moussaoui according to the usual rules for 
consular protection, as for everyone. I understand that depending on the 
practical arrangements, the visit could take place this afternoon.
Q - What advantages do people have under consular protection?
These are stipulated in the 1963 Vienna Convention. Article 34: contacts, 
checking on the conditions of detention and trial.
