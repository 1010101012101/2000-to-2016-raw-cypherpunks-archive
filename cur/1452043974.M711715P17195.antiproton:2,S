I still think it's a med reaction exacerbated by his run in with the
SFPD. What I'd really like to have examined is a toxicology report for
Murdock, due to his repeated erratic behavior the SFPD 'intervened' in.
You'd think they'd do such a thing, but I suspect not.

At one point in my younger days I personally knew Abbie Hoffman. Later
in life, and  at the other end of the US I had a hard time believing the
story of his suicide having always noted his maniac side but never
seeing the 'down side' of his personality. I broached that on a list
where someone who knew him a lot better than me posts and he went and
asked Abbie's brother-in-law Wally, from his first marriage to Anita
Hoffman.

The response from Wally was an eyeopener. Apparently Abbie was not in
very good health and had about 95% arterial blockage. Then he was
feeling under the weather so the doctors prescribed Prozac for him,
unknowing at the time that the combination of arterial blockage and
prozac causes suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

I suspect something similar happened to Ian Murdock, and the SFPD was
involved, and crudely so, but unless the 'abrasions' to his head that
needed stitches were severe enough to have caused his demise or
exacerbated a pre-existing head injury or unknown such as potential for
cerebral hemorrhage (again, this could be due to prescription meds), it
just another instance of the police as insensitive abusive
bureaucrats-with-guns ham-handly 'dealing' with a citizen, booking and
releasing him.
