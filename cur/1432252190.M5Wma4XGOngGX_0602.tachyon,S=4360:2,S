Macware Releases WebGhost

Anonymous web surfing for Mac Users

OMAHA, NE - July 12, 2007 - Macware, a leading Mac software publisher,
announced today the release of WebGhost, an anonymous web surfing utility
for the Mac.

Information about you and your computer can easily be accessed by any
webmaster, hacker or other person interested in learning about your online
habits or attempting to infiltrate your security. WebGhost protects your
computer by redirecting your Web connection through a secure proxy server
which hides your online identity, secures the information you transmit, and
cleans the Internet tracks stored on your Mac.

WebGhost integrates key security components to keep your online activity
private:

- Routes your Internet activity through anonymous public or private proxy
servers to hide your online identity

- Uses core Safari security tools to erase your activity and block ads

- Updates public proxy settings daily to strengthen WebGhost protection

WebGhost is now available in CompUSA, Fry's Electronics, Office Depot,
Microcenter and other Mac software retailers, or online for an MSRP of
$29.99. A demo is also available on the Macware website at www.macXware.com.
