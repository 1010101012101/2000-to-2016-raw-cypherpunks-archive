   Dear Colleagues,

   Due to popular demand the Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) workshop is
   extending the paper submission deadline to the 10th March. Please find
   attached the updated Call for Papers.

   Yours,

   George Danezis
   Philippe Golle
   (Program Chairs)

   6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies
   Robinson College, Cambridge, United Kingdom
   June 28 - June 30, 2006
   http://petworkshop.org/2006/

   (Note: paper submission DEADLINE EXTENDED to 10 March.)

   CALL FOR PAPERS

   The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel
   research on all theoretical and practical aspects of privacy
technologies, as
   well as experimental studies of fielded systems. We encourage submissions
  from
   other communities such as law and business that present their
perspectives on
   technological issues. As in past years, we will publish proceedings
after the
   workshop in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

   Suggested topics include but are not restricted to:

      * Anonymous communications and publishing systems
      * Censorship resistance
      * Pseudonyms, identity management, linkability, and reputation
      * Data protection technologies
      * Location privacy
      * Privacy in ubiquitous computing environments
      * Policy, law, and human rights relating to privacy
      * Privacy and anonymity in peer-to-peer architectures
      * Economics of privacy
      * Fielded systems and techniques for enhancing privacy in existing
systems
      * Protocols that preserve anonymity/privacy
      * Privacy-enhanced access control or authentication/certification
      * Privacy threat models
      * Models for anonymity and unobservability
      * Attacks on anonymity systems
      * Traffic analysis
      * Profiling and data mining
      * Privacy vulnerabilities and their impact on phishing and identity theft
      * Deployment models for privacy infrastructures
      * Novel relations of payment mechanisms and anonymity
      * Usability issues and user interfaces for PETs
      * Reliability, robustness and abuse prevention in privacy systems

   Stipends to attend the workshop will be made available, on the basis of need
   and merit, to cover travel expenses, hotel, or conference fees. You do not
   need to submit a technical paper and you do not need to be a student to
apply
   for a stipend. For more information, see:
   http://petworkshop.org/2006/stipends.html

   Papers should be at most 15 pages excluding the bibliography and well-marked
   appendices (using an 11-point font), and at most 20 pages total.
  Submission of
   shorter papers (from around 4 pages) is strongly encouraged whenever
   appropriate. Papers must conform to the Springer LNCS style described here.

   Reviewers of submitted papers are not required to read the appendices
and the
   paper should be intelligible without them. The paper should start with the
   title, and an abstract. The introduction should give some background and
   summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a
   non-specialist reader. Submitted papers should be anonymized by removing or
   sanitizing author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, and obvious
   self-references. A preliminary version of the proceedings will be made
   available to workshop participants. Final versions are not due until
  after the
   workshop, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their papers based on
   discussions during the meeting.

   Submit your papers in Postscript or PDF format. To submit a paper, compose a
   plain text email to pet2006-submissions@petworkshop.org containing the title
   and abstract of the paper, the authors' names, email and postal addresses,
   phone and fax numbers, and identification of the contact author (to whom we
   will address all subsequent correspondence). Attach your submission to this
   email and send it. By submitting a paper, you agree that if it is accepted,
   you will sign a paper distribution agreement allowing for publication, and
   also that an author of the paper will register for the workshop and present
   the paper there. Our current working agreement with Springer is that authors
   will retain copyright on their own works while assigning an exclusive 3-year
   distribution license to Springer. Authors may still post their papers on
  their
   own Web sites. See here for the 2004 version of this agreement.

   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
   published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference
   with proceedings.

   Paper submissions must be received by March 3, 2006. We acknowledge all
   submissions manually by email. If you do not receive an acknowledgment
within
   a few days (or one day, if you are submitting right at the deadline), then
   contact the program committee chairs directly to resolve the problem.
   Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors no later
than
   May 1 and authors will have the opportunity to revise for the preproceedings
   version by June 2, 2006.

   We also invite proposals of up to 2 pages for panel discussions or other
   relevant presentations. In your proposal, (1) describe the nature of the
   presentation and why it is appropriate to the workshop, (2) suggest a
  duration
   for the presentation (ideally between 45 and 90 minutes), (3) give brief
   descriptions of the presenters, and (4) indicate which presenters have
   confirmed their availability for the presentation if it is scheduled.
   Otherwise, submit your proposal by email as described above, including the
   designation of a contact author. The program committee will consider
   presentation proposals along with other workshop events, and will respond by
   the paper decision date with an indication of its interest in scheduling the
   event. The proceedings will contain 1-page abstracts of the presentations
  that
   take place at the workshop. Each contact author for an accepted panel
  proposal
   must prepare and submit this abstract in the Springer LNCS style by the
   "Camera-ready copy for preproceedings" deadline date.
