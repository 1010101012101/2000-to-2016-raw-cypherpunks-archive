I am not confusing them at all.  There is ample evidence that the Germans
sold to Saddam both before and after the reunification of Germany.

The _UN_ claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  They ordered
them destroyed, and actually watched some being destroyed until Saddam
threw them out in the late 1990s.  They subsequently reported that they
could not account for tons of chemical weapons; this was one of the
reasons for the second war.

The manipulative misinformation is the claim that the US somehow armed
Saddam Hussein.  He had French planes, Czech weapons, Russian tanks; we
saw them burning on TV in both wars.  There is no evidence at all that the
US supplied weapons in any quantity to Iraq, just unsubstantiated claims
from the usual mob, the ones who supposedly know all those secrets hidden
from the rest of us.
