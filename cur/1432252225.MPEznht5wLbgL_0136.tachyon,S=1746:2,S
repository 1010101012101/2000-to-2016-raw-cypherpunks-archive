This is the commune of the guy charged and released for toasting some
Hummers.  Getting RichardJewell'ed by the FBI.  Oh yes, he is
"a peace activist who has protested the war in Iraq and actions
of the Bush administration" which is surely coincidental.

CNN interviewed him 11pm Sat, and he's getting a lawyer.
This interview was a few minutes before Declan talked about
spam (and mentioned Eudora on CNN!)
