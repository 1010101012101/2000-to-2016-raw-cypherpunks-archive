 How To Reach Thousands Of Prospects Every Month 
                
Our research has found that many people have tried one or more of the 
following...
 Free Classifieds? (They just don't work anymore) 
Web Site? (Takes thousands of surfers) 
Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
 E-Zine? (Hope they have a *huge* subscriber list)
 Search Engines? (Forget it, unless you're in the top 20)

 S O  W H A T   D O E S  W O R K ? 

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has proven to succeed 
time-after-time.  E - M A I L   M A R K E T I N G ! !  IT'S A FACT.....  if 
you're not using your computer to generate income, GOOD income, you're 
leaving money on the table. Here's what the experts have to say about E-Mail 
Marketing:
 "A gold mine for those who can take advantage of bulk e-mail programs" - The 
New York Times 
"E-mail is an incredible lead generation tool" -Crains Magazine 
"Blows away traditional Mailing" - Advertising Age 

The way to reach thousands of people, generate orders and build wealth is 
person-to-person direct. 
1. How do you find the millions of people on the Internet?
 2. What are you going to tell them when you do reach them?

 HERE'S THE ANSWER TO QUESTION #1 


 25 MILLION EMAIL ADDRESSES + SOFTWARE  

The cleanest, most comprehensive e-mail address list in the world, BAR NONE! 
We're proud to offer it.
 O N E - O F - A- K I N D 
This is a first. No one has gone to the work it takes to produce an e-mail address 
list of this quality. Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists: 
1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates.
 2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No 
address with inappropriate or profane wording survive! 
3. Then we used our private database of thousands of known "extremists", 
opposed to commercial e-mail, and kicked off every one we could find.
 4. And finally, we sorted the list into easy-to-manage packets of 100,000 
addresses in a simple text (.txt) format. 
5. All domains have been verified as valid.

 WHAT  DID  WE  END  UP  WITH?
