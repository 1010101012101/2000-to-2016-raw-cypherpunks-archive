Obviously this calls for wiretaps on Freeh's phones and email and
hidden cameras in his house to prevent future occurrences....

Subject: Risks of self-induced false alarms

http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38625-2001Mar7.html

FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said he and his wife had been baffled by a
series of false alarms from the security system in their Great Falls area
home. Fairfax County police responded each time, but no suspects had been
nabbed.

It seems that two of his six sons, then ages 5 and 4, had been amusing
themselves by making their 2-year-old brother run in circles in the basement
to set off the motion detector. "They would sit and watch for the police to
come," Freeh said.

[AW notes: no discussion of why the motion detector was on in the basement
while the children were home, nor why the police didn't adopt a "call before
responding" policy after some number of false alarms.]
