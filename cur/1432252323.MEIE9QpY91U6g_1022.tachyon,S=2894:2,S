It depends on what happens to the receipt when you say commit.  It could
automatically go into the ballot box without delay, so you can't take such
a photo.

I expect that Vinny is already doing this with video of the touch screen
verification screen and the voter pressing OK, but he hasn't make me an
offer yet.  I expect he gets better value for his money with TV ads, and
last minute hit mailers.

Cheers - Bill
