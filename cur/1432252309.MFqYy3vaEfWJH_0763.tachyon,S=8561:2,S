Microsoft May Add Eavesdropping To Skype

Kurt Bakke in Products on June 26

Tags: Microsoft, patent, Skype

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published A Microsoft patent application
that reaches back to December 2009 and describes brecording agentsb to
legally intercept VoIP phone calls.

The bLegal Interceptb patent application is one of Microsoftbs more elaborate
and detailed patent papers, which is comprehensive enough to make you think
twice about the use of VoIP audio and video communications. The document
provides Microsoftbs idea about the nature, positioning and feature set of
recording agents that silently record the communication between two or more
parties.

The patent was filed well before Microsoftbs acquisition of Skype and there
is no reason to believe that the patent was filed with Skype as a Microsoft
property in mind. However, the patent mentions Skype explicitly as an example
application for this technology and Microsoft may now have to answer
questions in which way this patent applies to its new Skype entity and if the
technology will become part of Skype.  Legal intercept structure

Legal intercept structure (RA= recording agent)

In the patent descriptions, the company justifies such a feature with the
fact that monitoring of calls has been around for a long time for traditional
calls, but devices that were used for plain old telephone service (POTS)
simply do not work with VoIP anymore. Recording agents are designed to take
the place of those outdated devices, but are b not surprisingly b much more
capable, can be placed in different locations and automate call
interceptions. For example, Microsoft says that recording will be triggered
by beventsb, or a bsequence of eventsb b for example when specific callers
are involved.

The patent does not mention an eavesdropping module that is integrated into
the client software. However, it describes recordings agents that can be
placed in a multitude of devices, including routers (see image, RA =
recording agent). There is also the note of a recording agent software that
represents ba software module that logically and/or physically sits between
the call server and the network.b According to Microsoft, the agent will have
access bto each communication sent to and from the call server,b which
clearly refers to the general infrastructure of a VoIP service and network.
Legal intercept process

Legal intercept process

The patent lists the following process of a silently recorded call (we
removed references to drawings in the description for easier reading):

 

1. A delivery endpoint is registered with a call server. For example, the
intercept requestor may register an IP address/port for delivery of copies of
recorded communications associated with a designated VoIP entity.

2. A request to monitor a selected VoIP entity is sent by the requestor to
the call server. For example, the intercept requestor may request that the
call server record communications for the VoIP entity.

3. An initiating entity negotiates candidate network paths with a media
relay. For example, the VoIP entity may talk to a STUN, TURN, and/or other
servers to determine what IP address/port of the VoIP entity is visible from
the network. For example, if the VoIP entity is connected to a NAT, the NAT
may translate IP addresses and port numbers. In STUN/TURN environments, the
call gateway may act as a STUN and/or TURN server. The SDP parameters
indicated previously are an example of what may result as the entity
negotiates candidate communication points with a media relay.

4. The initiating entity sends an invite to the call server. The invite
includes data regarding establishing a communication session between at least
two entities via a switched packet network for a communication that includes
audio. For example, the VoIP entity sends an invite (such as the SDP
parameters mentioned previously) to the call server to communicate with a
VoIP entity in the enterprise.

5. A copy of the invite is sent to the delivery point. For example, the call
server may send a copy of the invite to the intercept requestor or another
endpoint designated by the intercept requestor.

6. An invite with no local candidates is sent to the remote entity. For
example, the call server  sends an SDP with the local candidates deleted to
the remote entity of the enterprise . Having no local candidates is
synonymous with having bno direct paths.b In STUN/TURN terminology, this
means that the VoIP entity needs to employ a TURN server to communicate with
the remote entity.

7. The remote entity responds to the invite by sending bOK.b For example, the
remote entity in the enterprise  responds to the invite by sending an OK to
the call server.

8. A copy of the OK is sent to the delivery point. For example,  the call
server sends a copy of the OK to the intercept requestor  or another endpoint
designated by the intercept requestor.

9. The OK is sent to the initiating entity. For example,  the call server
sends the OK to the VoIP entity.

10. The agent that will be recording the subsequent communication between the
entities is configured so that it will create a copy of the communication.
For example, the call server, the call gateway, or some other server may
configure the router to create a copy of the communication to and from the
VoIP entity. Note, that the recorded may be configured to record a
communication for an entity any time after a monitoring request for the
entity is received.

11. The VoIP entity sends a packet to the media relay. For example, the VoIP
entity may send a packet to the call gateway.

12. The packet passes to the recorder. For example, the packet may pass to
the router.

13. The packet is sent to the remote entity. In addition, a copy of the
packet is sent to the delivery point and/or stored for later sending to the
delivery point or retrieval by a law enforcement agent. For example, the
router sends the packet to the VoIP entity in the enterprise and sends a copy
of the packet to the intercept requestor or another endpoint designated by
the intercept requestor. This continues until the communication is
terminated.

14. Upon termination, the delivery endpoint may be informed that the
communication has terminated.

 

The patent clearly addresses the need of governments and law enforcement to
record Internet calls. There is also a certain sense that especially closed
networks are targeted with this technology, yet the clear notion that VoIP
applications targeted by this patent bmay include audio messages transmitted
via gaming systems, instant messaging protocols that transmit audio, Skype
and Skype-like applications, meeting software, video conferencing software,
and the likeb may raise privacy concerns and surely the question how
Microsoft intends to use such a patent now that it owns Skype.

So, Microsoft: Will Skype officially include eavesdropping capability in the
future?

A request for clarification we sent to Microsoft has remained unanswered so
far.
