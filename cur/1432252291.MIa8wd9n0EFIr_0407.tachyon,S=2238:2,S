Contrary to widespread belief, it was more
likely American voters in Israel, not Florida,
who put George W. Bush in the White
House four years ago  a phenomenon that has Kerry's supporters in
Israel vowing to do whatever it takes to make certain that doesn't
happen
again in November.

Those who doubt that Americans living abroad could tip the balance in
2004 might consider this: Various chads aside, Al Gore (news - web
sites) received 202 more votes than George W. Bush on Election Day
2000 in Florida. Only after all the overseas votes were counted,
including
more than 12,000 from Israel alone, was Bush's election victory
certified.
The margin was 537 votes.
...
But in the 2000 presidential election, Zober points out, it
made no difference how Israeli immigrants from New York voted. All that
mattered was how expatriates from Florida cast their ballots.

Israel is home to roughly 6,000 former Floridians  expatriates who tend

to be more conservative than Jewish voters in New York and many of
whom voted for Bush in the last election, Zober said.
