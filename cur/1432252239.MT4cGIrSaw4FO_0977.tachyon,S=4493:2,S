This is completely unnecessary if you address the document with a
cryptohash.  An URI like
http://localhost:4711/f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100 can only
adress a particular document.

If you serve broken content your node's reputation falls through the
floor.

Note that content is distributed, dynamic, and you have no idea what
you're actually serving.

The issue of node reputation is completely orthogonal to the document
hashes not colliding. Reputation based systems are useful, because
document URI
http://localhost:4711/f70539bb32961f3d7dba42a9c51442c1218a9100 doesn't say
what's in there. A claim needs to be backed by someone (preferably
anonymous) with a good reputation trail.
