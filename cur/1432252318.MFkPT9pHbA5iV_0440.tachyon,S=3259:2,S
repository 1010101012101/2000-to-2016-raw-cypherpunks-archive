Well, not everyone, but that was surely the way the wind was 
blowing. The Che Guevera poster symbolizes that era.

In "austin powers", they make the spy sound sixties by 
depicting him as expecting the victory of the Soviet Union, and 
perhaps rather favoring that outcome.   If they had him quote 
Ayn Rand, he would not have sounded sixties.

When the mass media want to cash in on nostalgia for the 
sixties and early seventies, it is the young commies they 
remember.

Go to the mall:  observe the mall rats.   See any baldies or
nose rings? (Come to think of it, you probably would, but I do
not.)

Nip down to that park in San Jose where all the young people
get their drugs.  See any baldies or nose rings?

You are further out of it than Doonesbury.

The leadership of the Death-to-coca-cola crowd are old farts. 
These days Chomsky needs an interpeter.  The 
could-pass-as-young pinko activists of the sixties are still in 
the business as old fart pinko activists of today.   And if the 
same is true of the libertarian party, well it has been walking 
dead for some considerable time, but its death does not reflect 
the health of libertarianism.
