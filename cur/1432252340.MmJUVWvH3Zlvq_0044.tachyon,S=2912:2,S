Celebrating two years of service to the Taxpatriate community, the Official 
Taxpatriates Page has enhanced its offerings.

We have produced a comma delimited database of the full taxpatriate list:

http://www.frissell.com/taxpat/taxpats.csv

For those who track such things, 3008 names have appeared on the "List of 
Shame" since its debut in the 4th quarter of 1996.

Some years ago, my daughter was asked by a woman in a shop why she wasn't 
in school.  She gave the answer I had previously suggested, half in 
jest.  "My daddy doesn't believe in your schools.  He says they're 
controlled by the communists."  Further deponent sayeth not.
