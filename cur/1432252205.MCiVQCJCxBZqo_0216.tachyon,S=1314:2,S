Does anyone know of a recent brute-force work
factor calculation for the various common symmetric ciphers?
I.e.   it'll take X 3.2gh Xeons Y years to brute cipher Z.
I know there's a table of these in Schneier and there's the "Seven
Cryptographers" paper but they're both pretty old at this point.

I'm just looking for an approximation.

Thanks.

Eric
