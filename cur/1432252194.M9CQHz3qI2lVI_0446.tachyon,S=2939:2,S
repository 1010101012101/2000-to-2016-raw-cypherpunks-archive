The....Comfy Chair?

One of the difficulties of working in the Bay Area is that when conferences
*are* here, I often don't get a chance to get to the daytime parts,
and many of them are price-structured in a way that you can't just
pay for evening events.  So hanging around the lobby and the bar in the evening
is the way to get to them.

For Usenix, that's not so bad - it's always been part relaxicon
as well as session-oriented convention, and more than a few companies
have started out with conversations in the bar....
