Neither, because that case would be unlikely to net much more than $10,000 in
settlement.  Hell, the guy who was violated with a baton and has effectively
no colon anymore got a measely few million from the city.

I have done white collar crime work, some related to forced disclosures, but
false imprisonment cases are usually civil cases against private defendants.
It's very hard to get a jurisdiction to pay for "injusticies" committed where
duly sworn law enforcement officials were acting in an official capacity.

You overestimate the average contextual awareness level of the typical
cypherpunk reader I think.

I stand corrected.  I had confused the 1968 date with the cesasation of
registration issuances.
