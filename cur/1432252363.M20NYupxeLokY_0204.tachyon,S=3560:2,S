Yes, thank you very much, indeed, absolutely.

A suave-tailored and barbered and elocuted gentleman
who runs UK's Internet Watch aroused the anti-censorship
crowd with the  query "should we allow an image of a penis 
up an infant's anus." 

"Absolutely not," the crowd vowed.

Debate on splitting the profane image from the urbane text 
ensued. Text should be unfettered but not pix, it was
agreed. The uncensorable textual image mouthed by the
Internet Watch barker hung in the air to arouse unanimity on 
what's not permissable in a succesful secret-vice society.

Onion kiddie-chat rooms, absolutely.
