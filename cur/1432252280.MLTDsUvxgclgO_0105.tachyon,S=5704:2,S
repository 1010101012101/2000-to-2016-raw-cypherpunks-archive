"Bob, I see here that you are "demanding" a copy of this test that I 
paid for, that you voluntarily provided a sample for, or that you 
were careless enough to leave some skin flakes for on my sofa over 
there in the office. Well, you know what, Bob? Maybe I'll let you 
have a copy of the results, maybe I'll tell you to get the hell out 
of my office. But if you keep "demanding" something that isn't yours 
to demand, I may just have to take stronger measures."

Indeed. But let's drop the use of the word "demand." I was taught 
that a "demand" is a "demand," not a request.

Indeed. And those who arrive here on this list and natter on about 
insurance as a right, about how corporations, not government, are the 
real danger, and who spout about the evils of capitalism should be 
rebuked.

And it increases overall costs by making people less sensitive to prices.

Imagine what would happen if "dietary insurance" existed, with every 
person having state-funded budgets for food and restaurant meals. 
(Don't laugh: food stamps already work this way for a significant 
subpopulation.)

The probable effect would be an overall rise in prices.

This has happened with health care. Too many examples to even begin to list.


The ultimate solution for dealing with all of these folks who demand 
money from me to pay for their insurance is to kill them. Crypto 
anarchy offers many interesting options.
