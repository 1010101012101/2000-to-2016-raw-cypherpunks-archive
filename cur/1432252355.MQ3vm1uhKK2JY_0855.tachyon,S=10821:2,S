Thanks, Tim, for posting an interesting essay. You say:

> agent's reputation. Thus suggesting strongly that reputation is not 
> something attached as simply as above.

To expand on this: It seems that using "reputation capital" to
describe a multifaceted information space such as even the most
wretched of cypherpunks posters does not do that person justice. Even
if someone is generally correct and truth-telling, he may also be
immoral or a fan of invasive police measures or immature in debate or
prone to violations of netiquette -- any of which might lower his
reputation capital.

Sure, one can say: let's just have a complicated reputation space
(think an array of arrays) for each one of these characteristics. To
use a silly example:
    * truthtelling [0-255]
    * maturity [0-255]
    * morality [0-255]
    * netiquette [0-255]
    * spelling [0-255]
    * etc.

But that quickly becomes burdensome to use as a shorthand.

It seems to me that reputation capital is a term that has limited
value when applied to something as subjective as the areas above:
having an article published in the editorial pages of the Wall Street
Journal (or the Journal of Socialist Doctrine) may lower your
reputation capital among some people and raise it among others. This
is the nature of subjectivity.

Reputation capital is more valuable a term when describing traits that
are less subjective. When dealing with an online ecash bank, you may
want truthfulness and reliability and good customer service (for
example), which are less subjective than "interesting political
opinions."
