This little polemic illustrates a classic political warfare technique
I call "rebel as you are told."  One of the most effective ways to
combat social/political reform movements is to create and promote
front groups that co-opt movements and factions with legitimate
grievances by presenting vindictive, divisive, self defeating versions
of same to the public.  This method is expensive but worth it, because
when it works an independent, self sustaining, self funding and self
defeating fad displaces a potentially effective reform movement - and
whoever is profiting from the abuses of power the original reform
movement sought to remove can rest easy for a decade or more.

I believe this tactic evolved from the simple black propaganda
technique of creating bogus advocates to stand up strawmen in the name
of various real-life reform campaigns.  Someone noticed that these
strawmen can be taken at face value by naive people whose interests it
pretends to speak for, and ran with it.
