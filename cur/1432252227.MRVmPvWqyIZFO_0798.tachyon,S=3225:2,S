Reddit (Jan 29) - "We are the Predator UAV Pilot/Operators currently in  
Afghanistan. AMAA!":
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17j9wa/we_are_predator_uav_pilotoperators_currently_in/

Haven't had a chance to review thoroughly, but looks like there's some  
interesting questions posed about the training the pilots received (a  
6-month course compressed to 1-month resulting in an FAA license) and  
similarities w/ video games.

Please share any interesting quotes you find.
