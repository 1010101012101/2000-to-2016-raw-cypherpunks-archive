i thought the idea of reinforcing cockpit doors was a good one.  i
think the issue is that most of the security added has been
ineffective.

agreed; this seems better than checking the shoes of the elderly or
forcing a nursing mother to drink some breast milk (just to be sure,
you know...)

but it's also easy to circumvent. do terrorists engage in social engineering?

also, it was my understanding that El Al uses armed personel on
flights; if this is the case perhaps more air marshalls are the
deterrent to use instead of passenger personality.

i don't think that is the issue; it is the secret laws hidden behind
"sensitive security information" which is to be fought.  if there is a
law that random search and identification are required to fly, it
needs to be public.

so glad i quit flying years ago...
