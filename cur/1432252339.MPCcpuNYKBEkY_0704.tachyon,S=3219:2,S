We hold corporate employees liable for criminal acts. Why should 
government employees be exempt from the same standard? And why should a 
judge who is able to withstand pressures not to sentence corporate 
employees to prison be unable to withstand similar pressures when it 
comes to government employees?

There are issues of separation of powers, what with the judiciary thus 
having some power to imprison legislative members, but this is not a 
new issue. Judges have sentenced members of the legislature and the 
executive branch to prison for various offenses, including bribery, 
corruption, perjury, etc.

The business of legislators passing new laws when other essentially 
identical laws were struck down, just to show their constituents that 
they are "doing something" or "helping to save the children," has got 
to stop.

"You knew that passing a law restricting freedom of speech would be 
struck down eventually. You did it anyway. You have been found guilty 
of violations of the civil rights of the 3 million residents of 
Colorado in this class action case. The 73 defendants in this case are 
each sentenced to the statutory minimum of 6 months for each violation, 
sentences to run consecutively."
