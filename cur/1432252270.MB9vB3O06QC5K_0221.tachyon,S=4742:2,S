And in this, he gave way to David Friedman and the like. Hayek is the least
Austrian of the Austrians. Look to Mises - or better yet, to Rothbard - to
find a much better Austrian.

You're still incredibly deluded. Even Hayek (bad as he is) would have
supported someone's decision NOT to sell to someone else, your rethoric
notwithstanding. BTW, do you have anything else besides "Tim is wrong"? (And
I'm no fan of Tim.)
