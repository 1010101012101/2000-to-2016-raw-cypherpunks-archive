KNO3 is of interest to airport security eg in gunpowder.  Similar
salts are in fertilizer.  Ergo the caution.  Also, some of us have 
had a black powder addiction at one time.

If you just took an angina pill I imagine the mechanical noses can
detect it on your hands or things you touch immediately afterwards.

Or blackpowder (or noncorrosive powder substitutes).. or wore that clothing
when setting off firecrackers...

Not out of San Jose Intl... but discussing Semtex (tm) could get
you federal charges in the states... 

Actually I have seen someone set off the sniffer, the local airline
rep came over, they chatted briefly, the person was on their way,
maybe 30 extra seconds taken.  San Jose again.
