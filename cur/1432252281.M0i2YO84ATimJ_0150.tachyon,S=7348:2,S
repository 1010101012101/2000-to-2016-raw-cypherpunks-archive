China's human rights policy, and American criticism of it, have formed a 
centerpiece of U.S.-China difficulties ever since 1989, when pro-democracy 
protests on Beijing's Tiananmen Square ended in bloodshed. Hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, died.
In the years afterward, many in the U.S. Congress demanded that renewal of 
China's "most-favored nation" trade status be contingent on human-rights 
progress by the communist government. Most-favored nation status by the 
United States for China is now permanent.
China insists it is making great progress in its own way and must be given 
leeway to balance the difficulties of governing 1.3 billion people through 
a period of great change with what it has acknowledged is the necessity of 
human rights.
Human rights groups say China's harsh treatment of Tibetans, ethnic Uighurs 
and members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement demonstrates its lack of 
progress on the issue.
China and the United States are attending the ASEAN Regional Forum as two 
of several nations who are not members of the 10-country Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations but have security interests in the region.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to visit the United States later 
this year in what many perceive as a farewell trip before his expected 
retirement.
