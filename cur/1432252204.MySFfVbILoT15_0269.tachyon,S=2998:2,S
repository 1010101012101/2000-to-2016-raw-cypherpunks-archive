Choice quotes from the Man, who doesn't realize that the Constitution
protects *everyone* in the US, regardless of residency status:

                      The cards would be voluntary for all U.S.
citizens, he said
                      Tuesday. Any American without a card still could
board a
                      plane, but only after undergoing a more rigorous
search.

                      The cards would be mandatory, however, for foreign

                      visitors, including students on visas and
non-citizens living
                      and working in the United States who now carry
``green
                      cards,'' he said. Ellison has not offered
specifics on how
                      the estimated 8 million illegal immigrants in the
United
                      States might be affected.
