I would denounce it, but the fact is that our denouncements don't matter.

Political prosecutions and trials have become the norm.

Personally, I have been closely involved in two serious criminal 
trials. In both of these criminal cases, those charged either were 
found guilty or would have been had they gone to trial (one of them 
died before the trial). In the case of the guilty person, he received 
no prison term for perpetrating a very serious crime. Why? Because 
there was no political interest in his case, so the usual excuse 
about how "overcrowded our prisons are" was used to let him avoid a 
prison sentence. When there is no interest in a case, a rap on the 
knuckles is the worst fate most street criminals ever face. However, 
if there is political interest, then charges are magnified and hyped 
and information is leaked to "U.S. News and World Report" about the 
horrible terrorist who awaits prosecution by the protectors of our 
freedoms. Even though our jails and prisons are said to be so crowded 
that violent felons are given bullshit "be a good boy" releases, 
political trials such as the cases of Parker, Bell, Henson,  and 
others are the focus of cop activities  and aggressive prosecutions.

We let murderers, arsonists, and kidnappers go free so that the 
prisons can be filled with people who write fanciful essays about the 
"Circle of Eunuchs" and those who criticize local doughnut eaters.

Keith Henson faces much more prison time than does the violent 
criminal in the case I am involved with. Because Henson is a thought 
criminal, while the violent criminal is just an ordinary criminal. 
And in these beknighted states of America, being a though criminal 
like Bell, Parker, or Henson is far worse than being a rapist, 
murderer, arsonist, or thief.

Time for another Revolution and for about a hundred thousand 
dishonest cops and judges to face trial for and be put before firing 
squads.
