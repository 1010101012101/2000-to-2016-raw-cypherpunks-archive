I didn't say that this was the whole problem.  I said that it 
demonstrated a (one) basic flaw.  On the other hand, I didn't say
that the problem simply involved US law.  In this case the problem
seemed to be pressure from the executive branch.

There is a very large world outside of the United States.  There is 
no reason why issues involving .UK, for example, should be subject 
to the jurisdiction of California courts.  Britain is not a colony
of the United States, nor is it a California county.

Nor is there any justification for US government control over the
allocation of IP address space within Europe.  But when you look 
closely at ICANN, this is what you are getting.

ICANN was supposed to replace IANA.  IANA had a narrow technical role
that depended upon voluntary cooperation.  Having IANA arbitrate 
decisions about .UK actually worked, because IANA did not claim any
ultimate legal authority.  It was just obvious to everyone that if
they didn't cooperate the Internet would not work.

It may seem odd, but because IANA was gossamer thin, it had real 
power and legitimacy.  ICANN doesn't and shouldn't.

ICANN is a California corporation subject to state and US laws.  It
has an obligation to obey those laws.  There is or should be no 
question about this.  ICANN is after all a legal fiction, a body 
whose very existence rests upon the authority of the state of 
California.

The question is whether the domain name system, the IP address space, 
and other fundamental Internet infrastructure should be subject
to US and California law.  These are global, not local, resources.
