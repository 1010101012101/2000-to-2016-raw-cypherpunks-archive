excerpts from http://mappa.mundi.net/inform/inform_0190.html


The Seattle building had so much fiber running
between floors that one elevator shaft was eliminated to make room. I
believe this is
the first time that I know of where people space in an office building
has been
replaced with electron (or photon) space.

(Amusingly, the Seattle
offices had a simple $100 hub that connected three of the Alaska
providers to each
other. But that was probably all that was needed.)
