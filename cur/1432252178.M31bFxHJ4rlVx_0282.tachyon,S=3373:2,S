Spam.

The reason clients pay Alice or Bob to receive their approval ratings is
to avoid downloading bogus files - incomplete, poorly encoded, misnamed,
or deliberately spoofed files (cf Madonna's "what the fuck?" example).

Bandwidth isn't free.  Time and effort isn't free.  If it's cheaper for
someone to pay Alice the Editor to tell them which files meet a
particular standard, rather than spend their own time and bandwidth
downloading and listening to half a dozen potential copies, then Alice
makes a profit.

People aren't paying Alice for the content - they can get that anywhere.
 They're paying for Alice's opinions.  The reason Alice's opinions are
worth something is that they are backed by Alice's reputation.  That's
why Bob can't merely strip off Alice's signature, resign and
redistribute: the thing he is redistributing is no longer backed by
Alice's reputation, it's backed by Bob's reputation.  It's no longer
Alice's opinion, it's Bob's.

Process is the same for other domains, not just mp3 sharing.  Think
anti-spam services, search engines.  People aren't paying to receive
more content - they're paying to receive _less_.  

There's a good reason why Google is able to resell its opinions to other
search engines, even though those opinions are effectively freely
available from other sources.
