Wealth distribution is a law of nature
submitted by: Institute for Social Inventions
Summarised from an article by Mark Buchanan, entitled 'That's The Way Money
Goes', in New Scientist (August 19th 2000; New Scientist subs #97 or $140,
tel 44 [0] 1622 778000).

Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mezard, two French econophysicists, believe
that wealth falling into the hands of a minority is not just a fact of
life, but a law of nature. They have discovered a connection between the
physics of materials and the movements of money, a link that could
revolutionise the way we think about the distribution of wealth in society.
It could also provide a mathematical basis to theories of free trade and
competition.(cont at URL above)

I hope they're close by to study the day my BUM went psycho.(Barter Units
of Money.Im 9k an hour btw.)
