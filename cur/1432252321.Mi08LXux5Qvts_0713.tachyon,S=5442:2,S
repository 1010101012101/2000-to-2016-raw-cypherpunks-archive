InfoSec News is a privately run, medium traffic list that caters to
distribution of information security news articles. These articles
will come from newspapers, magazines, online resources, and more.

To subscribe to ISN, send mail to majordomo@attrition.org with
"subscribe isn" in the BODY of the mail.

To unsubscribe to ISN, send mail to majordomo@attrition.org with
"unsubscribe isn" in the BODY of the mail.

The subject line will always contain the title of the article, so that
you may quickly and effeciently filter past the articles of no
interest.

This list will contain:

	Articles catering to security, hacking, firewalls, new
        security encryption, products, public hacks, hoaxes,
        legislation affecting these topics and more.

	Information on where to obtain articles in current magazines.

	Security Book reviews and information.

	Security conference/seminar information.

	New security product information.

	And anything else that comes to mind..

Feedback is encouraged. The list maintainers would like to hear what
you think of the list, What could use improving, and which parts
are "right on". Subscribers are also encouraged to submit articles
or URLs. If you submit an article, please send either the URL or
the article in ASCII text. Further, subscribers are encouraged to give
feedback on articles or stories, which may be posted to the list.
Anonymous feedback is welcome.

Please do NOT:

	* subscribe vanity mail forwards to this list

	* subscribe from 'free' mail addresses (ie: juno, hotmail)

	* enable vacation messages while subscribed to mail lists

	* subscribe from any account with a small quota

All of these generate messages to the list owner and make tracking
down dead accounts very difficult. I am currently receiving as many
as 50+ returned mails a day. Any of the above are grounds for
being unsubscribed. You are welcome to resubscribe when you address
the issue(s). This is not a whim! Other moderaters have begun to do
the same.

Special thanks to the following for continued contribution:
	William Knowles, Aleph One, Will Spencer, Jay Dyson,
	Nicholas Brawn, Felix von Leitner, Robert G. Ferrell,
        Phreak Moi, Brian Martin, Marjorie Simmons, Richard Forno
