ANSWER:
The monkey without anything.

EXPLANATION:
The monkey with the banana but without the stick is disqualified; he has 
nothing to defend his prize, trusting in the decency of the "society" of 
primates he lives in to protect him and his valuable belongings. A clear case 
of wishful thinking.

The monkey with the stick but no banana is disqualified as well. He has spent 
his resources to gain the means of taking wealth (the banana) by force; 
resources including energy, time and intelligence. However, he has a stick, 
not a gun, and as soon as he tries to take the banana from his neighbor the 
other primates will attack him as a threat to the "common good". 

You, on the other hand, are disqualified as well. Although you are a primate, 
and some would claim that as a human you win by default, you're dumb enough 
to get stuck in a room with three monkeys.

Which leaves the monkey who has nothing. If the monkey with the stick 
attempts to take the banana, the resulting fight will likely leave the other 
two monkeys out of the running; the banana monkey weakened by the initial 
attack and the stick monkey beaten by the mass counterattack. Leaving him 
with the banana and the stick. 

Remember, it's *always* the quiet ones.
