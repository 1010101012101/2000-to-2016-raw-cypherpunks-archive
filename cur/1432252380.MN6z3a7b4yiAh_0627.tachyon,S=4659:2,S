I'm even more concerned, even angry, about some local restaurants 
_restricting content_ and _limiting my choices_.

(Their excuse is that they talk to other restaurant and dietary 
experts, a la the ORBS conspiracy, and learn which food items are 
popular and which are not. Like ORBS, this is a de facto conspiracy 
to impose food censorship on the citizen units! RICO, anyone?)

Like Choate, I believe we must stop the practice of ISPs deciding how 
to deal with their property as they choose. And we must stop this 
censorious practice of allowing restaurants to restrict content! And 
newspapers must be forced to carry anything the Peoples want to have 
published. Long live the Socialist Internationale!
