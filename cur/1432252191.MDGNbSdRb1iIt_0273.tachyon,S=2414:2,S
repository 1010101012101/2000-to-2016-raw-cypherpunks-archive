The San Francisco Bay Area Cypherpunks will be meeting
Saturday, April 12, 2003, from 1-5pm.
The meeting will be in Moscone Center North, Room 112.
The RSA show starts Sunday, so people from all over will be around.

Agenda:  Our agenda, as ever, is a tightly held secret :-)
This is an open public meeting on US soil.

Logistics - You'll need to go to registration to get day passes,
because it's a show floor setup day.
I'll try to make sure there are signs, and that the processes work.
Kellie Beakey is the person at registration who coordinates them.
They might want people to sign in (so think of creative aliases!)
but I will try to make this not happen.

Directions: Moscone Center is at 3rd-4th St. and Howard.
Moscone Center North is the side closer to Market St.,
adjacent to the Sony Metreon (which has coffee and food court.)

- BART stops at Powell, which is near 4th and Market, about 3 blocks away.
- Muni busses run down 4th St. from Market
- Caltrain is still doing weekend construction, but they claim to run busses.
         The Caltrain depot is 4th and Townsend, and Muni busses go back up 
3rd.
