No shit, what was your first clue Sherlock?

There is a long and strong history as to what is considered 'cruel and
unusual', torture and that sort of crap was ruled unavailable long, long,
ago.

However, if you think about it a moment while positing that such behaviour
is found to be allowable then the quesion of the 'United States' becomes
moot.

You do the math, if you can stop thinking like a victim.
