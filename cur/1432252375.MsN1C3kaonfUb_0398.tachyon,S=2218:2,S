Tim May has probably gotten all strange in the last few years, living in
his remote hilltop home, waiting to see the end that will not come since
the y2k crisis turned out to be nothing more than a financial boondoggle
for the companies that believed all the hype.

Imagine that his racist rantings are the expression of a frustration that
he cannot admit, and that the overtly bigoted expressions are a cover to
hide his real opinions on affairs over which he has no control.  I
sincerely doubt that he cares one way or another over the fate of
Washington welfare cases, the poor of Africa, or the 'Underground Zionist
Leaders of America' (or whatever).


Regards,

Steve
