This is a critical point, and it's one you fail to recognize over and over 
again.

Let me tell you a little story. There's this guy that lives down the 
block...I think he may be a Satanist or something, but I'm not quite sure. I 
know he's into some wierd stuff...I saw his wife with a black eye once, and 
his kids don't look so happy or healthy.

One day at the supermarket his cart crashed into mine. It may have been an 
accident, but I'm not quite sure. But the guy gave me an eye, so he's 
clearer a threat to me.

So what I did the other day was I broke into the guy's house...it was late 
and I took him by surpise so when he was coming down the stairs I shot him. 
His older son came at me with a baseball bat, so I had to shoot him too. 
When I finally got to the wife the ungrateful bitch started crying and 
begged me not to kill her..."DAMMIT, I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU YOU STUPID BITCH" 
I said to her, but she didn't seem to feel any better.

Actually, I'm typing this message from her house, because if I leave the 
cops'll get me and maybe some more of the guy's relatives will come, and 
then we'll be right back where we started. I've got no plans to leave here 
for at least 2 to 3 years. Funny thing is, though, every now and then when 
I'm coming down the stairs there will be tacks or nails or something at the 
bottom. I'm starting to get the idea they don't want me here!

Sometimes I wonder if I should have done this, but now that I look around 
this guy's house I can see all sorts of whips and books on Satanism. So it 
turns out I was right! I guess that means I did the right thing.
