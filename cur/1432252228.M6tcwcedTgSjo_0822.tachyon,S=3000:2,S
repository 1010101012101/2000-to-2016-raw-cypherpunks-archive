"Moore made explosive and rockets- fragments of which would pepper a
neighbor's
roof, 'which wasn't much fun from their point of view'.  He tinkerred with a 
variety of explosives, "but nitroglycerin was one of the easiest ones" he
said.
'You couldn't get away with that now.'"

Moore, as in Gordon E. Moore, of Moore's law and ex ceo of Intel.
