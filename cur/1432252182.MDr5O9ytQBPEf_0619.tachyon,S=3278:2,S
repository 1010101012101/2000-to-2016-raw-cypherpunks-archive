Your first and second sentences don't go very well together, Eugen. :)

Using Paypal is not a bad idea; they're pretty efficient in terms of
fee percentage, their servers don't go down very often, and they have a
very large market presence in the US and a few other markets.  I
personally don't use any other standalone online payment system.

But, keeping a significant fraction of your capital in Paypal is a
terrible idea.  They have very little patience for innovative business
models, they have a poor track record of customer service, and their
default response to any surprise is to freeze the account balance.

Noisebridge automatically transfers our Paypal balance to our bank
account on a regular schedule (nightly, I think, but don't quote me.)
