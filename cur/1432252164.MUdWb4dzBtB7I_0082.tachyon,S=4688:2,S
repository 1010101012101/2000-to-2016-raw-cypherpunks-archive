Col. Morris Davis: “Military has detailed regs on confinement credits
& parole eligibility. My best est is he'll do about 8-9 yrs, out by
age 33-34.”

If true, a pretty fitting sentence, I think, for indiscriminately
publishing huge amount of classified information that potentially
endangered many people, and considering that USA has unusually harsh
sentences for a developed country.

An interesting comment on Reddit, of all places:
“Significant amounts of foreign service agent names were released.
These are civilians working for their government in some official
capacity (think spies, except not all of them are cloak and dagger
types). These were people stationed in hostile countries (Pakistan, SE
Asia, Middle East, Africa) and if their cover had been blown while in
country they could have been sought out.
Luckily, as I understand it most of the people that were exposed were
notified by their handlers in advance (basically as soon as word go
out that diplomatic cables had been compromised) and were extracted. A
friend of mine works in a field that draws a lot of foreign service
agents to it due to the nature of the work, and they were camped out
in northern Pakistan with her crew. She woke up one morning (the
morning after the diplomatic cables were released) and half her crew
was gone. They got word in the middle of the night and left. They
couldn't even tell the people they were with why they were gone, and I
imagine it was quite unsettling to be there and be missing people all
of the sudden.”
