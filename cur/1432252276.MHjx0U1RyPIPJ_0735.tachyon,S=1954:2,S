I imagine if there exists a https://www.go1d.com/ site for purposes of
fraud, it won't be using a self-signed cert. Of course it is possible that
the attackers are using http:// instead, but more people are likely to
notice that.

I don't think any currently can be - but regardless, an attacker wishing to
run a fraudulent https site must have a certificate acceptable to the
majority of browsers without changing settings - That currently is the big
name CAs and nobody else.
