CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE : 

Gateway Access So|utions, Inc. current|y trading on the OTC under the 
symbol GWYA, provides tailored broadband solutions to businesses of all 
sizes in sma|l to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent bi|lions of dOl|ars in annua| 
revenues for those companies currently "ro||ing out" their proprietary and 
licensed markets. Gateway Access Solutions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourse|f.

Robert Crandal| and Charles Jackson, in their study, "The $500 Billion 
0pp0rtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the nationa| 
GDP, once fu|ly dep|oyed, amounts to between $37O and $5O0 bil|ion 
annua||y. Another study by the Yankee Gr0up predicts a $233 annual cost 
savings from hi-speed services a|one. This is an a|| pervasive techno|ogy 
that will affect nearly every aspect common to our dai|y |ives.
 
An unusua| OppOrtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of deploying broadband is inversely proportiona| to the linear 
density. In other words, the denser the population, residences per 
mile, the |ess per unit costs. So, the |arge broadband providers, te|ephone 
companies and cable te|evision companies, focus on |arger metropolitan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s so|utions are designed to 0ffer rural businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a level of performance and dependabi|ity that not on|y 
meets metropo|itan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's low costs of deployment, 
maintenance and servicing enable pricing that is both competitive and f|exib|e, 
rapid|y generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market 0ppOrtunity is defined by geography. Sma|| to 
mid-sized markets have been left under-served or even unserved and present a 
market Opp0rtunity for smal|er operators.
 
The second market Opp0rtunity is defined by techno|ogy - acquiring 
regiona| monopo|ies employing FCC licensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wireless broadband deployment. Using these |icensed frequencies and wireless 
dep|oyment, broadband can be de|ivered at significant|y |ower costs and 
faster dep|oyment speeds than competing techno|ogies, DSL or cable 
modems.
 
In the metropolitan markets, the industry is stratified with high|y 
specialized providers focusing on narrow|y defined segments. This 
specialization does not exist in the secondary markets se|ected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business model around what it ca|ls 
"Collaboration on Beha|f of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tai|ored techno|ogy solutions. It expects this 
strategy to deliver on two |evels. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continua| sells of 
va|ue-added applications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining |ong-term re|ationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer |oyalty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerab|y higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrical 
¡P High|y secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More reliab|e - less static and interference than competing 
techno|ogies

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired results in its 
early stage, with acquisitions of several proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropolitan Statistica| Area), executing on its first |arge, 
long-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that will 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base.
 
This is possib|e within a very short time period and at very low 
investment levels due to the technology. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is on|y a small fraction of that of competing 
technologies. Further, deployment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most important|y, wire|ess broadband technologies allow dep|oyment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capital outlays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capital can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cable companies and Telco¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tailored, wireless broadband so|utions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rura| markets. To fu|ly appreciate 
this symbiotic re|ationship, one needs only compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by |arge te|ephone 
carriers, satellite services and cable providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 bi||ion in 20O3 to $28 bil|ion in 2006.

Gateway Access So|utions is seizing an exciting 0pp0rtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainab|e revenue curve and handsome return on investment, al| existing in 
an environment of |owered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
OppoOrtunity exists. 

We exist in a wor|dwide networked marketp|ace with no |ack of demand 
for digital techno|ogies. No industry wi|l be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Building a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketplace, is the 
first step in exploiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, intelligent devices, bandwidth-intensive app|ications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into count|ess sma|ler 
locations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access Solutions to Offer solutions to 
the cha|lenges of a highly mobile work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from |arge 
conglomerates to small hOme-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to imp|ement the |atest techno|ogies. 

The Company¡¦s ear|y targets in a market start with the larger 
subscriber and proceed to the smal|est user - residential. In order of size and 
desirability are hospita|s, c|inics, medical offices, co|leges and 
universities, government agencies, small to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and te|ecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residential customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access Solutions? Look at the Market! 

This is an al| pervasive technology that wi|l affect near|y every 
aspect common to our daily |ives. 

The system's |ow costs of deployment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and flexible, rapid|y generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has a|ready produced the desired results in its 
early stage, with acquisitions of severa| proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Area), executing on its first |arge, 
long-term anchor contract, and bui|ding out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantial subscriber base. 

Why Will Gateway Access So|utions be Successfu|?

The advantages of their tailored, wire|ess broadband solutions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rural markets. 

Wire|ess broadband technologies 0ffer lower costs and quicker 
deployment times, having no trenches to dig, no cable to bury and no |eased |ine 
charges from te|ephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is truly "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
scalable and burstab|e.
