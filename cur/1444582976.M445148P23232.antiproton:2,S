<pre>Calling bullshit. Mirimirs right, explanation makes no sense. And JYA says netsol won&#39;t let him delete the logs but Netsol says <a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/support/how-to-enable-download-the-web-logs/">logs are disabled by default</a> and you have to turn them on.

So how the fuckd this really happen?

Mirimir &lt;mirimir@riseup.net&gt; 
Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?

I almost can&#39;t imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can&#39;t imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can&#39;t imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.

&lt;--SNIP--&gt;

&gt;<i> Should access logs be kept for that long?  Absolutely not.  From what I
</i>&gt;<i> have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log files were
</i>&gt;<i> included in a NetSol total restore.  My guess is that John/Cryptome did
</i>&gt;<i> not intentionally keep these files, and did not realize these files were
</i>&gt;<i> included in the archive.
</i>
But that&#39;s the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the &quot;NetSol total restore&quot; have changed that?

&gt;<i> When I do incremental backups or updates on my own systems, I don&#39;t
</i>&gt;<i> usually go back and check the integrity of files I&#39;ve already archived
</i>&gt;<i> in my closed system.  I can see where this could be an honest mistake
</i>&gt;<i> that has gotten blown way out of proportion.  It&#39;s a good lesson to be
</i>&gt;<i> more aware of these types of glitches.
</i>
I still don&#39;t get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.</pre>
