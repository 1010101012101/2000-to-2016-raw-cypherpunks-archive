Book review from the Whole Earth Review magazine. E-mail to 
(wer@well.sf.ca.us) for more info about the magazine. War Tax Resistance (A 
Guide to Withholding Your Support From the Military) Ed Hedemann, 1992; 131 
pp. $14.95 ($17.95 postpaid) from New Society Publishers, 4527 Springfield 
Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19143; 800/333-9093 About half of your income tax 
goes to support the military, past and present. About 80 percent of the 
national debt is attributable to the military. For moral reasons or just 
plain outrage at expensive toilet seats and bombers that dont fly, there is 
cause for both liberal and conservative to decry the spending of such huge 
sums on killing when there are so many more pressing needs. What can you do 
about this matter? Can you refuse to support the military by paying only 
half your taxes? If you do that, what will happen next? Are there ways to 
avoid paying for the military and stay out of trouble? (Yes.) This book, 
now in its fourth edition since 1981, presents the tax resistance 
arguments, the rules of the game, your options for personal action, and the 
probable results. Maddening, tantalizing and realistic.
