Rumsfeld to order Syria invasion plan  

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--An intelligence source says U.S. Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld last week ordered the drawing up of contingency plans 
for a possible invasion of Syria, Newsday reported Thursday. According to 
the newspaper's Web site, Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith is 
working on a policy paper highlighting how Syria's support of terrorist 
groups is a threat to the region. But the newspaper also reported that 
a senior Pentagon officer said he was unaware of any new planning 
regarding Syria.

Rumsfeld said Wednesday that Syria had allowed Iraqi regime figures to 
enter and had provided Iraq with military technology.
