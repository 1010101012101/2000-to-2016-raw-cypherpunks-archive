You're the product, not Windows.  That was the good thing about the old
Microsoft (yes, there were good things about them), they took your money and
left you alone to do whatever you wanted with their software.  Now, like
Google (where you're entirely the product, for sale to anyone with money) and
Apple (where you're still the product, but the sole customer is Apple),
they're turning their customers into the product.

(Not to mention that W10 has moved even further along the path of treating
your PC like a cellphone.  It's possibly the first GUI I've used that was
literally painful to use, the all-white-all-the-time UI theme was like staring
into a lightbox, my eyes hurt after an hour of two of setting up a neighbour's
PC).

Peter.
