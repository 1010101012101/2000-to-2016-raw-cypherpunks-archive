You're correct,  of course.  It doesn't.

They're not forced to do anything.  They're probably under the 
delusion that they're safer from liability if they ban groups whose
names imply pirated content.  It's not their fault if somebody
puts metallica mp3s in alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork,
but what the hell did anyone expect to be in alt.binaries.metallica?

I think actually they're shooting themselves in the foot.  If they
excercise no editorial control at all over their news servers
they're protecyed as common carriers,  whereas if they
do excercise some control,  they might be considered to approve
of whatever they let through.

OTOH,  they're probably rich enough to be safe anyway.
