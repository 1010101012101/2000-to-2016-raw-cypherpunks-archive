Yes, running a middleman is a good idea. Unfortunately if an adversary
knows you're running a middleman, it seems that he can make it seem as
though you're sending spam and so on (or just claim it w/o proof,
depending on ISP). My impression is that there are some people out
there actively going after remailers, but it's a vague impression.
