I did, actually.  Turns out I got the year wrong, it was 1967 not 
1965.  But the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, to which the US is a 
signatory, has a big fat anti-sovereignty clause, stating that no 
nation can claim off-earth territory.

Although I found this guy far too optimistic about the role of
government, I believe he has his facts straight regarding the 
treaty.
