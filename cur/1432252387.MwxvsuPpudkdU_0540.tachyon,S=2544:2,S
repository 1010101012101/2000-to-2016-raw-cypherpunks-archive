Who said anything about switching to GPG?

My code uses GPG to determine if a message contains OpenPGP formatted
data. In my tests the code is able to determine if a message contains
data which has been encrypted/signed with PGP 2.6.3 _and_ GPG. I have
not tested messages encrypted/signed with PGP 5.x or PGP 6.x.

You obviously have not tried the code. Please do so.
