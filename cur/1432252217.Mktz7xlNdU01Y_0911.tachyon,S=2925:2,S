We saw that when the Soviet Union fell, the US lost interest in 
central America, and peace and democracy broke out in central 
America with the victory of those forces that had formerly 
received US backing, and the defeat of those forces that had 
formerly received Soviet backing, showing that US meddling in 
central America, was, as it was claimed to be, a defensive 
response to Soviet meddling, a defensive response that had the 
support of the people of central America, and that the 
suffering of central America was in substantial part caused by 
Soviet meddling.

Sure they don't trust us, but observe that in the Afghan 
election, Karzai got 56% of the vote, and the 
soft-on-the-taliban guys got much the same vote as the supposed 
representatives of the oppressed masses in Central America - 
down in the asterixes.  I predict a very similar election 
outcome in Iraq.  Sadr may get a dangerously large vote,
possibly as large as the Nazis got in the Weimar republic, but
anyone who looks aligned with the car bombers will be down in
the asterixes.

Another tale from your odd parallel universe where the US 
attacked Korea.
