1. SWIFT agreement adopted by the European Parliament
============================================================

The European Parliament has adopted the so-called SWIFT agreement on 8 July
2010 allowing sharing EU citizens' bank data with the US authorities, but
failing to stick to its initial position on privacy safeguards from February
2010.

The text was adopted with 484 votes in favour and 109 against. The
supporters of the current version claim that the new text was significantly
improved by gaining a number of important concessions from the US. These
include the limitation of bulk data being transfer to the US or the role of
Europol in overseeing the transfer process.

However, even the data protection European bodies - EDPS and the Article 29
Working Party - have underlined that the current agreement does not meet the
European privacy standards.

As EDRi has explained in a FAQ made public shortly before the vote, there
is no prior judicial ruling required for transfer of data, the definition of
"terrorism" is very broad and there is still no legal redress available for
EU citizens in the US against data transfers or the possibly serious
consequences thereof.

Also, in practice, SWIFT can't currently limit data searches to specific
individuals or single transactions. Actually, it will have to (and has in
the past) transfer data about all transactions from a certain country or a
certain bank on a certain date. There have been reports that the US Treasury
has received up to 25% of all SWIFT transactions, which number in the
billions each year.

As regards the Europol's position, the EU body is far from a judicial
authority and it is now authorized to request information from the US
searches in the transferred data, which drastically reduces any incentive to
limit the transferred amount of data in the first place.

This agreement will enter into force on 1 August 2010. The current text will
be valid for 5 years and then automatically extends for one year at a time.
In order to terminate the agreement, one of the parties has to take an
initiative. Even if it is terminated, all transferred data will remain at
the disposal of US authorities. The data provided to the American
authorities will be subject to a retention period of 5 years.

============================================================
2. European Parliament invents Google Nanny
============================================================

The Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection of the European
Parliament has found another use for Google. From now on, Google should read
what we are searching for and, if the search implies any risky behaviour,
Google should tell us to be careful. Of course, it would not be just Google
but any "search engine" and nobody felt to that it was necessary define what
exactly a "search engine" would be in this context.

The first such "risky" behaviour would be looking for information about
medication. In a report about falsified medicine, the Committee agreed to a
proposal to insert warnings in search engines in the event of a search for
medicinal products on the internet. Whether or not people exist who would
both be foolish enough to search for (and buy?) dangerous medicines from
uncertified sources online, but yet clever enough to accept Google's wise
counsel, is not yet clear. A further question is how one could implement
such a policy without scaring people away from using entirely legitimate and
verified online pharmacies.

One can, however, see lots of useful ways in which this measure can be
spread into other areas where people may be searching for things which
could, in some circumstances, be dangerous. There are vast numbers of things
which are at least as dangerous as searching for information about
medication online, although the biggest danger of all seems to be the
creation of a society whose common sense has atrophied through living in a
nanny state where people are no longer expected to think for themselves.

Undemocratic countries will also be looking with interest on what can be
done using such a system. Belarus claims that its new laws restricting the
Internet are based on legislation introduced in France and the United
Kingdom. The prospect of search engines giving a warning of the consequences
of accessing certain online resources would be an interesting new addition
to an armoury of internet restrictions.

The Committee report (adopted by 46 votes to zero, with two abstentions)
will be probably voted in a plenary session of the European Parliament in
September. It is unclear if alternative proposals will be tabled or whether
the European Commission will support the measure.

3. Increased Internet censorship in Belarus
============================================================

The Belarus government has adopted new measures increasing the control of
the Internet and restrictions on online freedom of expression.

Following Decree no.60 (On measures for improving use of the national
Internet network) issued on 1 February 2010 by President Alyaksandr
Lukashenka, Belarus Council of Ministers adopted five resolutions with new
Internet regulations introducing the compulsory registration of all web
sites and the collection of personal data of Internet cafe users.

The decree will enter fully into force on 1 September but the police has
already started interrogations and equipment seizures in a campaign meant to
intimidate Internet users and online journalists. According to the new
regulations, all ISPs on the territory of Belarus, irrespective of their
commercial or non-commercial nature, must register with the Communication
and Information Ministry and provide technical details about online
information resources, networks and systems used to connect to the Internet,
including computers and mobile phones.

The Council of Ministers issued on 29 April 2010 a decree "On some questions
of improving usage of the national segment of global Internet computer
network" according to which the information on registered Internet resources
gathered by a registering organisation is to be further on passed to the
Operative-Analytical Center. The body created by the same Decree no.60
will be subordinated to the President's office and will have the task to
monitor the content before it is put online, meaning it will actually be a
censorship organism. At the request of the Center, ISPs are to close down
any website within 24 hours.

The Belarusian State Telecommunication Inspection will make a list of
forbidden websites on the ground of proposals of appropriate governmental
bodies. If a Belarusian site is included on the blacklist, the owner will
receive a notice about that. The blacklist will further on be published on
the Telecommunication Inspection website, but the national ISPs may extend
that if they want.

Also any person accessing the Internet in an Internet cafi or using a shared
connection with one, must provide an identification document and a record of
all his (her) online connections will be kept for a year.

Based on the new legislation, Beltelecom, the state-own ISP has recently
blocked access to kurier.vitebsk.by, Vitebsky Kuryer's newspaper's
website which had not registered with the authorities for ideological
reasons. The reasons are actually political ones as the site criticized
local and national policies. The decree appears to be in fact aimed at
blocking opposition's Internet resources in view of the upcoming
presidential elections.

The decree has been strongly opposed and criticized by the media community
and international human rights organizations, including OSCE. Nine members
of the National Bolshevik Party who made an unauthorised demonstration on
the Freedom Square in Minsk on 23 June 2010, waving placards and wearing
T-shirts with the words "Internet Freedom", were arrested, convicted and
fined for the infringement of the procedures for holding demonstrations.

4. The Digital Economy Act brought to court by two UK ISPs
============================================================

The two big UK ISPs, BT and TalkTalk, have asked the High Court to carry out
a judicial review of the most controversial aspects of the Digital Economy
Act, in order to establish whether it is in contradiction with existing
privacy and electronic communication laws.

The law will force ISPs to disconnect their customers deemed by intellectual
property rights holders to have allegedly infringed copyrights.

"The companies share a concern that obligations imposed by the Act may not
be compatible with important European rules that are designed to ensure that
national laws are proportionate, protect users' privacy, restrict the role
of ISPs in policing the Internet and maintain a single market," says a
statement of the two ISPs.

Regulator Ofcom, which is in charge of drawing up detailed plans on how the
legislation will work, has recently publicly presented the draft policy to
deal with illegal file-sharers, requiring ISPs to send warning letters to
customers who allegdly illegally download films, music and TV programs. A
provision was added at the last moment stipulating that several rounds of
consultation would be required before the implementation of such measures.

The two ISPs believe they are also disadvantaged by the Digital Economy Act
as, presently, the code of practice applies only to ISPs with more than  400
000 subscribers and therefore they may see all lot of their customers move
to smaller ISPs which are not subject to the legislation.

Technology lawyer Struan Robertson of Pinsent Masons stated that the court
could not do much about a law that has already been approved by the
Parliament: "All the court can do is make a declaration that a law is in
breach of other obligations. That declaration would put pressure on
Parliament to revisit the act."

Although, according to BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that the
Digital Economy Act "badly needs to be repealed" the new coalition
government has no plans to change it.

"The Digital Economy Act sets out to protect our creative economy from the
continued threat of online copyright infringement, which industry estimates
costs the creative industries, including creators, #400m per year," read a
statement from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills which also
said: "We believe measures are consistent with EU legislation and that there
are enough safeguards in place to protect the rights of consumers and ISPs
and will continue to work on implementing them."

5. Belgium ISPs are not obliged to block The Pirate Bay
============================================================

Two Belgian ISPs have won their court battle against an anti-piracy group
which had demanded that they block the access to The Pirate Bay.

On 9 July 2010, the Antwerp Commercial Court rejected the blocking demands
made by the Belgium Anti-Piracy Federation against the two ISPs, considering
that the measure would be "disproportionate".

The entertainment industry has exerted pressures recently on ISPs to block
the Pirate Bay but most of them are refusing to comply. The negotiations the
Anti-Piracy Federation had with Belgacom and Telenet ended up in court but
the court ruled in favour of the ISPs.

The ISPs argued they were merely technical operators and did not have the
capacity to judge which sites were illegal and should be blocked. "It is not
the role of Telenet to decide which sites should be available or not to our
users. As a service provider, this is not within our competence," said a
spokesperson for one of the ISPs.

Also in Norway, the main ISP has refused to block access to The Pirate Bay
considering that "asking from an ISP to control and establish what its users
can or not download is as bad as asking from a post office to open and read
any letter and to decide which should or not be delivered" as explained
Ragnar Kerus, Telenor Director who added that it was not a question of being
for or against copyright but of knowing whether it was "reasonable for ISPs
to have the role of Internet censor in order to make certain rights
observed".

Another action follows the OpenBitTorrent that moved to the Spanish hosting
company SoloGigabit. Spain is one of the countries where BitTorrent search
trackers are not considered to infringe the law. Even so, IFPI has decided
to go after the OpenBitTorrent's new Spanish host and has sent a letter to
SoloGigabit stating that the hosting company could be "liable for aiding and
abetting criminal copyright infringements and receiving payments from
criminal activity."

According to the Spanish legislation, BitTorrent search trackers are
considered legal although some of their users may use it to download
copyright infringing content. The OpenBitTorrent tracker is just a
communication facilitator between torrent users. "According to all Spanish
legal resolutions, a link does not communicate nor reproduces the work under
intellectual property. So, linking is not a violation, hosting without the
rights holders permission is," told copyright expert and lawyer Javier de la
Cueva to TorrentFreak.

It is not yet certain what position will SoloGigabit take, having in view
that the company is a rather small one and might not be able to face a long
and costly trial even if it does not infringe the Spanish law.

6. Blocking of innocent websites by O2 Ireland
============================================================

The Irish mobile operator O2 has acknowledged accidentally blocking the
image hosting website IMGUR through its system for blocking alleged child
abuse material. There appears to have been no indication that there was, in
fact, any illegal material hosted on that site. Furthermore, it is not
obvious on what basis O2 could have made the decision to undertake the
blocking.

In a statement provided to the Irish hotline, which was not published but
simply made available to people who enquired about the problem, O2 explained
that "the technology behind the service (to block child abuse images) is
more far reaching than anticipated and on occasion a site which should not
be blocked may be." It is impossible to tell how many other innocent, but
smaller and therefore less noticeable, websites are similarly blocked by
accident, due to this "far reaching technology."

O2 undertakes its blocking system on a voluntary basis, despite the fact
that, according to the European Commission, "such measures must indeed be
subject to law, or they are illegal"(according to the Commission's impact
assessment on the draft Directive on child exploitation). Nonetheless, the
European Commission is also now supporting such extra-judicial measures and
it is now also proposing to use taxpayers' money to fund them.

A six million euro call for proposals launched in June 2010 refers to
funding for "blocking access to child pornography OR blocking the access to
illegal Internet content through public-private cooperation". This call, by
the Commission, for "self-regulatory" blocking of allegedly illegal content
in general was made just a few weeks after Commissioner Malmstrvm explained
at a conference that "the Commission has absolutely no plans to propose
blocking of other types of content - and I would personally very strongly
oppose any such idea".

It is likely that further deliberate and accidental blocking of websites
will now spread in Ireland, due to the fact that the Irish former monopoly
Eircom agreed to block sites accused of containing unauthorised material,
while mobile operator Vodafone has reportedly also indicated that it will
introduce extra-judicial measures against any of its customers repeatedly
accused of infringements.

Many blogs and online message boards accused the Irish Internet hotline of
having prepared a faulty blocking list and this was what led to IMGUR being
blocked. As the Irish internet hotline does not prepare a blocking list, but
simply acts in its capacity as a hotline, these allegations were incorrect.

7. Facebook faces serious fines in Germany
============================================================

The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information John
Caspar has launched legal proceedings against the operator of the social
network Facebook for illegally accessing and saving personal data of people
who don't use the respective social networking site.

"We consider the saving of data from third parties, in this context, to be
against personal data laws," said Caspar. Germany benefits of one of the
strictest privacy laws in the world that includes precise limits to the
access to personal data and has already launched an investigation on Google,
as well as in relation to its Street View mapping system.

Facebook was given until 11 August 2010 to give a formal response to the
legal complaint which may lead to its being fined tens of thousands of euro,
if the response is not acceptable.

Although Facebook has changed its privacy settings in order to allow its
users to block access to their e-mail address contacts, the Commissioner
argues that the already saved contacts have not been erased and are
used for marketing purposes. Facebook collects data also on non-members, by
using, for instance, the Facebook application for iPhones which allows the
transfer of all the contacts from the mobile phone to the social network.
This offers the option to transfer all available contacts in the mobile
phone on Facebook. Also, when somebody creates a new account on Facebook,
the system offers to search into the new member's e-mail accounts to find
friends on the network.

Caspar stated that many citizens had recently "complained about the use of
third party data" meaning that they had been contacted by Facebook after it
had obtained their e-mail addresses from contacts of network members.

The Consumer Protection Minister Ilse Aigner announced in June that she was
planning to give up her Facebook account considering the social network was
not doing enough to protect users' data.

8. Yahoo is not bound to give personal data to Belgian authorities
===========================================================

The Belgian Court of Appeal of Gand ruled on 30 June 2010 that Yahoo was not
obliged to hand over personal data of its users to the Belgian authorities,
in a case where the first instance had issued a contrary ruling.

In 2009, following a cybercrime investigation by the Belgian police, it was
discovered that a group was using Yahoo e-mail addresses to commit online
fraud. The members of the group stole data from various companies and used
the data to order goods without paying. Yahoo was requested by the Belgian
Public Prosecutor to hand over the IDs related to the e-mail addresses used
by the group but the company refused to comply and, on 2 March 2009,
received a 55 000 euro fine from a Termonde judge who also imposed a daily
penalty fee of 10 000 euro in case of non-compliance with the judgment. The
court did not consider Yahoo's argument that it was not subject to the
Belgian law as it had no legal entity in Belgium and did not store any
customer data in Belgium.

The appeal court has now decided that there was no legal basis for the 2009
ruling against the company. "There is not enough evidence that the providers
of free of charge e-mail addresses are also electronic communication
services. In other words, there is no proof that Yahoo deals directly with
sending the signals. It has no control over the network as an e-mail
provider" said the decision of the Appeal Court.

It is reported that, throughout the whole process, no attempt was ever made
by the Belgian authorities to use existing Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty to
obtain the requested data via recognised legal channels.

9. ENDitorial: French biometric passport: case still pending after 2 years
============================================================

It took more than two years after the complaint against the French biometric
passport was filed to have the conclusions of the "public rapporteur"
publicly presented at the Conseil d'Etat (French highest administrative
Court), on 30 June 2010. While the final court decision was expected some
weeks later as it usually occurs, the plaintiffs received instead an
official note that the conclusions presented on 30 June were dismissed, and
that some more analysis was needed: the case will now be heard on October
2010.

The French biometric passport entered into force after a decree was
published on 4 May 2008. On 4 July 2008, a case was jointly filed before the
Conseil d'Etat by two NGOs: French EDRI member IRIS and the French Human
Rights League, to obtain the annulment of this decree. Other complaints were
filed by a group of 10 citizens from Toulouse, and by photographers
associations and companies, the latter complaint highlighting economic
issues with the decree.

The main provisions targeted by the two NGOs are: the establishment of a
centralized national biometric database; the collection and storage in the
database of 8 fingerprints (only 2 of them being also stored in the passport
chip), instead of the 2 required by the European regulation on biometric
passports; the collection of fingerprints of children starting from age 6.
Legal substantive and procedural arguments against these provisions are
provided in the complaint.

In the French Conseil d'Etat judicial system, the "public rapporteur" is a
member of the Council in charge of presenting to the court the claim put
forward in the complaint, of analyzing the circumstances and the applicable
law, and of proposing independent and impartial conclusions and
recommendations regarding the final decision. Usually, the court follows
these conclusions, or simply makes slight modifications before delivering
its judgement.

Two years after the complaint was filed, the "public rapporteur" recommended
the annulment of the provision requiring to collect and store in the
centralized database the 6 additional fingerprints, on the basis that this
was disproportionate with respect to the European regulation. While he
didn't recommend the annulment of the provision creating a centralized
database, the "public rapporteur" pointed out that this was not required by
the
European regulation, and that French and European data protection
institutions, as well as the European Parliament, voiced strong concerns
against this provision. However, the "public rapporteur" considered,
following the opinions of the French Ministry of Interior, that this
centralized database is necessary to avoid identity fraud and passport
trafficking, including in the case of children starting from age of 6.

Apparently, these timid conclusions were still too provocative for the
Conseil d'Etat or were they, on the contrary, indeed too timid in the
Court's view as well? No one knows yet why the Conseil d'Etat considered
that they needed to be dismissed, and that four additional months of
investigations and discussions were still needed to reach a decision. In the
mean time, the deployment of the French biometric passport has been going on
since the publication of the decree, given that such complaints do not have
any suspensive effect.
