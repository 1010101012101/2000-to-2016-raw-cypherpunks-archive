Hi there,

Can't they just get both certs and accept the one that works for them? I.e. 
John Doe would just accept the "vanilla" SSL cert; Joe R. Hacker's browser 
would have these blocked, but could accept a Monkeysphere-based one.

The idea is to have the same site.

Ah, yes, quirks. ;)

Oh, this is good. Differentiating between "vanilla" certs and "advanced/really 
secure" Monkeysphere-based certs via ciphers is neat. Thanks for the idea!

Mhm.

So, sticking to the ciphersuite hack, which is elegant and bound to work. 
Thanks a bunch.
