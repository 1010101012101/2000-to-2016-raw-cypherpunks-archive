Glad someone found it helpful. I've actually been meaning to post more  
viewing notes along with interesting videos that I think are worth  
sharing, with the aim of being more respectful of people's time. Still  
working on the discipline to take notes while viewing.

It's a bit like disciplining yourself to take pictures when you're  
traveling. There's always a feeling of "oh man, this is a hassle and I  
just want to enjoy the moment without fussing with a camera." But you're  
always glad you took pictures later on.

Regarding blocking of all things goog: Until I get my own MediaGoblin  
instance up and running I can try repost videos on a service that's a tad  
less an arm of the surveillance state. I was thinking of inserting the  
content into the new Alexandria project. If you have any other suggestions  
let me know.

Electricity is a unique commodity in that it's not that efficient to  
store, so I can see the logit in trying to shift usage to off peak times.  
The engineer Rob States from the other follow-up vid I posted says that  
utilities could save 30% on power transmission by switching to  
superconductor high tension lines.

Agree with all this. If you can grow a beard, start farming it! haha.

Time to start whipping up some suspicion and discontent with the peasants  
beforehand, I'd say.
I would like to live in a culture of resistance where the prevalent  
mindset is always "Hmm, big mega corp 'X' or gov is trying to roll out  
such and such product/service/program/legislation. How are they trying to  
fuck us in the ass this time?"

$50 a billing cycle is outrageous. Depending on the laws where you live,  
you might be best served by communication your refusal via registered mail  
or whatever the equivalent is in your area. Takebackyourpower.net has lots  
of resources for how to properly serve the electrical company with a  
refusal notice so that you will maintain the best legal position to  
dispute the extortion charges they try to punish you with.

I think there's a lot of push-back happening, we're on the cusp and it's  
gaining momentum every day. three people on my street have already gone  
back to analogue a long time ago, and I'm approaching three more neighbors  
with the hopes of convincing them to do the same. I might even be going  
door to door and distributing copies of the 'Take Back your Power'  
documentary.
