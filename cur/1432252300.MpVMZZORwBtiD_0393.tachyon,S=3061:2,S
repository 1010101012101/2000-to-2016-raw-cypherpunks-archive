We've added 60 pages of Jim Bell's filings to an updated
docket and filings:

   http://crytpome.org/jdb032801.htm

This supercedes the file of 23 March 2001.

It appears that these sixty pages were deliberately omitted
from the TIFF images once offered on the WWA web site;
some filings were represented only by a first page, others
not offered at all.

They vividly describe alleged collusion by Jim's PD,
Robert Leen, AUSA Robb London and Judge Jack
Tanner to deny Jim a fair trial. Really chickenshit behavior
by the pack and their rats. Read and puke. 

Watch your back.

One of Jim's motion asks for sanctions and fines against
the troika, to be paid to him until the three are recused:

For Leen, $5,000 per day.
For London, $10,000 per day.
For Tanner, $5,000 per day.
