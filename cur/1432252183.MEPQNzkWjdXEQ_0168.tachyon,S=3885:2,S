> You may be asking yourself: where, oh where, has all the crypto gone?

Presuming question, as the rest of the article.

Crypto is there for all those who want to encrypt, accessible as it was five
years ago. And stuff does get encrypted - the real crypto, P2P, not the bogus
one between servers in boiler rooms.

As for argument that OS upgrade game requires live crypto coders to keep up -
that's also bogus. PGP 2.6.3i runs fine on the latest winshit. PGP 2.6.2 runs
fine on latest macs. PGP 2.6.2 compiles under linux and freebsd today (unlike
6.* sources)

And they are being used by those who need them. What, no shiny UI ? Tough shit.
Use plaintext. And shiny UI *did not* make masses use 7.0.3, did it ?

Actually, people have machines with 5-6-7 year old OSes ... because they work.
Especially in end-user interface applications - text editors, mail clients,
telnet/ssh/http, there is no need to upgrade at all.

Virus claim is also bogus.

That is, unless you you use microsoft stuff with 5 months average life span.
You do ? I thought so.

Face it, convenient crypto is an exercise in futility. Convenience is
positioning end users where they are wanted - bent over, pants down, cleansed
by the upgrade enema, ready to receive.

ITAR classification was correct, after all. Crypto is arms. Successful crypto
distribution and use patterns will follow those for arms. Guess when sheeple
will start to use crypto.
