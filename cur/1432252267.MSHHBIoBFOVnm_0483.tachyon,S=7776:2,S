What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project =
as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you some exam=
ples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:


4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a=
 good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, righ=
t? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, =
that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big =
clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that =
answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.


1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears =
up the floor for more mess craft making.=20


i was chuckling while i cooked thinking about how my irish grandparents alw=
ays had a plaque on their wall with this prayer on it: "may you be in heave=
n a half hour before the devil knows your dead" ha!=20


she's cute


2. to keep the bedrooms clear i throw all the dirty laundry in the laundry =
room and shut the door. out of sight, out of mind!=20
