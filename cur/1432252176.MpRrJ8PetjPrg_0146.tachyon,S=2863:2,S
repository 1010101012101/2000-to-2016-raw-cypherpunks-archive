The Bay Area Cypherpunks Meetings have had visitors such as
"Lucky Green", "Black Unicorn", "Lawrence from Boulder", "Ogre",
"John Doe #3", multiple "Tim May"s and Detweilers, "Hey You", and
people who either didn't mention their names or gave plausible-sounding 
names that didn't trigger the "obvious pseudonym" test.

Some of those people have used other names at the meeting as well;
it was quite a while before Lucky decided to let his other
well-known name overlap into Cypherpunks namespace,
and Black Unicorn has used several names in various contexts.
				Thanks!
