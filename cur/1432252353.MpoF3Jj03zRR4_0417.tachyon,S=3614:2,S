You do know she's been trying the same scheme for several hundred thousand 
years, right?  As an artist, I think she's in a creative decline.  Ebola is 
picturesque and flashy, but not all that scary unless your funeral rites 
involve lots of contact with the blood of your dearly departed.  AIDS is 
more subtle, rather like syphlus before good antibiotics, but it's not her 
best work.  Even SARS is Yet Another Coughed Contagion.  If I recall 
correctly, smallpox got 90% of the American Indians who were exposed, and 
measles killed something like 1/3 of Roman citizens.  Bubonic and pneumonic 
plague swept through European cities and wiped out huge numbers of people, 
and they're still with us, though mainly places with lousy public health 
and sanitation.  And lets not forget her original innovation for 
discouraging cities, death-by-crapping-out-all-your-electrolytes.

If diseases get us, they won't be Gaia's work, but rather some of her more 
modern imitators in the bioweapons labs of various countries.  Like every 
great artist, she's spawned a host of followers, mostly not too 
imaginative, but some of whom may take her ideas and techniques to 
undreamt-of levels.
