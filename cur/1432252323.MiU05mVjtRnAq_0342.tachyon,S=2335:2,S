It is tempting to say that the victims have some kind of natural right
to see justice done against this tyrant.  The problem is that the there
is no one in Iraq with legitimate authority to convene such a court,
least of all the US or their puppet regime.  In my opinion, Saddam
should be released, or shipped out to an international court with
recognized authority.
