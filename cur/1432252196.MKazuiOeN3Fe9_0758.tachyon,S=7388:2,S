Grow a beard
Be argumentative
Draw attention to yourself
Park in no-parking zones
Wear eastern clothes
Don't pay your rent on time
Cause trouble in your neighborhood
Be chatty in public
Don't join the gym
Drink a lot and fuck.

Sounds ALmost like any card-carrying cypherpunk to me.

> in areas where neighbors do not know each other well.
> The suicide hijackers in last week's attacks apparently practiced

> 
> The manual, "Military Studies in the Jihad Against the Tyrants," was

> 
> Experts say the manual illustrates the inner workings of bin Laden's

> foreshadows the suicide hijackings themselves, in which the terrorists
> used boxcutters and knives.
> 
> For example, the manual's "Assassinations" section gives precise
> instructions on how to use weapons with blades, saying the "enemy must

> 
> Do not address others with traditional Islamic greetings in which

> 
> Do not cause trouble in your neighborhood. Do not park in no-parking

> 
> Do not live near police stations. 
> 
> Do not appear to be overly inquisitive.

> 
> Use codes when talking on the telephone. 
> 
> Try not to be "chatty and talkative" in public. 
> 
> Maintain an appearance "that does not indicate Islamic orientation
> (beard, toothpick, book, long shirt, small Koran)."
> 
> Most television images of the men thought to have been aboard the
> airliners show them without beards. And people who met them said they
> wore Western clothes.
> 
> Neighbors of some of the men in California, Florida and Maryland said

> moved frequently, staying in motels and apartments around the state.
> 
> They also joined gyms. One made small talk with a neighbor about
