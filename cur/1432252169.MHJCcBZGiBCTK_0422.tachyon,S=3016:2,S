Damn right. 'Conservative' means agreeing with the most vocal proponents of 
the current right wing apparatchiks. It seems to have little or no 
relationship to fiscally conservative ideas. "Left wing" now refers to 
anyone who disagrees with the 'Conservatives', even if said left wing 
policies are practically identical to those of the 'right'.
