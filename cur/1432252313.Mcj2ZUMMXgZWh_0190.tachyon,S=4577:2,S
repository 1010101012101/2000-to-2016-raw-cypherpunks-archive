The trust issue is not the code, the trust issue is the company. 
If he doesn't feel that the company is committed to maintaining 
appropriate levels of privacy, he chooses not to expend labor in 
support of the company's software.  And he may trust version 2, 
without trusting the company to produce a version 3 that he can 
in good conscience recommend to anyone to use.  

I have designed and built code for free for people who told me 
they were going to use it one way -- and sent it to /dev/null when I 
discovered that they intended to use it another.  It's as simple 
as that.  These days, I tend to restrict my coding-for-free effort 
to projects that will be useful *only* in the ways I think are 
beneficial to society at large, or to projects that, used by everyone 
according to their own whim, will at least cause society more good 
than harm. (Note, I did not say "nations" or "governments" or 
"businesses" or even "citizens" -- I have a peculiar idea of 
society and what is beneficial to it).
