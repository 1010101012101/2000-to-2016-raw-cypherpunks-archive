Take out your calendars, It's that time again folks.

I am starting to put together the  schedule for the Millennium
Edition of  the Mac Crypto/ Internet commerce workshop.   The
dates should be the week of Jan 29th, 2001.  I have booked us space
for that whole week, on the Apple  Cupertino Campus .

Henceforth, I am looking for folks to give talks, papers etc.

This year's overall theme could cover "Security in a MacOS X world".
I would like to see a number of talks related to how MacOS X changes
the Macintosh threat model.  In addition I would also like to see
a few talks about lessons learned in the last few years about
developing crypto related products.  Maybe something about digital
rights management or music. Digital cash talks are always welcome.

I would like both technical and tutorial material.   As usual I
discourage simple marketing presentations without  content, this is
a technical group.

Please try to  keep the talks no more than  40 minutes with an
additional  10 minutes allocated for for Q&A..

I suspect that there a a number of new people who have never been to
a Mac Crypto. To get an idea about what this is all about take a look
at the past three conference archives at http://www.vmeng.com/mc/

I will be posting a preliminary schedule, formal announcements and
registration  form in a month. In the meantime if you would like to
give a talk, please send me the Title, Author's full name and email
address and a small abstract I can post on the web-page.  Once you
have slides or possibly a pdf, please send me a copy I post or link
to..
