 Subject: IMPORTANT NOTICE: MIT CONFERENCE ON REAL ID ACT IS POSTPONED AND
  AUGMENTED BY ONLINE DISCUSSION.

 [Apologies if you have already received this notice - the mail server at
 the MIT Media Lab crashed today and we are aware that at least some
 people on our notice list did not get this important message.]

 Please be advised that the public forum originally scheduled for
 Wednesday, September 14, 2005 to address the REAL ID Act of 2005 has
 been postponed. This has become necessary because many of the people
 interested in the forum are from the homeland security and first
 responder communities, and their focus is now squarely on the ongoing
 efforts to recover from Hurricane Katrina.

 In place of the September 14th public forum, the MIT Media Lab and the
 MIT E-Commerce Architecture Program will be organizing an online forum
 to start a conversation about the REAL ID Act of 2005. This online forum
 will be an ongoing, asynchronous event lasting from Monday, September
 19, 2005 through Friday, September 23, 2005.  This online discussion
 will include presentations by leaders in the field, policy experts and
 governmental officials who will give deeper background on the status and
 issues related to REAL ID.  There will also be an opportunity for all
 registrants to participate in a dialog with the speakers and each
 other.  Additional details about the online forum will be available
 shortly at http://ecitizen.mit.edu/realid.html.  Please register at that
 web site between now and September 19th in order to participate in this
 web-based discussion.

 Finally, there will be a physical meeting at MIT to discuss the REAL ID
 Act of 2005 on Thursday, November 17, 2005. The upcoming online forum
 will provide an excellent opportunity to design this event so as to
 provide the maximum benefit for the people who will be attending this
 gathering.

 In the meantime, please continue to use the registration feature on the
 website to let us know if you are interested in participating in the
 online forum or attending the November meeting. Also be sure to check
 the website periodically for additional details.

 Regards,

 Daniel J. Greenwood,
 MIT Media Lab, Smart Cities Group, Lecturer
 MIT E-Commerce Architecture Program, Director
