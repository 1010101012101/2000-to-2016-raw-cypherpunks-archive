"Manned by the countrybs main security service, the FSB, this bSystem of Operative Search Measuresb has been in use for more than two decades. But recently, SORM has been upgraded. It is ingesting new types of data. It is being used as Moscowbs main tool for spying on the countrybs political protesters. And it has become extremely useful in the quest to make sure that the Kremlinbs influence in the former Soviet Union continues long into the second regime of Vladimir Putin."
