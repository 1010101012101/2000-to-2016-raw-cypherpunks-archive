Damn. I'd say "that's the most intolerant hate-filled garbage I ever..."

But shit. It's basically true. Or at least the fundamentalists in charge of

of the world with reality, and that's dangerous because their guns are 
real...."Let God sort 'em out" seems to be the basic philosophy.

As it so happens I saw 'Malcom X' on cable last night....
