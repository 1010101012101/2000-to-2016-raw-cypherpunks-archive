Indeed, and I also read a sense of exasperation or at least
resignation in "there's only so much one will do with disregard of
self." Even if that -was- an expression of personal position, it's a
damn sight better than the sociopaths in the seats of "demoncratic"
power.

Don't stress about it. Some conversations go smoothly, others less so.
Everyone brings their viewpoint, and most bring a genuinely good
intention, even if their instances of "XX is a given" are different to
yours. Even CIA apologists have a mentally justified world view, and I
found it uniquely interesting to engage with that think or mental
nature, a while back - and yes, I very nearly spat fire and brimstone.
I think the only thing saving me was learning to embrace my inner
bitch.

How about a vote - let's be gentle with each other's resignation. Then
we can all leap into our attempts to express that which is important
to us, without getting upset when we fail to hit our mark of clarity
or succinctity, or when others fail to hit our expectation of
response.

We are schooled to be right, to get the gold star, the stamp of
approval, the right to be condescending towards those who "fail" to be
"top of the class" or even fail to just be "correct". Are you smelling
a human programming program here? Let's shake off our deep schooling
(programming) and start educating ourselves how to be genuine. How to
simply be. Be what and who we are. Be satisifed, at peace. Then
perhaps we can be satisfied with others just as they are (WHOAH! don't
get too deep now!)
