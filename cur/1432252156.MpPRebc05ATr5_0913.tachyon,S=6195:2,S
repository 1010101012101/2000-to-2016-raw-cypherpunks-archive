First, if you're going to attempt a "FidoNet II," at least use link 
encryption at every stage. Since each node knows the next node it 
will be phoning (or linking to), it's a relatively easy matter to 
encrypt to the public key of that node. This makes each node a kind 
of remailer, as someone looking only at the internode traffic will 
only see encrypted bits.

Second, so long as one has done the above, might as well make each 
node an actual remailer. With all of the usual mixing of in/out 
packets, packet size padding, etc.

Third, the use of radio links has come up several times over the 
years. A couple of early Cypherpunks were involved in packet radio 
and addressed the issue. By the way, the FCC still has restrictions 
on encrption over the airwaves, as I understand things.

(One can argue that a micropower transmitter, or a "Part 15" 
transmitter, is exempt or undetectable, but this may not be enough if 
the Feds really want a bust.)

Fourth, given the speeds of the Net, given the move to put phone 
calls over the Net, given the many tools...why on earth would anyone 
want to revive FidoNet? Implement remailer protocols to do a virtual 
FidoNet, perhaps, but don't actually have machines phoning up other 
machines!

Fifth, notwithstanding all these comments, go for it.

Watch out for those trucks with the rotating antennas.

Laudable. Sounds like you're recapitulating the early years of the 
Cypherpunks list discussions.

Look to remailer networks and I think you'll find what you're looking for.

Would radio offer advantages worth the effort of going to a different 
transmission mechanism? Wireless, a la Bluetooth and obviously via 
Ricochet, etc., is already here. A ham radio system, even one based 
around the "big linear amps" you speculated about earlier, would have 
a long uphill struggle.

Still, a worthy outlet for your energies.

Between your thinking above and your recent search for Vinge, sounds 
like you're moving squarely into the crypto anarchy camp. Maybe 
there's hope as well for Nathan Saper and all of the other commies on 
the list.
