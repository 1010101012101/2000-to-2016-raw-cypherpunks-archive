Very funny.  My walls o' vinyl are, BTW, licenses to KaZaa the content
in more convenient forms.

Here, this will amuse you.  Only last week did I burn my first audio
CD.  The week before, my first data CD.  Before that, it was hot backups

and ZIP disks.   Yes, we're 4 years into the 21st century.  Dig.

As far as "Dad's", well, how many five year olds know Waits, Krimso,
and Einsturzende, but know nothing of Brittny?

I recently recycled a computer fan guard into the AA site of a
mock toy RPG, using styro cups as the grenade and a broken plastic
gun as the handle.  Compleat with balaclava on the young-un.
Stick that in your chillum and process it.

And have a nice solstice.
