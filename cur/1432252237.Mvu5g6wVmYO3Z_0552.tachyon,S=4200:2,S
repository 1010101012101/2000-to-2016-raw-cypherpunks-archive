Funny, the article doesnt say
how the pirates subverted the
encryption in order to make copies.

RIAA Behind More "CD-Pirate" Busts 09-18-00

GARLAND, TEXAS, U.S.A., 2000 SEP 18 (NB) -- By Steven Bonisteel, Newsbytes.

The music industry announced what it called more successful raids on businesses alleged to be counterfeiting
music compact discs using personal computers and CD-R technology. 

The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) said today that it pointed authorities in Texas to two
businesses in Garland where CD-R equipment for burning CDs was found along with piles of allegedly
completed counterfeits. 

The RIAA said searches at both locations were executed Sept. 14. A month ago, the RIAA announced similar
raids on the home of a New York man and at a residence and a business in Phoenix. In those raids, thousands
of apparently copied music CDs were found. 

This month, the RIAA said, members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, tipped off by the RIAAs
anti-piracy unit in Texas, executed a search warrant at Garland retail store Kode Red and seized three CD-R
towers containing a total of 12 eight-speed CD-R burners 898 allegedly pirated labels and 373 allegedly pirated
CDs. 

The RIAA said the 12 CD-R burners had the capability to produce up to 720 CD-Rs every eight hours. At that
rate, it said, the value of the output would be some $4 million a year.
