Well, there's a TINY little hole in your logic here...

For one, Flying can easily be a requirement, not an option. But that's 
besides the point here.

The real point is that some Super-JAT could (5 years from now when there are 
ubiquitous highway checkpoints) argue that "walking from NYC to Boston may 
be difficult but it IS possible". Or of course (after Tenent's vision for 
the internet is realized) "You could simply Fedex those files, you don't 
need to use the internet"

...and so on...it get silly after this though.
