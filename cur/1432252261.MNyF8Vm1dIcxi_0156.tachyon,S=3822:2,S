If all you're looking to do is avoid data-mining and digital footprints being
stored by non-state actors, I think it would suffice, as long as you were
careful with the shell/VPS providers. Mix it up, and connect to a free shell
provider (if you aren't doing anything that requires stronger anonymity) or
server that has other accounts, as mentioned, to use as an "exit node" in
order to hide your exit traffic from upstream camping, and of course use a
browser that's resistant to browser-fingerprinting, and all of that standard
jazz.
