Actually, this is not the first laptop based on open firmware and
software. Glugglug/Minifree did that quite a bit of time ago with
their Libreboot, even FSF certified. Nobody cares, sadly.
Librem likely will fail too for the same reasons - ideology is not
enough, and they are even worse at it technically-wise.

On the other hand, having a more secure laptop is a tangible benefit.
Without backdoors, with fewer bugs, audited firmware, perhaps even
partially audited hardware.

Maybe even make it easier on the designers, produce a server platform
matching those requirements - there's more of a market.
Google might even get in, as they are known to use a lot of customized
firmware and even hardware. I think they used to support Coreboot
itself.
They might have stopped caring about this though.

Having competitive hardware or design is not the same as being a competitor.
Try this argument again when it's actually a competitor to, say, any
iPhone. At least in top 10.

By the way, Fairphone 2 is a nice story for uninformed people, about
on par with Librem.
I approve of their other efforts, but it's nowhere near enough or
close to what's necessary.

The critical component, Qualcomm 801 chipset, will be running a
proprietary microkernel with proprietary RF firmware, proprietary DSP
code and more.
Good luck getting Qualcomm to open that - they are quite hostile to
any of those efforts.

Again, poor choice of an architecture and a very tough nut to crack.
(For instance, Marvell is way more open and much less hostile.)

I wouldn't quite count on it, though they seem to be expanding their
open source drivers effort which bodes somewhat well.

That said, their GPUs still require a few fat, complex firmware blobs
- fortunately Qubes is pretty good at scraping GUI and enforcing
separation thereof.

P.S. If we're talking about pie in the sky designs:
Probably the best design for an OS like Qubes would be to have
separate small CPUs instead of many cores, with separate RAM and
memory controller. Maybe even an integrated GPU each to run OpenGL.
Multiple USB controllers and hubs to simplify hardware redirection.
Multiple small flash drives or even chips. Expensive, power intensive,
hard to cool and large though.

Think a tiny cluster of mostly separate PCs, connected via an
extremely fast bus, such as HyperTransport. NUMA considerations would
be less important here as the CPUs with their associated memory would
be dedicated to a VM and the support exists in both Xen and Linux
anyway.
