My guess is that cyberpunks@toad.com is listed towards the top
of some lame list of net resources used by 14 year old net newbies
on AOL or the like.

"dude it has like punk in it and cyber must be about making bombs"

Ironically the best resource for this information is the US government's
Improvised Munitions Handbook TM 31-210.  The print edition is actually
now banned from import into the UK.

Ascii copies are "out there" which shows the futility of trying to suppress
information in the 21st century.
