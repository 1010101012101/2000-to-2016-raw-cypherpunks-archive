What are the Limits on Warrantless Drug Testing of Pregnant
                    Women? 

                    Ferguson v. City of Charleston 
                    Docket No. 99-936 

                    From: The Fourth Circuit 

                    Case at a Glance

                    This case involves a Fourth Amendment challenge to a drug-testing
                    policy implemented at a South Carolina public hospital. Under the policy,
                    pregnant women are tested -- without warrants or probable cause -- for
                    cocaine use. Positive test results are shared with law-enforcement
                    officials, and some women were arrested and threatened with
                    prosecution if they did not complete drug treatment.
