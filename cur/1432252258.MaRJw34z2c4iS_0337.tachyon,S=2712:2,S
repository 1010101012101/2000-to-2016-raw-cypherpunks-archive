The best security/crypto/privacy news ticker I've seen is at 
http://www.infosyssec.com, a portal which bills itself as "The most 
comprehensive computer and network security resource on the Internet for 
Information System Security Professionals". If you don't feel like waiting 
for the ticker to scroll through, try 
http://www.infosyssec.com/infosyssec/infosecnews.html.

If some of the the links don't work, the whole story is usually mirrored at 
http://www.securitynewsportal.com/.

None finer, IMHO...
