You put nukes in subs to avoid getting them blown up
esp. by a first strike.

So whoever nukes Israel had best do so without a
piece of real estate associated with it, because the sub
nukes will persist.  Even if the ground-based intel
the subs might have relied on for targeting is smoking slag.

The problem of real estate:
Look what happened to the Afghans who gave ClintonBush
a place to target.

Yet another advantage to being a unlocalized organization.

Or working out of an untouchable like Saudi arabia.
