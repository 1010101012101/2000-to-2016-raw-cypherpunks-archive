No. To have a single name for these few federated social networks that =
already=20
federate with each other. So that instead of saying "do you have a=20
Diaspora/Friendica/Red/GNU Social account?" one can say "do you have a =
The=20
Federation account?"

Because this will:
 - make it easier for the normal users to join ("just choose any of the=
se,
   they're compatible")
 - make it more interesting for developers of other free federated soci=
al
   networks to get compatible with The Federation ("it's not a single p=
roject,
   a few of them got together already, why not join the happy bunch")

And in the end it's all about this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect

Each of these projects in itself is too small to get users' attention;=20=

together they have much more chance of that.

Nobody needs nor wants to define nor create any new protocols. The prot=
ocols=20
are already there: that's what Diaspora, Friendica, Red and GNU Social =
use to=20
talk to each other.

The ONLY aim of calling it with a collective name is to make it seen as=
 a=20
single, huge, federated-and-federating distributed social network. And =
to get=20
the ball rolling on more social networks joining-in and federating.

They already do. They implement each others' protocols. Nobody has to d=
o=20
anything there. I have a Diaspora account and have added friends from=20=

Friendica and Red servers.

But thanks anyway.

"I guess I'll leave that one until you answer Meredith" would be one an=
swer.=20

"I prefer to contribute and improve a ~40 years old protocol with billi=
ons of=20
users and thousands of implementations (...)" and direct you to e-mail =
(which=20
allows you to share photos and info with your friends, after all), woul=
d be=20
another, admittedly snarky.

"So how is JID/Jingle client and server implementation work going", wou=
ld be=20
yet another.

"You're very welcome to join The Federation, if you'd like; the easiest=
 way to=20
do this would be to either help The Federation projects implement your=20=

protocol, or implement one of their protocols in your software; in retu=
rn=20
you'll get a huge bunch of active users to federate with, and the user-=

perceived value of your network would rise" is the one I'm going with,=20=

however.

Also, Diaspora is implementing an XMPP-based chat functionality these d=
ays=20
(should be released soon). So, there's also that.
