Thanks Steve, I don't think I have heard this before. I googled on the text you quoted and found this url

http://wais.stanford.edu/Iraq/iraq_andambassaprilglaspie22303.html

and a few more

http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/glaspie.html

I don't know what to say. This makes me sick to my stomach.

I guess one way of lookin at this is that U.S. played dirty and deceiving.
U.S. is more or less the reason Iraq invaded Kuwait.

I guess this is not told on Fox news.
