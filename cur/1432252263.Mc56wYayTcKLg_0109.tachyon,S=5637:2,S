Quite likely hogwash, but you may admit that science can be as political as 
any profession and that some of the most important breakthroughs in science 
were scorned by the establishment of their time (e.g., plate tectonics).

I have an interesting book I've mentioned before on the list, "Causality, 
Electromagnetic Induction and Gravitation," by Oleg Jefimenko 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0917406230/qid=1003043154/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/103-2152618-1779855 


A physicist who has spent some time in  this told field me that Jefimenko's 
book is brilliant but it has been mostly ignored by many in the scientific 
establishment.

 From the publisher info:
"This book is a strikingly new exploration of the fundamentals of Maxwell's 
electromagnetic theory and of Newton's theory of gravitation. Starting with 
an analysis of causality in the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, 
the author discovers a series of heretofore unknown or overlooked 
electromagnetic interdependencies and equations. One of the most notable 
new results is the discovery that Maxwell's equations do not depict cause 
and effect relations between electromagnetic phenomena: causal dependencies 
in electromagnetic phenomena are found to be described by solutions of 
Maxwell's equations in the form of retarded electric and magnetic field 
integrals. A consequence of this discovery is that, contrary to the 
generally accepted view, time-variable electric and magnetic fields cannot 
cause each other and that both fields are simultaneously created by their 
true causative sources -- time-dependent electric charges and currents. 
Another similarly important discovery is that Lenz's law of electromagnetic 
induction is a manifestation of the previously ignored electric force 
produced by the time-dependent electric currents. These discoveries lead to 
important new methods of calculations of various electromagnetic effects in 
time- depended electromagnetic systems. The new methods are demonstrated by 
a variety of illustrative examples. Continuing his analysis of causal 
electromagnetic relations, the author finds that these relations are 
closely associated with the law of momentum conservation, and that with the 
help of the law of momentum conservation one can analyze causal..."
