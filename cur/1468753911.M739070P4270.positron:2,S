This "answer" must be printed and put on the desk of not only this
"researcher", but on the desk of all the congressman.

Couldn't stop myself from reposting this harsh piece of truth again,
Zenaan. With "amen" on every basic statement of it.
___

in the US government this "balance" or "favouring of righteousness" is
> almost never achieved.
>
!!!

The US government drones people to death, every day, all around the
> world, based on meta data that it collects globally to the greatest
> extent possible.
>
!!!

These daily killings by the US, done via the IT infrastructure centred at

HOW CAN WE TRUST YOU?

THE KEY QUESTION. Or... shall i say a KEY STATEMENT?
.

The US North American regime has year after year, since World War 2,
> deceived the people, bombed other people, unilaterally acted in war, and
> generally been highly despotic in its actions.
>
!!!

How can this possibly be brought to a stop?

?!

North America has sold and bombed away every shred of honor, decency and

> Therefore the US government has no credibility.

> The US government is not accountable where it matters - in respect of

> The US government does not respect the rule of law.
> The US government is not a democracy.

!!!

There are SO many problems with the US government, that any attempt to
> help it, is only going to help kill more people, daily, around the

>
!!!

This all has to stop.
>
!!!

In the eyes of those who seek righteousness and goodness in the world,

!!!

The North American government has no high moral ground; no moral ground

!!!!!!!!!!

Why should we help you?

!!!

Western governments appear entirely lacking self awareness when it comes

**** If some country started conducting extra-judicial drone killings of US*

!!!

Are you able to affect any real change?

!!!

despotic global surveillance infrastucture that the US

*!!!MOST OF US ARE DOING THAT!*

More and more humans being killed.

> Herb/ Joy/mr. X/Y/Z, can you help to stop this?

*!!!The question is, whether he/we WANT to or.... the warm bed and the nice
suit is more important...The moment he WANTS -> HE "SUDDENLY" CAN.!*

This global illegal communications intercepting and meta data and actual

!!!


> *Can you help to stop these daily illegal killings?*

*Again, this question refers to EVERY HUMAN BEING. Especially on this list.*

The supreme authority of the people, both collectively as well as

!!!

All 'significant' decisions (say anything costing more than $1000, like
> unilaterally dropping a drone bomb on a human in a foreign sovereign

!!!

Many humans are schooled, but sadly, not educated.

And "universitized" and even "professored"/big-bossed, but still, not
educated!

Extra-judicial killing destroys trust, destroys democracy, and destroys
> a nation. North America will ultimately suffer the fallout of its
> despotic daily illegal killings.
>
!!!

Like killing people daily, completely illegally. That will certainly
> destroy trust.
>
!!!

No individual can trust North America.
> No nation can trust the North American/ USA government.

!!!

*!!!NO, HE IS NOT. Excluding the case that this is a CIA officer OR a dead
walking zombie (although i see no big difference)*.

Killing takes a toll on conscionable humans.
