I disagree. While autoclaves and pressure cookers/canners do indeed 
"heat faster," the main purpose is not speeding up the heating.

Rather, it is in getting the temperature to 240 F or higher, the 
temperature required to kill organisms which are not killed at mere 
boiling water temperatures. And, secondarily, in getting the temperature 
in all the various nooks and crannies of instruments. (In this part, I 
agree that "heating faster" is important...but it's only a secondary 
issue, and of no practical importance for the "autoclaving the mail" 
proposal: one just leaves the mail in the autoclave or pressure canner 
for another couple of minutes, thus compensating for any slight lag time 
in heating.)

In a pressure canner, this 240 F temp is needed to prevent botulism in 
low-acid foods (meats, some vegetables). High-acid foods like jams and 
jellies and fruits can be canned in ordinary boiling water.

Not that I am endorsing this idea, but the contents of a sealed 
container will _still_ see the internal 240 F temperature (albeit with 
some small thermal lag, depending on construction, thermal mass, etc.). 
Papers inside a sealed metal foil package, for example, without 
insulation in the foil, will reach the ambient temperature (240 F) 
pretty quickly.

It is not necessary for the steam to touch the material being sterilized.
