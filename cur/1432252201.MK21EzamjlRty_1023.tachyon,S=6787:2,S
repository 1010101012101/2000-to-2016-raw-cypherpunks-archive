That may very well be. I came across an opening article the other day  
about how this whole "Obama-Netanyahu ''Fallout'' is Theater - Planned in  
2009" [1].

Some of the quotes from The Brookings Institution's 2009 policy paper  
titled, "Which Path to Persia? Options for a New American Strategy Toward  
Iran," are eye popping.

"..any military operation against Iran will likely be very unpopular  
around the world and require the proper international context— both to  
ensure the logistical support the operation would require and to minimize  
the blowback from it. The best way to minimize international opprobrium  
and maximize support (however, grudging or covert) is to strike only when  
there is a widespread conviction that the Iranians were given but then  
rejected a superb offer—one so good that only a regime determined to  
acquire nuclear weapons and acquire them for the wrong reasons would turn  
it down. Under those circumstances, the United States (or Israel) could  
portray its operations as taken in sorrow, not anger, and at least some in  
the international community would conclude that the Iranians “brought it  
on themselves” by refusing a very good deal."

They've laid out the entire maniac war plans in plain sight for anyone  
curious enough to read.

Problem is 'muhricans don't read, and the elite know this.
