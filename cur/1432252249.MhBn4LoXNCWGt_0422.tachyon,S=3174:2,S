Those using mydejacluelessmail.com to send messages through the public
remailer network can use "cutmarks" to remove the irritating "Sign up For
MyDejaCluelessmail" footers from their messages which a) are obnoxious and
b) can leak information.

Why is there such a tag at the bottom of *your* note? Is this a default
.signature that you just chose not to remove/alter? Or is it inserted
courtesy of Freedom without the option to omit?  

If the latter, my loathing of Freedom has just increased substantially --
pay $50 for some crummy nyms and then be forced to carry ZKS advertising
to boot?  No thank you.
