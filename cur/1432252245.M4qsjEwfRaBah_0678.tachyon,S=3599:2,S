Let's get one thing straight. I hate how Gmail does threading. IT SUCKS.
Anyone miss that? GMail threading SUCKS. Maybe even their sniffers
will catch that. GMail SUCKS is always a winner but I want THREADING
in the string.

Oh, horse shit. Physics predates everything but it the last to be
discovered and explored. Law and Religion are inexorably twined. The
predecessor of religion, superstition, gives rise to many things.
Finance and Politics are after-effects of everything else.

You did that one up right -n- proper, inchoate.

Given that their sole enforcement arm is lawsuit, you are inchoate again.
It proves that they can bring a lawsuit and on occasion, win. Duh.

Again: you demonstrate why that code is not widespread already. Ted
wrote code. It still isn't widespread. Why fucking not?

The Unabomber's Code

This is interesting. Ted Kaczynski wrote in code:

     In a small journal written in code, he documented his thoughts
about the crimes he was committing. That code was so difficult, a source
says the CIA couldn't crack it -- until someone found the key itself
among other documents, and then translated it.

Look at the photo. It was a manual, pencil-and-paper cipher. Does anyone
know the details of the algorithm?
