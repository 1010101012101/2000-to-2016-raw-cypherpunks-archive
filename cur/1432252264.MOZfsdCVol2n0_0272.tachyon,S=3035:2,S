Fascinating article at the NSA site about the 
heroic efforts to provide long-distance secure voice 
communications over radio.

The good folks at Bell Labs essentially invented
digitized, compressed voice, and encrypted it
using synchronized pairs of records of
random data at each end. Each terminal site
had 55 *tons* of equipment!

Apparently this astounding - and apparently 
successful - effort was mostly declassified 
back in '76, but I first heard about it in 
Stevenson's Cryptonomicon last year.

A remarkable story.
