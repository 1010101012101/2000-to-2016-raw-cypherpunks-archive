Taking some guesses here at the code being used:

x86-32 hand-tuned asm optimised for Pentium Pro.

x86-64 code, gcc optimised for Athlon64.

x86-64 hand-tuned asm optimised for Athlon64.  I'm guessing this one has the
same catch as the Itanium speed test.

My PoS hardware test PC and a $25 Broadcom chip beats your Athlon 64 :-).
