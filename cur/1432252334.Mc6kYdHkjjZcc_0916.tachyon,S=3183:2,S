"They told me they were there to search the house. I asked then if they
had a warrant," said Mr. Storer. They did not. An ATF agent instead
presented Mr. Storer with a consent form to sign allowing the ATF agents
and the Sheriff's deputies to search his trailer.

Mr. Storer, still in his pajamas and his hands on his head, surrounded by
armed officers, was given an option. He and his girlfriend, who was
wearing a t-shirt and little else, could wait outside in the cold until
the ATF could obtain a warrant on a Sunday morning, or he could just sign
the consent.

Kids, if this happens to you don't worry.  Consent obtained at gunpoint is
not considered voluntary even in our debased system.  Always safer not to
consent though.
