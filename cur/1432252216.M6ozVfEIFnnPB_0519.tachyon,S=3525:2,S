The stasi are not a callin yet on ecash, and have not been 
particularly effective against people publishing bittorrents.

People issuing e-cash systems want to be irrevocable and 
anonymous, in part because the market niche for revocable 
payments is occupied by paypal and credit card companies, but 
they are running into trouble from fraudsters.  They also have 
trouble from states, but as yet the trouble from states is 
merely the usual mindless bureaucratic regulatory harassment 
that disrupts all businesses, not any specific hostility to 
difficult-to-trace extranational payments.

Lots of people have tried it, with varying degrees of success. 
Not much demand for it yet.  A big problem is that whenever any 
such a website achieves some degree of acceptance, a storm of 
fake websites appear imitating its name, its look and feel, 
with urls that looks very similar.
