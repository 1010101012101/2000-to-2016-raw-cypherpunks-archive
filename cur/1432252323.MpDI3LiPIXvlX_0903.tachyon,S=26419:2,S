dministration embraced the Clipper Chip, =0Aenvisioned as a mandatory compo=

effort, distributing =0Aposters with a foundering sailing ship and the word=

the Clipper Chip and instead relied on export controls to =0Aprevent the be=

eral former employees said.</div><div> And the BSafe toolkit was becoming=
=0A a much smaller part of the company. By 2005, BSafe and other tools for =
=0Adevelopers brought in just $27.5 million of RSA's revenue, less than 9% =
=0Aof the $310 million total.</div><div> "When I joined there were 10 peopl=
e in=0A the labs, and we were fighting the NSA," said Victor Chan, who rose=
 to =0Alead engineering and the Australian operation before he left in 2005=

 half =0Aof 2006, RSA was among the many technology companies seeing the U.=
S. =0Agovernment as a partner against overseas hackers.</div><div>=0A New R=
