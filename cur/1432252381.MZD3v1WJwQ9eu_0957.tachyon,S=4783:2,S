Talking about "low wage sweat shop jobs" indicates profound confusion on 
your part.

Sorry to be so blunt, but this is the way it is. Henry Hazlitt wrote a 
good book on basic economics.

I doubt I can convince you in a few paragraphs, but consider some 
miscellaneous points, which are all closely related:

* "Low wage" compared to _what_?

* Comparing the wages to U.S. wages is not meaningful, for many reasons.

* To those getting paid $300 an hour, most jobs in the U.S. are "low 
wage sweat shops." Perhaps the U.N. can attempt to force U.S. average 
wages to be raised?

* If the labor is being "exploited" by being paid "too little," this is 
an excellent opportunity for an efficient producer to enter the market 
and offer more. Henry Ford did this with car production early in the 
20th century, Intel is doing it now with factories in Malaysia, Costa 
Rica, and mainlaind China. More "globalization" explotin' da peeples, I 
guess.

exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from 
the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for 
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with 
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy 
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
