The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi|lions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Wel| Re-entry in Fie|d with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a |arge existing field that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantial recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barrels of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is selling for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparab|y sma|l market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wi|| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
slight|y, you wi|l stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wi|l secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| rea||y turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
