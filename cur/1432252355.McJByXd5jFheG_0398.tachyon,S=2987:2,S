Likewise, I received a phone call from the FBI asking to speak with me. 
They had tried to locate my physical place of residence, but were unable 
to do so. I went to the local FBI field office to talk to them, because I 
was curious about what they had to say.

When the conversation no longer interested me, I told them I wished to 
leave, and that they should arrest me if they weren't going to permit 
that. I was allowed to leave.

I would not repeat this, however. If a similar situation occurs, I will 
most likely use Tim's method. I find being served with subpoenas to be 
distasteful.
