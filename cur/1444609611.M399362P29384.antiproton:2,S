Not everyone believes that hoarding btc and hiding out in a cabin loaded 
for bear is the way to go.

Let me put it another way:  we are *long* past the torches and pitchforks 
stage in this country.  We can't just storm the Capitol and force the bums 
out anymore.  It's a sad fact that the 2nd Amendment enthusiasts are just 
going to have to come to terms with, or get droned trying.

For every Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, there are hundreds more we 
don't know about.  People on the inside who have no intention of publishing 
data and doing interviews or shaming officials; they are going to help take 
it down the only way it is still possible to do so.  They just don't 
broadcast what they're doing on public lists.

Also, some people view altruism as a weakness - and some believe it's not 
possible to act in an altruistic manner without expecting anything in 
return.  Those people probably live very empty lives.

That's my first and last comment in this thread (and now I'm really off to 
go watch Walkers bite it.)
