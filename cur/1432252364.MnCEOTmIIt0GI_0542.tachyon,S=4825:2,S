	The disparity in numbers is largely due to the way we treat 
the mentally ill. "They" (Russia, and most of europe) don't count the 
numbers of people forcebly institutionalized for "mental illness" as 
part of their prisoner counts, and here in the US the government 
*usually* doesn't forcibly institutionalize someone until after 
they've committed a crime, or at least been convicted of a crime of 
some sort, whether it really should be a crime.

	Simple answers are for simple problems or simple people. This 
is not a simple problem.

	I think you're both wrong.

	We have increasingly more laws because we don't have enough 
problems for our elected leaders to deal with, and in order to 
justify their pay checks they feel they need to "Be Doing Something", 
so they manufacture one crisis after another, propose and half-ass 
implement some nit-wit solution.

	The problem is that dimwitted idiots keep re-electing these 
rotten sonsabitches.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
