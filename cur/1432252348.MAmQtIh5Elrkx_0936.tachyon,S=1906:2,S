Doesn't surprise me - the UK police collected a huge bunch of 
fingerprints and dna samples "for elimination purposes" during one of 
the child-murder witchhunts, with written promises given that the 
samples were just for that one task, and would be destroyed once the 
hunt was over.
They still kept them anyway of course, and made them the basis for their 
new "national dna database".
