America 'encouraging' Iraq into allowing permanent US military bases in Iraq.

America the 'global cop' is also America the 'schoolyard bully'.

Bloody and shameful.

US Military Chopper Transfers ISIL Leaders from Fallujah to Unknown
Location - 21 February 2016

Informed sources disclosed that a US-made helicopter has taken several
senior ISIL leaders out of Anbar province in Western Iraq to an
unknown location.

“A US chopper landed in a farm near the main road linking
al-Saqlaviyeh to Fallujah in Anbar province and took off  after one
hour with ISIL leaders on board,” the Arabic-language Sama Baghdad
news website quoted informed Iraqi sources in Fallujah city as saying
on Sunday.

The sources noted that several ISIL leaders had gathered in Fallujah
farm as if they had been informed of the helicopter’s imminent landing
in the farm.

In a relevant development on February 13, senior Iraqi security
sources lashed out at the US and its regional allies for supporting
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, and said that Washington is the main cause
of ISIL’s survival in his country.

“We have compelling evidence that a US helicopter landed in Albu Arim
palms of Fallujah city to take out the ISIL leaders who were in
contact with the Americans,” a senior Iraqi security official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told FNA.

He noted that other US aircraft were flying over the region to protect
the airplane which was boarding the ISIL leaders, adding, “The US took
out the ISIL leaders in order to rescue them from possible attacks by
the Iraqi Army and security forces.”

In relevant remarks in October, Spokesman of Iraq’s Kata’ib Hezbollah
(Hezbollah Battalions) popular forces Jafar al-Hosseini disclosing
that captured ISIL leaders have acknowledged receiving logistical
backup and intelligence support from the US.

“As the ISIL commanders captured in Iraqi popular forces’ recent
military operations have confessed, the US supports for the terrorist
groups are not limited to the dispatch of logistical support,”
Al-Hosseini told FNA.

He reiterated that the US has provided the ISIL with intelligence
about the Iraqi forces’ positions and targets.

“ISIL commanders trusted the US officials who had assured them that
the Iraqi forces would not attack Fallujah because the US had urged
the Iraqi government to prevent the popular forces from entering
Fallujah and raid Beiji instead; hence the terrorists left Fallujah
for Beiji to stay on the alert in there,” Al-Hosseini added.

Al-Hosseini had also stated on Wednesday that his forces plan to win
back the city of Ramadi only after expelling the American forces from
Anbar province.

“Our forces have two operations underway; first seizing Ramadi from
ISIL and second keeping away the American forces from Anbar province,”
al-Hosseini told FNA.

He underlined that preventing the US forces from getting close to
Anbar province will expedite operations for winning back the province,
specially after the military operations in Salahuddin province that
led to the liberation of the city of Beiji.

Iraqi officials have on different occasions blasted the US and its
allies for supplying the ISIL in Syria with arms and ammunition under
the pretext of fighting the Takfiri terrorist group.

Also in October, the Iraqi army and volunteer forces discovered
US-made military hardware and ammunition, including anti-armor
missiles, in terrorists’ positions and trenches captured during the
operations in the Fallujah region in Al-Anbar province.

The Iraqi forces found a huge volume of advanced TOW-II missiles from
the Takfiri terrorists in al-Karama city of Fallujah.

The missiles were brand new and the ISIL had transferred them to
Fallujah to use them against the Iraqi army’s armored units.

On October 10, the Iraqi forces discovered US-made military hardware
and ammunition from terrorists in Beiji.

“The military hardware and weapons had been airdropped by the US-led
warplanes and choppers for the ISIL in the nearby areas of Beiji,”
military sources told FNA.

In February 2015, an Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the
western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri
terrorists in Iraq, revealing that the US airplanes still continue to
airdrop weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL terrorists.

“The US planes have dropped weapons for the ISIL terrorists in the
areas under ISIL control and even in those areas that have been
recently liberated from the ISIL control to encourage the terrorists
to return to those places,” Coordinator of Iraqi popular forces Jafar
al-Jaberi told FNA.

He noted that eyewitnesses in Al-Havijeh of Kirkuk province had
witnessed the US airplanes dropping several suspicious parcels for
ISIL terrorists in the province.

“Two coalition planes were also seen above the town of Al-Khas in
Diyala and they carried the Takfiri terrorists to the region that has
recently been liberated from the ISIL control,” Al-Jaberi said.

Also in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq’s army
has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the
ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province.

“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has
access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed
while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee
Hakem al-Zameli said.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in
Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in
al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes
that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the
terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation
in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as
it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Also in February 2015, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out
at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons
have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and
Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi
region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial
Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel
were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city
of Ramadi.

Meantime, Head of Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense
Committee Hakem al-Zameli also disclosed that the anti-ISIL
coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in
Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

In January 2015, al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main
cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid
to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA at the
time.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that
the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft
weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation
committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about
the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the
reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence
provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the
popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the
investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to
protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January 2015, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that
the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL
and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome
Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament,
said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to
everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main
positions in Iraq.”

In Late December 2014, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense
Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist
organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out
that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin
province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious
in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the
technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and
destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war
against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have
its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes
threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit
city”.
