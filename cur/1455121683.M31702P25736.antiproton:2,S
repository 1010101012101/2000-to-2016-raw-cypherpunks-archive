i am reminded of my visit to tesla in serbia

his story tells a tail of defeat by the powers but his is not the only and
final story

rabbit hole:

also to my knowledge his archive is there but the USG confiscated his US
archive and it was freed in 2013 but i have not looked into that
declasification from top secret ... to what i dont know...

http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/nt.php?link=arhiva/a&opc=sub5

http://www.teslasociety.com/archive.htm

there are problems with the digitization process

http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/nt.php?link=arhiva/a&opc=sub5

some fbi files are linked here:

http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_mispapers.html

##

anyway the point of bringing it up is that in spite of the powers making
structural decisions for the globe i still think it is possible to work
around them

and i am not sure this original post of johns is really that interesting

to what point is he posting it? knowns?

there is overall a harnessing of the structures in the minds of people
meant to thwart development and all fronts need work to shift this out >
from trash collecting to nasa stuffs

i think catagorizing what is known is archival but our minds can engage
more substantive constructs
