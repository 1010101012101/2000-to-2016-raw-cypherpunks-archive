Works very nicely. :)

Problem: leaves evidence, and takes time. The main advantage of electric
shock is that the fried chip looks for the naked eye exactly the same way
as a non-fried chip. The only difference could be found with a scanning
electron microscope on the chip itself, which is something nobody is
likely to bother with. Especially in harsh environments (cars classify)
chips tend to die, so its death could look as natural enough to not be
suspicious.

If I am wrong, please tell me where and why. :)
