    Funny, I did sorta' the same thing here, only I got 3 cats and only one
can of, er, "ballot".  It was a landslide.  Of course, these 3 (Mama Fritzi
and her two offspring, P-Boy and Rachel) are feral cats never had no learnin'
except the street. More than a bit spooky, and quick to strike out with fang
and claw, also quick to disappear when strangers come. I trust their
judgement. Mama Fritzi learnt 'em well -- always have a good deep hidey-hole,
rip the shit outa' anybody lays a hand on you, and move fast. They guard me
when I sleep.
