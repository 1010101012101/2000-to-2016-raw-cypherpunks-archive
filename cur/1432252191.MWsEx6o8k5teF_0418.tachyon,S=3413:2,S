Evil = bad = counter to our goals.  One of our goals is to have
general-purpose
computers widely available.  A DRM layer between us and the hardware
is counter to that goal, ergo, undesirable from this perspective.

Its like a governor in a car.  Do you want one in yours?   Are you
willing
to pay for the decreased driving flexibility and decreased reliability
(extra parts,
after all) of your car?  What makes you think you can require one in
mine?
