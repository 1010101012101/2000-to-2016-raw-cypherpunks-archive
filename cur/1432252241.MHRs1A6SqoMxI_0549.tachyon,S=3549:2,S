I have also added directions to this page now. here's a copy for those
who don't want to visit a webpage for fear of it all being a set-up. :)

Directions:
If using a car, please consult one of the maps above.
If coming by public transport, use either the U1 to St. Pauli or the S1
or S3 trains to Reeperbahn. If coming from the main
station ("Hauptbahnhof") you will want to be near the end of the train
in both cases.
At Reeperbahn (S1/S3) leave through the exit "Talstraﬂe" - the one
towards the end of the train if you come from main
station. Then just continue down the Reeperbahn until you see the place
(see pictures).
At St. Pauli you will also want to leave through the "back" exit. You
should be at a large crossing with a bus station in front of
you (2nd picture in the set). Turn to the right and you should already
see the building (see pictures).


if you have any questions left, or need help in finding a place to sleep
or transport towards hamburg, contact me (tom@ricardo.de)
