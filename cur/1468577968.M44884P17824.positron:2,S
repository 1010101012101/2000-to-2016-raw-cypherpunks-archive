Wtf is or was so important about Appelbaum that would lead to any kind of massive conspiratorial smear campaign? Who gains from taking him down? He may talk about him a lot, but he's not Julian Assange.

Maybe he was just a douche bag with a few people too many and they threw up some exaggerated reports to get him chucked.

In any event, he doesn't seem to be fighting back particularly hard.
