Interestingly, this time-dependency has also forced other technology.

Some years ago, the fuzzy logic people were touting a
(german?) dishwasher which was extra quiet because it used their
tech... which is important because Europeans apparently do their
heavy-wattage usage at night, to save costs.  A foreign concept to
Yanks :-)

Your electric meters must cost more.  I once lived in UC grad housing
that had no electric bill (free electricity :-) because it would have cost
too much to install individual meters.
