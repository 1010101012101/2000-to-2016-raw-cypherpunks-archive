I enjoyed interacting with Perry about 10-11 years ago, mostly on the 
Extropians list. Perry was a major political ranter (even if it is not 
true that he coined the phrase "Utopia is not an option"). (Extropians 
was a privately-owned list, and what eventually drove me away was the 
silliness involving "trials" for those accused of insulting others, or 
violating some rules, or disrespecting the Official Beliefs. I 
attribute this silliness not to malice by the Extropian Maximum 
Leaders, but by the very nature of private lists and the almost 
unavoidable tendency to try to "perfect" lists by tweaking what people 
can and can't say.)

I despise people's private fiefdoms, whether Dave Farber's "Interesting 
People" list or Lewis McCarthy's "Coderpunks" list or any of Bob 
Hettinga's various "BearerBunks" and "Phisodex" lists. And Perrypunks, 
with its quixotic policy about politics (politics banned, except when 
Perry wanted to rant), was just another private fiefdom.

I don't dispute their property right to do with their machines as they 
wish, absent contracts, but being in their fiefdoms chafes very quickly.

The distributed CP list may end up being the last list left standing, 
at least in this niche.

Part of the reason Usenet continues to thrive, despite its flaws.
