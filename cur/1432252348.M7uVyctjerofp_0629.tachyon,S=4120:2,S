Most delightful. Thank you for reminding us that Cypherpunks do indeed
write code. More comments in a bit.

That [...] you see is an artifact of the anonymous remailer you were
using. Mixmaster, I believe, gives the option to truncate messages which
appear to include binary encoded data. PGP messages are explicitly allowed
to be sent.

Immediate problem: we can't verify your signature.

Short term solution: find a remailer that allows binary posting.

Long term solution: perhaps contact the Mixmaster authors and ask them to
explicitly allow "multisig" data?
