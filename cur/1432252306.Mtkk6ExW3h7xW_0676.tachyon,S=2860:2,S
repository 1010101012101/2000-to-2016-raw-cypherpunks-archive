             Eudora 5.0 boasts new sharing
             feature 

             By Dennis Fisher, eWEEK

             Dont look now, but Eudora is growing up.

             Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq:QCOM - news) this week released version 5.0 of the
             popular free e-mail program, and it includes a host of features that cant be found in
             many commercial messaging products.

                              The feature most likely to grab users attention is the Eudora
                              Sharing Protocol, which allows users to share files among
                              small groups of friends and co-workers.

                              Users set up a folder on their hard drives that is designated for
                              file-sharing. The only other step is to enter the e-mail addresses
                              of the other people who are allowed to access the folder. All
                              files in the folder are then automatically saved and updated
                              whenever anyone in the group edits them.
