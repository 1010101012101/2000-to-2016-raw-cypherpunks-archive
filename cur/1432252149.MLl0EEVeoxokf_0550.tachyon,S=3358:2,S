While I agree that at, least initially, the Senate would continue be 
populated only by Republicrats, this could eventually change if minority 
parties gain a good enough foothold in the House.  Both major parties 
contain major 'single issue' blocks (e.g., the Republican Party's fiscal 
conservatives and Christian fundamentalists) are only sometimes satisfied 
with the platforms and conduct of the major parties.  These voters now have 
no alternatives, but if they thought they could have more legislative 
muscle through minority party seats they could well abandon the majors.

Yes.
