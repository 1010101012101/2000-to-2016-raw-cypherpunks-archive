Solar panel energy is very expensive in most countries (those that aren't
especially sunny)

Cartels (or just "the wealthy") have more money to spend on whatever there
is to be bought. So it was when Bitcoin were cheap, so it is while ASICS
get cheaper, so it will be for the time to come.

That might be true. But many people with startups consider their startup to
be the product, to be sold to a big company later on.

The world simply is quite bleak.

Bitcoin however dodges the bleakness by being a product without judgement
on color. It simply is what it is. It tolerates a few employing the rest of
humanity as slaves, but also doesn't allow the few to dominate their
ability to have free money exchanges. Although it doesn't save the many
foolish people, it reserves them the ability to save themselves later. That
might be the best we can do right now. Maybe, if we believe the many will
stay foolish no matter the incentive, then it is the best we can ever do.
