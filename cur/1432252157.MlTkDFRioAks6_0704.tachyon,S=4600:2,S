Police brace as bikies rally for run
By Layla Tucak
December 31, 2001
AS many as 250 Gypsy Jokers bikies are expected to set off from Perth on 
their annual "run" today, stretching police resources on New Year's Eve.
West Australian police conceded yesterday they still did not know the 
destination of the run, as gang members from across the country converged 
on Perth by air and car.
Their motorcycles, trucked across the Nullarbor in the past two days, were 
inspected by police concerned about trouble from one of the nation's most 
notorious gangs.
Members of the Jokers are the prime suspects in the car-bomb murders in 
September of former senior detective Don Hancock and his friend Lou Lewis.
Hancock and Lewis were killed a year after gang member Billy Grierson was 
shot dead by a sniper bullet at Ora Banda in the Goldfields after being 
kicked out of a pub owned by Hancock. It is thought that Ora Banda may be a 
destination for today's run, which will be followed by a large police and 
media contingent.
The Jokers who flew to Western Australia at the weekend were questioned and 
photographed at Perth airport by police.
Gang members began pouring into Perth on Friday night and continued to 
arrive yesterday while police kept a watchful eye at Perth's domestic 
airport and at the gang's Maddington headquarters.
Police sergeant Graham Clifford said yesterday as many police as needed 
would take part in the operation.
"We conduct randon breath-testing and vehicle checks on the general 
population and these people are no different - except that their his tory 
is linked to criminal activity," he said.
The gang will also be followed by a civil libertarian and an independent 
observer - Professor Arthur Veno from Monash University - who will document 
their ride.
Sydney Vietnam veteran Ray Jennings was also planning to join the group to 
act as its public relations spokesman but a police source said the gang had 
since discharged him of the role.
Police relations with the bikie gang have deteriorated since the double 
murder, which has resulted in multiple searches of gang hang-outs but no 
arrests
