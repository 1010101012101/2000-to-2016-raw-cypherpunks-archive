As all Matrix cognoscenti know, the machines use humans to extract otherwise
unavailable entropy, randomness which is fed into fusion generators, that would
otherwise get stuck because of the well known "quantum boredom" effect.

It's superficially similar to mass media principles, and there is at least one
PhD thesis that claims that machines use humans for entertainment.

Of course, one cannot expect comprenhension of the above by those still stuck
into geodesic mud.
