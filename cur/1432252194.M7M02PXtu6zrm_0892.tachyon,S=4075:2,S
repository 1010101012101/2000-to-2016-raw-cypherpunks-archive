The US Corrections System currently has 458,000 Drug War Prisoners. 
Plus the number of people under some form of correctional supervision 
-- jail, prison, probation, or parole -- has reached a record 6.3 
million. Go to the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) semiannual report on corrections.  That report, as 
well as a treasure trove of related statistics is available online at 
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/correct.htm>.
