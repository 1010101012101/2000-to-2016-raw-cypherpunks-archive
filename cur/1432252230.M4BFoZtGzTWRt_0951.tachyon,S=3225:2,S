The two events are completely unrelated, except for the fact that 9/11
gave the US the additional hubris it needed to launch an unprovoked war of
agression against another sovereign nation, in violation of international
law and the wishes of the world community.

Saddam's capture is the poisoned fruit of an illegal occupation, which is
itself the poisoned fruit of an illegal invasion, whose clear purpose,
despite the lies about Saddam's ready to launch nuclear weapons, was to
control Iraq's oil, and eliminate support for the oppressed Palestinians.

Bush knew that as long as he managed to attack Iraq, using any pretense,
he would never be forced to leave once the excuses were revealed as lies,
because if there's two things America is structurally incapable of doing,
it's accepting blame and apologizing.

Every American soldier in Iraq right now is a war criminal.  Every dead
Iraqi is a murder victim.

As one writer so aptly put it...

"For months we have wanted to get our hands on the warmonger who
terrorized the world with weapons of mass destruction. But, as we couldn't
get George Bush, we had to make do with Saddam Hussein."
