For example, Pax Dickinson was fired for crimethink

The person who called for his firing was Anil, who holds regulatory
government powers over the company that employed Pax Dickinson.

      I was pretty amazed that he went for it. He flat out said that he
      wants his startup to be funded and wasn’t sure if it’d be
      possible after all of his, and I replied that it realistically
      wasn’t going to happen without the say-so of someone like me, and
      I wasn’t inclined to give some VC the nod on this.

So, these days, the merely wealthy need a nod from the likes of Anil,
the powerless need to run all their decisions past the powerful.
