There are two roads: The Dulles Toll Road, which connects I-66 (near
the Beltway) with Dulles Airport, and the Dulles Greenway, which continues
northwest away from the city to end in Leesburg. We've been talking
about the Greenway.

There's a map here:
http://www.dullesgreenway.com/cgi-bin/dgmap.cfm

I take the Dulles Toll Road whenever I fly out of that airport, but have
only taken the Dulles Greenway once or twice (the only people I know in
the area are north of Leesburg, and it's easier to connect through
Point of Rocks in Maryland). So I'm not really all that familiar with it.

A quick search, though, turns up this, which shows that the Greenway
was a government project accomplished through eminent domain, that it
is run by a private contractor and will return to state control in a
few decades, and that it's subject to continued aggressive regulation
from local governments.

Not a good example of a privately-owned and privately-built road.
