IBM would tell you the z13 is the best platform to run a cloud on.
Claims are you get 8000 or so cloud servers per machine [1]. I'm
sure fujitsu or some other vendor will sell you something equally
expensive in the same 'mainframe' class that can virtualize like 
that.

A lot of what I hear about 'cloud' and virtualization are things that
were first deployed in 1970's-ish on mainframes.

Now, you're absolutely right that a 1TB hard drive that has been 
qualified to work with that machine will cost about 10x what you can 
get at staples.

But the point about mainframes is they are built to have lots of 
*memory bandwidth*, and a 'compute minute' on a Z13 is going to process
a lot more transactions and write them reliably to that overpriced 
disk than any cloud solution is ever going to do.

You just have to be ready to write a check for a couple of million 
if you want one of these things on-site, and that's why the cloud 
exists, for the folks that either don't have that kind of money, or
don't understand why they should spend it up-front, instead of getting
nickel and dimed to death by cloud vendors and their hackers.
