THE MAIN EVENT:
SVASE Monthly Meeting

Privacy: Where's the Profit?

Microsoft Campus, Mountain View
Thursday, July 12, 2001, 6 pm

Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of startup business plans are based on 
exploiting privacy technologies. Technologies that protect privacy --- as 
well as business plans based on those that undermine it --- seem to come 
out nearly every week. Existing or proposed federal privacy laws will have 
a huge impact on whether those plans ever succeed.

This extraordinarily high-powered panel of experts will sort through the 
issues and tell you what they view as the key issues for entrepreneurs 
facing - or hoping to make money from - the rules and regulations of 
electronic privacy.

Our keynote speaker and moderator JIM HARPER, based in Washington, DC, is 
one of the world's preeminent experts in privacy policy. He is the founder 
and principal of PolicyCounsel.Com, a lobbying and consulting firm focused 
on e-commerce, technology, and telecommunications. He is the founder of 
Privacilla.org, the only online think-tank devoted to privacy as a public 
policy issue. Mr. Harper served as counsel to committees in both the United 
States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. He now works 
to help Congress and regulators understand the New Economy. In his 
presentation to SVASE, Jim will unpack the complex concept of privacy and 
discuss the thinking and plans of legislators, regulators, and advocates. 
Progress & Freedom Foundation (<http://www.pff.org/>http://www.pff.org/) 
recently named Jim as an Adjunct Fellow.

MARK UNCAPHER is Vice President and Counsel of the Information Technology 
Association of America, responsible for ITAA s Internet Commerce & 
Communications Division. The more than 100 members of the division include: 
Amazon.com, AOLTime Warner, AT&T, Boeing, Cable & Wireless, Covad 
Communications, EDS, Exodus, Focal Communications, Fujitsu Limited, Global 
Crossings, IBM, MCI WorldCom, Metromedia Fiber Network, Microsoft, Nortel 
Networks, SunGard Data, Teligent, and Yahoo. Uncapher argues that the issue 
is not about whether to protect consumer privacy on the Internet -- that is 
what the public expects and what Internet companies are determined to 
provide -- the challenge is to identify the best and most profitable ways 
to do so.

DAVE KRAMER is a litigation partner with the reknowned law firm Wilson 
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.  On the privacy front, Kramer has worked 
extensively with technology pioneers such as Google and Netscape, 
developing startups such as Napster and Yodlee, and new online entrants 
like Orbitz, Cogit and Enviz. Mr. Kramer will discuss the biggest threats 
companies currently face in the privacy arena, including privacy regulation.

DECLAN McCULLAGH is Washington Bureau Chief for Wired News. He has been 
writing about the Internet since 1990. McCullagh moderates politech, a 
mailing list looking broadly at politics and technology that was founded in 
1994. He has appeared on CNN, CNN-fn, Court TV, NPR, ABC News, CNBC, CBC, 
CSPAN, Reuters TV, and Fox News. He is a member of the International 
Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences and has been a judge in the Webby 
awards, the Ars Electronica awards, the Internet Freedom journalism awards, 
and the Pacific Research Institute technology privatization awards.

RAY EVERETT-CHURCH, is a Principal at PrivacyClue LLC.  Called the "dean of 
corporate privacy officers" by Inter@ctive Week Magazine, Ray 
Everett-Church is an internationally recognized expert on privacy law and 
policy. In 1999, he became the world's first corporate Chief Privacy 
Officer, a ground-breaking position soon adopted by dozens of Fortune 500 
firms. Founder of PrivacyClue LLC, a privacy-oriented consultancy, he 
advises firms on developing privacy measures consistent with existing laws, 
prevailing consumer attitudes, and acceptable industry practices.  He was 
previously an attorney with the Washington, DC-area telecommunications law 
firm of Haley Bader & Potts, and has counseled America Online, Microsoft, 
and numerous start-up ventures.
