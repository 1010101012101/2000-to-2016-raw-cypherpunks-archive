That's a pretty nead idea for a detonator.  Especially in a haystack :-)

Exactly.  So can anyone be painted as a terrorist.

This is where hacking becomes an interesting terror weapon.

It's a good recipie.  A hacker can make someone look like a terrorist.
Good targets would be children of aparatchitks.  They would have access to
lots of "dangerous things" and they'd be near privledged info (even if
they  don't know that).  After a few 100 15 year olds get busted who are
all related to "powers that be", the conspiricy theorists might notice.
But until it happens to a few 1000, nobody will take it very seriously.
After all, the corruption is so deep right now that when governor's
daughters get caught with coke, nobody cares.  But being sent away with no
hope of ever seeing daylight again might make the recipie a touch more
tasty.

Patience, persistence, truth,
