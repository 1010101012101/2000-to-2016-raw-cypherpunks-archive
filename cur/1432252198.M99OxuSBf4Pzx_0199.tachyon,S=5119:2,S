Actually, Jews are actively using the electromagnetic frequency systems of the U.S. government and intrelligence agencies to attack remotely individuals who criticize them or who may think against them in one way or another. I have written more about this on alt.politics.org.cia.

I had communicated to my own voicemail box at BellSouth "There are too
many Jews in the White House." and I had said "Play this music to your
grandparents" (I played loudly some 3rd Reich songs .. so I must
conclude that Jews attacked me started from the summer of 1999 after I
had told to the Kremlin and on the USENET that Boris Berezovsky and
other Jews must be fired etc ... Madeleine Albright was involved
against me as I correctly noted in my notes earlier (they used the
word insertation technique (basically word were placed to the phone
conversation between me and my seperated spouse on December 15, 1999
as I have noted ..)

They tried to kill me ... really KILL ME ... how interesting ... so
the U.S. government with Jews destroyed my family and stole my moneys
.. from the ordinary Finn.

A Medrash. Hashem said to Moshe "Hain Kirvu Yamecho Lamus". Your time
                has come. The end of your life is here.

                The Hebrew word 'Hain', the commentaries explain,
implies finality. Hashem
                told Moshe, "You have been praying, arguing and
negotiating with me to
                extend your life. It is not going to happen. The
conversation is closed. The
                decision is in. "Hain!" Your time has come. You will
not live to enter the land
                of Israel."
