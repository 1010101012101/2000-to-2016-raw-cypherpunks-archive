And more from this "only TEENAGERS and adults" website...

	"Recently, I showed a friend a photograph of myself and a 
twelve-year-old boy with whom I was bonded years ago. We are standing 
side by side with my arm around his shoulder, in what I would consider a 
typical adult-child pose. My friend took one look at the picture and 
said, "You were lovers." To my surprise, he pointed out that there was 
absolutely no space between us. The boy had molded his body so that he
was in continuous contact with me from his ankle to where his shoulder 
fit into my armpit.  The author is classified as a violent felon, and so 
housed and treated, because the law defines sexual contact with a child 
less than eleven as a violent crime. The irony is profound. The child in 
question once had to go find his brother to help him remove a bothersome 
loose tooth because the author couldn't bear to cause him even momentary 
pain."

	Try as I might, I have been unable to find a single page on that 
NAMBLA website that speaks of "teenagers and adults."  All they ever 
talk about is "boys."
