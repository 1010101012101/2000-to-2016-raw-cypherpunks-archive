It's people like you -- or the perception that you tried to give me of you that I am trying to protect my son against.  When deception, filth, dishonesty, and the such as you have displayed rule this world ... when talking isn't the answer, a parent has the responsibilty to care for their child.  Perhaps you are not a parent, or you never had a parent that cared enough to protect -- but, I am one that will fight to the bitter end to protect the innocence of my children.  I simply asked for you assistance in cracking the .pwl file and your response was nothing to do with that request.

Your children are less "innocent" than they appear.

By keeping them in a state of ignorance about the world you are doing them
an incredible disservice.  (When they leave your "protection", they will
be totally unable to cope with the world around them.)

If you don't want them exposed to "filth" (as you call it), you need to
not be connected to the net AT ALL.

Filters are based on fraud.  Pure and simple.

I feel more sorry for your kid at this point.  He will have to do a GREAT
deal of growing up AFTER he leaves home.  (Because he obviously is not
being allowed to do so now.)
