But there is a scalar number attached to a person which deserves the name
"reputation capital", namely his own judgement of what his reputation is
worth. The idea of reputation capital solves an important problem: How do
we prevent nyms from doing bad things, disappearing, and coming back under
a different nym? If a nym has a positive reputation capital, then
disappearing is costly, so that provides a disincentive to do bad things.

Yes, that's why we should distinguish between reputation and reputation
capital.

But "Alice's reputation capital has been harmed" is not nonsense. That
just means Alice thinks her reputation is now worth less than before.

There are lots of situations where Alice does X only because she expects
Bob to do Y, and Bob does Y only because he expects Alice to do X. Money
is an example of this, and so are virtually all other social phenomena. I
would call this collective reality, not collective hallucination.

I don't see why our monetary system is less provably real than the world
of atoms and stars. Every proton in an atom can spontaneously decay.
Everyone in the world can spontaneously decide to stop accepting US
dollars as payment. It's all a matter of probabilities.

All crypto is economics. Unfortunately the economics doesn't seem to favor
much of the more advanced crypto we're interested in. Just to cite one
example, there are a small number of people who value privacy very highly,
and a larger number of people who value privacy somewhat. But there's no
way to charge them different prices to provide the same untraceable
communcation services to them. Since you need a large number of users to
provide cover traffic, you have to charge a low price for everyone, and
that doesn't seems to be a profitable business.

Anonymous ecash seems to have this problem, plus many more.

I think we may have been mislead by the extremely favorable economics of
basic crypto (i.e. exponential attack/defense cost ratios for encryption
and authentication) into thinking that all crypto have favorable
economics.

Isn't this just standard Baysian probability theory/decision theory/game
theory? Where are you going with this?
