A. You don't want all data.

A nice illustration on ether speeds is obtained by using simple tools like
putting the NIC in promiscuous mode, using simple reassembler and filter that
discards everything but smtp/pop text parts. This can be trivially done with
tcpdump+awk. The percentage of mail texts is usually less than 2-3% of all
traffic. And it's not even because of porn - it's stupidity of html generators
(humans & software).

B. Even 'All data' is far less than line speed. Average fiber utilisation is
under 4% in US. Buffers!
