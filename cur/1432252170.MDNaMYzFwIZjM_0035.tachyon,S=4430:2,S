With high-powered lasers, one of the important destructive mechanisms is
blast - the outer layer of the illuminated object vaporizes, and flies away
from
the rest of the target. The reactive force of this gives the target a hell
of a kick.
Kicking off strict alignment with it's flight path, or putting a big dent
(or even 
better a hole) in the side of a missile under several G's of stress
traveling at 
a high Mach number is not healthy for the missile.

Laser's have problems though - as they heat the air the refractive index
changes,
leading to 'blooming' or beam expansion. At too high a power density they
can
also ionize the air, which makes it effectively opaque. Dust, haze, and
clouds
are also problems.

Using *very* short pulses eliminates many of these problems.
