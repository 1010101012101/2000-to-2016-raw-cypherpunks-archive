Take a look at http://www.htthost.com

This allows you to tunnel through a proxy using HTTP and arrive at an 
external tunnel server. The tunnel link through the proxy can be encrypted 
using a static symmetric key (no SSL). The tunnel server can be running on 
a machine over which you have control on the outside of the proxy zone.

I'm assuming that you want to do what I am doing (that is to keep whatever 
I am doing from the proxy log files) so a symmetric key would do you and 
will save on the key set up.

The system is free, but is only suitable for Windows boxes.

Hope this helps.
