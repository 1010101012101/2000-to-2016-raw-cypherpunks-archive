Fermi's Paradox?  Per its .com address:

"The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high
probability extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of
contact with such civilizations."

I don't mean to diss the "inevitable self destruction" model.  My own
conclusion is that it's in progress here and now and can not be
stopped by any human agency.  But while the end of civilization as we
know it may be unthinkable for Civilized people and institutions,
leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.

That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.

We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).

If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.

In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.
Building the best future possible for kids born in 2150 is gonna be a
fuckton of work, and we better get as much done in advance as possible.

:o)
