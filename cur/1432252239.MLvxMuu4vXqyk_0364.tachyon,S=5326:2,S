Interesting.
I guess my basic question is, is there a subset of counter-surveillance 
actions that can be taken that, while not ensuring secure communications, 
forces eavesdropping parties to take 'radical' measures in order to obtain 
the desired information? In other words, if they have to deploy a black-bag 
operation every few weeks, then that makes the odds of them being 'outed' 
sooner rather than later much greater. It might even deter survelliance 
except "when it really counts".

But then again, if the walls really have ears, then there's not much that 
can be done. Perhaps Koffi Annan was completely aware of this but counted on 
normal diplomatic protocol to prevent embarrasing and public 
exposures...(and that may be all that's really needed at the UN after 
all...)
