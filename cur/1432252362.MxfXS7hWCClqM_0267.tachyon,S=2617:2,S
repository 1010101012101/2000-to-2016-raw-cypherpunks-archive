This has probably been mentioned here before, but another interesting
approach is what justicefiles.org used to do (I'm not sure what
the status of the site is, it seems to be down now). 

They collected the names of police officers (particularly ones
known to be abusive of their authority) in King County, WA and
published that + all public information they could find on them
(including SSN's, addresses, phone numbers, etc).  

Of course the police tried to take the site down but the court
upheld the site's right to publish any publicly available 
information about the cops (I believe they excepted the SSN's).
