Again, you make no distinction between freedom fighters and terrorists,
which is very sad because there is a rather important difference. Being
incapable of making the distinction, you are condemned to hate everybody
who fights.

Right is certainly on our side. I'm an atheist, so I have no concern for
God's opinions.

Remember September 11, 2001 but don't forget July 4, 1776

Rather than make war on the American people and their
liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
