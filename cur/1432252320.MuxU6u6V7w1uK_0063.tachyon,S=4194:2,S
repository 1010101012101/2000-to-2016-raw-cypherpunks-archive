If companies and even health clubs are subjected to Calfornia's 
various laws about discrimination, hate crimes, and other political 
correctness issues, why would ICANN, a California corporation _not_ 
be subject to these various rules and regulations?

(By including "health clubs," I don't mean building code or health 
regulations. I mean things like the law banning gyms from 
discriminating against women, though women-only clubs are still 
legal. The chick lawyers got this exemption put into law...something 
about "providing protected spaces for womyn." Many other examples 
abound of California law being used as an instrument of majoritarian 
herd rule politics.)

It may well be that political activists discover this whole ICANN 
thing and realize they have a golden opportunity to have California 
laws applied to black/delist sites they dislike, organizations they 
think are racist, etc.

The Southern Law Poverty Center, the Simon Wiesenthal Hate Center, 
and other ZOG-controlled commie organizations will likely be going 
into overtime.
