At 3:31 AM -0700 on 6/29/02, davidbrin@cts.com paints a picture out
of the second "Planet of the Apes" movie, Roddy McDowell, Ceasar
Romero, and all...:

In other words, using the nation-state (a mob by any other name
smells just same) to solve a technological, a physical, problem.
Shall we legislate pi, while we're at it?

I think my original point about Brin "trusting" the nation-state --
one I thought fairly tangential to my review of Wayner's excellent
"Translucent Databases", though apparently not tangential enough --
is proven above, and throughout Dr. Brin's latest fulmination. Meet
the new mob, same as the old mob, with a nod to Mr. Townsend and the
now late Mr. Entwhistle.


Sure, we're going to have ubiquitous *supervision* of *property*
using exponentially cheaper charge-coupled camera devices attached to
geodesic internetworks. Moore's, Metcalfe's, Gilder's(?) "laws", will
not be denied. But it will be increasingly done by property owners,
and not by nation states. I think that Brin used his entire book to
grope for that same point, but, apparently, he can't see beyond his
own statist nose to the ultimate answer to the problem he poses
there.

That's because, cryptography, and financial cryptography in
particular, is not just about anonymity. It is, ultimately, about the
control of property, and without the use of force, much less the
monopolistic use of force found in a nation-state, or any other form
of mob rule. :-).

First, encrypted information -- like informed opinion, the most
important thing in a ubiquitously networked world -- actually becomes
property, in the sense that if information, "content", whatever, is
encrypted, and I have the key, it's my property, to do with what I
want, including selling it to someone else. The more strong
cryptography there is in the network, the more that becomes so. I do
not define Microsoft/WAVE/AMD's digital "rights" "management"
attempts in this regard as strong cryptography, of course. Ronald
Coase, who first noted that property is necessary for the existence
of a market, much less an economy, is smiling somewhere, I bet.

Second, and most important to what I'm interested in, protocols like
those of Chaum, Brands, and Wagner, and others every year, are all
designed to *anonymously* transfer ownership of assets, particularly
financial assets. It is that deliberate anonymity of design that
paradoxically makes exchanges of those assets cheaper to use because
you don't need *identity*, Mr. Brin's cherished "transparency", to do
business anymore. If it's cheaper to do it privately instead of
keeping an ostensibly public database at a "trusted" third party, and
sending someone to jail if they lie about a debit or a credit, then,
obviously, we'll use functionally anonymous bearer-transaction
financial cryptography protocols instead of the "transparent"
book-entry settlement systems we now use. "Transparency", like
privacy, is orthogonal to transaction cost.

Look at it this way. If it were cheaper to use anonymous paper bearer
certificates hauled in armored trucks than it is to do batch, then
interactive book-entry transaction settlement, using mainframe and
then client-server over securely transported tape and now proprietary
communication networks, then we'd still use Brinks trucks, vaults and
cages, and wallets full of paper to do business with each other. But
that's not what we do, and, frankly, if it's cheaper to do anonymous
bearer-transaction financial cryptography protocols on a public
internetwork then we'll do that instead of the current "trusted",
"transparent" book-entry regime backed up by monopolistic government
force. By the same, um, token, :-), if you reduce transaction cost,
firm size goes down, and that means that, maybe, someday, we do not
even "buy" (pay for it gunpoint at tax-time) force from governments
anymore. Surveillance of citizens so they don't break the law becomes
supervision of your property so people don't damage it.

Dr. Brin says something about never hearing of "society", much less a
nation-state, that succeeded in an atmosphere of ubiquitous personal
privacy,  and, oddly enough, I believe he's right. First, we haven't
been able to organize in large groups without force monopolies until
now, and second, of course, nation-states probably can't survive in a
world of ubiquitous strong financial cryptography and geodesic
internetworks.

That, by the way, is why I was happy to review Peter Wayner's book,
"Translucent Databases", which, not so tangentially, now, is the
ultimate topic under discussion here. Using simple techniques, Wayner
shows that we can have as much anonymity as we like in a database,
and, among other things, it's because we can do the encryption in the
client if we want. Exactly what is done in blind signature
bearer-certificate financial cryptography, something Wayner only
skirts a couple of times in the book itself because it's a more
advanced solution to the original problem.

Which was my point, all along. If it's cheaper to use encryption, in
terms of transaction cost, liability to various risk, and so on, then
we'll use cryptography, up to, and including, functional anonymity.

As far as Dr. Brin's particular world view goes, if internet
databases are "translucent", the cameras feeding those databases
become "translucent" as well. So, if it's in the interest of the
*owner* of the *property* being watched by the camera to reveal that
information, or even sell it, then that information will be used.
Otherwise, it won't.

I expect most, if not all information, in databases and going over
the net to be encrypted sooner or later, and not to smash the state,
or to promote it, but because it's cheaper, safer, less personally
and financially risky, to do so. So much for the "Transparent
Society".




Finally, as to the mechanics of this discussion, I didn't reply to
Dr. Brin directly because he didn't reply to *me*, directly, when he
had the beef in the first place. Monkey see, monkey do, I suppose. He
had my email address. He knew how to use it. And, of course, there
was no reason to send him my review of Wayner's book "Translucent
Databases", any more than anyone else referring to his ideas would,
except to curry his favor, or something. Among other things, The
review itself is public. Hell, it even got Slashdotted this week,
though I wish I had corrected spelling and grammar a bit more there
before I punched the "Submit" button on the review instead of
concentrating on the HTML so much. Fortunately, various mail lists,
and Dr. Brin through various intermediaries, got the better version.
The geodesic network wins again.


As to misquoting him, I think his pair of recent emetica on the
subject have "quoted" Dr. Brin quite well enough for my taste, thank
you very much. I did not "lie", much less misrepresent his views, as
most people reading those two missives can see now from his own
words. Last but not least, I certainly didn't have to buy his book to
have an opinion about his ideas on politics and on transparency
itself. Before I got interested in financial cryptography on the net
and understood its implications and knew better, I had read most of
Brin's prior work, including "Earth", where the "transparency" idea
was presented in fiction. His public pronouncements, on the net, in
the press, and elsewhere since his non-fiction book's publication
have made his point, and rather vociferously, as we've now seen.

I suppose it would have been much better to have civil discourse with
the man, but he's the one who came out swinging. At the moment I feel
an awful lot like someone in a scene from a Monty Python movie. Let's
hope he continues to have fewer limbs to swing with at every
iteration of this exchange...


Cheers,
RAH
