As I said, how about this:  If YOU don't like seeing MY email, then why

Apparently you have no fucking problem whatsoever with filtering out the 
great deal of spam that comes from this list, whats a few more messages?

First off, let me point THIS out to you...

A search on excite for +cypherpunks +list turns up a great deal of sites...

The first site, "VERONA cypherpunks archives" has a link called "List 
Information", which goes nowhere.
The second site, obscura.com has several links but no mention of the list 
itself.
The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth sites, the cypherpunks 
hyperarchive at inet-one.com, has a copy of an email message DIRECTED AT 
THE TOAD.COM ADDRESS that comes up first in the search, followed by some 
others.
The SEVENTH site is homeport.org, and the first link on the site is to "The 
Cypherpunks Homepage" pointing to an FTP archive at berkeley, and has a 
link to the mailing list.  This link specifically tells you TO use the 
toad.com address.

So who is being ignorant exactly?  You go to a page claiming to be the 
"Cypherpunks Homepage" and it says the mailing list is @toad.com??

Why don't you blame the asshole responsible for that site before blaming 
people who did their due diligence and turned up toad.com again and 
again?  As it happens, this "homepage" makes no mention whatsoever about 
the other filtered lists.. not that I didn't know about Coderpunks or the 
others, but if you don't know, they aren't easy to just "bump into."  This 
berkeley.edu site is the only site I've run across ever claiming to be "The 
Homepage" and I believe it to be the closest thing there is to one.  So, 
kindly, shove it.

ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/mailing_list/index.html is the 
site and page I am talking about.

But, on a related note...
