	'if you recall correctly'? 

	Are you aware that this is the end of the year 2013, by the way? 

	Do I need to mention again that tor developers admit that traffic can be
analyzed? 

	Why on earth do you believe that "absence of (outdated)evidence is
evidence of absence"?

	What if you actually read my messages instead of repeating the same
unfounded assertions I've already replied to?

	Ã€re you joking? There's no reason for the NSA to be the NSA? 

	the hell are you talking about.

	They can do both . And actually, owning the target's computer may be
harder than monitoring the tor network, depending on circumstances.

	So? Virtually all academic computer science in the US is corrupt. That
isn't news.

	So? Applebaum may not get along with the US government, doesn't mean
anything, considering that the other developers are rather friendly to the
US government.

	For fuck's sake they work for the FUCKING US MILITARY.
