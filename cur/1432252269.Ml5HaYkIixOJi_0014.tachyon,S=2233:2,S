Those 5% get a special visit from the Colonial Eye for the Arabic Guy,
(a Fox production) where they get to wear a nifty black hood
complemented
by a spiffy nylon bracelet for both hands.  And then they get some
special
counseling from the friendly boys from interrogation.  Its amazing how

a cell phone will go up a rectum when you really want an answer...

What they need is good stego.
