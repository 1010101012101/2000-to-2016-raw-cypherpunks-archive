"Ironically, some of the features of Gmail bear resemblance to BlackNet.
In particular, its claimed policy of retaining email indefinitely,
even after the recipient has stopped using the account, is reminiscent
of BlackNet's function as a data haven, as well as other Cypherpunk
projects like the Eternity Network.  This retention is objectionable to
conventional privacy groups, but Cypherpunks will recognize it as being
deeply in accord with their values."

Poo poo. The difference between a potential blacknet and Gmail is that 
there's little doubt that google will cough up the true names of 
objectionable posters, if and when anyone looking even remotely 
authoritative/governmental comes pounding on their doors. In a worst-case 
Blacknet, my True Name will only be gettable by agents of the state via the 
expenditure of very large amounts of resources, if at all.
