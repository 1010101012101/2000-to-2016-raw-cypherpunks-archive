Isn't this dangerous to honest users?

"pirate-ransom": Own the user, make her download pirate/illegal content
preferably from well watched site. In addition possibly make her seed
the content. Remove signs of owning. Find a way to take money from her,
if possible.

It is possible that LEAs did something similar. IIRC the Hacking Team
leaked stuff had movies with titles suggesting illegal content, don't
have link at hand ATM.


Check the sizes of botnets and the amount of sickuarity bugs and 
backdoors.
