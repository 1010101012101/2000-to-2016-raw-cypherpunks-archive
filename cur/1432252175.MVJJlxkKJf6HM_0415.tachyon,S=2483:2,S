For the WWW, an alternate solution has already been proposed and
implemented. You can find an HTTP server, client and browser that
function using a decentralized designation and authentication
model at:

http://www.waterken.com/dev/YURL/

The acceleration part depends upon the participation of others,
such as yourself.

The YURL model is currently being discussed in a thread that
includes both the web-calculus list and the cap-talk list.

You can join the web-calculus list at:

http://mail.waterken.com:8080/mailman/listinfo/web-calculus

and the cap-talk list at:

http://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/cap-talk

or we could extend the discussion to this list.

The current thread is a continuation of the moderator terminated
thread you may have seen on the cryptography list. This
termination prevented the many misunderstandings from being
addressed. You can find a FAQ on these misunderstandings at:
