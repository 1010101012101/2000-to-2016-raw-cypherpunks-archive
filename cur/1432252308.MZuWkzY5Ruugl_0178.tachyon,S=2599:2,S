Is Hillary out?



May 20, 2008



BY MICHAEL SNEED

Sun-Times Columnist



<http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/958837,CST-NWS-SNEED20.article>





Is it over? Has the Hillary Clinton camp privately begun

throwing in the towel?



To wit: Sneed hears a Hillary Clinton fund-raiser starring

hubby Bill Clinton here Thursday will only ask for cash

they don't have to give back.



Translation: the $1,000-a-ticket event at the Palmer House

Hilton will only ask donors for money covering her primary

campaign.



Further translation: It's a big administrative hassle to

refund general election cash -- but you don't have to give

back money donated to the primary campaign. Hillary has

already infused her war chest with $9 million-plus of

her personal funds.



$$$$$: Donors can give $2,300 for the primary and $2,300

for the general election, and often get hit up for the

full $4,600 at these fund-raisers.



The buckshot: "This is the first time I've ever seen a

federal campaign ask only for primary dollars. The fact

is the fat lady is standing at the microphone -- and

will be singing soon," according top a Dem fund-raiser.
