As opposed to a thick watch battery?

Is that english?  I don't think the device transmits PCs and handheld
devices to biometric measurements.

I know that isn't english, and it's only marginally coherent.

I would much rather read a summary written by someone literate.

Uh huh.  This looks like a joke or a scam.  Even if it's not, I have a
hard time believing that a girlfriend/wife/daughter is not going to
notice that in her panties, and I doubt sufficiently miniaturized GPS
receivers could be made for so little money.

Perhaps that's why Anil seems to have removed the entry in his blog?

Do you now understand why I hate redistribution of slashdot stories?
