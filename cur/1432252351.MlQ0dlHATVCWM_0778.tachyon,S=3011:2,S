Therefore, the Government 
is invited to submit to the Court, prior to the filing of the 
aforementioned report explaining the key logger device, any 
additional evidence, either by way of affidavit, declaration or 
otherwise, which would provide particular and specific reasons how 
and why disclosure of the key logger technology "would jeopardize 
both ongoing and future criminal and national security operations." 
See id. This material shall be submitted in camera and under seal. 
Upon review of the Government's submission, the Court will then 
determine whether to reconsider the procedure for disclosure as 
outlined in this Letter Opinion and Order.

        IT IS SO ORDERED:

                              NICHOLAS H. POLITAN
