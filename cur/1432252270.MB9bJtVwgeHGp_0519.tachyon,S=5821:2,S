Sure, but that doesn't mean the individual people working there are 
incompentent. It's an institutional problem.

That's not by accident--they have zero incentive to show their true hand 
and every reason to hide it. For example, if someone from the NSA were to 
crack PGP, do you think they'd public-mindedly post the vulnerability on 
Bugtraq and have a big IRC coffee klatch to work on a fix? Hell no. There's 
no telling how many vulnerabilities in common software government security 
analysts found and kept secret. And the lousy thing is we all know it only 
takes one. 

Another one of their advantages is a fairly straightforward intelligence 
asymmetry: you have no clue as to who these people are and what they can 
do, whereas they can go over everything about you with a fine tooth comb at 
their leisure. People help them and don't even know it: the easiest way to 
get free security testing is to declare a government system secure, 
honeypot and fishbowl it to Kingdom Come, and wait for the free data to 
come rolling in from the too-smart-for-their-own-good suckers who can't 
wait to broadcast to the world exactly in excruciating detail how 
they "r00ted the Fedz". Everyone laughs and gloats at how insecure 
government systems are, but they didn't gain a thing, since all the truly 
interesting data was far, far away. And the veritable icing on the cake is 
that the feds turn around and use the very intrusions they invited as a 
tool to scare the Solid Citizens in Congress into allocating even more 
money and resources "to protect national security". Depressing.

Maybe. But some of those very same people are still around and sharper than 
ever. Never underestimate the old guys.

Well, I'm not ruling that out. But since none of us knows the first thing 
about what's happening behind the Silicon Curtain, that remains to be seen.
