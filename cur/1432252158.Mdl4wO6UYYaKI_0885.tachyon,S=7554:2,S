I'm sure Mr. Obvious meant to say the following publically.

Frankly, I give up. Go read Brands and Chaum, though I bet you'd dispute
them, as well, on what I just said.

Yes, I do believe that, given small enough bearer cash transactions,
authentication of things like the "adult" bit will be sold, and for cash.

Finally, a payment system is, by definition, morality-neutral, or at least
orthogonal. Biblical imprecations of money being the root of all evil
aside...


Cheers,
RAH

You're saying that the customer comes to the porn merchant with a
blinded credential.  The merchant goes to the authenticator with the
credential, and pays for it to be authenticated.  The blinding is there
to protect the customer, as the credential is unlinkable to his credit
card which he used to prove his age.

Actually there is direct sales contact with the content vendor.
The notion that he is going to come to the authenticator and pay CASH for
EVERY customer contact is absurd.  It's completely uneconomical until we
have a worldwide ecash infrastructure.  If that's what you had in mind,
shut up for ten years and speak up when you have something relevant
to say.

What will really happen is that the porn merchant will have an account
with the authenticator, and he'll pay every month or so based on how
many authentications have been done.  That's how business works.

This means that there IS sales contact, and the authenticator DOES KNOW
who his merchants are.  It is exactly the same business relationship as
exists today, except that the customers have the benefit of blinding to
protect their identities.

Somehow I doubt that the Reedys are going to get away with saying that
governments aren't held liable for misdeeds commited with their currency,
so they shouldn't be blamed when someone sells bad stuff using the
Reedy's own services.

Look at what they're accused of!  Providing access to kiddie porn by
verifying credit cards and assigning passwords.  That's exactly what
your bearer cert business will do except instead of passwords they'll
issue blinded tokens.

This is especially true when the de facto market for such a business
is only the worst porn, the porn that the customers really don't want
anyone to be able to find out they were involved with.  This kind of
information comes out in court.  You can't hide it.

Obvious.
