We in al Qaeda organization are committed to a prize of 10,000 grams of
gold to whoever kills Bremer,
his deputy, the commander of American forces or his deputy in Iraq," the
voice said.

Bin Laden also offers 1kg of gold for killing a US
soldier or civilians, and 500 grams for killing an allied
civilian or soldier.

Terrorists in Fallujah claim they'll
give $15 million each for the heads of
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Lt. Gen.
Ricardo Sanchez and Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmit.
