It takes a lot to get a whole town annoyed enough at you
that they won't do business with you.  You can do it,
but it's much easier to do in a small town where
it's easier to leave than in a large city.

Demands without consequences are stupid.  "Play nice" or else what?
"Play nice or I'll cry a lot and flame you on Usenet!"
"Play nice or I'll take my ball and go home!"
"Play nice or I'll picket your business and you'll lose customers"
"Play nice or I'll shoot you"
Governments usually go for "Play nice or we'll use as much violence 
as it takes to get you to obey us", which isn't nice at all.

Oh, it's way too late for that :-)

:-)  In particular, it gets into the debate of how land ownership works,
how it's justified, and how the land gets given out.
Here in North America we usually resolve it by saying that the
British/French/Mexicans stole it from the Indians and we
stole/bought it from them and most remaining Indians are dead,
which may or may not be related to naming many baseball teams after Indians
:-)
