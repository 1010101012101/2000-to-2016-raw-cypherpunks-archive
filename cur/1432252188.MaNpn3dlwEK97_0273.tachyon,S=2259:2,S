"Enemies" are discussed in juxtaposition to "levying War against [the 
United States]".  This implies
that "Enemies" of the United States are those with whom the U.S. is at 
war.  Since the Constitution
gives Congress the sole power to declare war, I conclude that "Enemies" 
in this context can only  be
those entities on whom Congress has declared war.

This also precludes conviction of Hawash, as there was no overt act, 
only  a claim that his intentions in travelling were to later commit 
such an act.
