    Bush and Gore Campaigns Will Debate Privacy
    posted by cicero on Tuesday October 10, @03:22PM

    Representatives of the George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigns
    will debate privacy in Washington on October 16. Now, the candidates
    themselves aren't going to be there, but a privacy debate is still a
    first. A related one happened today at the Brookings Institution, when
    Sen. Robert Bennett (for Bush) and Robert Shapiro, Commerce Department
    undersecretary (for Gore) tangled over "technology and the global
    economy." There's one odd thing about the Bush-Gore privacy debate:
    It's being hosted by Amitai Etzioni of George Washington University, a
    "communitarian" who's deeply suspicious of proposals to limit
    government surveillance, and an unusual choice for a moderator. See
    below for details. Also see Gore and Bush and Ralph Nader on privacy.
