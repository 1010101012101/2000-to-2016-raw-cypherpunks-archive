Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
oss-security@lists.openwall.com mailing list.

I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at oss-security-owner at lists.openwall.com.

I'm sorry, your message (enclosed) was not accepted by the moderator.
If the moderator has made any comments, they are shown below.

>>>>> -------------------- >>>>>
If you ever have anything valuable to share, like software bugs you used
to find 10+ years ago, please feel free.  Other than that, please consider
the kind of content you've been posting lately unwelcome on oss-security.

We also have a policy to discourage CC'ing other lists on oss-security
postings (because this attracts less-relevant postings from other lists),
but of course you didn't know nor care.  (And the CC's were not
particularly bad in this case, I admit.  It's worse when someone CC's LKML.)

Many thanks. You fixed the _entire_ messy issue with a single `rm`.
btw, didn't your marketoid debian overlords taught you to
hypocritically say `thanks' in issues like this?

Goodbye oss-security-unsubscribe@ and debia
