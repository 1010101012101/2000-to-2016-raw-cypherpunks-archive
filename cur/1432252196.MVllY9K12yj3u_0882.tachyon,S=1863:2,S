I've been thinking what a bunch of (camouflaged) Ubiquiti point to point
links to Syria, running a darknet that obscures the gateways behind a
few hops would do.

Solar-powered, and installed so that there is no lead to a particular
warm body. Rest goes over dynamical Serval-on-smartphone things, so 
that you can link up to meshed relays up there on house roofs.

It seems that locating end users would be tricky, and taking the thing
down or jamming it expensive. Thoughts?
