The way calling cards in the US work is that the user calls an 800
number and then enters a PIN number and the number to be called.  The
way 800 numbers work, the 800 number operator (ie, the company that
pays for it) gets a list of all the numbers that dialed it, because
he's paying.

It seems that it should be possible to create a "bugged" calling
card.  You give this to someone as a "free prize" or whatever and then
you get a list of all the numbers he calls to and from using it.

Does anyone know if something like this exists, which I can buy?  I
want to send someone a "present".

Thanks
