   That's obviously covered under the 1st's "freedom of the press". What does
that have to do with non-humans (corporations) having Constitutional rights? The
arguement always put forth is that corporations have the right to make campaign
contributions, because that's "freedom of speech". But I guess if those rights
are going to be extended to non-humans like corporations, then there's no way to
stop them from being extended to other non-human entities as well, such as
animals and trees. Or even rocks.
