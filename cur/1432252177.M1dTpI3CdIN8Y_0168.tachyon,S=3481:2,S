Has anyone who does not look a terrorist done a suicide mission 
outside Israel or Russia? Recall the shoe bomber.   You just
had to look at him. You would think the airport screeners would
need to be half brain dead to let him on the plane.  Come to
think of it, they are half brain dead, but laws that require
them to pretend to be stupider than they actually are do not
help.

Just don't let anyone who looks like the shoe bomber fly. 
Problem solved.  A restaurant should be able to turn away those 
whose looks they do not like, and an airline likewise.

There are probably a few innocents in Guantenamo, but they 
released at least one Al Quaeda terrorist who promptly got back 
in business murdering large numbers of people, and was caught 
doing it - so presumably they have released lots of others who 
have committed lots of murders, and not been caught doing it.

Anyone who was non Afghan and in Afghanistan in the middle of 
the war without a good explanation should have been executed by 
the Northern Alliance or imprisoned permanently in Guatenamo.

Yes, I do support internment, as wartime measure, during real 
war, against an ethnically based enemy. Similarly I support 
shelling enemies who surround themselves with captive women and 
children, as Sadr did in Najaf.   That hostage crisis was ended 
by negotiation, but because the administration were reluctant 
to shell the mosque, the deal was settled on very unfavorable 
terms.
