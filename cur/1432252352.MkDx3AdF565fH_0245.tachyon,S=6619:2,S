The feature isn't entirely unlike, say, ssh, or VNC tunneled through
same.  Poking around the vendor's website indicates that there is some
security offered.  Note that this doesn't mean that the feature *is*
secure, but remote access to computer systems in a controlled manner
*is* possible.  Naturally, insecure access is also possible, and access
via untrusted hardware or software may pose a real risk.
