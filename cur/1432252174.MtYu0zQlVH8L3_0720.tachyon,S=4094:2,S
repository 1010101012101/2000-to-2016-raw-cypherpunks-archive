Also from yesterday...A WOMAN who sneezed in a policeman's face was an 
egocentric,
attention-seeking nuisance, a judge said yesterday.
But April Whitelaw is $500 better off and without a criminal conviction
after Judge Peter Gebhardt dismissed a charge of assaulting police.
Yesterday in the County Court, Ms Whitelaw appealed against a magistrate's
decision that she had intentionally sneezed in the face of Sen-Constable
Kevin Walsh after he intercepted her car in Bittern on May 19 last year.
The court heard Ms Whitelaw, of Chelsea, falsely told Sen-Constable Walsh
and his partner that two purses she had with her were stolen. In fact, they
were hers.
Sen-Constable Walsh told the court that as he went to arrest her, Ms
Whitelaw told him he was placing himself "in fear of assault" before she
"sneezed or snorted" nasal fluid in his face.
