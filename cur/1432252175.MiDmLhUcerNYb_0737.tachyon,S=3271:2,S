This aggression against the ufo bases will not stand.
I'm not saying that they exist, I will do so when I am inside but the
aggression against
them will not stand. I repeat it will not stand, that's the
aggression against the ufo bases.

On the Zetas. Obviously we have (in more cases than one -
"ubernormal") events that have transpired. These
have lead to a few people claiming that they know the whereabouts of
"figures" involved.
In a powerful vision to Tim May I could speak finnish. It would be
really unfortunate if Tim May then concluded
that I am of finnish descent. *

Nazi...Never heard anything interested about it, except some
sightings in Italy during the Mussolini reign.
Probably misinterpreted speculations, again. However occult links to
alot of national socialist circles exist.

1488 and hail the ufobases, american bitches.
