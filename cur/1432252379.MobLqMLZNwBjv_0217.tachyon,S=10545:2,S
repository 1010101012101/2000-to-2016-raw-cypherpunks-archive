And would you be so upset if it were a county full of people that
share YOUR political persuasion, but similarly configured?

Probably not.

Therefore, you are not quite the objective guy you claim.  You just
have a lot of vocal people on this list who share YOUR views.  There
are a lot of people in Palm Beach County who share some other views.
They feel cheated.  They are angry.  They are using the legal system
to do something about it.  They may not succeed.  (Who cares.)  All
I claimed was that they have a right to pursue the issue precisely
because the goal of elections is to see what the voters want, not
whether the voters meet some intelligence criteria or can decipher
some level of complexity.  I may personally dislike the notion that
such idiots are voting, but they have every right to vote.  I also
am well aware that real people in real situations make mistakes.

That is why there are lots of recourses to help fix election process
problems.  Of course, the ideal would be that everyone votes exactly
at the same time, with informed intelligence, etc ..  Real life is
much more complicated than that, and unlike you, I do not pretend to
know every complication (and have an proper solution) that could
happen to such a huge process.

Subject: Looking for statistically-unlikely surges in absentee ballots

I just heard Karen Hughes of the Bush Campaign express concern about 
the status of absentee ballots being mailed AFTER the outcome of the 
election was shown to be so close. In particular, after the legal 
cut-off date.

This fits with what I just posted about concerns that Florida 
dual-citizenship residents of Israel, or tourists in Israel, sending 
in absentee ballots they had neglected to send in by the cut-off 
date. (Or, more ominously, ZOG conveniently postmarking them to match 
the law in Florida.)

[By the way, I think in my ZOG piece I mentioned Palm Beach County. 
This is not the point, as the closeness of the vote is Florida-wide. 
This is what I meant to say.]

The thing to look for is a _surge_ in ballots arriving in Florida 
absentee ballots as compared to other states. While other states may 
also have some degree of "after the fact absentee ballots," the 
incentives are higher in a razor-thin state like Florida. A surge of 
absentee ballots arriving two or three days after the controversy 
became obvious would be compelling evidence to justify further 
investigation.
