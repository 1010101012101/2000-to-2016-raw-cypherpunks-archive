Abstract.=20

In recent years, hardware Trojans have drawn the attention of governments a=
nd
industry as well as the scientific community. One of the main concerns is
that integrated circuits, e.g., for military or critical infrastructure
applications, could be maliciously manipulated during the manufacturing
process, which often takes place abroad. However, since there have been no
reported hardware Trojans in practice yet, little is known about how such a
Trojan would look like, and how dicult it would be in practice to implement
one.

In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for implementing
hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their impact on the
security of the target device. Instead of adding additional circuitry to the
target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing the dopant polari=
ty
of existing transistors. Since the modified circuit appears legitimate on a=
ll
wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon), our family of Trojans =
is
resistant to most detection techniques, including fine-grain optical
inspection and checking against "golden chips".  We demonstrate the
ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans into two designs | a digital
post-processing derived from Intel's cryptographically secure RNG design us=
ed
in the Ivy Bridge processors and a side-channel resistant SBox implementati=
on
and by exploring their detectability and their ects on security.

Keywords: Hardware Trojans, malicious hardware, layout modifications, Trojan
side-channel
