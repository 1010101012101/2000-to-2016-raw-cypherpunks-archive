That's true. But there are many militaries. And although much of their
technical allusion is over my head, what I do get makes sense.

I do consider you an ally, of a sort. And your perspective is valuable.
But your unremitting nihilism has been getting to me. And it smells like
sock to me.

In particular, I also have concerns and reservations about Tor. It's
true that the US military funded its development. And it's true that
they probably still use it.

But maybe think of it this way: we have military-grade anonymity. And in
any case, as far as I know, it's the best anonymity tool we've got.
