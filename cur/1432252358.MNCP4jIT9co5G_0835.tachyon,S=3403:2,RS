It's obviously to prevent another Clinton administration,
just as it was used to prevent various Kennedy administrations :-)
Also takes care of any lingering Gore recount problems.

Constitutionally, before you assassinate someone, 
you have to propery indict the target and hold a trial in which
he or she is present, has a lawyer available, 
and is allowed to question the witnesses and appeal whether any
sentence of death is cruel or unusual punishment.
_Then_ you can sneak up on them and kill them,
or poison their cigars, or give them an Israeli cellphone
or a Ford Pinto.
