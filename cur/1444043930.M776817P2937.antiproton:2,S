Good ideas in this thread so far.  What I would add is, get the F
away from population centers; they are very hungry machines that
will start to fail in very bad ways whenever any of their major
inputs are substantially reduced for more than a few weeks - even
without panic and martial law factored in.

On moving way out of town:  Sooner is better, because as the
industrial economy crumbles everyone will get the same bright idea
and that land ain't empty.  It's occupied by communities where it
takes time to learn the human landscape and build trust
relationships.  On arrival start working to establish oneself in
an economic role that will continue to pay off in the form of
mutual aid and bartering of labor and commodities, as the value of
Federal Reserve Notes spirals down.

As for cash money, I like silver way more than gold:  People will
kill you much sooner for gold than silver, and the value of silver
has been steadily rising due to industrial applications drawing
down the world supply faster than mining is able to replace it.

Another thing to think about is identifying technology that will
stay relevant to the practical concerns of feeding and housing
people in your local economy when international supply chains go
sideways for months or years at a time.  Learn what is and isn't
important by getting involved in the actual work, and get on top
of how to run and fix that stuff, /then/ stockpile spare parts and
replacements.

In short, start building the world of 2100 today.  It's going to
be built one way or another; early adopters will have more
problems to solve and go down more blind alleys, but that's the
price of coming out on top in the long run.
