Actually, the deteriorating standard of justice in this country is starting
to blow up in the faces of Bush2 and his gang.

EU regs forbid extraditing people to countries with lower standards of
justice
than practiced in the EU. Spain has already refused to extradite the 
Al Qeada(sp?) suspects it's arrested, unless it's guarenteed that the 
USG won't kill them.. Spain (like most civilized countries) has abolished 
the death penalty, and doesn't think highly of places which haven't.
Sending them to a place where they may be tried
by a secret tribunal is also a regarded as a problem
