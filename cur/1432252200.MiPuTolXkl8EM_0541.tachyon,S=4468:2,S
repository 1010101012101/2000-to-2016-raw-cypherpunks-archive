L International Computers Inc. Announces the Next-Gen Grand Canyon,
Quad-Panel OLED based Computer/ AV Professional Display
Tuesday May 23, 12:14 pm ET


BEVERLY HILLS,  Calif.--(BUSINE`SS WIRE)--May 23, 2006--L International
Computers Inc. (Pink She`ets: LITL) through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Liebermann Inc., a renowned manufacturer of high-performance computers and
personal technology, today announced the next generation Grand Canyon
display that will be bringing desktop views and resolutions to unheard of
new heights. 

The displays will be available in configurations based on single display
size panels of 17", 19", 24" and 32" ranging from 1280x768 pixels to
1440x900 pixels, 1680x1050 and 1920x1200 pixel individual resolution. When
compared to L's first generations Grand Canyon, the new displays have a
remarkably smaller separating seam per panel bringing an unparalleled sense
of unified desktop space and ultra-wide screen royalty. L's next-generation
of large format multi-panel displays represent the pinnacle of computer
displays technology for creative professionals, demanding graphics, digital
photography, design, gaming, rich-content creation, video, audio and large
venue presentation requirements delivering world-leading resolutions, allied
to extremely wide viewing angles, unmatched color depth, and
near-instantaneous pixel video response times inherent to OLED Technology.

Miguel Liebermann, CEO of 'L', stated "Delivering superior image quality in
contrast, video response, and color reproduction, the new displays are
compatible with PC, Mac, HP, SG, Sun and all video standards. They are the
solution for creative professionals and critical digital imaging scenarios,
covering the viewing area of several high resolution monitors with a smaller
comparable physical footprint. L's next-generation large format multi-panel
displays represent an industry benchmark years ahead of the competition."
