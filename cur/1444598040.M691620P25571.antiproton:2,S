Not necessarily...

Logs in /var/log is where they should be by default, but if the box is
on a shared hosting account, then things are completely different. For
instance, Bluehost charges $3.95/month, which gets you a home directory
on a box shared with hundreds of other users. In your home directory,
you get something like (from memory, which was a long, long time ago):

  ~/
  ~/public_www/
  ~/public_www/html/
  ~/public_www/access_log
  ~/public_www/error_log

So as you can see, the user does have permissions to access logs, but
are kept in the user's _home_ directory. Now you can see why this could
have mistakenly been distributed:

  tar zcf cryptome-backup.tar.gz ~/

The backup would have also slurped in all the logs. There was no malice,
just an easy mistake that everyone here could have make given the same
circumstances.
