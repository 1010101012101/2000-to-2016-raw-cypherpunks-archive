  Meditation is very much a part of weapons control. Read Musashi's
"Book of the Five Rings." Many of the Samurai were Zen students, 
and more than a few were actually Zen masters. Also read Jocho
Yamamoto's book, "The Hagacure", he was a 16th Cent. Zen Samurai/monk.
The book later came to be used as required reading for the 
glorius "Spirit Wind" pilots in WWII.
   How more noble can a man's life end, then to love his country, or
his cause, his family, his friends -- more than himself?
