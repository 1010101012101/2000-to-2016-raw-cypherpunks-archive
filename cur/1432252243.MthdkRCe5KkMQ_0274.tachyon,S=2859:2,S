Hi Bjarni,

There is a stylometry item in the anonbib where they do statistical
analysis of features of writing style:

http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec2000/full_papers/rao/rao.pdf

I bet these techniques have gotten more powerful as the field of
machine learning has developed, although I don't know if there are
more recent studies of what this means for anonymity.
