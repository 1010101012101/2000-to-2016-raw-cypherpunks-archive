Someone has dubbed this "griefcrime," after Orwell's "thoughtcrime."

The notion that a child grinning while displaying his "Peace Poem" 
assignment is cheering on some act is bizarre. Many years ago I got 
interested in the way people will smile or grin (or do something besides 
weeps and frown) when they are reacting to bad news or talking about it.

Because of this interest, I've watched thousands of people on t.v. 
dealing with bad news or sorrowful news with various upturns of their 
mouth, grins, etc. Does it mean they're "happy" with what they are 
talking about? No. It means that people react in various ways. Some 
grinning is due to nervous reaction. Some is subconscious.

  (Not that I countenance punishing a person for such thoughtcrime.)

Griefcrime is out of control this time around. When children are 
_required_ by law to attend school, there is no place for punishing them 
for incorrect thoughts...if these thoughts were even incorrect in any 
meaningful sense (pace the point about grins being personal reactions).

I'm glad I don't have any rug rats in the U.S. educational system. I 
expect I'd be arrested for threatening to blow the heads off of teachers 
and administrators.
