This author needs to get a clue.  There is only one form of
intellectual property, which is the trademark, and trademarks won't
benefit from encryption.  Copyrights are "held", not "owned".
Copyrights expire; property doesn't.  Copyrights exist to reward the
production of artisitic or literary material, as a public benefit.
Property rights exist for their owners.

The term "intellectual property" must have been invented by the same
PR genius who invented the terms "freeway" and "Social Security".
