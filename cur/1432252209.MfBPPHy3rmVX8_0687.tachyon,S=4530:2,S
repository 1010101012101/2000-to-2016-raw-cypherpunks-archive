A couple of points. First, unless I've fallen behind, SHA1 is only
broken to the point where you can generate two different arbitrary
datum and have them result to the same hash. This is not the same as
being able to "undo" SHA, or to even determine an arbitary collision
to a fixed hash. Unless I've missed something.

Second, even if this were the case, the hidden service is supposedly
only listed with the introduction points that the service connected to
through Tor. Assuming Tor remains unbroken, these Intro Points cannot
reveal the hidden service IP, and the public key of the hidden service
is not secret information anyway.

Here are some slides that illustrate the process of connecting to a
hidden service: http://www.freehaven.net/~arma/wth3.pdf

The one thing I would advise against is running your hidden service on
the same IP as your Tor server (or at least do not announce this
fact). This can leave you vulnerable to an intersection attack, where
the attacker keeps track of uptime of your hidden service and compares
it to uptime stats of the various tor servers. You only have 300-some
nodes to hide among.


Incidentally, I would like to know exactly which directory server listing
hidden services are published in. I don't see any of them in
http://belegost.seul.org/ for example..
