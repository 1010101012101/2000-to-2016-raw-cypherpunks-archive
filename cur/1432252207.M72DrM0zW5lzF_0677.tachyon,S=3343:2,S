Yes, this is the logic. Discussed in many other fora.

And not new. When the U.S. "liberated" Somalia the first thing they did 
was to seize control of the press and begin to collect the guns...then 
the "warlords" were able to operate freely amongst the disarmed 
peasants, and ultimately the U.S. got its ass kicked and left in shame.

The U.S. believes in basic rights for _some_ Americans, but certainly 
for none of the sand niggers it conquers.

It declares the soldiers it fights to be "illegal combatants" and 
subjects them to torture at Guantanamo Bay. I hope some captured U.S. 
soldiers are declared to be "illegal combatants" and similarly tortured 
and murdered.

As for Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell, Wolfowitz, Perle and the rest of the 
Jew, er, New World Order, I hope they are eventually tried for treason 
for their lies and, if found guilty of lying about the supposed "WMDs," 
then hanged in a public square.  Actually, I hope General Powell first 
does the honorable thing and uses his .45 for its Approved Alternative 
Shame-Reduction Purpose.

(Note to the SS Gestapo: This is a statement of my protected political 
beliefs about what the court system of the U.S. _should_ do, not a 
statement of what freedom fighters plan to do. When freedom fighters 
act, the act will be a blinding white flash over the Criminal Capital, 
not some bullshit hanging of some run-of-the-mill criminals like Bush, 
Hitler, Rice, Goebbels, Powell, Mussolini, Wolfwowitz, Quisling, etc. )

The United States needs to have its hard drive reformatted.
