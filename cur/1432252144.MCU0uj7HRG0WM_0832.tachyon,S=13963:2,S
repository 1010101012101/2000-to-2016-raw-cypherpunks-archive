How Team of Geeks Cracked Spy Trade

By SIOBHAN GORMAN

PALO ALTO, Calif. -- From a Silicon Valley office strewn with bean-bag
chairs, a group of twenty-something software engineers is building an
unlikely following of terrorist hunters at U.S. spy agencies.

One of the latest entrants into the government spy-services
marketplace, Palantir Technologies has designed what many intelligence
analysts say is the most effective tool to date to investigate
terrorist networks. The software's main advance is a user-friendly
search tool that can scan multiple data sources at once, something
previous search tools couldn't do. That means an analyst who is
following a tip about a planned terror attack, for example, can more
quickly and easily unearth connections among suspects, money
transfers, phone calls and previous attacks around the globe.

Palantir's software has helped root out terrorist financing networks,
revealed new trends in roadside bomb attacks, and uncovered details of
Syrian suicide bombing networks in Iraq, according to current and
former U.S. officials familiar with the events. It has also foiled a
Pakistani suicide bombing plot on Western targets and discovered a spy
infiltration of an allied government. It is now being used by the
Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

Yet Palantir -- which takes its name from the "seeing stones" in the
"Lord of the Rings" series -- remains an outlier among government
security contractors. It rejected advice to hire retired generals to
curry favor with the agencies and hired young government analysts
frustrated by working with slow-footed technology. The company's
founders knew little about intelligence gathering when they started
out. Instead, they went on a fact-finding mission, working with
analysts to build the product from scratch.

"We were very naive. We just thought this was a cool idea," says
Palantir's 41-year-old chief executive Alexander Karp, whose usual
dress is a track-suit jacket, blue jeans, and red leather sneakers. "I
underestimated how difficult it would be."

Technology like Palantir's is increasingly important to spies
confronting an information explosion, where terrorists can hide
communications in vast data streams on the Internet. Intelligence
agencies are struggling to identify and monitor such information --
and quickly send relevant data to the analysts who need it. U.S.
officials say the software is also crucial as the country steps up its
offensive in difficult theaters like Afghanistan. There, Palantir's
software is now being used to analyze constantly shifting tribal
dynamics and distinguish potential allies from enemies, according to
current and former counterterrorism officials familiar with the work.

"It's a new way of war fighting," says former Assistant Secretary of
Defense Mary Beth Long. While there are many good systems, Ms. Long
says, with Palantir's software "you can actually point to examples
where it was pretty clear that lives were saved."

Palantir's chief rivals are I2 Inc., a 20-year-old software company
with offices in McLean, Va., and a handful of defense contractors who
have been building software for intelligence agencies for years. I2's
general manager, Todd Drake, dismisses his upstart competitor as "the
new sexy thing," saying that Palantir won't be able to make lasting
inroads in a government market that prizes the stability of
established companies. Palantir CEO Mr. Karp says such criticism
doesn't trouble him. He says the company is already expanding rapidly.

Palantir's roots date back to 2000, when Mr. Karp returned to the U.S.
after living for years in Frankfurt, where he earned his doctorate in
German social philosophy and discovered a talent for investing. He
reconnected with a buddy from Stanford Law School, Peter Thiel, the
billionaire founder of online payment company PayPal.

In 2003, Mr. Thiel pitched an idea to Mr. Karp: Could they build
software that would uncover terror networks using the approach PayPal
had devised to fight Russian cybercriminals?

PayPal's software could make connections between fraudulent payments
that on the surface seemed unrelated. By following such leads, PayPal
was able to identify suspect customers and uncover cybercrime
networks. The company saw a tenfold decrease in fraud losses after it
launched the software, while many competitors struggled to beat back
cheaters.

Mr. Thiel wanted to design software to tackle terrorism because at the
time, he says, the government's response to issues like airport
security was increasingly "nightmarish." The two launched Palantir in
2004 with three other investors, but they attracted little interest
from venture-capital firms. The company's $30 million start-up costs
were largely bankrolled by Mr. Thiel and his own venture-capital fund.

They modeled Palantir's culture on Google's, with catered meals of ahi
tuna and a free-form 24-hour workplace wired so 16 people can play the
Halo video game. The kitchen is stocked by request with such items as
Pepto Bismol and glass bottles of Mexican Coca Cola sweetened with
sugar not corn syrup. The company recently hosted its own battle of
the bands.

One of the venture firms that rejected Palantir's overtures steered
the company to In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit venture-capital firm established
by the CIA a decade ago to tap innovation that could be used for
intelligence work. As Silicon Valley's venture funding dries up, In-Q-
Tel says it has seen a surge of requests from start-ups in the last
year or so, many of which now see the government as an alternate money
stream.

In-Q-Tel invested about $2 million in Palantir and provided a critical
entrei to the CIA and other agencies. For his first spy meeting in
2005, Mr. Karp shed his track suit for a sports coat. He arrived at an
agency -- he won't say which one -- and was immediately "freaked out"
by security officers guarding the building with guns. In a windowless,
code-locked room, he introduced himself to the first official he met:
"Hi, I'm Alex Karp," Mr. Karp said, offering his hand. No response. "I
didn't know you really don't ask their names," he says now.

Mr. Karp showed the group a prototype. The software was similar to
PayPal's fraud-detection system. But instead of identifying and
connecting cyber criminals, it focused on two hypothetical terror
suspects and followed their activities, including travel and money
transfers.

After the demo, he was peppered with skeptical questions: Is anyone at
your company cleared to work with classified information? Have you
ever worked with intelligence agencies? Do you have senior advisers
who have worked with intelligence agencies? Do you have a sales force
that is cleared to work with classified information? The answer every
time: no.

But the group was sufficiently intrigued by the demo, and In-Q-Tel
arranged for Palantir engineers to meet directly with intelligence
analysts, to help build a comprehensive search tool from scratch.

Every other week for about two years, the engineers returned to
Washington with a revised product, based on analysts' requests. The
approach won over a number of tech-savvy younger analysts who asked
their bosses to adopt the software.

Spy agencies like the CIA and military intelligence organizations have
hundreds of databases each, most of which aren't linked up. A single
database might contain reports from field agents or lists of known
terrorists or companies thought to be financing terrorism. To conduct
an investigation, analysts have to query individual databases
separately, then try to make sense of the data -- frequently with pen
and paper.

With many of the existing search tools, analysts also can't access
some files on terrorist suspects or other threats because a bit of
data in the file is classified at a level higher than they are allowed
to see. That is a problem, because making connections among new clues
and existing data is a key to foiling terrorist plots. Among the
missed opportunities cited by post-9/11 investigations were the
failure to see that five of the 19 hijackers used the same phone
number as ringleader Mohammad Atta to book their airline tickets, two
used the same frequent-flier number, and five used two common
addresses to make their reservations.

Palantir's software plugs these gaps by using a "tagging" technique
similar to that used by the search functions on most Web sites.
Palantir tags, or categorizes, every bit of data separately, whether
it be a first name, a last name or a phone number. That means if only
one piece of data in a file is classified top-secret, an analyst with
a lower level clearance can still see the rest of the data. It also
allows analysts to quickly tag information themselves as it arrives in
the form of field reports from spies overseas, and to see who else in
the agency is doing similar research so they can share their findings.

By connecting different databases, analysts can start making new
links. Someone could see, for example, that one terrorist suspect
flagged in one database has been living at the same address as the
cousin of another suspect whose information is in another database,
and that the two men flew to the same city after money was transferred
to a particular bank account.

Some analysts say Palantir's strength is helping analysts draw
inferences when confronted with an enormous amount of disparate data.
Palantir's tool is getting a thumbs-up from officers using it. "It is
much simpler to understand the results of inquiries, and provides more
in-depth database links then the current programs in use by the Army
today," says Captain James King, an Army intelligence officer.

A handful of agencies have adopted Palantir's software for specific
projects. The Pentagon recently used it to track patterns in roadside
bomb deployment. Officials say analysts were able to connect two
reports and conclude that garage-door openers were being used as
remote detonators and soldiers on the ground had a new device to look
for.

Analysts at West Point recently used Palantir's software to map
evidence of Syrian suicide-bombing networks buried within nearly 700
al Qaeda documents, including hundreds of personnel records that the
military recovered in Iraq. The analysts did an initial sweep of the
data without the Palantir tool and assembled a report on foreign
fighters in Iraq who were paying Syrian middlemen to send over suicide
bombers.

A second analysis with Palantir uncovered more details of the Syrian
networks, including profiles of their top coordinators, which led
analysts to conclude there wasn't one Syrian network, but many.
Analysts identified key facilitators, how much they charged people who
wanted to become suicide bombers, and where many of the fighters came
from. Fighters from Saudi Arabia, for example, paid the most -- $1,088
-- for the opportunity to become suicide bombers.

Such details helped local law enforcement break up some of the rings,
said one U.S. official familiar with the work. It also revealed the
extent to which al Qaeda was relying on mercenary smuggling networks,
rather than true believers, to get suicide bombers into Iraq.

In the past two years, Palantir's work in Washington has expanded from
eight pilot programs to more than 50 projects, executives say. The
Australian government is now a client, and the NSA is eyeing Palantir,
as is the U.K., current and former government officials say.

The company expects to turn a profit on its government work this year
-- it recently started working with financial companies, but says it
is too early to see any profits from that yet -- and for revenues to
reach $100 million within the next two years. Palantir also maintains
a pro-bono roster. It examined the cyber attacks on the central Asian
country of Georgia last year, and earlier this year helped Canadian
researchers uncover a cyberspying operation on the Dalai Lama. The
company is now working with a nonprofit investigative group in
Washington to resolve open questions in the 2002 murder of The Wall
Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.

In 2007, Mr. Karp hired his first intelligence-agency alum, David
Worn, to open a Washington office. Mr. Worn says he was among the
younger agency analysts who felt trapped in an outdated system.

As he builds up the East Coast office, which now employs 20 people,
Mr. Worn says that the company is still figuring out "how to live in
those two worlds" of Silicon Valley and Washington. One thing that
does seem to help: He and his colleagues make frequent trips to Palo
Alto to make sure they don't lose "the vibe of the Shire," the home of
the hobbits from Lord of the Rings.
