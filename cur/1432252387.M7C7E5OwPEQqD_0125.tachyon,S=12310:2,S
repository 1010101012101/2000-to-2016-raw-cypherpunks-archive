1.  I still find it funny that bozos like you assume that I
would vote for Gore.  But that's one thread that will probably
not lead anywhere with your type.

2.  I did not say that the right resolution for Palm Beach
County was to let them vote.  I simply stated that the goal is
of an election was to figure out what the electorate wanted,
not whether the electorate was good at using or abusing any
particular voting technique or process.  Tim and company (and
perhaps you) seemed to be quite absolutist in the notion that
whatever shit happens on election day, that's the way it is,
and no one ever get a chance to correct anything.  I don't
subscribe to that absolutist view.  I also did not say that
any flexibility or compromise resolution is only for Palm
County or any other Gore-leaning counties.  YOU and Tim and
the rest made that assumption (hence, probably item #1 above).

3.  Unlike many of you nuts, I do not subscribe to the notion
that violence is the next step (even if you claim that YOU
yourself wouldn't do it, but someone else will ... that's just
a lot of chicken shit BS).  If you want powder keg and ammo
and Ryder trucks, you are on a different planet than mine.  It
is not impossible for me to ever pick up a gun, but it is not
anywhere near top-10 on my list.  I may agree with you and Tim
on crypto, but I certain loath to meet either of you in person
on the streets.  Your anti-everything and get out of my hair
anger is just too much for my tastes.

Ern

You arrogant pinhead. It is you who have been whining that these
poor dimwitted voters in Palm Beach County must be allowed to vote
again; after all, "the voters should get what they want."

In any case, if they did hold a revote in Palm Beach County, what
happens after that?  What if Bush is still ahead and there are more
spoiled ballots?  What if Gore is ahead, but there are spoiled
ballots?  Or, is the objective to just allow them to re-vote again
and again until you and Gore get the outcome you're looking for?

And what about other states?  There were spoiled ballots in every
state and probably every precinct, and I have no doubt there was
some idiot confused by the ballot in every such case.  What is the
threshold at which we allow that state or precinct to vote over
again?

I'm beginning to think Tim is right:  The fuse on this powder keg
is lit.  The NAACP and its ilk, along with Gore partisans like you,
will never accept the outcome of this election.

And holding a re-vote is the beginning of the end.  Republicans
aren't likely to let the Dems get away with stealing it back.  In
the end, I guess Slick Willie will just have to declare himself
dictator-for-life and invoke martial law to "maintain order".

Better stock up on ammo, folks.  (Maybe Y2K was just a few months
late.)
