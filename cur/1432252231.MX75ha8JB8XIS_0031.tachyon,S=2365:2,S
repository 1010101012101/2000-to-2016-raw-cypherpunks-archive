A "last hurrah"? Someone needs to mount an assault on Tim's 
"Heavily Armored Compound (tm)" and rip that last piece of sanity from 
it's obscurity: it would make a stunningly good counter to his more recent 
meditations.  Besides, the assault could be televised live (simulstreamed 
over the intarwebs of course) on pay-per-view, with the proceeds going to 
Julian's suicidal persecution fund. A double bonus!  And here, I thought 
the lottery was unwinnable?
