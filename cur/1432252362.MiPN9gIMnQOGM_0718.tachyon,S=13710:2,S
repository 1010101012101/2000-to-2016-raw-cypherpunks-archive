OH OH OH I am soooo pissed off, I'm gonna flame
for the fire of it. 

 ---- 

One of the most stunningly vile attempts to attack an
individual occurred just a couple years ago, in 1995. 

The attack was itself a throwback to the old days of COINTELPRO, (Counter-
Intelligence Program), a massive unconstitutional FBI operation --- one of
it's most abusive ever --- to discredit the politically incorrect. 

*   Main Justice, by Jim McGee and Brian Duffy, 1996, ISBN 0-684-81135-9
*
*   And it was not just the FBI. The CIA, the Pentagon and the National
*   Security Agency [Military] had all turned their intelligence-gathering
*   capabilities on American citizens. 

And who was targeted? 

Qubilah Shabazz, second oldest daughter of Malcom X. 

*   Both Sides in Shabazz Case Say Tapes Prove Their Point
*   by Don Terry, The New York Times, April 1995
*
*   Ms. Shabazz was indicted on Jan 11 on nine counts of using the 
telephones
*   and travelling across state lines to hire a hit man to kill Mr. 
Farrakhan.
*   Eight of the counts involved taped telephone calls between Ms. Shabazz 
and
*   Mr. Fitzpatrick, a cocaine addict who faces a possible five-year prison
*   sentence in an unrelated drug case. [read: blackmailed]
*
*   Of the 40 recorded conversations, 38 were initiated by Mr. Fitzpatrick.
*   "Most of the conversations during these calls consisted primarily of
*   remarks by Mr. Fitzpatrick." said defense lawyer William M. Kunstler.
*   [Kunstler was a silvered haired angel even while still on Earth]
*
*   The Government had a statement initialed from Ms. Shabazz.
*
*       "I jokingly asked Fitzpatrick if he would kill Louis Farrakhan."
*
*   The statement was written by two FBI agents, who did not advise her of
*   her right to remain silent and have a lawyer present.
*
*   Federal officials in Washington and Minneapolis say Ms. Shabazz was
*   'obsessed' with killing Mr. Farrakhan, and they had enough on her to
*   put her away for 90 years.
*
*   Mr. Fitzpatrick prodded her: "I'm willing to do whatever you want me to
*   do, this feels righteous." Ms. Shabazz replied "I don't really know
*   what you're asking me." Mr. Fitzpatrick later told her "I'm just going
*   to proceed." 

Qubilah Shabazz was 4 when she saw her father die in a hail of bullets in
1965. She has been a trouble woman ever since. 

*   "...Shabazz...", The New York Times, June 8 1997 (front page)
*
*   In telephone conversations taped by Federal prosecutors, Ms. Shabazz
*   acknowledged she had psychological problems and had spent time at 
Bellevue. 

Her mother long asserted  Mr. Farrakhan played a role in the death of her
husband. Three members of Mr. Farrakhan's Nation of Islam were convicted. 


And just what was so extraordinarily vile about this case? 

Its purpose was to tear the black community apart. 

Mr. Farrakhan, no fool when it comes to manipulation, joined in her defense. 

And: Mr. Fitzpatrick had been a high school classmate of Qubilah Shabazz. 

In courting her lifetime of anger at Mr. Farrakhan, he also courted her. 

Love. 

"A vile and evil seducer," said William Kunstler to the court. 

He had proposed to her. 

*   "Always the Violence", The New York Times, by Bob Herbert, June 9 1997
*
*   Percy Sutton, a close friend of the Shabazz family for more then three
*   decades, said "It was so sad. This little kid [Qubilah's son Malcolm, 
10]
*   he ended up feeling guilty because he tried to persuade his mother to
*   marry this guy [Fitzpatrick told the son about his marriage proposal].
*   The guy told him 'We'll have our own house.' And Malcolm got all excited
*   and he said, 'I'll have my own bedroom?' And the guy said 'Yes, you 
will.'" 

It is safe to say this directly contributed to the burning and subsequent
death of Betty Shabazz.  A distraught, torn, ten-year-old suffering the
effects of this persecution. 

He had been taken away from his mother because of Fitzpatrick. 

NBC Newschannel 4 NY, on the death of Betty Shabazz: 

   "Police say the boy was upset he couldn't live with his mother." 


Kunstler forced the Government to drop its case...
*   "...Shabazz...", The New York Times, June 8 1997
*
*   Prosecutors dropped the case when it became
*   clear she had NOT committed to the crime. 

...and instead settle for her getting professional counseling. 

Mainly to recover from what Mr. Fitzpatrick and the FBI did to her. 

Mr. Fitzpatrick was paid $45,000 of our tax money for his services. 

Mr. Fitzpatrick is a cocaine addict. 

Remember, it's the 1990s now: same as it ever was.

Not malevolent?  Not malevolent? 

Tim, they targetted him solely to help them
with one of their surveillance programs. 

 


Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge. 

Persisting, a BATF informant persuaded Weaver, a DECORATED GREEN BERET
VETERAN of Vietnam with NO CRIMINAL RECORD, to sell him two shotguns,
but insisted that Weaver saw the barrels off one-quarter inch short of
the legal limit. 

Monitoring him, they knew Mr. Weaver needed money for his family. 

Why did the government target Mr. Weaver? 

Blackmail. 

One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on political organizations. 

They wanted to use him to infiltrate white supremacists groups for the
government. Or face prosecution. 

When Weaver refused, he was indicted on guns charges. He was sent two
conflicting court appearance dates. He became paranoid the Government
was out to get him, so he didn't show up. [He was eventually acquitted
of all charges except the original not showing up in court!] 

To justify a militaristic retaliation, BATF agents lied to the U.S.
attorney's office. BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record
and that he was a suspect in several bank robberies. 

Both charges were fabrications, even according to BATF Director John Magaw,
who admitted the accusations were "inexcusable" in testimony before 
Congress. 

THREE HUNDRED armed federal agents conducted a siege of the Weavers' 
mountain
home, first killing Randy Weaver's dog, then his son, then his wife. 

A law enforcement wilding. 

*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*   http://www.cato.org
*
*   The Marshals, wearing camouflage and carrying silenced machine guns, did
*   not identify themselves or their purpose, but they did shoot one of the
*   dogs. Sammy Weaver, fourteen-years-old, returned fire, and was promptly
*   shot by a Marshal.
*
*   Sammy turned and fled, with his nearly severed arm flopping as he ran.
*
*   Sammy was promptly shot dead in the back. 


An FBI sniper, Lon T. Horiuchi, testified he could hit a quarter at 200 
yards. 

*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*
*   An FBI psychological profile, prepared before the attack, called Vicki
*   Weaver the "dominant member" of the family, thus implying that if she
*   were "neutralized" everyone else might surrender. 

Horiuchi shot Weaver's wife in the head while she held her baby. 

Her head exploded. 

Her dead body was laid out on the cabin floor, covered with a blanket: 

[ Tim, this rates as 9 out of 10 on the malevolent scale: ] 

*   The CATO Institute, "Congressional Testimony", May 24, 1995
*
*   During the next week, "the FBI used megaphones to taunt the family.
*   'Good Morning Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for breakfast. What did
*   you have?'" asked the FBI agents in at least one exchange.
*
*   Weaver's daughter, Sarah, 16, said the baby, Elisheba, was often
*   crying for her mother's milk when the FBI messages were heard. 

The Justice Department's own report recommended criminal prosecution of
federal agents; the surviving Weavers won $3.1 million in civil damages
from U.S. taxpayers. 

Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
Louis Freeh, Director of the FBI, took no serious action. 

Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director. 

*   "Documents Were Destroyed as FBI Resisted Siege Investigation, Report 
Says"
*   By David Johnston, July 16, 1995
*
*   Mr. Pott's former subordinate Michael Kahoe admitted he destroyed key
*   documents on the Ruby Ridge assault. The Justice department reports
*   documents were destroyed and missing. "We are troubled by the apparent
*   lack of a system to preserve such critical records."
*
*   The Justice Department, in a March 18, 1993 memo stated, "the FBI's
*   intransigence appears to EMANATE from Larry Potts level OR ABOVE." 

Larry Potts was a buddy of Louis Freeh. Within the FBI, these special
people are called "FOL" - Friends of Louie. [NYT 5/11/97] 

Janet Reno (who had veto power over the promotion) testified what happened
at Ruby Ridge wasn't enough to cause her to veto the promotion, 
foreshadowing
her actions at Waco. 

After two months, controversy (as opposed to events) over Potts' role in
Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh to remove him from the position, to politically
cover his own tush. 

Potts and four other top FBI officials have been suspended while a federal
criminal probe investigates the destruction of documents related to the
incident. 

A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted. 

The Federal government subsequently named after a U.S. Marshal who was
killed, but who also shot Randy Weaver's son dead in the back: a new
Marshals training center. 

The Federal government's behavior in the incident can only be described as
sickening: targeting a citizen (a veteran, no less) who committed no crime
AND EVEN HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD (but had politically incorrect views) for
blackmail, then acting vengefully when he wouldn't act as their rat fink. 

Shoot-to-kill. Sniper team.  Military fatigues. 

A terrorizing organization: how else to explain the cruel cruel taunting. 

A terrorist organization by virtue of shoot-to-kill orders.

Tim, know of anyone who would call
themselves a "crypto anarchist"? 

Someone the government considered dangerous and
was actively [yea SirCam intelligence] targeted
by this latest government surveillance program
of politically incorrect citizens? 

A U.S. government surveillance program with marching
orders to squash citizens and their public debate.
