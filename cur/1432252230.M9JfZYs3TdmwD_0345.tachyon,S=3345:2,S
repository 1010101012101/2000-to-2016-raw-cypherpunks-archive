Um. Interesting point. Come to think of it, it might actually make a lot 
more sense to be able to run those risk models offline. That way, you can 
always refine them later. Better safe than sorry. Given Variola's little 
factoid, even if they aren't grabbing everything now, they probably will 
soon.

I'd also point out that imaging technology (eg, CCDs) are moving like a bat 
out of hell, though I'm not sure of the relevance vz Cypherpunks. Riffing a 
bit...with effectively inifinte storage capacity and high-density imaging 
arrays, it might be possible for a database search to include parameters 
such as "brown eyes"..."1mm zit pockmark on left cheek", and then a search 
is run on all Metrocard terminals through all city subway's security cameras 
in the world.

Anyone see Wim Wender's "The End of the World"? BOUNTY BEAR!
