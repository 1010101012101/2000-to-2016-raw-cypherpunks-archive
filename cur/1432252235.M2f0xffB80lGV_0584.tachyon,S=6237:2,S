Subject: DCSB Call for Speakers

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The Program Committee of the Digital Commerce Society invites any
member of the above mailing lists to submit their proposal for a
luncheon talk to the Society.

Speakers can be any *principal* in any field of digital commerce.
That means anyone who is doing interesting research or development
in, or who is making significant market innovation in, the
technology, finance, economics, law, or policy of commerce on the
global public internetwork.

The Committee tends to consider the person giving the talk first, and
then gives the speaker lots of discretion in the content of their
talk -- as long as it pertains to DCSB's charter to promote
innovation in internet commerce.


The Society's meetings are held on the first Tuesday of the month at
the Downtown Branch of the Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal
Street, Thirty-Eighth Floor, in Boston, from 12 to 2 in the
afternoon.

Unfortunately, the Society can not remunerate a speaker for any fees
or expenses other than, obviously, the speaker's lunch, and basic
overhead projection equipment. There is dial-up internet access for
the meeting room.

If you, or anyone you know, are interested in speaking to the
society, please send, via email, a proposal, consisting of a single
paragraph on the speaker, and a single paragraph on the proposed
talk, to Robert Hettinga <mailto: rah@shipwright.com>, the chairman
of the DCSB Program Committee, and the Society's Moderator.

A list of previous speakers can be obtained with the following URL
<mailto:majordomo@reservoir.com?body=info%20dcsb>, or, if your
mailreader/browser doesn't support mailtos,

send

info dcsb

in the *body* of a message to majordomo@reservoir.com .

Thank you for considering DCSB in your speaking plans, and, if you
have any questions on your submission, please contact me directly.

Cordially,
Robert A. Hettinga
Moderator and Program Committee Chair,
The Digital Commerce Society of Boston
