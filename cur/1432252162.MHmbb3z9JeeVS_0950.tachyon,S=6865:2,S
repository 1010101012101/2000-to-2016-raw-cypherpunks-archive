INSIGHT NEWS ALERT!

A new issue of Insight on the News is now online

http://www.insightmag.com

...............................................

Folks, in case you missed it, John Berlau&#8217;s blockbuster on how anti-
tobacco lawyers are now targeting fast food is still posted 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/256297.html. And Hans Nichols sweeps the dirt on 
the Ninth Circuit Court out from under the carpet, and explains how it could 
have done the unthinkable---rule the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/256762.html. I know you&#8217;ll enjoy them! OK, 
until next time, from the Bunker, I&#8217;m your newsman in Washington.

...............................................

ONE NATION, UNDER THE NINTH CIRCUIT

Hans Nichols says they ruled the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional. Read 
more about this "Rogue Court."

...............................................

SUPPLYING TERRORISTS THE &#8216;OXYGEN OF PUBLICITY&#8217;

Jamie Dettmer opines that combating terrorism is a desperate undertaking for any 
democratic government. Fight with merely military might and the struggle can be 
lost &#8212; as the Reagan administration belatedly learned in Central America 
in the 1980s and the Russians have found in Chechnya.

...............................................

A BURNING ISSUE

Phil Magers writes that Arizona and Colorado burn the wildland fire management 
debate rages.

========================================



UNLIKE CLINTON, BUSH IS MEETING THE THREAT OF TERRORISM

Ralph Reiland writes that like three blind mice, House Majority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Democratic political strategist James 
Carville are running around saying they want their eyes opened as to what's 
going on in this country about terrorism.

http://www.insightmag.com/news/256332.html

...............................................

SYMPOSIUM---PRO & CON

Q: Has the White House ignored human rights in the name of national security? 
http://www.insightmag.com/news/256338.html

WILLIAM SCHULZ SAYS: YES: The administration has given itself and its coalition 
partners a 'pass' on human-rights violations.

http://www.insightmag.com/news/256339.html

ROBERT L. MAGINNIS SAYS: NO: It is not treating suspected terrorists inhumanely 
nor trampling on the civil rights of citizens.

America's global war on terrorism significantly will advance human rights 
because it will free people from repression and the threat of terrorism. Until 
the war is over, however, expect temporary sacrifices for more security. Every 
soldier facing the enemy understands this unavoidable trade-off.

..............................................

BIZARRE RULING&#8212;NO REGULATION NEEDED

Sean Paige tells us, in what well could be a first, a leading government agency 
with responsibility for public safety has recommended against heaping yet 
another safety mandate on the mountain of regulations already in place to ensure 
that accidents don't happen.
