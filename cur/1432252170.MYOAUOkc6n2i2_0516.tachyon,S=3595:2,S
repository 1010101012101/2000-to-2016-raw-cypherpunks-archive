"It dis-crim-nated 'gainst da homeys."

Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are calling rallies to get certain 
results "investigated." Marches are planned. And Jeb Bush has flown 
back to Florida to supervise the recount.

Yep, I think that whatever result is finally reported, the 
recriminations and charges of election fraud will continue.

We'll have another president addressed as "Your Fraudulency."

Sounds good to me.
