That's the traditional Agincourt interpretation.  More modern ones (backed up
by actual tests with arrows of the time against armour, in which the
relatively soft metal of the arrows was rather ineffective against the armour)
tend to favour the muddy ground trapping men and horses, lack of room to
manoeuver/compression effects, and arrows killing horses out from under the
knights, at which point see the muddy ground section.  Obviously the machine-
gun effect of the arrows was going to cause a number of minor injuries, and
would be lethal to unarmoured troops, but they weren't quite the wonder-weapon
they're made out to be.

(There were other problems as well, e.g. the unusually high death toll and
 removal of "ancient aristocratic lineages" was caused by English commoners
 who weren't aware of the tradition of capturing opposing nobles and having
 them ransomed back, rather than hacking them to pieces on the spot.  Again,
 arrows didn't have much to do with the loss of so many nobles).
