Ah, apologies. I was unclear. I was refering to the perspective of a=20=

community, not the individual (as has Troy, I believe). As in: anonymit=
y poses=20
significant problems for any community that tries to honour it.

For example anonymous remailer trolls and flames on this list are a con=
crete=20
"cost" of the fact that the list accepts anonymous remailers.

Pseudonymity (along with some reputation-based mechanisms) helps to all=
eviate=20
that, to some extent, while retaining some of the most important advant=
ages of=20
personal anonymity.

By the way, I'm perfectly okay with the cost-benefit trade-off we're ma=
king on=20
this list with anonymous remailers, please do not treat the above as a=20=

suggestion (pardon! idea ;) ) to remove that option.

Indeed.

Seems legit, thanks.
