   OpenSSL version 0.9.8a and 0.9.7h released
   ==========================================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   http://www.openssl.org/

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 0.9.8a of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a security and bugfix release and incorporates
   changes and bugfixes to the toolkit.  For a complete list of
   changes, please see http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES.

   We also release 0.9.7h, which contains the same security bugfix as
   0.9.8a and a few small bugfixes compared to 0.9.7g.

   These updates contain a fix for CAN-2005-2969, a potential SSL 2.0
   rollback reported by Yutaka Oiwa. For more details of the security
   issue being fixed in this release please see
   http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20051011.txt

   We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8a to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 0.9.8a is available for
   download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you
   can find the various FTP mirrors under
   http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html):

     * http://www.openssl.org/source/
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

   For those who want or have to stay with the 0.9.7 series of
   OpenSSL, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.7h
   as soon as possible.  It's available in the same location as
   0.9.8a.

   The distribution file names are:

     * openssl-0.9.8a.tar.gz
       MD5 checksum: 1d16c727c10185e4d694f87f5e424ee1
       SHA1 checksum: 2aaba0f728179370fb3e86b43209205bc6c06a3a

     * openssl-0.9.7h.tar.gz
       MD5 checksum: 8dc90a113eb8925795071fbe52b2932c
       SHA1 checksum: 9fe535fce89af967b29c4727dedd25f2b4cc2f0d

   The checksums were calculated using the following commands:

    openssl md5 openssl-0.9.*.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 openssl-0.9.*.tar.gz

   Yours,

   The OpenSSL Project Team...
