alt.anonymous.messages provides a channel for people who wish
to receive messages without themselves being identified.

If I want to receive a message without providing and email
address that can be traced, I ask the recipient to post in in
the newsgroups such as alt.anonymous.messages.

For obvious reasons people who read alt.anonymous.messages, or
think they might need to read it in the future, download the
newsgroup in its entireity.
