Coderpunks-request@toad.com will get you to a quiet list
with a high signal-to-noise ratio.  It's not dead,
but it's usually not very busy, since nobody codes any more :-)
Cryptography-request@c2.net will get you to Perry's 
probably-still-moderated list, which has more traffic,
and does more cryptography discussion than coderpunks,
plus occasional relevant political or business news.
