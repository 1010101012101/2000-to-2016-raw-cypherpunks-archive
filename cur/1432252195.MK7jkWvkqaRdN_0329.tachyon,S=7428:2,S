Feds bPingedb Sprint GPS Data 8 Million Times Over a Year

* By Kim Zetter Email Author * December 1, 2009  | * 5:42 pm  | * Categories:
Surveillance

Sprint Nextel provided law enforcement agencies with customer location data
more than 8 million times between September 2008 and October 2009, according
to a company manager who disclosed the statistic at a non-public interception
and wiretapping conference in October.

The manager also revealed the existence of a previously undisclosed web
portal that Sprint provides law enforcement to conduct automated bpingsb to
track users. Through the website, authorized agents can type in a mobile
phone number and obtain global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the
phone.

The revelations, uncovered by blogger and privacy activist Christopher
Soghoian, have spawned questions about the number of Sprint customers who
have been under surveillance, as well as the legal process agents followed to
obtain such data.

But a Sprint Nextel spokesman said that Soghoian, who recorded the Sprint
managerbs statements at the closed conference, misunderstood what the figure
represents. The number of customers whose GPS data was provided to local,
state and federal law enforcement agencies was much less than 8 million, as
was the total number of individual requests for data.

The spokesman wouldnbt disclose how many of Sprintbs 48 million customers had
their GPS data shared, or indicate the number of unique surveillance requests
from law enforcement. But he said that a single surveillance order against a
lone target could generate thousands of GPS bpingsb to the cell phone, as the
police track the subjectbs movements over the course of days or weeks. That,
Sprint claims, is the source of the 8 million figure: itbs the cummulative
number of times Sprint cell phones covertly reported their location to law
enforcement over the year.

The spokesman also said that law enforcement agents have to obtain a court
order for the data, except in special emergency circumstances.

The information about the data requests and portal comes from Paul Taylor,
manager of Sprintbs Electronic Surveillance Team. He made the revelations at
the Intelligent Support Systems (ISS) conference, a surveillance industry
gathering for law enforcement and intelligence agencies and the companies
that provide them with the technologies and capabilities to conduct
surveillance.

The conference is closed to press, but Soghoian, who is a graduate student at
Indiana University, obtained entry and recorded a couple of panel sessions,
which he posted on his blog. In one of the recordings, Taylor is heard saying
that the automated system was rolled out a year ago and that in 13 months it
had processed more than 8 million requests for GPS data from law enforcement.

bWe turned it on the web interface for law enforcement about one year ago
last month, and we just passed 8 million requests,b Taylor is heard saying.
bSo there is no way on earth my team could have handled 8 million requests
from law enforcement, just for GPS alone. So the tool has just really caught
on fire with law enforcement. They also love that it is extremely inexpensive
to operate and easy.b

Soghoian concluded on his blog that the quote provided proof that blocation
requests easily outnumber wiretaps, and b& likely outnumber all other forms of
surveillance request too.b


He cites a telecom attorney named Al Gidari who claimed at a talk last year
that each of the major wireless carriers received about 100 requests a week
for customer-location data. At 100 requests a week for each of the top four
wireless carriers, the total should be around 20,000 requests a year.

bI now have proof that he significantly underestimated the number of requests
by several orders of magnitude,b Soghoian writes.

But Sprint spokesman John Taylor (who is not related to Paul Taylor) says
Soghoian had bgrossly misrepresentedb the 8 million figure, which doesnbt
refer to unique requests or to individual customers, but to the total number
of bpingsb made on every number for the duration of a law enforcement
request.

bThe figure represents the number of individual bpings for specific location
information, made to the Sprint network as part of a series of law
enforcement investigations and public safety assistance requests during the
past year,b said spokesman Taylor. bItbs critical to note that a single case
or investigation may generate thousands of individual pings to the network as
the law enforcement or public safety agency attempts to track or locate an
individual.b

There are four circumstances under which law enforcement agents can use the
Sprint website and obtain GPS data: 1) under the authority of a court order;
2) to track the location of a customer who has made a 911 call; 3) in an
emergency situation, such as tracking someone lost in the wilderness or
trying to locate an abducted child or hostage; 4) with a customerbs consent.

In the case of court orders, Taylor said agents are required to provide
Sprint with the order, after which the company provisions the law enforcement
account to allow an agency to track the targeted phone number. Court orders
cover a 60-day period, and agents can do automated pings to obtain real-time
GPS data every three minutes throughout that 60-day period. Taylor says this
accounts for the 8 million figure.

bIf you can access the info every three minutes over 60 days, that adds up
pretty quickly,b he told Threat Level.

He added that the GPS data includes only latitude and longitude and the date
and time of the ping.

The automated system was set up so that law enforcement agents wouldnbt have
to contact Sprintbs electronic surveillance team each time they wanted to
ping a phone number throughout the 60 days of a court order. Agents still
have to obtain a subpoena to get historic call detail records, such as phone
numbers called, the date, time and duration of calls and the cell site and
sector from which the calls were made.
