Say a public library implements a policy of replying positively to all such 
inquiries, that is, if asked by a patron the db admin will tell them when 
their account is free of such inquiries.  If a request does come in then 
the db admin can either: fail to respond (monitoring implied), tell them 
they are being monitored (violating the law) or lie and say they are not 
even if they are.  So, can the Feds require a librarian to lie to a 
customer who inquires whether their library usage is being monitored?
