Hello, earth to Tim. 
 (1) You can send anonymous mail by sending it through a remailer, but 
 (2) The remailers themselves are not anonymous.
 (3) If the remailers *were* anonymous, they could not operate 
      because then the users would not know where to send their mails.
 
   As long as the remailers themselves are traceable, make no mistake: 
they exist only because the lions have not yet passed a law against them.

   You cannot have encryption technologies advancing and leaving the law 
behind, so long as any vital part of the infrastructure you need is 
traceable and pulpable by the law.
