The service rendered was trade volume. It seemed to do that quite well.

I'd argue that centralized systems provide, on averge, a larger anonymity
set and privacy in the majority of cases than decentralized ones. In particular
exchanges that everyone believes are 'incompetent' are a wonderful place to
get a lot of cheap plausible deniability by making everyone else that uses 
it pay for it when the house of cards falls down.
