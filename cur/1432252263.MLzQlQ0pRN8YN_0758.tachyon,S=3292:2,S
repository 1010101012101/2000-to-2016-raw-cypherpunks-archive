Yes, and until the mixmaster nodes start to *charge* anonymous digital 
gold tokens for routing, and lets nodes gets into competition with each 
other to create a robotic free market, the Internet will be a baby eaten 
alive by Mighty Big Brother and mixmaster will be overrun by the tragedy 
of the commons...

Big Fat Hint: The above (pay for traffic nodes) will result in spam free 
untraceable email, robotic economically viable self extending wireless 
networks, Voip thats really secure and high quality, DDoS proof 
Internet, private p2p markets for commodities, stocks etc... etc. Now, 
if there are investors out there... speak up.

The alternative Internet provided "for free" is the biggest boon to big 
government, ever! (well, almost... after fiat money). "Capitalist" 
$$investors are about to be eaten alive by fiat money that is not theirs 
which they soon cannot move... The clampdown will be, heh, SWIFT (sic).

I spoke about this at HOPE6, I don't know if more than a couple of 
people in the audience even got an inkling of what the hell I was 
talking about. If they did, and are busy producing code, more power to them.

Best regards,
