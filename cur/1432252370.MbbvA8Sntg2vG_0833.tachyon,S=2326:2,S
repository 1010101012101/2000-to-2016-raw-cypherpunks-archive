Lots of problems are only computable in exponential time,
or at least superpolynomial time.
The closest we'd get to your suggestion is that
P might equal NP, or (for crypto) factoring might be in P.

Sufficiently large polynomials are easier in theory than in practice -
Karmarkar's polynomial solution to Linear Programming was
something like N**12 or L*N**6 where L was a very large number.

We wouldn't have to go back to OTP, just symmetric-key keyservers
which people used before public-key became well-known.

While the public-key algorithms are based on math problems like
factoring or discrete log, most of the symmetric-key algorithms
are based on intractable ugliness, and on doing enough analysis
to find out which kinds of ugliness and bit-twiddling are really
intractable and which can be cracked.

If the polynomial computability comes from quantum computers,
some of the symmetric stuff seems to reduce from 2**N time to 2**(N/2) time,
so we might need to upgrade from 3DES to 5DES or 7DES, but it's not big deal.
