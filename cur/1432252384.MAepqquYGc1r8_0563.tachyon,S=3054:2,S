I'm really curious to see who goes into business selling full-bore
anonymous IP on our codebase.  If anyone really wants to, we'll be
happy to spend a day or two telling you about all our in-progress
traffic analysis results, so you don't need to re-do that work.  (It
will all be published as it becomes ready for publication, but if
someone really wants to pursue this business, we'll show you what
we've done.)
