Tsk. Don't you know that you're with us or you're with the terrorists? If
you're not careful the Justice Department will decide that you are a
"person of interest" and whisk you off to an undisclosed location until
the war on terror is over with a stopover in Saudi or Egypt for torture.

A lifetime ago Franklin Roosevelt said "The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself." Today the government is peddling fear itself.
