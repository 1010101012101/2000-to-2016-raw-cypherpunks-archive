Time to start a new ad campaign:

"You don't run around naked in public do you?  Neither should your
packets!  Encrypt your traffic - it's just common sense!"

"Your internet packets are naked! Clothe them with IPSEC" 

"Don't help the terrorists to your financial info - encrypt!"

"You wouldn't want Osama reading your email, would you?  Encrypt"


Then when everything's encrypted, such laws can be challenged.
