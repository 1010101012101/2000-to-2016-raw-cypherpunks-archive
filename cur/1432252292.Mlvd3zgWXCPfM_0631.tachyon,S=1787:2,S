As far as I know, these news stories can be tracked back to a
particular USA Today story.  There's also been a bunch of stories how
a covert channel in TCP could be used by terrorists to hide their
communication.

Unfortunately, when such stories are retold for the second time, the
"could be used" part tends to change to "is used". 8-(
