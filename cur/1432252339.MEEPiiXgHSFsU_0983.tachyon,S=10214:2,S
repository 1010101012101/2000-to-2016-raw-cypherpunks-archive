Alta Vista, as always is richer if not faster than Googol. The first hit
on Alta Vista is to an Italian translation of TS Eliot's Little Gidding
(wa wonderful poem :-)

There are some computer resellers in Kiev: http://www.noos.kiev.ua/

There are links suggested to  http://www.norva.navy.mil/navosh/ which is
some sort of training college  ("industrial hygiene"is one of the
courses) - perhaps it is to do with the COMSC (NOOS) Peter already
mentioned at  http://www.vnh.org/Admin/Afloat/Afloat03.html  - which is
I guess back to the original sealift idea.

Or they could be clammies - the Prophet Elron explained the origins of
the word "Dianetics" as "Dia - through, noos - mind".

http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/~aha/research/old/iccbr-95-summary.txt has a
reference to "Cases as feature values in the NOOS language" - unlikely
toi be relevant.

But True Conspiracy theorists  will want to connect it to "Summer Noos"
on Blackhawk Helicopters at:
http://www.nvctc.commnet.edu/conncap/page2.htm
Obviously a paramilitary training camp designed to indoctrinate American
Youth into the statist grasp of the enforcers of the New World Order.

My guess is the Nasda lot. They seem to be into GIS & remote sensing &
also work with Unesco & some UK universities, so I guess they could turn
up more or less anywhere - though in that case why the heavies?  Danes
are usually a lot less hassled by tourists wandering around uninvited
than, say Russians. Or even Americans.

So that was what the FOIA was for - swamping the activists in a sea of
irrelevant data.
