Most of the Boston Red Sox team look as if they have just
come from a terrorist training camp for blind, handless barbers, 
decked-out in ill-fitting sports gear, staring wild-eyed at 
RPGs being fired at their heads and nuts, swinging clubs futilely 
at the inerrant missiles, their ass-wipe paws swollen into giant 
shit-covered patties, muttering homicidal jihads against devil-bred 
yankees.
