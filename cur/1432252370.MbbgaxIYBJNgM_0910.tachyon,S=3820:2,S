What happens if you're knocked up (in the American sense) and get
vaccinated?  Some vaccines are very contraindicated in that condition.
How about the immunocompromised, elderly, young?  The .mil pop is very
different from the general one.  

As for liability/paranoia issues, just look at the autistism folks who 
blame some vaccine instead of genes (because autism becomes noticable 
around the time of that vaccine, and the genetic evidence is only recently
being discovered).

Maybe that's not so important since you can't sue your gov't.
