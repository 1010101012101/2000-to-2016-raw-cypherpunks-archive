"Arthur Andersen's office in Vilnius has reportedly
fallen victim to electronic surveillance operations.  
Following the discovery of suspicious equiptment in 
the office, Andersen called on the Lithuanian authorities 
to open an investigation into what it views as a case of 
economic espionage.  Another firm highly active in the region, 
J. Kabasinka & Partners, is said to have also been subjected to similar
surveillance"

Intelligence Newsletter 12 Oct 2000 p3 indigo-net.com [no affil.]

Also a notes that FBI now training NIPC in Carnivore use.  "Previously
