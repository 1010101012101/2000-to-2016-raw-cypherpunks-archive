Just a historical anecdote.  Back in the old days, software
could be linked to the unique ID on Sun motherboards.  To move
software to a new machine, you called and maybe faxed something
signed (with a pen) to the effect that you weren't ripping them off.

This was before the software-based floating licenses became 
popular.
