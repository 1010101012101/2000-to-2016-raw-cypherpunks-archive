How can you find out who's operating the exit nodes, unless you
know the operators personally? The system is designed to
tolerate a certain fraction of Mallory operators.

IIRC, the client builds the circuits.

Tapping and traffic analysis upstream of existing nodes are far
less instrusive.

What I'm wondering is whether the claimed attack is due to a
design fault, or just by throwing resources at it. If it's a design
issue, it can be fixed. If it's a brute force approach, it shows
how much they're willing to deploy on very little incentive.
If it's a canard, they're trying to stall and destabilize.

Knowing which would be useful.
