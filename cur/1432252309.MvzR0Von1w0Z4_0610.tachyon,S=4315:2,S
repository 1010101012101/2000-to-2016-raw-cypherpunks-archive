There are numerous makes of weapons that do not require tools to change the
barrel. Glock pistol barrels can be changed in about 20 seconds with no
tools, Desert Eagle pistol barrels in about 5 seconds, and Winchester 1300
shotgun barrels in about 30 seconds. If you want to sanitize a non-removable
barrel, fire-lap it. This involves firing bullets embedded with successively
finer abrasive grits down the barrel, which also increases accuracy and
reduces fouling. Bead blasting, careful sanding, or replacement of the
firing pin ejector, and extractor will sanitize marks made on the cartridge
case, or better yet, attach a bag to either the gun or your firing hand to
catch ejected empties before they get left behind as evidence.

Maybe not, but the tools used to remove the barrel/s can be traced by teeth
marks and other metal to metal contact.
