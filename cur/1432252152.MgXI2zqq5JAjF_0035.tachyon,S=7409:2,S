<font color=red>I could use a <font color=blue>FREE $20,000 loan,</font> could you ??</font><BR>
<BR>
<font color=blue>Follow the very simple instructions below and in<BR>
a few days you should have around $20,000<BR>
as the response rate will be HUGE due to the tiny<BR>
investment required and the MASSIVE<BR>
potential. We believe the return rate is<BR>
currently as good as 70% !</font><BR>
<BR>
You could do this as often as you liked, I'll<BR>
explain how simple it is.<BR>
<BR>
Log into your paypal account, and send $10 dollars to:<BR>
<BR>
NEXT DUE : :- &nbsp;&nbsp;shayneman@cybertime.net<BR>
<BR>
Who is currently the next person in line. <BR>
Select:<BR>
"service" as payment type and put "Donated"<BR>
in the subject line.<BR>
<BR>
You can open a paypal account (AND get a $5 bonus<BR>
for doing it !) at<BR>
https://www.paypal.com/affil/pal=J8YGGHLDT7H2W<BR>
<BR>
Next, move this address:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PENDING &nbsp;1:- &nbsp;&nbsp;cherishangel1@hotmail.com<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up into the "NEXT DUE" slot Now Move This Address:<BR>
<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PENDING 2:- &nbsp;lm88013@aol.com<BR>
<BR>
To "PENDING 1" Slot and put your own<BR>
e-mail address into the "PENDING 2" slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now send the mail to as many prospects as you<BR>
possibly can. Having done this once,<BR>
you'll see how easy it is. <BR>
<BR>
ONLY SEND money to the first<BR>
person on the list. And DON'T cheat ! If Your Attempt<br> 
to move your Name Up To The Top it will not work.<br> 
You may get a few dollars But You will not get<br> 
anywhere near as much as is possible when the rules<br> 
are followed, it also cheats others out of their due money.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=red>Now here is a great Tip: &nbsp;send through bulk email <br>
services or Paid  To Read Email Lists! Many paid to read <br>
email lists allow free member ads. <BR>
<BR>
You can find some great deals of one time mailings at <br>
bulk mail services. And you can find Some pretty large <br>
Opt-In mailing lists that allow you to send email for <br>
free every seven days. These are lists that you do <br>
not have to send yourself. They are sent through the<br>
List providers server. They are not illegal and not <br>
considered SPAM as all have opted/agreed to recieve emails. </font><BR>
<BR>
<font color=blue>If you find enough of them to send to You could possibly<br> 
send out to over 30,000 prospects! and let's say you get <br>
a low 2% response rate from those 30,000. That's still a <br>
heck of alot more then what you put into it! Then those <br>
2% that responded send out another 30,000 with your name <br>
in number 2 and they get a 2% response, then those 2% <br>
send out another 30,000 emails with only 2% response! <br>
That's 90,0000 emails sent to prospects by the time you <br>
are in 1st place!</font><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 3 names in your branch you can expect<BR>
it to happen VERY quickly !<BR>
but you KNOW you will<BR>
get your 10 dollars back !!<BR>
<BR>
That's only ONE reply from around 25000 with your<BR>
name in "NEXT DUE", isn't it ?<BR>
<BR>
What would happen if you mailed 35,000 prospects ?<BR>
<BR>
You can do this again, and again, and<BR>
again........<BR>
<BR>
AGAIN, DO NOT CHEAT. IF YOUR "BRANCH" is BROKEN<BR>
YOU WONT<BR>
GET ANYTHING NEAR THE RETURN !!<BR>
<BR>
This is not a chain letter. You can refer to<BR>
title 18, Section 1302 of the<BR>
Postal and Lottery Code.<BR>
