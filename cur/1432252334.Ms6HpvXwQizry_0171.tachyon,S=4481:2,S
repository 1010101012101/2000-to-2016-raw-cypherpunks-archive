California county plans to
                  fingerprint homeless

                  October 10, 2000
                  Web posted at: 9:32 AM EDT (1332 GMT)

                  RIVERSIDE, California (AP) -- County officials are planning
                  a voluntary fingerprint program for the homeless as part of an
                  effort they say will provide better services. 

                  "This is strictly for the purpose of identifying an individual so
                  we can track their services more effectively and better plan
                  for their needs," Kevin Gaines, spokesman for the Riverside
                  Countys Department of Public Social Services, said Monday. 

                  But some of the homeless and their advocates say the move is
                  too intrusive. 

                  "Im not hiding anything but I think its just getting into my
                  business a little bit," Gary Cervantes said. "It feels a little bit
                  like they are tagging an animal." 

                  Attorney Dan Tokaji of the American Civil Liberties Union
                  said homeless people would be intimidated into taking part in
                  the program. 

                  "When you have someone in position of power requesting
                  information from a needy person, there is inherent coercion,"
                  he said. 

                  Officials say fingerprinting will provide a more reliable count
                  of the homeless and access to more federal grants to help
                  them. They are planning to visit shelters beginning next month.

                  Some transients see the benefits of the program. 

                  Angel Monroy recalled that doctors had troubled identifying
                  him after he lapsed into a coma in 1992. 

                  "When you live on the streets anything could happen where
                  you would need to be identified," he said.
