~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MARKET ANALYSIS & SUMMARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a recent Louis Rukeyser’s Wall $treet Week news article, he
writes about three pivotal industries that lie squarely in the
path of tens of millions of increasingly affluent customers. The
next wave of leading industries and players will be healthcare,
financial-services, and technology stocks... companies emerging
as the new Pfizer’s, Merrill Lynches, and Microsoft’s of the
world. He went on to say: Financial services have come a long way
since the days of the haughty loan officer, arrogant stockbrokers
and dour bankers in pinstriped suits. Years of economic growth,
and unprecedented bull market and democratization of all aspects
of finance have reversed Wall Street’s traditional balance of
power. 

For the first time in history, banks, insurance companies and
brokerages are merging into one-stop financial shops. It is the
intent of the management team of EMB to capitalize on the present
market conditions surrounding financial-services, using new
technology, and with these changes hopefully the company could
show increased revenues and profits for the benefit of the
shareholders, which is priority number one for the new
management of EMB Corp..
