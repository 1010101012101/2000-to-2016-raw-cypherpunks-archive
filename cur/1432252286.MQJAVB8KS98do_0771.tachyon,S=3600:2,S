You are apparently simply unaware of the real size and terrain of China. 
There were villages in remote parts of China that were unaware of Mao's 
death into the early 1980s. Travel around in China for a while and you'll 
get the picture. Just to give you an idea, short of renting out a 
helicopter, there are plenty of parts of China that are more than a week 
away from even me, living here in NYC.

No, as usual you seem to think that because I disagree with the simplicity 
of your "grid" that I must believe the opposite. Let's put it this way: The 
Qin was absolutely despotic in areas that could be guessed at ("Burn Books 
Kill Scholars"), as well as quite despotic in areas that would seem 
pointless now (like bell volumes, because bells were also measurements for 
grain). They also completely didn't care about other things that you would 
think a despot would really care about.

A thing to think about was that Qin Shr Huang seemed to truly believe that 
everything he did was necessary for the unification of China (which he 
accomplished). YOU (not me) might argue that by unifying a large portion of 
central China he actually prevented a lot more deaths due to "Barbarian" 
incursion by "Unfree and uncivilized" Muslims...OOPS--Did I say that? I mean 
"Unfree and backward people that should be killed".
