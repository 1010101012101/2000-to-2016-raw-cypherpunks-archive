Turns out it's really just a park bench with four phone lines
for laptop users to plug in modems, and nobody'd thought to
block long distance or international calls.
After they'd called their local council, they called
Bill Gates's secretary, but didn't reach Mr. Bill himself.

Bad start for internet bench

The teenagers took advantage of the free service

Two teenagers discovered the world's first internet bench could be used to
make free international telephone calls.
The cyber-seat, which is based in a public park in Suffolk, UK, went online
on Monday.
Neil Woodman and Dan Sanderson, both 17, took a normal telephone handset
along to the bench, which was created by Microsoft's MSN service in
partnership with the local council.
The pair cheekily phoned St Edmondsbury Council to warn them of the problem
and then tried to call Microsoft boss, Bill Gates.
