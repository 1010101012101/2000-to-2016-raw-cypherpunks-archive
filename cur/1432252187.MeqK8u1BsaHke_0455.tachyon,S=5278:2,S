No. You are wrong. The world has changed forever. Bitcoin was 
a technological djinni like the nuke. Now that it has been loosed in the 
world. All the kings horses and all the kings men cannot get bitcoin back 
into the bottle again. But you are also right: the king is forced into the 
game now so he is both vulnerable and dangerous.

Yeah. That Steve Jobs guy had lots of gold. Too bad he didn't make any 
rules against cancer with all that gold. What's with this rant 
anyway?   Did you lose money? Did you get robbed while slumming in the 
hood? I just don't understand how you could be upset that spending money 
made you more wealthy friends than it did poor friends. My problem is the 
exact opposite. I would be happy to be your poor friend if that's all you 
want. Or is this perhaps you declaring your side in the class war or 
something?

There are *lots* of reason why people are what they are. A lot of your 
angst stems from thinking too *much*. About what was and what could be 
rather than opening yourself up to the present moment in all its glory. 
Lighten up. Enjoy your new found wealth.
