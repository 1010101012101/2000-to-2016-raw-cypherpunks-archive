I'm experimenting with a new sendmail milter.
(the SMTP HELO arg needs to be reasonably valid in order to pass).
I've now set it to not reject mail to majordomo at
lne.com.  The blocklist thing is still
in effect, but if you're bounced by that
you get a URL in the bounce message
that you can use to get it fixed.
