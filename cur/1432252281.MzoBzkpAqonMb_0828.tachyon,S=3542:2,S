right. it should be icann.int instead of icann.org - while the UN has
it's seat in new york, it can at least keep a front of not being a long
arm of the US government.

incidently - all the DNS crazyness may lead to a "new regionalism". I
know for a fact that the next domains I register will be .de domains,
not .net or .org as my current ones all are. actually, I plan to operate
a (small but) worldwide business on a .de domain. primary reason: not to
get fucked over by some <censored> who decides on a windy morning that
cyberspace is a state of the USofAssholes.
