>By the way, so far my Ultimate TV hasn't tried any such Big Brother tricks on me. Though they may have their own corporate clowns looking for revenue enhancement.  Downloaded ads that play before every recorded show can be viewed. Schemes to disable fast-forwarding through commercials.

Back when I had an UTV, there were ads displayed whenever you went into grid that displayed TV listings.  I found that pretty damn annoying as well.

As for UTV trying any tricks, well, the division no longer exists, as I understand it.  Some elements of the UTV team were folded into another part of the organization.
