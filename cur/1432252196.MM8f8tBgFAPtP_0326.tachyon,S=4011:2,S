That's a shame. There're certainly a lot of email users, even of the
younger generations. In particular, email lists are used *quite*
frequently by political activists (in my area, at least) -- I've wanted
to include an email anonymity network on an Ubuntu remix for a while for
this reason, but haven't yet, since Mixmaster seems obsolete and
Mixminion's debian package seems to have unfixed security bugs. I admit
I haven't done a great deal of research into this, so I might be
mistaken.

It's also my understanding that Mixminion is more tailored to email and
thus more secure than POP/SMTP over Tor could be. Is that the case?
Should I care that Mixminion is dead? Would it be a waste of time to
write a setup tutorial for it, or integrate it with Thunderbird or
Evolution?
