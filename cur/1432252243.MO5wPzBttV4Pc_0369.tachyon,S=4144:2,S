It is the responsibility of the consumer to make sure that the terms
of the contract are agreeable prior to entering the contract.  That
doesn't leave them in an unprotected position, it leaves them in a
position of power.  If they don't like the contract, they leave.
Easy.

How could it possibly be any other way?  "Oh, wait, I didn't know
about that clause in the contract, so my obligation is null and void."
That would be a great step forward for contract law, no?
