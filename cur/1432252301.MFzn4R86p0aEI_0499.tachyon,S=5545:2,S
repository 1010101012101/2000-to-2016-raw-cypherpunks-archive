Russia sucks.  For one thing, it's damned cold.  Still, if you are
doing something which is annoying to the USG and not the Russians,
Russia is a better deal.  Maybe not the best deal.

It's not the case that all world governments have perfectly
synchronized their witch hunts.

The point is that even in the most important case the FBI handled in a
decade, they couldn't do a basic surveillance job in a friendly
foreign country.  Implication: the same applies to less important
people.  Sheesh.

No standing army, either.  What's the tax system like?  Can people
shoot guns legally?  Net connection?  Will you visit soon?
