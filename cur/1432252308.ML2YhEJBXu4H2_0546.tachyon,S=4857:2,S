A happy accident. Overlooked by all but the most sensitive, alert types.

Oh, I've been to Lake Placid a few times, watched some ski jumpers,
skaters etc. Practice is OK since there's no official bullshit going on.
Ice^H^H^HWhiteface is OK. Pretty darn long run.

I can't remember the last time I had even a remote interest in the
Olympics. Too hyped. Too commercial. If this is some kind of unifying
event that belongs to the whole world why can't all the stations
televise it? Why can't anyone webcast it? Screw Olympics, Inc. If anyone
starts up the Olympics again let me know.
