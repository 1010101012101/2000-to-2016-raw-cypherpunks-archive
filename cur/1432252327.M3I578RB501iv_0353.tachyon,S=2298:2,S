Ever since the Wired article came out, I've thought that Havenco was a
joke (but not a very funny joke for the investors probably).  I've
been checking their site occasionally, and it always says "coming
soon".  Does anyone know if they are going to actually start selling
services, or have they given up?

Right now, it looks like the UK won't even have to waste any time
shutting them down, because Havenco's first-rate executive team will
do the job for them.
