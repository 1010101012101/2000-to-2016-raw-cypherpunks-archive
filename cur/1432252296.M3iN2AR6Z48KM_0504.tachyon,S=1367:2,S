A more detailed analysis of what's going on with the JS exploit:
    http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rlo0uu

Hits a vulnerability in the FF17 Javascript implementation. Notable
because FF17 is the long-term support version, and it's the one included
in the TOR bundle (though JS is off by default in the bundle).

This business with the FBI spraying JS hijacks around the web is more
than a little troubling. Is this the first widely-publicized case of the
feds indiscriminately deploying an exploit on this scale?
