"Researchers have devised a new way to siphon data out of an infected compu=
ter even when it has been physically disconnected from the Internet to prev=
ent the leakage of sensitive information it stores.
The method has been dubbed "DiskFiltration" by its creators because it uses=
 acoustic signals emitted from the hard drive of the air-gapped computer be=
ing targeted. It works by manipulating the movements of the hard drive's=C2=
=A0actuator, which is the mechanical arm that accesses specific parts of di=
sk platter so heads attached to the actuator can read or write data. By usi=
ng so-called seek operations that move the actuator in very specific ways, =
it can generate sounds that transfer passwords, cryptographic keys, and oth=
er sensitive data stored on the computer to a nearby microphone. The techni=
que has a range of six feet and a speed of 180 bits per minute, fast enough=
 to steal a 4096-bit key in about 25 minutes.
"An air-gap isolation is considered to be a hermetic security measure which=
 can prevent data leakage," Mordechai Guri, a security researcher and the h=
ead of research and development in the cyber security labs at Israel's Ben-=
Gurion University, told Ars. "Confidential data, personal information, fina=
ncial records and other type of sensitive information is stored within isol=
ated networks. We show that despite the degree of isolation, the data can b=
e exfiltrated (for example, to a nearby smart phone)."
Besides working against air-gapped computers, the covert channel can also b=
e used to steal data from Internet-connected machines whose network traffic=
 is intensively monitored by intrusion prevention devices, data loss preven=
tion systems, and similar security measures. The technique is documented in=
 a technical paper titled=C2=A0DiskFiltration: Data Exfiltration from Speak=
erless Air-Gapped Computers via Covert Hard Drive Noise, which was publishe=
d Thursday night. Guri and the other Ben-Gurion University researchers who =
devised the covert channel created the video demonstration below."
