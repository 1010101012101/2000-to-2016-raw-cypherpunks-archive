You might want to look at the work RSA Labs is doing on 'blocker tags'.
These are special tags which leverage the mechanism used to disambiguate
the presence of multiple tags to make it look as if you are carrying
2^n (n usually 128) different tags at once.

They propose a protocol to make them only block tags for items which
have undergone sale to their final owner, but the idea could be 
applied to all tags.
