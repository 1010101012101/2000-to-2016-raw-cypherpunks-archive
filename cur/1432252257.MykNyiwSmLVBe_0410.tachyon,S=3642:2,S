So far,so good:I agree with both your opinions and analysis in support 
thereof. Unfortunately, I believe that every major reader (from PINE up) 
has the complained about functionality (I may very well be wrong here: 
FD). I routinely use this on PINE as a sorting measure (a way to force a 
re-read later on down the road)

The only was I see any reasonable change of chaning this [fairly common] 
behaviour is with an RFC. Willing write one?  Ill be happy to co-author, 
but there needs to be a primary.
