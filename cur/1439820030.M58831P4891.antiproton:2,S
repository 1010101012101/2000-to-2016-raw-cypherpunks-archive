Your suggestion is well within financial reach.

According to trivia, the decent movie "Travelling Salesman" (2012)
> The film was made for under $10,000.

If this turns to be thread about "want to see movies",
I would like to see this old free book filmed:

Underground
Tales of hacking, madness and obsession on the electronic frontier

http://www.underground-book.net/

...and...

Documentary about "Hacking in the '90s'.

Wouldn't argue about the title, but something like "Division by zero"
would be better. IIRC there is a novel with this exact name 
(I recommend it). By Ted Chiang.
