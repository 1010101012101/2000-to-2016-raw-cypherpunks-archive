Most P2P clients don't support this, so one better does QoS tweaks at the
firewall. The Draytek Vigor line of routers allows you to define VLANs, and
assign those to switch ports, and throttle these in small increments. DSL
lines are deeply buffered, so pushing out traffic as fast as you can plugs up
the FIFO, soon resulting in killer lag.

Unfortunately, few PCs cruise the Net without NAT firewalls, and these are
typically braindead, and have no hooks for P2P apps other than UPnP.

Some nodes are power constrained (mobile phones), some are not (cars,
planes). Ultrawideband is intrinsically low-power (integrated, the pulses are
200 W or above). Positioning include pingpong, so you could easily use that
payload for SMS relaying. Furthermore, ad hoc mesh is a mode. You can go into
ad hoc when outside of more immobile infrastructure.

If you don't have to compress voice, drive the display and transducers, etc,
pure relay for precompressed voice packets is tolerable. You don't have to
do it all the time, so you can
specify the degree of whether you're a defector, or a good guy.

All power management issues are irrelevant for immobile nodes and for
energy-glut nodes. Solar-powered immobile nodes is a good idea (I've looking
at cheapest ways to build them), but they have power management issues during
nighttime. Also, there's snow on the panels and thermostating problems in
harsher climes.

If the network is agoric, you're getting good mana in exchange for your
juice. The amount of your mana varies, depending on local market prices.

Yes.

I stopped using geodesic routing a while ago, because I found out the proper
term is geographic routing.
