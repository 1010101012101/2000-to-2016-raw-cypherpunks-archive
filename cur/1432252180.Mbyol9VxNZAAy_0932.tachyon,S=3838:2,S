Gee...one would think there'd be a nice software-based tool so that this 
kind of digital pogrom would never even be possible, particularly seeing how 
Kazaa, Gnutella and so forth are all based on a file sharing model that has 
no centralized server a la Napster. And of course, most users would never 
bother using encryption techniques in this context, but "power users" 
certainly might!
