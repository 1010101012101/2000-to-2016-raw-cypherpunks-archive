But Ben is not spoofed here!  So there is little motivation.

In an environment where spoofing was common, folks would
sign (which is not incompatible with retaining anonymity, of course).

You could also sign anonymous statements here which you might
decide to bind to one of your identities later.

In the absence of any need, its not rational to bother.
