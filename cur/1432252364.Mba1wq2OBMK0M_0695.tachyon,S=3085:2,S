I actually don't impose my ideals.

I do however urge others to accept and adopt them.  Point in case, you
have assumed that I smoke.  I actually don't, and never have (past the odd
one or two cigarettes that I've tried back when I was young, and found I
didn't like.)

That in and of itself should give you an inkling of why I believe my
ideals are correct.


Incase it's not, consider this:

I'm not imposing, I'm asking.  I don't have a law book to thump, nor a gun
to point at you, nor a cop waiting to arrest you if you disagree with what
I say.  Nor am I asking for such laws to prevent or limit others in
similar ways.

On the other hand, some trolls around here, wish to do just that, in order
to impose their ideals on all of us (in various cities.)
