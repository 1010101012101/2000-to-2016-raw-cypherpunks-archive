Would holding both the corporation and its executives libel for the same 
crime constitute a form of double jeopardy ;-)

Is it possible for the injured parties to criminally prosecute the alleged

that is what is needed.  The govenment should not enjoy a privileged 
position on enforcement of criminal statutes.
