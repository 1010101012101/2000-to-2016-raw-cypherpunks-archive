Let me second the recommendation for jabber (though I wish the code 
quality of some of the components were better).  The protocol itself 
supports TLS for client-to-server encryption; you can also have AIM (or 
other IM) gateways on that server.  In many situations (i.e., 
wireless), it protects the most vulnerable link from eavesdropping.  
While clearly not as good as end-to-end encryption, it's far better 
than nothing, especially in high-threat environments such as the 
IETF...  (Of course, I only know of one open source client -- psi -- 
that checks the server certificate.)  In theory, server-to-server 
communications can also be TLS-protected, though I don't know if any 
platforms support that.

On top of any other encryption, many implementations support PGP 
encryption between correspondents.  I don't know of any support for 
e2e-encrypted chat rooms.

I haven't played with OTR, nor am I convinced of the threat model.  
That said, what you really need to watch out for is the transcript 
files on your own machine...
