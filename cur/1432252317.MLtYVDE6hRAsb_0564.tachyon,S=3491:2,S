That's why it was critical that Lee be guilty of *something*,
at least one charge, so he doesn't have a strong position for
suing the Feds for big bucks individually and organizationally.
He may still have some ability to do that, but I'd be surprised
if the plea bargain deal didn't address it somehow, even if it's
not in the part that's in the press.

Was that Perry, or Deutch?  I think I saw recently that Deutch _is_
getting his wrist slapped somewhat hard now.
