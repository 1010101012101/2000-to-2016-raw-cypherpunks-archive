The UPS uses very effective computer character recognition. How long do
you think it'll take 'em (if they aren't now) to drop a traffic analysis
system in there to look for 'known writing samples'? Not very long I
suspect. And mail is tracked with respect to pickup by the very way it's
sorted in the bag. You could cause a slight hickup here by using
convenient drop boxes but that is getting a tad rare (not to mention most
are located at businesses that have security cameras - you think a couple
of cops would go through some tape if they knew the specific date the
letter was dropped? I think so.)

Using a typewriter or laser printer won't help, each leave characteristic
marks.

You people should spend more time looking in forensics texts.

But hey, don't believe me. Keep cranking out those 'anonymous' cash
payments sent through the mail...;)
