      Dear friend<BR>
      We would like to invite you, as one of our hardcore members, to a site
      you'll
      find everything to relax after a hard day's work. It is well known that
      daily
      stress and work pain influence health in a bad manner.
      <a href="http://www.k-s-online.com/">ElsaClinic (www.k-s-online.com)</a>
      offers you the most efficient way to relax after work and to avoid
      overworking
      during work hours. That's the best possibility to remove stress and to
      keep
      yourself in fit form even at work.<P>
      
      The site contains TENS THOUSANDS pictures and more than 500 mb of PRIVATE
      video clips illustraring you the exercises and procedures critical for
      your
      health and excitement. You can take your way to the most beautiful nurse
      ever,
      and have 'common' procedures with her, or you can try playing with those
      funny
      doctor thingies that make the patients cry and even CRYYY!<BR>
      Of course, you can choose a patient there, just to find out how it feels
      being
      a doctor and how the funny thingies work. But be careful. Some of our
      doctors
      and nurses a very strict, they are to be obeyed. Nevertheless we are quite
      sure
      you're experienced enough to distinct them from unexperienced practicants
      who
      are in plenty in our hospital. You can come across with them even at the
      dark
      stairs (for some unknown reasons the elevators tend to stay shut for hours
      locking the patients and the staff).<P>
      
      It is sure enough <a href="http://www.k-s-online.com/">ElsaClinic
      (www.k-s-online.com)</a>
      is the right place to check your health as well as the health of your
      neighbour.<P>
      
      Thank you for being our customer !<P>
