I'm afraid the closest I can come is to recognize that a presscorp
(or reporter!) has only its reputation to sell; and when bias is exposed
that is
reduced.  But no 'public' anything; a newspaper (like a web server) does not
need a 'public' license to use a 'public' resource like the EM spectrum or
the cable infrastructure.

Just my 2 picas.
