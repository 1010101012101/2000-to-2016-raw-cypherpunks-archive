No sooner has that guy in Ohio gone to the slammer for 10 years for his
naughty diary, than some judge in Australia has fined a person $10k for
downloading naughty text stories on the Internet.

Will www.nifty.org and www.assgm.com survive?

And in a very odd and cleverly worded op-ed piece...

http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/34569.htm

The New York Post has suggested that locking up Mr. Dalton was wrong
because he didn't show his story to anyone, while observing in passing
that such a sentence would have been just fine if Mr. Dalton had "posted
his story on the Net", or "shown it to a friend."

Goodness, we can't have that, can we?

Kind of makes one side with those who believe that the solution to
god-soaked religious cretins is an emergency lion-breeding program.

Child porn fiction gets fine of $10,000
By Bronwyn Peace
   
A MAN has been fined $10,000 for possessing stories about child
pornography even though the judge said they were not as serious as
pornographic pictures because they were fictional and there were no
victims.

...
   
Last month, prosecutor Gail Archer told the court that Keogh should be
jailed for the pornographic stories, which were found on his home computer
by his stepdaughter's boyfriend.

She said the stories, which detailed gang rape, bestiality and incest, had
titles such as Bonnie Goes Camping, The Little Homewrecker and Prince and
His Princess. "All of the stories are quite detailed, quite graphic and
incredibly unpleasant," she said.

Ms Archer said Keogh admitted to police he owned the stories but said he
did not know they were illegal and that they helped him cope with his past
abuse. She said any downloading of child pornography encouraged the
exploitation of children.

...

The judge said Keogh, who until now had led a blameless life, deserved a
significant fine.
