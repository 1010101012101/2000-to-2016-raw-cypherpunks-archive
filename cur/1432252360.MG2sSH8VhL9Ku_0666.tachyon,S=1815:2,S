Does it help if:
Alice generates a secret key for each payment
Alice *anonymously* deposits an *encrypted* message containing payment
details into Bob's acct
Only Alice can reveal the key for a particular transaction in Bob's
account, thereby
stripping anonymity but also revealing payment.  For only that
transaction.
