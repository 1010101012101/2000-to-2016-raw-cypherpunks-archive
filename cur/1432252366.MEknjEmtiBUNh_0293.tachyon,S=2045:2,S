Although the symbol is more often usedby Anarchists, an "A" in a circle is
also a symbol used by individuals in the white supremacist movement who
are violently anti-government because of their conspiratorial belief that
Jews control he government. The symbol can also signify that an individual
is part of the Aryan movement and disregard authority. 

Looks like an apt description to me -- they acknowledge that it isn't
always a hate symbol but is more often used by Anarchists
