Fuck. There's no excuse for some of this crap.

How bout we stop litigating against Trojans and other spyware, at least as 
far as corporations are concerned. Or wait, they get a trojan and lose data 
then a CTO goes to jail instead. OK, not Cypherpunkly enough...OK, security 
or credit card company loses 100,000 cardnumbers to a trojan and an 
auto-posse forms to string up that company's CTO.

Joking aside, anti-spyware legislation is making some of these companies 
awfully lazy.
