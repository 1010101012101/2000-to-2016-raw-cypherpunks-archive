Just as the initial euphoria from the introduction of notes and coins wears 
off, the euro has received a boost from news that China could be buying 
more euros to reduce its reliance on the dollar.

footing with the US dollar."

poor, with its fundamental motivation in personal greed, simply cannot 
survive without force - without a secret police force.
