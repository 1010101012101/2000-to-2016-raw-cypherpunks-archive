Jerzy's comments notwithstanding, I say that you two (rysiek and Juan)
made some great progress in this thread, and I really appreciate the
effort you both put in. Been a bit busy, and so had this thread in my
mind to prod again, since there are some questions raised which are
in, and have been in my mind for some time, so thanks for the efforts.

I'll crop the text down to what interests me personally...

Excellent point. I don't think anyone disputes that Google, Facecrack
and Twatter working with the NSA and CIA is a good thing for us common
plebes.

And there's an underlying question "in political anarchy, wouldn't
these companies tend to conspire together, against the people, just as
they do now?" Or perhaps "paint me a picture of how these companies
might -actually- be better if political anarchy were our way."

Regarding the OP, waay back, I assume the DMV would not exist, except
for a small percentage of vanity vehicle number plates or perhaps
diplomatic plates etc - there can be no dispute that private sector OR
public sector omnipotent databases will sooner rather than later be
abused against the people.

Juan was not unqualified there - he says that when the money for "the
good" comes from taxation or inflation, that's theft from the people.

I find it hard to disagree that it's theft.

Small point, but this was a searching for shared meaning (excellent
intention btw), and you suggested the second term which you then ask
"why use two terms" - point scoring can be fun, but more important (I
say) that we reach shared meaning/ understanding.

Finding shared meanings can be a great challenge, so I really applaud
the attempt to do so. The process of doing so may involve multiple
attempts, and yes that can look like a One True Scotsman "failure".

Top down: freedom, civil society, anarchy, good

Bottom up: So IWF caused Wikimedia to remove XYZ, is this good or bad;
what principle arises from IWF's action/attack?

It's excellent progress and even thinking about how to define these
terms is interesting, in the face of IWF, WWF, GreenPeace and endless
more.

Juan, your ongoing willingness to jump in boldly, use terms and
attempt definitions etc, is bloody awesome - it's always easy to cut
down the tall poppy and so many don't speak up, remaining meek and
polite and PC all the way to heaven<snort>

I found this question quite interesting. But again, we might be back
to definitional road blocks.

Can we say with any certainty that any thesis regarding any political
ideology, can be "shot to pieces"?  The sanskrit-era principle "the
mind is the great trickster" comes to mind.

Definition of corrupt needed here perhaps?

"Can a private company be corrupt without government's help?" is for
me the elephant in the room of political anarchy -> but the question
is too simplistic, since a corporation is an entity created by
sanction and force of the state (copyrights, patents, trademarks,
obligations to pay tax, report finances, etc).

In a political anarchy society, how might a corporation manifest?

Company -> a group or "company" of individuals acting in self interest.

Yes, current large western governments have become pathologically
evil, and perhaps USA is getting close to the "any change is better
than more of the same" point where revolution shakes it all up.

But it's that "acting in self interest" bit which has me thinking ...

Anarchist Google would offer free email right? I still get my free stuff?

That looks like it would be the start of a whole nother, and very
useful, conversation. If power needs to be checked, how is it checked
in an anarchistic society? - (a new thread perhaps)
