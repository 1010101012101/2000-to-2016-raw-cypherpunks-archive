a few ideas related to the context for crypto today.

there is certain irony in crypto that can be subverted and used to attack
or surveil via stealth. reminds of the basic situation with most home
electronics, blackboxed. such as IPcams that remain on 24/7/365 and have
microphones accessible over the network, compromises built-in. thus to seek
security is to extend the hidden security state and its illegal home
invasion. solution: five dollar on/off switch, activate security device
only when away, and upon return turn it off again, limiting the designed
for boundlessness of political technology.

the diagrams here reference the following NSA document...

the question of crypto in a complex environment where it has both offensive

ratings

strong and weak, secure and insecure characteristics in a complex
environment

the role of installation and usage errors as related to security and
exploits, inherent in complicated or high-literacy approaches

crypto implementation flaw

this is the direct reference and extension of the NSA diagram above.
cryptanalysis was included, Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM),
though likely other domains are missing or perhaps in relational error.
 improvements or corrections appreciated...

Electromagnetic Borders of Cryptology

this is my estimation of the situation today, based on the above
technosocial structure. it does not include many aspects and is limited by
my lack of awareness and understanding, though makes an attempt at an
integrated view of the larger dynamics involved...
