Bullshit.

In the 1930s Stalin's servants, Foster and Ford, ran for
president, all the great and the good, the top intellectuals at
the top universities, all fulsomely backed them, and of course
they got votes down in the asterixs.

In America the communist threat was always conspiratorial.  Actual
support by the actual working class was as near to nonexistent as
makes no difference.

In the 1870s there was in America working class movement bent on
class warfare.  It utterly discredited itself with murder,
sabotage, and crime, and by the 1890s was dead as a doornail,
never to rise again.

Ever since then, socialism in America has been an elitist
movement, composed of the children of the rich and powerful.
