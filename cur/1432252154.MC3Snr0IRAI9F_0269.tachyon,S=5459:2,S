I had a "pre-visit" by a pair of women--perhaps Census workers, 
perhaps not--about a year before the actual Census. They told me they 
were listing structures on properties so that Census workers could 
then make accurate tallies of the outbuildings, structures, etc.

While one of the women engaged me in conversation about how many 
rooms my house had--I didn't tell her anything--the other woman 
started to enter my side yard, through an archway.

I yelled over to her, "Please don't trespass on my property."

She retreated, and the first woman mumbled something about "not 
liking a threatening tone." She said they were required by the rules 
to check properties for evidence of numbers of residential units, 
out-buildings, "granny flats," etc.

Angry by this time, as I am wont to get, I told the both of them that 
the U.S. Census exists for one and only one purpose: counting the 
population for the sole purpose of the apportionment of Congress.

It doesn't exist to track races (Japs, for example), to make pretty 
maps of income, marital status, computer usage, sexual preferences, 
numbers of pets, numbers of televisions and computers, and so on. It 
just doesn't.

They retreated down my driveway (they had walked in...I assume they 
were walking to all houses on the street). I half-way expected Yet 
Another Stern Call from the Sheriff, but it never came (either that 
or my phone line was busy, as is usually the case during the day).

When the Census form eventually arrived I got the short one. I 
answered only the question about the number of adults living at the 
address. I wrote "Aryan" for my race...I figured if the "favored 
minorities" got to have dozens of sub-classes ("Asian American, 
Pacific Islander, but not Chamorro Islands," or somesuch), then I 
could certainly write down "Aryan."

[For those not in the U.S., the Census is a slave to political 
correctness. We have the spectacle of those of Spanish descent, as in 
"from Spain," writing down some variant of Hispanic for their "race," 
even though a Spaniard is of course of European, aka white, stock, 
while most Mexicans are much different. Amerindian, or whatever. And 
the Asians are divided into a dozen or so groups which lobbied for 
inclusion in the Census. Meanwhile, Finns, Irish, Poles, Israelis, 
Russians, Arabs, BUT NOT SPANIARDS, are all lumped in as "white." 
Bizarre.]

In the Censuses of 1980 and 1990 I think I wrote down "Human Race" or 
something like that. Now I try to be as politically incorrect as 
possible.

Fucking statists.
