Largely similar with my experience. I went and talked to the counselor, 
carefully considered what they said, and completely ignored the
suggestions.

I'm wearing a different hat now, but in a previous life managed an
engineering department that turned out Product extremely well. 
I tend to be a difficult person. Not becuase I like to be, but because
asking questions seems to lead to better Product. In a more research 
focused persuit, I'd present as a very different person.

I do remember a conversation with a college couselor who told me I was
promising, but difficult. When I replied, pointing out that simply
saying "yes" all the time is a bad way to make sure everyone had some
idea of what is going on, I heard something largely along the lines 
of "see, that's the problem."

School counselors in general seem to suffer from the same problem as
phychologists. Not only can't they tell someone what "best practice" is
for what they want to do, but also, they fail to meaningfully help out
with the question of "what is it that I want to do?" I don't hold it
against them that they can't do so, but I still find them useless.


The random .sig that came up strikes me as amusing.

Arguing with an engineer is like wrestling with a pig in mud.
After a while, you realise the pig is enjoying it.
