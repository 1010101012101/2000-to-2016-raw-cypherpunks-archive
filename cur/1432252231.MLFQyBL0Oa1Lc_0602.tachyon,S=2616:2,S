In the 1996 release of the film, "The People vs. Larry Flynt", there is a 
scene where a warrant is served on Flynt's home. His bedroom typified the 
ultimate "safe room" where the agents serving the warrant couldn't get in until the 
room was opened from the inside.  Obviously everyone doesn't have the money 
that Flynt has in order to effectively harden ones house, but you can cheaply and 
rather effectively improve your haunts to allow more warning.

The system you describe would in most jurisdiction still be considered 
illegal and premeditative.  You're better off with passive measures.
