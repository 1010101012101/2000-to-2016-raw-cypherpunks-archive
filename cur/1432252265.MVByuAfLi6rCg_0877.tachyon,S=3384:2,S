it seems like this should be possible using a radioactive material
with a known short half-life and exposing it to a neutron source with
a mask (beryllium?) with the key space on it.

assume a grid of cells on a flat surface containing the radioactive
material; if a given cell emits over a threshold of radiation it is a
'1' bit, dead it is a 0 bit.  exposing the 0's to a neutron emitter
would fission the radioactive cells early leaving it's ionizing
radiation level below the threshold.

there would be some delay between when the key was usable with all
cells/bits readable (a few days, weeks, months?) and when it was still
holding a detectable / useful amount of key information that could be
used in a brute force attack against the unknown bits of key.

they let you put americium in smoke detectors but something tells me
it would be hard to get radioactive crypto keys commercially approved
for production. :)
(the neutron source would be another problem, although piezoelectric
fusion might work)
