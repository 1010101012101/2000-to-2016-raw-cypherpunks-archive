The idea _is_ for it to detonate, not just have a severe thermal 
excursion!

The total "radioactivity" in a critical mass of fissionables is actually 
not all that great. (Not something I'd want in my backyard, and sure to 
produce panic, but not all that significant.) The point of a bomb is to 
get a _lot_ of those radioisotopes fissioning in a much shorter amount 
of time than usual. Without that chain reaction, the radioisotopes are 
just decaying at their normal very, very slow rate. (The reason uranium 
is so radioactively benign is that it's half life is several billion 
years for the most common isotope and pretty close to that for the U-235 
form...the reason we still find both in nature, of course.)

For the oft-discussed "radiological bomb" there is no need for U-235. In 
fact, shorter half-lived stuff like cesium-137 and even spent fuel rods 
would be better.

Personally, this is much _less_  worrisome than biological weapons.

If radioisotopes are spread over a few city blocks, for example, they 
can be cleaned up in various ways. Easy to detect with a Geiger counter 
(or scintillation counter), easy to vacuum up with HEPA filter units, 
all sorts of foaming agents and hoses and the whole decontamination 
apparatus. And if the Geiger counter is silent, it's all gone.

A radiological bomb would result in an evacuation, and the usual panic 
by the sheeple who are afraid of atoms, but the cleanup would be 
straightforward.

(Chernobyl was what it was because many tons, even hundreds of tons, of 
fuel rods were vaporized and/or burned.  Not many terrorists could 
arrange for the vaporization/combustion of this much material.)
