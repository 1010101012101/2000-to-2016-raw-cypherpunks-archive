And in both of these examples I gave, "Nomen Nescio" took a literal 
reading of the examples. "But Ireland is not a communist regime!" "But 
they are not Jews!"

Examples, like the half dozen I gave, are designed to convey to the 
reader the range of uses, needs, and justifications. The specific stands 
for the general.

Both Nomen and Aimee are remarkably block-headed in seeing the big 
picture.
