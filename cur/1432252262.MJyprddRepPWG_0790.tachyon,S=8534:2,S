At 4:33 PM -0500 on 8/11/02, the Austrian one-hop-wonder changed
remailers again, jumped out of the kill-file, followed me around the
mail list and started humping my leg with:


> Namecalling. Possibly your strongest argumentation?

Not at all. I really do believe the word "idiot" is most appropriate
to your level of intelligence, and that makes it merely an
observation of fact on my part. However, to honor your persistence, I
will call you names later, since you really want it so bad.

But, first...

You are clearly a statist. In my autodydactic but still fairly
practiced opinion, an idiot statist. "Statist" because apparently
you've never seen a nation-state you didn't want to suck up to.
"Idiot", because when someone makes a statement of fact, like I did
several times in a row in this thread, you refute it with something
other than reason. Usually a repetition of the same thing over and
over, even when it clearly doesn't work for you. Certainly the very
definition of lunacy, if it's not actual idiocy.

There. How's that for a characterization of your disagreeable
politics?

[This is, ladies, and gentlemen, exactly what *I* would call
"oppositional bullshit". Notice that he merely said the logical
equivalent of "I know you are, but what am I?" Oppositional. And
Bullshit. Check, and Check. Notice he says nothing, including his
previously ignored and recursively regurgitated "refutation" of that
claim at the beginning of the thread, that actually counters what
I've said all along, copied above in the interest of completeness, if
not consistency, above.

But enough of that, well, idiocy. Now, boys and girls, let's have
some fun, shall we? He thinks I'm insulting. Clearly he hasn't been
here long enough. :-) First a, um, warm-up. Where were we. Oh, yes.
Here we are...]

> Read first, spew later.

Cranky, Mr. One-Hop? Whatsa matter? Your ancient mother give you a
friction burn in the sack last night? K-Y's cheap, you know. You
should try it. I hear it even, um, comes in flavors these days...

[...and, as promised, the main event...]

Allow me to argue even better then, in a matter you seem to
appreciate most.

You, sir, are an imbecile. A Poltroon. A Spittlelicker and a toady
[Thanks to Patrick O'Brien...]. [Postmodern anti-imperialist] A
statist lackey (sorry Ryan :-)). A straw-felching pederast [my
apologies to all felchers, straw-using, and otherwise, and, of
course, to pederasts everywhere...]

Ah, the pain of monolinguality. You've said it yourself, haven't you?
I really should learn to use other languages, as my life would be so
much richer.

In that, um, vein, and in your multilingual honor, I hope I'm
forgiven if I got some help,. The following are compliments of the
good folks at <http://www.insults.net/>:

Yiddish -- Yutz. Putz. (I'm sorry you'd don't qualify for "Schmuck",
Mr. One-Hop, much less "Schlong", but, by the way you acquit yourself
here on cypherpunks, that would be off by an order or two of
magnitude. Or, heh, three. :-). Maybe it got dwarfed by friction
burn, or something. Better put some ice on that?) Schlemeil,
Schlmazel, [I feel like Laverne and Shirley, here...] Mishugena. Gayn
Cacken Ofn yam.

French -- Lhche mon cul. [I think that one says it all, don't you
think? The French have *such* a classy expression for *everything*.]

German -- Depp (sound familiar?), Arschgesicht, Leck mich am Arsch
[there's an echo in here...], Hosenscheisser, and, probably most
applicable to your career and qualifications, Arschkriecher [cf
"Toady", above].

Afrikaans [vaguely brutal, and to the point] -- Poephol.

Japanese [cute, in a "Hello Kitty" kind of way] -- kisama.

Cantonese [phonetic] -- lay da yuen fay gay mm sai sou.

Mandarin [also phonetic] -- Liu mang.

Finnish [in honor of Linus] -- Ditisi nai poroja!

Dutch [as one would expect :-), they're particularly creative, but I
like a little irony, myself] -- droogkloot.

And, finally, Latin [a classic, rendered in a classic tongue, and in
memory of your aforementioned chronic lack of nightly lubrication]--
tua mater.

> as the better explanation of the failure of your "Internet Bearer
> Underwriting" ventures.

We'll see, I suppose. At least I haven't quit yet. Nonetheless, it's
a safe bet that as much as I'm too stupid to quit trying to make IBUC
work, you will *always* be more stupid than I am.

Now, somehow, I really feel like I got the better deal, here. Tell ya
what, One-Hop: if I do get IBUC's arm out of the shark and sewn back
on, I'll send you a little remuneration for all the entertainment
you've provided all of us this evening.

So, if and when IBUC actually *does* work, and given your ironic
predilection for book-entry transactions and the use of violent
government enforcement of non-repudiation, where, exactly, do you
want me to send the check, and who do I make it out to?

;-)

Cheers,
RAH
