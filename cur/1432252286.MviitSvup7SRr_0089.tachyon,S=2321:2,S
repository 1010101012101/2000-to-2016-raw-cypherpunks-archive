You're both wrong, his actions are not successfull. In fact they harm the
society as a whole and help the company.

The money he 'wins' doesn't come from the company, any more than the money
that pays the companies lawyers comes from the company. It comes from the
customers via higher prices. So what you're actually doing is allowing the
company to take more money from the community then would have happened
without such laws.

What you're doing is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich.

Some 'good'.
