Uh, where? In China? In India? Indonesia? RIght there you have almost half 
the world's population, and what you've written has almost zero 
applicability. ANd despite the economic advances of, say, China, outside 
coastal regions acquiring enough calories is still a challenge. And the 
occasional floods in central China make it extremely difficult every few 
years.

Overall, however, it would seem that the standard of living and life 
expectancy of both China and India are increasing (and not just for a small 
number). Based on this I cautiously agree, but it's not exactly "obvious", 
and a few natural disasters in the most populated parts of China could put a 
dent in the curve.
