Money in the US was largely privately issued until 1915.

Capitalism long predates government monopolies of money.

The word dollar comes from thaler, which a government stamped
ounce of silver -- but stamped by a minor government very far
away, one of many such stamping authorities.

The state is the enemy of property, not the source.  Property
rights in the means of production not only continued to exist
without state support, where the state was absent, they
invariably continued to exist in the face of massive bloody
state violence aimed at crushing those rights.  Always, those
seeking to crush those rights had to escalate far beyond what
they expected, then escalate the violence even further.
