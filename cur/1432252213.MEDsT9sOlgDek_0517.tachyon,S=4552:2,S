Aha.  I have learned something then; I didn't realize that reps
must be somewhat infectious.  But infectious-reps require a decent
medium, e.g., a decent language; squirrels don't really have the
degrees of freedom.  Though it must be obvious to new squirrels
(eg by observing other more seasoned squirrels lack of reaction) that no
one takes Spoofie Squirrel seriously.  In any case, each squirrel certainly
believes their own set of experiences (and reputations inferred therefrom)
and so would advocate the adoption of its experience, 
if sufficiently verbal to do so.  Much like primates.

In any case, "Spoofie is unreliable about badgers" seems to me to be
a reputation.

At one extreme of opinion, reps are personal; at the other they are objective
and are therefore worth transferring amongst members of so-equipt
species.

Nature *does* have joints at which it can be carved; high-rep people
will tend to recommend other high-rep people and the UFO types will
cross reference the Bigfoot folks.  Such is the nature of peer
review, of cultural epistemology.   There are objective
parts of reputation, even if no objective agreement on the *sign* of
the quality.  

Crypto/tech will only elaborate what is innate or natural in social critters.
