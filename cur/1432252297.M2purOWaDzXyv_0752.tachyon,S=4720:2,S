   New Encryption Regulations Take Effect On Today
   October 19, 2000
   By Brian Krebs, Newsbytes.
   WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A.,
   Published By Newsbytes News Network
   
   In the final step toward matching the European Union's recent
   liberalization of rules governing the export of encryption products,
   the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration has
   published a final rule allowing the export of encryption products of
   any strength to 15 EU nations and eight other trading partners.
   
   The announcement cements changes proposed in July, when the Clinton
   administration said it would relax laws governing the export of
   powerful encryption technologies to allow exports of all
   information-scrambling products to any end user in the European Union,
   as well as Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Japan, New
   Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.
   
   The move, designed to match recent shifts in encryption export policy
   for EU nations, also eliminates the 30-day waiting period that had
   been imposed on companies exporting encryption goods to EU nations and
   other trading partners. Instead, companies will now be required to
   submit a "commodity classification request," and will be allowed to
   ship products without waiting for a review from federal regulators.
   
   Previously, companies could export "retail" - or off-the-shelf -
   encryption products to nearly any country, except those labeled as
   terrorist or high-risk nations, such as China and Russia. But for
   exports of non-retail products, US companies had been required to
   obtain a license before they can export to the governments of any
   other country.
   
   By contrast, the EU allows companies in its member states to export
   encryption products without a license to a set list of 25 countries,
   and makes no distinction as to whether the end-user is a government or
   non-governmental entity.
   
   The new encryption regulations to take effect today eliminate the end
   user, retail and non-retail considerations for encryption exports
   destined for roughly 23 common trading partners.
