Cari,

You have been making frames for others all along in your rants, why is it so unacceptable when someone else uses the same device on you?

You are mixing our profession and your wishful thinking and opinions. The two must be separate. Your job is to report facts, not your personal opinions.

The fact that you are not willing to do your job properly when compared to other journalists is what puts Laura Poitras ahead of you and makes her famous and rich ... and you green of envy.

Remember to take your meds - made my capitalists - once in a while, we would all be thankful if you do.
