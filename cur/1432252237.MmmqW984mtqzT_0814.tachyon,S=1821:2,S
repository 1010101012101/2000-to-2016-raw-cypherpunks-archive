So, I just spent a little over a week out of the country in southern mexico.
I hadn't had my passport, and was traveling on id and birth cert. I kid you
not, no less than a day after I get back, I get a letter from the post
office on how easy it is to get a passport, and how I should go and apply
today in order to make travel alot smoother.

Don't get me wrong, we all know we're tracked like tagged animals, but damn,
that was fast.
