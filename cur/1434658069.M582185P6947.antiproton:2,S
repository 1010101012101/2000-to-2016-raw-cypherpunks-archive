	Au contraire. Any violation of natural rights is morally wrong
	and criminal. Morality, rights and crime (violation of rights)
	are all facets of the same idea.

	The definition I quoted explicitly rules out government. But
	even if you want some kind of 'government' it has to be
	'voluntary'. So in practice it doesn't govern anything.

	And, we were talking about existing governments, especially the
	US government - an organization which isn't 'minimal' by any
	means and which is fully criminal/coercive. The US government
	like any other 'official' 'national' government operates on the
	principle of "obey or die".



> Governed you are. Whether it's by 
> consensus, opt-in or otherwise.


	No, because I don't consent* to being governed. So as
	as far as I'm concerned I'm choosing ZERO government - or
	anarchy.

	
*Consent, you know. The ability to say "yes", or "NO" GO FUCK YOURSELF.

	Not smart, not the point and do your own homework.

	Yep, that's exactly what they are. But actually no, they are

	But yes, tell your sob stories to the people your military

	By the way, anarchists don't only reject governmental
	authority. They tend to reject all kinds of authority. For
	instance, 'religious' authority.

	How do you think direct democracy works? What do you mean by
	that? What kind of things can be put up for a vote? Burn the
	witches, yes, no? And what happens when the witches are
	outvoted?

	A government that can't enforce its dictates is not a
	government. Also, the definition mentions plain government

	"a doctrine urging the abolition of government...as the
	...condition for...liberty"

	They could have just said "abolition of governmental restraint"
	but they didn't.

	I'm willing to admit that definition isn't as polished and
	consistent as it should be, but no more.

	Fine, and let me repeat, the disussion was about clearly
	coercitive governments - like the US government.

	I want to abolish the use of crime as an allegedly legitimate
	and legal way for people to interact.

	Well, if somebody was led into thinking that anarchy is chaos
	it's because he was not paying attention.
