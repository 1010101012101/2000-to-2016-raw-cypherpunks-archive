Nokia pledges to pursue N-Gage crack creators
[...]

Nokia today vowed to "aggressively pursue" the people behind the
successful attempt to crack its N-Gage handheld console-cum-phone's
copy protection mechanism.

A Nokia spokesman told The Register the company had already begun
working with ISPs and law enforcement agencies to track down the
perpetrators.

[...]

As we reported earlier, the crack has been implemented in an
application which when loaded onto an N-Gage or another Symbian-based
Series 60 handset will detect encrypted games stored in the root
directory of a memory card, decrypt the files onto the card then add
the game in the handset's application launcher.

[...]

How the copy protection mechanism was cracked isn't known. The Nokia
spokesman said the company's system was proprietary [...]

[...]

Skill is one thing, but as far as time goes, it has taken only a month
from the console's release to the public for the code to be
cracked. The Nokia spokesman admitted that the company had "expected
this to happen" - which begs the question why, like the DVD Content
Scrambling System, the copy protection developers didn't come up with
something stronger in the first place.
