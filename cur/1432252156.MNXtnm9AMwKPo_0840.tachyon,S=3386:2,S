Shouldn't we turn in our guns first? Or is it our books? Maybe it would be smart to get rid of any 
compilers, don't you think?

We have a national secret police now that no longer has to start with a crime and then find a 
criminal, rather they can start with a person and find a way to classify him a criminal. Radio 
frequencies just give them one more way to put a person in jail for five years. It is actually 
nice of them to not just suspend habeas corpus universally.
