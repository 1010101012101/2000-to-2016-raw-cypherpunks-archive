Background Summary
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio was instituted under a
Constitution giving titular duties and recognition as Monarch to His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, a native Marshallese Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) who, by right of descendancy, traditional matriarchal
tenure and ancestral heritage, is owner in allodium of the islands at
Eneen-Kio Atoll. As a limited constitutional monarchy, the government
was first formed by the King, who by appointment, established the office
of Minister Plenipotentiary. King Murjel passed away in December 1998;
his brother Remios became Second Monarch of the Kingdom. King Remios'
brother, HRH Lobadreo Hermios, is Crown Prince.
The tiny atoll has a remarkable history of having played a very
significant role in the religious and social life of the Marshallese
natives who first began to inhabit the area as early as 500 BCE. Due to
the isolation and relative obscurity of the flat sand and coral islands,
finding the atoll presented a distinct challenge to native sailors, who
navigated the open sea using small charts of sticks and shells and
simple dugout sailing canoes. Some, reportedly selected for human
sacrifice to native gods, would find the huge sea birds, unaccustomed to
humans, easy prey at Eneen-Kio Atoll. A wing bone could be substituted
for one's own bones, destined to be used as a "needle" in tattooing
ceremonies. The demonstration of bravery in completing the journey was
sufficient to spare their lives. Sailors returning from the atoll would
proudly display proof positive of their success: a small orange (Kio)
flower, unknown to grow elsewhere in Micronesia at the time. This same
delicate flower (Sida fallax), commonly called Ilima, is scattered
throughout the Hawaiian Islands of today and is used in lei-making and
decorative arts. 
Today, the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll are occupied by the agents and
workers of the federal government of the United States, which unlawfully
seized the property during the colonial expansion era of the
Spanish-American War, circa 1899. Efforts to convey an understanding of
the King's right and title to the land and to promote cooperation
between the leadership of the two nations are continuing.
The precedent for the return of the islands was set by the 1993 U.S.
apology (PL103-150, 107 STAT 1513) for the illegal overthrow of the
Hawaiian Monarchy and by the 1994 return of the island of Kaho'olawe to
Hawaiians are considered paramount to the demands being made in the case
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
General Considerations
The three islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll are far from any classic image of
tropical paradise. Foliage is scant, the land is low and fresh water is
in short supply. The challenge of setting up and maintaining habitation
and human activity there is lessened somewhat by advances in technology.
The use of alternative and renewable energy and environmental systems
offer several convenient solutions for the reliable power and water
needs of residents.
Centrally located in the North Pacific Ocean, triangulated between
Hawaii, Japan and Australia, albeit remote, the atoll offers a unique
set of circumstances worth special consideration. Aside from the
presence of military-styled infrastructure, water and power station and
a substantially superior airstrip to any in the region, little else is
known to be there as would befit commercial and community development.
Numerous improvements are needed to support the planned activity.
This presentation is intended to conceptually introduce the reader to
potential uses, programs and development opportunities envisioned for
the Kingdom of EnenKio.

Government Trust Services
The foundations of government are supported by the pillars of freedom,
equality and respect for the traditions of past generations of native
Pacific islanders. Application of these ideals guide the design,
selection and implementation of methods and programs to induce a maximum
benefit for and to residents and citizens of Eneen-Kio Atoll, without
regard to where they may actually reside or from what place their roots
derive.
Liberal considerations complimentary to the inherent rights of
individuals are made with respect to citizenship, licenses, ship
registry, personal and professional documentation, trust and financial
services and other areas normally encumbered with restrictive controls
and governmental influence. For that reason, all areas within the
jurisdiction of the EnenKio government are declared to be a
Free-Enterprise Zone.
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
Given that considerations for factors stated above are requisite to
fully understand, appreciate and utilize the opportunities for commerce,
trade, travel, finance and business in and of the Kingdom, the following
are set forth below in capsule form:
Telecommunications
Commercial Broadcasting - A powerful radio wave transmitting facility on
par with "Radio Free Europe" could reach audiences from Alaska to New
Zealand, China to Mexico and provide programming now unavailable.
Voice & Data Links - Satellite and ground relay of communications from
all island groups in the North and South Pacific Ocean. Worldwide
cellular telephone service is planned. It will be dependent upon
spaceport development, efficient and economical satellites in orbit.
Fiber Optic Relay Station - Communication link between Eastern Asia and
Hawaii, which has access to North America, would provide service for
large-bit data transmission through superior fiber optic network, also
expandable to link island groups in the South and West to main trunk
line. 
Spaceport Operations
Satellite Launch Facility - The proposed Spaceport to be located in the
Big Island of Hawaii was to take advantage of geographic considerations
for certain types of launches seems to be terminally stalled over
hazards to and objections of the population. Eneen-Kio Atoll has none of
the issues that are causing seemingly insurmountable problems in Hawaii.
Yet Eneen-Kio Atoll still has the advantage of geographic location,
major airstrip and freedom from the numerous restrictions imposed by
U.S. federal agencies and associated policies.
The importation requirements are still valid, being 2000 miles from the
U.S., and exportation of waste and toxic residue could be eliminated by
local processing facilities, planned regardless of spaceport plans.
Other limitations imposed by native archeological sites, thermal and
wind flow effects, weather and cloud effects from mountains, increases
in moisture from rain and rocky coastline (ocean spray), scientific
observation equipment atop Mauna Kea and need for permits or land
acquisition are essentially eliminated.
Weather Data/Observation - Coupled with the need for timely pre-launch
weather data, observations with atmospheric instrumentation and balloons
will capable of being conducted on a regular basis.
Telemetry Support - Coupled with the need for post-launch telemetry, the
facilities will be available to support space programs of other nations.
Given the establishment of communications links with Hawaii, much of the
support may be supplied from Hawaii.
Toxic/Nuclear Waste Disposal Program - Coupled with the spaceport
operation, permanent disposal and remediation programs for a variety of
products, whether produced locally or outside of Eneen-Kio Atoll, are
needed and contemplated. Several of these processes are proprietary and
beyond the scope of this presentation. 
Transportation
While the air terminal on Wake Island is potential refuge for commercial
Transpacific aircraft on an emergency basis, it is not now open for air
routes and interisland flights. Upon site development and requisites of
other programs, a need for increased services shall be met with
appropriate measures. The present air strip is nearly 2 miles in length.
Fisheries
Geographic position of Eneen-Kio Atoll plays an considerable role in the
development and support of North Pacific fishing fleets. Vessel supply
and repair services, cannery operation, fish processing facilities and
air shipment of fresh catch products to the East or West are to be
developed.
Financial Services & Banking Center
The prevailing political climate in support of individual freedoms,
including rights of privacy and security in personal affairs and lawful
business dealings, shall combine with other factors to create a climate
of expanding commerce and financial independence. In general, services
shall include electronic bank transactions, insurance, precious metals
refinery and depository, central bank and secure trust haven.
Implementation will be augmented by the communications links and
expanding gross national product. 
See also: The Banking Act of 1995. 
Mineral Exploration, Natural Resource Recovery & Processing
Very little with respect to recoverable natural resources is known about
much of the area proximal to Eneen-Kio Atoll. Nearby seamounts and
mineral beds are potentially a vast natural resource awaiting
technologically refined methods of discovery and retrieval. Coring will
be necessary to assess the presence and character of minerals.
Maritime Services
Policies and procedures are in place to promote national security,
encourage domestic and foreign commerce and to ensure safety of vessels
of the Kingdom and other maritime nations of the world.
Ship Enrollment and Maritime Service Documentation - EnenKio will be a
host nation for documentation and enrollment of sailors and their ships.
All enrolled vessels shall be accorded privileges, which may be
unavailable to vessels of highly regulated nations.
Ship Supply and Service Facility - A necessary component for any diverse
maritime industry will be adequate ship services. Primarily designed to
handle vessels of fishing fleets, other transpacific, international and
pleasure craft shall have ready access to the services and facilities at
Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
See also: The Maritime Act of 1995. 
Citizen Fidelity & Investment
Individuals wishing to further the causes and development programs of
the Kingdom by affiliation or involvement may make application for
citizenship and travel documents or for consular representative
assignment. Participation in the government's development programs shall
be considered on a per case basis, but generally will not be
unreasonably denied to persons of sincere intent. Economic and personal
advantages to natural and artificial citizens of EnenKio may be found in
understanding licensing laws, financial and trust services and in
finding freedom from taxation.
Citizenship - Belief in and support of the concepts of individual rights
and freedoms that were the founding precepts of the United States of
America in the latter part of the 18th Century shall be required of any
applicant. The purpose of government shall be to ensure those rights and
freedoms are not violated under the Constitution of EnenKio. MORE on
Citizenship
Travel - Citizens of EnenKio, without regard to ethnic or national
origin, shall have the right to travel freely while outside the
territorial boundaries of EnenKio. Travel documents, including passport,
will be issued and acceptance by other nations will be the goal of
ensuring our citizens of their freedom of movement while in foreign
lands.
Diplomatic Service - Citizens who are willing to promote the programs of
EnenKio and are desirous of consular status while in foreign lands shall
be considered upon application on a per case basis, in accordance with
Foreign Service Corps and Ministry policies.
Investment - Acceptance of support and funds for advancement of
development programs shall give participants priority in obtaining
necessary government affiliation services. Programs of national identity
and international commerce will benefit from dedicated citizen
involvement. A legal defense fund will be instituted to perfect and
assert claims.      
MORE on the Economic Citizenship Program
Waste Remediation
Radioactive waste - Permanent disposal via proprietary methods will
eliminate materials producing ionizing radiation, without substantial
risk of contaminating and polluting of any place on Earth or elsewhere.
Toxic and chemical waste - On site via proprietary methods as above.
