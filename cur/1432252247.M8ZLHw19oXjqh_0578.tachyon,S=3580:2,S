I haven't downloaded and seen whether you need to disassemble the
free crippleware to figure out what it's really doing,
but my friend John Doe tried unsuccessfully to do so,
and perhaps a human will respond to the log messages tomorrow.
It wants some kind of public key, probably a raw hex RSA key.

Two obvious methods for them to use are
- some interesting mathematical breakthrough like Montgomery Multiplication 
only faster
         (ok, how to make such a breakthrough isn't obvious,
         but what to do with it if you had one is.)
- no new math, just building a modexp library that uses
         vector processing features on Intel-like chips like SSE / SSE2 / etc.
