The answer to this question is actually fairly simple, it is VERY easy to
block smurfing in the form of amplification, I.E that is to say that you can
stop yourself being an amplifier, this helps your outgoing bandwidth.
However, to stop yourself being smurfed you have to stop all incoming ICMP
Echo Reply packets coming into your host at your upstream, because what you
are getting from a smurf are NOT ping request packets, they are ICMP echo
reply packets coming from other amplifiers, which means you could be getting
ICMP echo reply packets from 10 thousand + hosts at a time, and there is
little you can do to block it other than have your uplink firewall it.  The
problem is that by the time the ICMP reaches the uplink, the uplink has
probably been saturated, or at least is upset enough over their loss of
bandwidth to possibly cut your connectivity.  It is pretty pointless
blocking ICMP echo replies on the IRC server itself as well, because by the
time the packets get dropped at the server, they have already passed over
the lines and saturated the lines.

Kinda sad hey?

I have a question: given that half the bandwidth and almost all
of the spike bandwidth is devoted to smurfing, why don't IRC
servers just block multicast ping? I mean, okay, so it's in the
kernel code instead of being a separate application.  It still
shouldn't be hard to come up with a patch that killed smurfing.

Pings should never be forwarded to multiple hosts.
