	I always thought that the best strategy would be to look through all
mail folders, find the last email received from the target, and use the
subject from that, adding 'Re: ' at the start. Delete the body of the
mail and replace it with one of several variations along the lines of 'I
thought this might be helpful: <Insert macro-trojaned .doc> Just click
'OK' when the dialog box pops up.'

	That would get most PHBs I know...

	I'm not a VB programmer, but I assume that sort of functionality is
available from the Outlook COM object (or ActiveX object, or .NET Web
Service, or whatever the hell it's called now :>)
