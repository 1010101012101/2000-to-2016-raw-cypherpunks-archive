Subject: [Tom Berson Skype Security Evaluation]

Tom Berson's conclusion is incorrect. One needs only to take a look at the
publicly available information. I couldn't find an immediate reference
directly from the Skype website, but it uses 1024-bit RSA keys, the coverage
of breaking of 1024-bit RSA has been substantial. The end, the security is 
flawed. Of course I told them this now years ago, when I told them that 
1024-bit RSA should be retired in favor of larger keys, and several other 
people as well told them.
