Does raise a question about Apple's intent to develop
its own crypto as with everything else consumers have
come to expect inside a pretty package of magic. Which

PGP may be well aware of, with as ever, an assist from
Microsoft's inside spies at Apple. Clunkers ban together.

To be sure, Apple's spies inside Mircosoft and PGP are
not idly spreading rumors of Linux ever-more tentacular
prowess.

Doubly sure, the spies and liars may be the same in all
instances, doing the CEOs' dirty to slip into IBM's inner
pants to see what's highly erectile functioning.

Learning from NSA who learned from the British who
tortured the Muslims who bung-holed the Greeks
who cheated the Sumerians who grabbed from the
Egyptians who, let it be said, Gaddafi shouts, we all
out-gunned the paranoid sub-saharans by poisoning their
wells, and little noticed in this circle jerk fingerpointing
is the quiet claim by the central africans about the
lasting effectiveness of viral ebola and ball-shriveling
AIDS.

Anybody who thinks viral bots are a western invention
is historically, vaingloriously blind to conceal claims of
originiality to hide buglary and theft-- which is a prime
definition of western civ.

Its not the strong math and weak implementation that
assures success in crypto business and WMDs, its the
knife in the back, i.e., the financiers behind the arms.

Akbar, akbar.
