Look up Johansson, et al.  Point light displays.  Yes you can tell
sex, age, etc., from the ratios of rotational axes, etc, but a stone
in the shoe is a bitch.

All faith is in drivers' licenses, a total joke, I got gummies on your
'prints, all your time-derivatives are mine.

But grant$ are good, and flavor$ of DARPA be bitchin.
