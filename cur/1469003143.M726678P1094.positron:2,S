I didn't say that there was anything altruistic or humanitarian about
it. And yes, they did what they had to do.

Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. I can't imagine how you know. I do
agree that it's prudent to be suspicious. But no better alternatives

Route Tor through nested VPNs. Route Mixmaster, Pond, Bitmessage, etc
through Tor. Encrypt private stuff with GnuPG.

Maybe so.

If your assessment is correct, we are truly fucked :(

Yes, it does :(
