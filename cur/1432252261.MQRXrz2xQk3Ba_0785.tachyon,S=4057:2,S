Haven't checked the gzip site in a long time, but last time I did
there was some amusing stuff there.  The guy who wrote it
(gzip) mentioned that he had had to spend a lot more time
investigating patents than investigating compression techniques
(to make sure that gzip didn't step on any), as I recall he found
several differnt patents claiming to have algorithms for compressing
random data (which he quite rightly dismissed as the equivalent of
perpetual motion).

One (already patented) technique was essentially moving the data
from the file to the filename.  That is, I take a file called
"Readme.txt" with the info "Hello World", and I rename the
file as "Readme_Hello world.txt" and the file is now zero length!

I suspect the ZeoSync people are trying something similar.
