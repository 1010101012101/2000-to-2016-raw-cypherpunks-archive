Using a GPS coordinate set as keying material?  Hope it's just 
additional keying material.  Knowing the intended destination of 
something like a movie in transit to a theater seems pretty easy, 
and the set of GPS coordinates encompassing your average 
multiplex would seem to be pretty small compared to the usual 
keyspaces discussed here.
