In anticipation of the "Guv'ment ID Needed for Everything/Can't Get ID 
Without Already Having ID" state, I got government ID last month, before 
the regulations went into effect.

I did the whole house of cards.  Certified birth certificate copy, voter 
registration, library card, passport, state ID, SS Card.

Now I will have to live a quiet life flying under the radar as myself, and 
conduct all my nefarious schemes under invented identities.

Did you know that once you get a Drivers License/State ID, it is illegal 
not to inform them within 10 days if your address changes?  Once in the 
system, always in the system.

The picture is also very unflattering.  I am substantially taller than the 
lens level, and being ordered to look down at the lens makes me appear to 
have multiple chins.

The things I put up with.
