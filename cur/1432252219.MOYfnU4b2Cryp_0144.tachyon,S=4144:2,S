I once had a friend that had the same myopic legal fixation as Choate.  She
had this love/hate relationship with the law.  On the once hand, she was a
libertarian and very skeptical of the government.  On the other, she did
things like become a notary to gain some sort of government-anointed
prestige.

One of the things she did to play lawyer was repeatedly circle the block in
her car to make a left turn at an intersection with a sign that said, "No
Left Turn--Except Buses" or something like that.  When she finally got a cop
to ticket her, she was ecstatic.

In court, she pulled out a definition of a "bus" from a source totally
unrelated to the traffic code.  It said a bus was any vehicle capable of
carrying 6 or more people.  Well, her car seated 6 or more, so it was a bus,
right?  The judge was so amused, that he cut her loose.  She counted it as a
victory and thought her legal "reasoning" had won the day.

I only pray that I live long enough to see Jim Choate in the docket someday.
Of course, he's way too smart to hire a lawyer, so he'll demand a free
lawyer.  When that doesn't work, he'll begrudgingly representing himself.
He'll strut about, use big words he doesn't understand and waive around a
tattered copy of the Constitution.

Maybe he'll be as lucky as my friend.  Probably he won't.  Whatever the
case, I want to be there.  God, will it be SO rich.
