And of course the German word for money is Gelt, which means 
Gold. 

Cows might have served well as currency for primitives like the 
Etruscans, but can you imagine using them today?  I took
a bus this morning, the fair was 1.10 and I only had paper money
so they ripped me off 90 cents.  But if I was an Etruscan, they
would've taken my whole cow!
