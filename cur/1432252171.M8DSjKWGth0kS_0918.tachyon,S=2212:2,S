The Assange Show on RT tonight, June 5, covers Cypherpunks
as source of WikiLeaks:

http://www.rt.com/news/julian-assange-internet-war-cypherpunk-989/

RT blurb:

-Cypherpunks is a movement originating from
Cypherpunks Electronic Mailing List, which was
set up by activists aiming to improve Internet
privacy and security through proactive use of
cryptography. The movement has been active since
the late 1980s. WikiLeaks is one of the many projects derived from
Cypherpunks.

A furious invisible war over our society is
underway. Finer technologies to collect netizens
private data pop up every week  and what now
exactly is private? Julian Assange asks his
Cypherpunk guests: is the worlds future tied to the Internet?

-WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, gets back in
touch with the Cypherpunks movement to discuss
the unseen battlefield  the Internet: how cyber
wars are no longer a sheer paranoid fantasy, how
your life turns into goods sold at the market,
why a math problem is not exactly a problem when
private data is concerned and what the best
antidote is to political storytelling.

"A furious invisible war" is no longer a poetic
comparison, you will find out, and this is a battle in your backyard.
