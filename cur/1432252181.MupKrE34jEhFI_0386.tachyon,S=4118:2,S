If you are that worried about someone identifying you, maybe sending the
sensitive information out unencrypted over the Internet to an easily
identifiable third-party that can be monitored is a bad idea.

Downloading the software is not much better, as it is still a very
distinctive feature. When doing anything for the sake of anonymity you
must consider both your threat model and your anonymity set.

A perfectly secure network is worthless if the bar to entry is so high
that only a few people ever join. Even if you could only ever know
something came from someone on the network, that fact alone would reduce
the number of individuals that could be responsible to fewer than if
they hadn't bothered with the network.
