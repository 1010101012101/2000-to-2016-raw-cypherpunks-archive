But, but, but the Israeli Payload Specialist, the Colonel in the IDF 
who was on the bombing mission to take out the Osirak reactor in Iraq 
in 1981, certainly was not involved with any kind of surveillance 
satellite work!

His sole duty was to investigate the effects of gamma rays on 
man-in-the-moon marigolds.

That's NASA's story...and they're sticking to it.

"Pay no attention to the Israeli Defense Forces spy behind the DOD 
curtain!"

(Several times in the past we have only been told long after the fact 
that what had been billed as a "scientific mission" by NSA, er, NASA, 
was actually a military mission. Given that missions are very, very 
expensive and usually have somewhat-justifiable mission goals, the fact 
that this mission had no publically-disclosed goals except "science 
fair projects" suggests strongly why the Israeli pilot was on this 
particular mission. And Pakistan may be wondering what the Indian woman 
was doing.)
