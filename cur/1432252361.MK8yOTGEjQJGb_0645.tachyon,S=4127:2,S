Oh...this post was connected to my previous one.

Sorry...my ideas along these lines are still a little foggy but I'll try to 
articulate.

Basically, let's assume someone with some resources has cracked your email 
and wants to monitor what you send and receive. let's also assume they don't 
want you to know it. Let's assume they also are not particularly thrilled 
about having hotmail know what they're up to (if needs be they can obtain a 
warrant, etc..., but this is clearly less than desirable compared to more 
direct techniques). It seems fairly easy to me to (for instance) create a 
bot that duplicates all of the email and resends it to your hotmail account 
so that when you log in everything looks fresh and new. (There are probably 
easier ways to do this via direct hacks of hotmail).

Is there some way to make it evident that someone has opened your email?

Right now, I can't think of anything you could do aside from suggesting that 
hotmail (or whoever) offer some kind of encryption service.

BUT, it occurs to me that you might be able to have gmail forward your mail 
to hotmail via some intermediate application you've set up that takes the 
timestamp and whatever and creates a hash.

Now your 'observer' of course could possibly go over to hotmail and try the 
same tricks, but this might be harder...the forwarded emails might not last 
very long. this might require a pretty heavy hack into gmail or else a 
subpeona, in which case they are much closer to the surface than 
before...'they' need more resources and possibly subject themselves to the 
legal system, which they probably still want to avoid.
