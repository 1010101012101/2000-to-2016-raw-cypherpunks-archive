Reading the discussion I see that the amendment calls for inclusion of 'terrorist activies' into Title III which allows wiretapping under Court order, not anything about warrantless wiretapping.  I did not perform all the text substitutions of the amemdment itself though.  However in the language of the amendment all references that I read are to activities under court order.  

Please indicate the wider circumstances, particularly the warrantless circumstances, that this amendment allows cybertapping under, for those of us without your time or acumen in editing the existing Title III language.

You also did not quote this:
"One of the most effective investigative tools at the disposal of law 
     enforcement agencies is the ability to go to a Federal judge and get 
     wiretapping authority. It is critical in matters such as this. That is 
     the ability to intercept oral or electronic conversations involving the 
     subject of a criminal investigation. The legislative scheme that 
     provides this authority, and at the same time protects the individual 
     liberties of American citizens to be secure against unwarranted 
     government surveillance, is referred to in the criminal code as Title 
     III. Among the many protections inherent in Title III is that only the 
     investigations of certain criminal offenses, those judged to be 
     sufficiently serious to warrant the use of this potent crime-fighting 
     weapon, are eligible for wiretapping orders. The law lays out a number 
     of crimes deemed by Congress to be serious enough to warrant allowing 
     the FBI to intercept electronic and oral communications.
       Title III currently allows interception of communications in 
     connection with the investigation of such crimes as mail fraud, wire 
     fraud, and the interstate transportation of stolen property.
       Inexplicably, however, the Federal terrorism statutes are not 
     currently included in Title III. I have been complaining about this for 
     a long time and this is the time to correct it."

>    On Thursday evening, two days after the worst terrorist attack in U.S.
>>    history, the Senate approved the "Combating Terrorism Act of 2001,"

>    The measure, proposed by Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Dianne Feinstein

>    Its bipartisan sponsors argue that such laws are necessary to thwart
