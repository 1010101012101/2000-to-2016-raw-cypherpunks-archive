Cryptography Research VP Benjamin Jun Takes Aim at Content Pirates
Friday November 5, 6:02 am ET

Discusses Technology Trends and Responses at Upcoming RSA Conference Europe
2004

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite piracy's high public profile
as a threat to intellectual property owners, surprisingly little has been
done to understand the range of technical solutions that are feasible,
according to security expert Benjamin Jun. With piracy plaguing deployments
of pay TV, optical media, console video games and other content, Jun, vice
president of engineering at Cryptography Research, Inc., believes content
publishers facing these issues have a number of tools and technologies at
their disposal to take aim at the pirates, and will discuss solutions and
the findings of his recent research on piracy in his seminar on Friday,
November 5 at the RSA Conference Europe 2004 being held in Barcelona, Spain.

According to Jun, pirates will grow bolder and more effective with advances
in CPU processing power, Internet bandwidth and hard drive storage.
Although piracy cannot be stopped completely, Jun believes a combination of
proactive and reactive security approaches can mitigate the risk and reduce
losses to survivable levels. Content publishers facing piracy can apply
methods for high-assurance design that anticipate attacks and employ
architectures that enable a response after attacks happen. Jun's talk
discusses recent piracy trends, describes industry techniques and presents
current research in content security.

"Although numerous products and technologies have been advertised as
solutions to the problem of piracy, most commercial security systems fail
catastrophically once an implementation is compromised, making them
inappropriate solutions for deployment as part of a major standard, said
Jun. "Piracy, like credit card fraud and computer virus security, is a
problem that cannot be solved completely, and requires a flexible solution
that combines programmable security and 'smart content' with risk
management techniques such as forensic marking and attack response
capabilities."

Proactive security combines tamper resistance with high-assurance design to
combat known security vulnerabilities. Reactive systems provide effective
tools for responding to piracy after a problem develops. These results are
findings of the Cryptography Research Content Security Initiative, a
CRI-sponsored, multi-year research effort focusing on understanding and
controlling piracy, technology trends in consumer electronics and
next-generation applied techniques for high-assurance security.

"Content providers must face next-generation pirates by selecting
technology that avoids a repeat of painful past lessons," said Carter
Laren, senior security architect at Cryptography Research. "We are proud
that results from our Content Security Research Initiative are helping
leading companies secure their most valuable content."

Benjamin Jun's talk, "Piracy: Technology Trends and Responses," part of the
Implementers Educational Track at the RSA Conference Europe 2004, will be
presented on Friday, November 5, at 11:00 a.m. at the Princesa Sofia Hotel
in Barcelona, Spain.

Benjamin Jun is a vice president of engineering at Cryptography Research,
where he heads the consulting practice and the company's Content Security
Research Initiative. He leads engineering groups in the design, evaluation
and repair of high-assurance security modules for software, ASIC and
embedded systems. Ben holds B.S. and M.S. degrees from Stanford University,
where he is a Mayfield Entrepreneurship Fellow.
