http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/whistleblower_the_nsa_is_lying_us

National Security Agency whistleblower William Binney reveals he believes
domestic surveillance has become more expansive under President Obama than
President George W. Bush. He estimates the NSA has assembled 20 trillion
"transactions" b phone calls, emails and other forms of data b from
Americans. This likely includes copies of almost all of the emails sent and
received from most people living in the United States. Binney talks about
Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and challenges NSA Director Keith
Alexanderbs assertion that the NSA is not intercepting information about
U.S. citizens
