This is hilarious, the illiterate developing their own cryptosystems and
getting pwned.

Not being stupid doesn't mean one has to 'know everything'*, it's knowing
what you can and what you can't do. And yes, its a requirement. Even for
criminal endeavors.


* ignorance is fine, as long as one is aware of it.

Italy cracks Mafia sheep code to arrest Godfather&#39;s henchmen<br>
<br>
By Ella Ide 1 hour ago<br>
<br>
Rome (AFP) - Italian police on Monday arrested 11 suspects linked to the fu=
gitive head of the Sicilian Mafia, including a former boss who ran a secret=
 message system for the mobster using a sheep-based code.<br>
Matteo Messina Denaro, 53, who has been on the run since 1993, used a farm =
in Mazara del Vallo to communicate with his henchmen via the aged-old metho=
d of &quot;pizzini&quot;, bits of paper containing messages often written i=
n cipher, police said.<br>
Among those arrested was former boss Vito Gondola, 77, whose job it was to =
call the clan members to alert them to each new message, which was placed u=
nder a rock in a field at the farm and often destroyed on the spot after re=
ading.<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve put the ricotta cheese aside for you, will you come by later=
?&quot; he would say on the telephone -- a phrase investigators said had no=
thing to do with dairy products.<br>
&quot;The sheep need shearing... the shears need sharpening&quot; and &quot=
;the hay is ready&quot;, were among other code phrases used to alert the ga=
ng to a new message, written on tightly folded bits of paper wrapped in Sel=
lotape and then hidden in the dirt.<br>
The police investigation, which followed the passing of messages between 20=
11 and 2014, used hidden cameras and microphones around the farm near Trapa=
ni in western Sicily to follow the movements of the clan -- and discover De=
naro&#39;s fading glory.<br>

<br>
Gondola is caught in one conversation telling another mobster that Denaro -=
- once a trigger man who reportedly boasted he could &quot;fill a cemetery&=
quot; with his victims -- was losing control over the latest generation of =
criminals, who &quot;disappear without saying anything&quot;.<br>
- &#39;State win, Mafia loses&#39; -<br>
Three of those arrested were over 70 years old.<br>
The only known photos of Denaro date back to the early 1990s. He is believe=
d to be the successor of the godfathers Toto Riina and Bernardo Provenzano,=
 who are both serving life sentences, but less is known about him.<br>
At the height of his power he had a reputation as a flashy, ruthless womani=
ser who ruled over at least 900 men with an iron fist.<br>
View gallery<br>
<br>
The 11 suspects arrested &quot;were the men who were closest to Denaro righ=
t now,&quot; said police official Renato Cortese, adding that it was &quot;=
too early to say&quot; whether the sting would help investigators close in =
on the fugitive.<br>
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi thanked the investigators in a message on his F=
acebook page, saying onwards all, to finally capture the super-fugitive bos=
s,&quot; insisting &quot;Italy is united against organised crime&quot; desp=
ite a recent slew of corruption scandals in the country.<br>
&quot;The state wins, the Mafia loses,&quot; Interior Minister Angelino Alf=
ano said on Twitter.<br>
Gondola, who despite his age rose every morning at 4 am to tend to his floc=
k, is believed to have once been a right-hand man to Riina. In the 1970s he=
 belonged to a gang used by the Mafia to carry out kidnappings, according t=
o Italian media reports.<br>
The Sicilian Mafia, known as &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; or &quot;Our Thing&quo=
t;, was the country&#39;s most powerful organised crime syndicate in the 19=
80s and 1990s, but has seen its power diminish following years of investiga=
tions and mass arrests.<br>
It also faces fierce underworld competition from the increasingly powerful =
Naples-based Camorra and Calabria&#39;s &#39;Ndrangheta.<br>
