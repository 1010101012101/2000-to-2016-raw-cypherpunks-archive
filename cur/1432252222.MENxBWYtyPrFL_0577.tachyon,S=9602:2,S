There are two types of 'registration' of militia which may be useful
to consider - that by government (state or federal) and that by notice
given to government (probably to state and to federal) of the
body-of-people created by that body-of-people and named a "militia".

Begging the elected machinery to do the bidding may be successful.

Legal notice of actions on foot and of a reality "hereby established
by the people of REGION and formed as a militia in the meaning of the
federal constitution and in the name of NAME" gives notice of a (newly
created) reality.

We the people are with the right to petition our parliaments, but even
further, to give notice to the parliaments. The right to act pursuant
to our governing instruments, the constitution at the foundation (at
least in the USA), and to give notice of the formation of
body-of-people pursuant to those governing instruments, perhaps out be
exercised with caution and discretion, where the power of the people
is expanding, and where such exercise of such power might be seen as
interesting by our governments.

Legal notice, at various stages of entity-body-of-people creation,
with appropriate time frames for suitable response and ongoing
communication, engages those external government authorities in a way
which can create entitlement for, by, and of, the people. Sanction of
the force of numbers would likely also be needed to establish such
right as the right to bear (any and all) arms by an established
militia.

Such creations would of course require united intention of many of
we-the-people, over an extended period of time, along with a
willingness to handle the responses from the wider public and of the
various governments, at least state and federal.

I do not live in the USA, so good luck and $DEITY-speed :)
