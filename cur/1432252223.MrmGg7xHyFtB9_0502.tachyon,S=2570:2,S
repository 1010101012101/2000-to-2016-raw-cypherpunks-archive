You are real close right now.

You just issued the "sovereignty" rationalization for Saddam's
crimes, and your peculiar recollection of the speakers at those
Vietnam war demonstrations sounds like a marxist's
recollection, and of course theire are your regular call for
various groups to be sent up the chimney's, which presupposes
some benevolent vanguard group wise enough and virtuous enough
to identify which individuals belong to these undesirable
categories and need to go up the chimneys.

It is not that you never were close to being a communist, it is
that you have never been close to repenting, except on tax and
spend issues.

Apart from taxes, you are still as commie as ever.
