I'm not sure that that's true. I'm certainly not a test case, and I
won't hold up my circle of friends as one either.

But, being someone who just turned 30 and finding that my prescription
is drifting back in the general direction of "normal", I find that an
odd assertion.

I try to code for a living, when I'm not solving the
getting-projects-to-code problem. That involves me staring at a terminal
about 14 hours a day, on average. And my vision is getting better.
