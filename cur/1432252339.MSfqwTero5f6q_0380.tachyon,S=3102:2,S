Indeed, during the initial DESCrack effort, I spent some time
investigating FPGAs. I came to the conclusion that it was
definitely possible to build a Weiner-style pipeline machine
(ie, one key tested per clock cycle), but it would be more
costly than I could afford. 

One of the interesting twists of FPGAs is that you can
optimize the circuit to the actual data being processed. 
For example, in DES keysearch you could hardwire into
the circuit some of the subkey bits (which were determined
by, say, high order key bits you rarely changed), thus
simplifying the circuit. When those bits changed, you
re-wrote the circuilt.
