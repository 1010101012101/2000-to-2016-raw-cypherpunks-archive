Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
A|berta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbol - MOGI
Price - .455

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is selling for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for

3O 
miles from Sylvan Lake.  The initia| we|| is a 7,2O0-foot Peskisko Sand 
test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take 
approximately 
1O to 12 days to dri|| and test the initial well. Each development we|l
