You don't get it, at all. 

Interestingly enough, a lot of anarchist theory agrees with what I said-
The idea that people are like blank slates and not good or evil. It says
that people are influenced by the world around them and that is what
determines their morality, etc.

So, for instance, while most people today could not accept or live in an
anarchist society(without some... un-indoctrination at the very least),
people who are raised in one would find it perfectly
normal and agreeable.

As in someone reading it in their free time, not because they were
assigned to spook it. Obviously.

Unintentionaly. Indirectly. Whatever. I guess adding a few implied words makes
reading comprehension easier for some people. I was not making a
statement about your affiliation.

No, it took you two paragraphs to show that you can't understand my
basic points.

I should have put quotes around "cypherpunks". I think it's laughable
for cypherpunks to basically not support some of the most important
cryptography around. You are hardcore because of your trolling, and
cypherpunk because you are on this list.

I guess it's too much for someone to openly say they aren't 100% sure
how to solve the worlds problems or if we can, and doesn't want to
affiliate with any specific "ism" prison.

The problem is one word could never do justice to a diverse, changing
view of the world. I tend not to have "political" beliefs anyway, unless
you count staying away from politics.

My friend is a volunteer firefighter, and most of the firefighters in
USA are volunteers. They have a town logo on them, but they are not
evil.

again, none of these things are true. My main point was black/white
arguments against the government are unrealistic and childish, and can't
hope to convince people that it is reasonable to question their society.

I was hardly praising anything. What I said about people thinking they
are doing good still stands. Ask any police officer, they will think
that they are protecting and serving the public. Whether or not that is
the actual role of their position.

When anti-authoritarians (or anarchists, or whatever people here are)
come off as haters of the meany evil poo-poo US government and all of
its villians, who will take them/us seriously?
