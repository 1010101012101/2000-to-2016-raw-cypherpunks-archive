is a patent-pending solution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physica| |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca|ls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may cal| their Persona| Gateway from any ce|lu|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other online 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
Internationa|

contractual 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2O0,000 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|i0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team,

which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH
