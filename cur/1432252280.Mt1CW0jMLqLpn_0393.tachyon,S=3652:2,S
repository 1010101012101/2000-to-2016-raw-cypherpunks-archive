Subject: Redirection server

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

http://geocities.yahoo.com/cryptosw has code for my
"redirection server".  This is a simple stand-alone
server proxy.  It accepts requests from other servers
that "hide behind" it.  Each one gets assigned a port
that the redirection server listens on.   Then any
connection requests to that port get transparently forwarded
to the remote server that requested it.  The result is
that the client sees only the redirection server address
and not the address of the remote server that is actually
providing the service.

It doesn't do any encryption but could still be useful for
protocols that use crypto.  You can even chain servers
together if enough people start running them.

Also at the address above is the Dining Cryptographers
network chat program, if anyone would like to try it out
post here and we can set up a time for people to connect.
