When Chirac says .. this is the victory of law over tyranny ... let me tell you my story .. THE US GOVERNMENT ATTACKED ME, STOLE MY HOUSE, STOLE 70K USD AND HURT ME, ALTHOUGH I HAD NEVER DONE ENYTHING WRONG, BAD OR ILLEGAL .. ONLY COMMUNICATE ON THE INTERNET ...

U.S GOVERNMENT IS CRIMINAL, TYRANNY AND VIOLENT ... I HATE THE USA .....

AND BY THE WAY .. WHY DO YOU NOT PUT THOSE VIETNAM WAR PEOPLE TO THE TRIAL WHO KILLED INNOCENT PEOPLE IN VIETNAM AND COMMITTED WAR CRIMES ... WHY WHY AND ONCE MORE WHY ....

USA JUST KILLS PEOPLE ... !

                   Jacques Chirac, who was also at the press conference. 

                   "This is a victory of law over violence, of democracy over tyranny. It sounds
                   hope for justice and freedom in the world," he said. Western leaders have all
                   hailed the Serbian government's move to hand over Milosevic to the
                   international court, with the decision unlocking more than $1bn in international
                   aid.
