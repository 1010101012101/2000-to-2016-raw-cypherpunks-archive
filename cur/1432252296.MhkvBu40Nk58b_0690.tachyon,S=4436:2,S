Who brought plastic explosive into the Phoenix airport?  The police.   Who 
took it away, and where is it now?  They don't know.   Why is the airport 
still open, instead of being closed like it would be if somebody 
accidentally snuck a set of nail clippers through security?   Because it 
was the police that screwed up.

Explosives stolen at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport

by Eddi Trevizo - Sept. 4, 2011 09:46 PM
The Arizona Republic

A container with explosive equipment has been stolen from Sky Harbor 
International Airport during a Phoenix police training exercise.

Police said the explosives were taken from a low-security area before 
screening checkpoints.

The explosives were stolen Sept. 2 about 2:30 p.m. and though police have 
combed the airport several times, the equipment has not been recovered.

"It is very stable and cannot be detonated without additional equipment and 
some degree of expertise," Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman, said 
Sunday night.

Police described the container as a blue, soft-sided Igloo container with 
two half-pound tubes of Cast Booster explosives, which are commonly used in 
the mining industry.

The letters C and B are written in white letters on the bottom of the 
cooler and each explosive tube is about five inches tall and one and a half 
inches in diameter.

Police were conducting a routine training exercise with canines when the 
explosives were taken by an unknown person in Terminal 4 of the airport, 
said Thompson.

Officials said airport operations were not interrupted and that federal 
investigators have been notified.

"It is believed that these items were removed from the vicinity of the 
airport," said Thompson.

Anyone with information about the incident, or who knows the location of 
the explosives, is asked to call 602 262-6151 or Silent Witness at 
480-WITNESS or 480-TESTIGO for Spanish.
