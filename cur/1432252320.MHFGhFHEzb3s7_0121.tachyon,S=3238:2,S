Subject: [liberationtech] Technocracy Now event, August 23

I saw a blurb about this "Technocracy Now" event on another list and
thought it might be of interest to liberationtech.

It shows a deep and nuanced appreciation of irony to include Palantir
on a panel about government transparency and democracy. Case in point:

Technocracy Now
http://technocracynow.eventbrite.com/

Tuesday, August 23, 2011 from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM (PDT)
Mountain View, CA

A discussion about how technology is changing government transparency
and decision making with Ari Gesher (Palantir), Abhi Nemani (Code for
America), Matt Monahan (Inflection) and more. A great event if you are
interested in the civic space.
