Yes, but this is probably beyond current and foreseeable attacks. I 
don't dispute that all sorts of advanced attacks are possible, just that 
the fixes this guy suggested are "much better than doing nothing."

Even _secure_ OSes (KeyCOS, for example) are vulnerable to attacks when 
physical access is gained...doesn't make it easy, though.

This implies a level of surveillance/commitment beyond what most FBI 
attacks are at.

More importantly, theft of my iPod would then trigger certain actions. 
Cancelling my existing key and generation of a new one.

All of these kinds of "they've got your hardware" attacks are present 
with nearly all systems. All require more work than the simple insertion 
of a keystroke logger involves. It's all measures and countermeasures.
