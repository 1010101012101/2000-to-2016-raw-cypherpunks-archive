Police wind up Kernot email probe
The Australian Federal Police will take no further action on a complaint 
from former Labor MP Cheryl Kernot about unauthorised access to personal 
emails.

Ms Kernot had asked police to investigate how a journalist had obtained 
copies of emails used to reveal her affair with another former Labor MP 
Gareth Evans.

Police say electronic records tracing the emails are no longer available, 
so any further investigation would be unsuccessful.
