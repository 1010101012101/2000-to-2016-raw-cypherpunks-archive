   I'm a little bemused by the fact that there has been 
literally no comment on the closing of the cyberpass.net
node of the list, and none before that on the disappearing
without even so much as a notice by the admin of openpgp.net.
   Doesn't this seem at all odd to anyone else? Lance also
shutdown the remailer function at anonymizer -- is he leaving
the cypherpunk world altogether? Anyone know what happened to
Geiger?
