You're missing the fundamentals of conspiracy here -
the secret steganographically-hidden message in the Osama & Bert poster
*is* the picture of Bert :-)

But what does it *mean*?  Is it just to distract you from the fnords?
Osama doesn't use Occam's razor, after all.
Is it the basic principle that the reason you don't understand why
they've hidden Bert's picture in the picture of Bert
is that *that just shows how clever they are*?

Or is it something more subtle, more dangerous,
a denial of service attack cleverly designed to keep the experts
distracted by analyzing this South-West-Asian version of a koan,
looking beyond the picture of one puppet clapping to find the
invisible hand hidden inside, trying to see the fingerprints through
the cloth instead of looking around them at what's really happening
behind their backs.

Wheels within wheels, man.

By the way, there was iocaine powder in both glasses.
