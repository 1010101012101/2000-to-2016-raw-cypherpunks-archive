Not at all.  A tree has a root; the Internet doesn't have one.  Instead
you have several thousand autonomous systems interconnecting at a large
number of peering points.

For a long time, most traffic between European countries was routed
through Virginia.  This has improved only in the last few years.  In
the same way a lot of Pacific traffic still runs through California.
In each case what matters is not geography but politics and quixotic
regulations.

Within most countries the same sort of illogic applies.  In the UK, for
example, most IP traffic flows through London, and within London most IP
traffic flows through the Docklands area, a geographically small region of
East London.  It's fractal: even within Docklands, almost all traffic
flows through a handful of buildings, and there is a strong tendency for
most of that inter-building traffic to pass through a very small number of
ducts.

Very true -- but this has nothing to do with geodesics.

? City layouts that I am familiar with are either haphazard or built
around rings or some mixture of the two.  MFS built a US national ring,
a ring in New York City, a ring in London, and rings elsewhere in Europe.
Other carriers tended to follow the same pattern.

That's certainly true, but now you are talking about political decisions
made ages ago.  Many roads in England were built by the Romans.  These
roads lead to London.  You see the same pattern on the Continent, of
course, with the roads leading to the local capital (Paris, say) and then
on to Rome.  That is, fiber optic paths today reflect the strategic
requirements of the Roman Empire, not geometry.
