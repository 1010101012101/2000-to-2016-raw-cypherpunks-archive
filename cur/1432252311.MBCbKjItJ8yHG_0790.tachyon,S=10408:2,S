I wasn't speaking of "security through obscurity," I was speaking of
"security through First Amendment law suit." Nobody could argue "objective
chill" in here, that's a legal concept....but clearly, you aren't
interested.

Well, that figures.

Conversational economics and privacy -- what I should have said. Posed as an
explanation for some surveillance law. See An Economic Theory Of Privacy,
Richard A. Posner. The same Judge Posner of Torres case fame. "There is no
right to be left alone while assembling bombs in safe houses." United States
v. Torres, 751 F.2d 875 (7th Cir.1984). Not a theory I subscribe to.

Right back atcha.

I didn't say IP addys were nonsense, Tim. I overhead some silly biometric
conversation and mentioned it because Ray mentioned IPs.

Certainly.

Why, thank you, Tim.

Dammit, I didn't say that.

I said: "I've seen predictions that by 2005-7, your IP will be biometrically
associated. (I have nothing to back to that up, but the source was
credible.)"

It was a mere reference to Bear mentioning IPs and third-party
intermediaries... (Hence, the cites.)  I didn't say anything about
remailers.

Indeed, what I was trying to get at might have been "somewhat related."

I agree with you in sentiment, but direct your attention to the CMRA
(commercial mail drop) requirements for domestic mail agency in the United
States in the USPS Domestic Mail Manual. I know you are aware of it.

Okay, well, I did learn something there.

Bear just mentioned IP and I just threw out the biometric comment. I was
curious, since it did not make sense to me. I made no mention of remailers.

*sigh* I didn't. Spoliation is a general concept. My comments were general
in nature. I don't think I used the word "remailer." You frequently rant off
into legal areas when you haven't briefed the law, Tim.

Now you are extrapolating. You didn't 'hurt my feelings' - you are just
gigging me. Furthermore, I wasn't looking for "moral support." And,
certainly not in here. :-)
