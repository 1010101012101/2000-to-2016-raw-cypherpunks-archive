	I am right. And you admited that anonimity systems don't work.

	What a fucktard you are. It's clear again that your writing
	skills suck.
	
	"I also believe that they may eventually reduce state power
	substantially. " 

	So they don't work
	
	"It works for many people." 

	So you contadicted yourself. But don' worry. You got it right
	the first time. Anonimity systems don't work.

	Because it is correct.

	But tor is 'the best'. So if even 'the best' is a failure, then 
	the rest of systems are going to be even more of a failure.
	That's like the A of the ABC of basic logic.

	Right. You are a 'nihilist' eh? As long as you can buy dmt it's
	OK for the pentagon to fuck as many people as they can.
