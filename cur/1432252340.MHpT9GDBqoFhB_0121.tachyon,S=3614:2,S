Hi Declan. 

What's the purpose of sending this to the cypherpunks list?

Do you intend it as an example of Silly Congress Tricks?

While I have a general unease about government getting involved in
anything as they're too likely to muck it up, toxic mold does appear
to potentially be a serious problem.   A quick Google search uncovers a
large number of references to toxic mold problems... scientific papers,
news stories, and even frightening statements like:

< "Mold is everywhere," according to San Francisco attorney Sara Thorpe.
< "There are no specific government guidelines and not a whole lot of
< medical information on it. It's ripe for lawyers to get into and expand it."

(http://www.enn.com/news/wire-stories/2000/10/10062000/upi_mold_32232.asp)

if the lawyers are into it, government won't be far behind.
There appear to be _five_ different bills pending in California
including one sponsored by a home builders association.
