      Hey, Retardo -- when did you ever check? If you had, you'd know
that you can't reply to anon remailers. Try replying to this, you clueless
shit. Now shut the fuck up about this bullshit, we're all tired of the
subject, and if you can't be bothered to check the archives, get the fuck
off the list.
