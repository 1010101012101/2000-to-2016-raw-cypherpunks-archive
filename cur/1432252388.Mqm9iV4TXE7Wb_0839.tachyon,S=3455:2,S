Two items which may have only slight relevance to the list. I've been 
waiting for an opportunity to mention them in context...

First, Judea Pearl's "Causality." A mix of logic, AI, and ontology. 
Closely related to issues of belief and causality. (Some of you may 
know of my interest in Dempster-Shafer belief theory...this is 
closely related.)

Second, just watched "Lola rennt," aka "Run, Lola, Run," for the 
fourth or fifth time. Saw it in a theater the first time, a year or 
so ago.

It's interesting that German is so willing to absorb new language 
terms, completely unlike French. English has embraced foreign 
expressions, and so, it seems, has German.

Of these two points, the Pearl book is more significant, ultimately. 
But the film has its place.

Sorry there is no "crypto significance" here. No S-box details, no 
Rijndael details. TS.
