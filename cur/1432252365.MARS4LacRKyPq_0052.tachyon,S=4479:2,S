These regimes are likely to suspect conspiracies whether or not they are
actually occurring. Look at our McCarthy era. Assume the jumper cables
will be applied whether there are secret messages or not. If you want to
actually communicate then you have to risk SOMETHING.

Scatter-gather is just a mechanism to handle arbitrary sizes of messages
and add some potential cover traffic. It is no less safe than any single
exchange of stego data. Possibly it is more safe since the data density
in the carriers can be made very low and an observer cannot easily
isolate a complete carrier set from the cover traffic.
