If you rent your house, and the renters cause you to get billed
for something they do, you can certainly pass on the cost to
the renter.  If you get a ticket in a rented car, you (not the
car owner) reimburse the owner.  If your ISP gets a lot
of complaints about your usage, they *could* pass on the
cost to you.  An ISP could regard its court-ordered hassles
(or other hassles, eg attacks launched from your node) as your fault.
