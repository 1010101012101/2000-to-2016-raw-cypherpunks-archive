What about a CDR node that strips all to:/from: info before sending it
out? A 'cypherpunks_anon@...' w/ replyto: set to itself. Would that be an
acceptable approach?

It could be made closed so that only subscribers could use it (which
implies the info functions would be disabled), or open so that anyone
could use it.
