Russ: 

Take off your economic hat, and try on a law-enforcement one.

With DMCA, etal, the tools to get around TCPA's taking of your
right to use your property as you please have been criminalized.
(Don't argue that TCPA will always be voluntary. I don't beleive 
that).

I have little patience with arguments which say 'Yeah, they can
make X against the law, but clever people like me can always
get around it, and won't get caught, so I don't care.'

Maybe you can, some of the time, but that's not the point. Most
people won't, either because it's too hard, they don't know what
they've lost, or because of a misplaced respect for the whims of 
The Men with Guns. This is not a Good Thing.

A freedom to skulk in the shadows, hoping not to be noticed, is not
the legacy I wish to leave behind.

Peter Trei
