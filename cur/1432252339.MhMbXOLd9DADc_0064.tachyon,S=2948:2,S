As an addendum I would add Claude Shannon.  In fact I can't think of a single lawyer in the 20th century who had the long term influesnce on society that either Shannon or von Neumann did.  The list of other influential non-lawyers might also be expanded to include Turing, Godel, von Braun, Crick and Watson.  Washington's myopia in thinking olny lawyers are worth listening to is indicative of the type of government we have.
