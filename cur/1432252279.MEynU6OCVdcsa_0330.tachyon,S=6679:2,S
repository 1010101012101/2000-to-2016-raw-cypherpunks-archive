Sorry, poor choice of language on my part. True, the bill of rights doesn't 
actually *assign* rights- it prohibits the federal government from making any 
laws that restrict them. Reading from amendments 1-10, and the othe articles 
of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights doesn't apply to the states- and this 
was legal fact until the passage of the 14th amendment. But that 14th stated 
that (paraphrasing here) "no state may deny a citizen due process of law". 
The Supreme Court interpreted this (in effect, adding foot notes to the 
constitution) to mean that the Bill of Rights now applied to the states. I 
know that nowhere in the Constitution does it say that "states must honour 
the bill of rights". But look in Supreme Court decisions (which, legally, are 
pretty much an extension of the constitution). There, it is *clearly* stated 
that the Bill of Right's restrictions of the federal government's powers 
applies to the states as well. So when you say that the Constitution only 
says that states laws must be representative, you are ignoring the 14th 
amendment, and what it does to the relationthip between state governments and 
their citizens. But yeah, that's all I'm trying to say. Enough is enough.
