Call me a moron, but what do you mean here? I had figured that "A.
Melon" was the nym of one individual, "Nomen Nescio" was the nym of one,
probably other, individual, and so on. Are "A Melon" etc group nyms,
like "Publius" of the US Federalist Papers? Does some anonymizer give
the same name for everyone who uses it?
