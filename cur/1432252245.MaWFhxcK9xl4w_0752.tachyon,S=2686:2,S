someone here once said...assume you were being
monitored to see if you "run" with the seeded assassination memes, if only
for analytical purposes. These matters are taken seriously by those charged
with the care of protected persons. (Contrary to what some here would have
you believe, subtlety can get you a much higher threat-rating than overtly
threatening correspondence.)
Lets assume that thats true and all those 'charged' are busty elsewhere;I 
propose a 'guess the death date
lottery' for jeff gordon.I pledge to pay 100 US $ to the person or persons 
unknown who predicts the time the
closest.Heres looking at you kid.
