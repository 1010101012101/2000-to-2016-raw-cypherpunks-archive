    Why does bin Laden hate?

    Despite the fact Webster's defines sociopath ==
    psychopath: anyone who hates is a sociopath; anyone who
    hates with violence is a psychopath. Therefore, does bin
    Laden really hate? --or does he have a mission based on
    his malevolent interpretation of the Koran as an excuse
    to establish a religious dictatorship even more rigid
    and vicious than Ayatollah Khomemi in 1979?<p>

    A psychopath destroys from lack of emotion to external
    events and has a lack of reaction to averse stimuli
    --eg: no startle reflex.  Therefore psychopaths may be
    predisposed to violence because they do not experience
    emotions that would inhibit such behavior. <p>

    bin Laden is another form of a Hitler or a Stalin.
    Hitler at least had a vision of providing a good life
    for his people and was an unabashed technocrat; Stalin
    at least tried to build a nation despite the pogroms. <p>

    bin Laden may claim to be building an Islamic utopia,
    but at least 50% of the population is proscribed a less
    than Dark Ages existence. bin Laden intends to turn the
    clock back at least 1300 years into a single purpose
    theocracy and anyone who resists is an Infidel:
    Christian, Jewish, Hindu, and even moderate Muslims
    and will either convert at the point of the sword or be
    killed. <p>

    bin Laden supposedly has a soft, disarming voice,
    appearing as a man of peace and calm --like a
    psychopathic killer before he strikes. Byron York, like
    others, can analyze bin Laden's demands and declare
    there are finite boundaries --there are not, absolute
    power corrupts absolutely and psychopathic fanatics will
    never be satiated. <p>

    The professors may try to explain bin Laden's
    frustrations, grievances, and objectives, and the
    politicians may try to play politics, but the bottom
    line in the real world is that it us or him/them --a
    war not only of civilization, but also of secular power
    vs. theocratic dictatorship.

    Although there are questions about its provenance and
    precise translation, the statement by Osama bin Laden
    that was broadcast Sunday on Al-Jazeera, the Arabic
    television network, will be closely studied by American
    experts as they search for clues to bin Laden's
    motivations. <p>

    Released as American missiles and bombs began to rain
    down on Afghanistan, bin Laden's statement sheds new
    light on a number of issues that have been the subject
    of widespread speculation in the United States. For
    example, his words add new evidence to the debate over
    the extent to which U.S. support for Israel was a motive
    for bin Laden's September 11 terrorist attacks on New
    York and Washington. <p>

    The competing arguments in the dispute can be summed up
    in two headlines on the Wall Street Journal editorial
    page. One, "Know Thy Enemy: Israel Isn't the Issue," was
    the title of an essay by Norman Podhoretz that appeared
    on September 20. The other, "They Hate Us Because They
    Hate Israel," by David Gelernter, appears today. Bin
    Laden's statement shows that both theories are
    incomplete. <p>

    First, his words suggest that Israel plays a significant
    role in his actions.  In his summation, according to the
    New York Times translation of his words, bin Laden says,
    "I swear to God that America will not live in peace
    before peace reigns in Palestine, and before all the
    army of infidels depart the land of Mohammad." That
    appears to place the Israeli issue on a par with the
    subject of American forces in Saudi Arabia, another bin
    Laden obsession. <p>

    Earlier in his statement, bin Laden says that, "Israeli
    tanks rampage across Palestine, in Ramallah, Rafah and
    Beit Jala and many other parts of the land of Islam, and
    we do not hear anyone raising his voice or reacting."
    And in a third passage, bin Laden refers to the
    attackers of September 11 as Muslims who "have stood in
    defense of their weak children, their brothers and
    sisters in Palestine and other Muslim nations." After
    this, it seems impossible to argue that Israel isn't a
    major issue for bin Laden. <p>

    At the same time, bin Laden's statement makes clear he
    has other obsessive grievances against the United
    States. It has been widely reported that he hates the
    presence of the U.S. military in his native Saudi
    Arabia, home of Islam's holiest sites.  His statement
    about the "army of infidels" in the land of Mohammad is
    echoed in another portion of his speech, in which he
    says that the "wind of faith is blowing and the wind of
    change is blowing to remove evil from the Peninsula of
    Mohammad." <p>

    There are several other statements that allude generally
    to the Gulf War and its aftermath. Bin Laden refers to
    "a million innocent children are dying at this time as
    we speak, killed in Iraq without guilt. We hear no
    denunciation...." Later, bin Laden again refers to the
    "million children," and says American did not care about
    their deaths but became angry when "a few more than ten
    were killed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam," a reference
    to bin Laden's 1998 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies
    in Kenya and Tanzania. <p>

    Then there is America's role in enlisting the help of
    Muslim nations in the war on terrorism. "Every Muslim
    after this event [should fight for their religion]," bin
    Laden says. They should target "the head of
    international infidels, Bush," and "those who turned
    even the countries that believe in Islam against us." <p>

    Finally, bin Laden's speech also sheds some light on the
    arguments made by President Bush, most eloquently in his
    September 20 address to a joint session of Congress.
    "They hate our freedoms," the president said. "Our
    freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, or freedom
    to vote and assemble and disagree with each - other."
    Perhaps those factors do underlie bin Laden's thinking -
    they are undoubtedly some of the things that make
    Americans "infidels" - but they are not included in his
    bill of particulars. Rather, bin Laden's speech suggests
    that he hates America for a variety of specific
    reasons. There's no single cause.<br><br>
