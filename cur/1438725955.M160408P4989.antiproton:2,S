Constitution Check: Does cellphone privacy follow its owner=E2=80=99s wande=
rings?=20
Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center=E2=80=99s constitutional l=
iteracy adviser, examines a case that has just arrived at the Supreme Court=
 about police access to cellphone location data stored on cellphone towers.=
=20
View photo.THE STATEMENT AT ISSUE:=20
=E2=80=9CAs technology advances, location information from cellphones (and,=
 of course, smartphones) will undoubtedly become more precise and easier to=
 obtain, and if there is no expectation of privacy here, I have some concer=
ns about the government being able to conduct 24/7 electronic tracking (liv=
e or historical) in the years to come without an appropriate judicial order=
.=C2=A0 And I do not think I am alone in this respect.=E2=80=9D=20
=E2=80=93 Excerpt from an opinion by a federal judge, Adalberto Jordan of t=
he U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, limiting his support for=
 a ruling by that court rejecting a Florida man=E2=80=99s Fourth Amendment =
challenge to federal investigators=E2=80=99 monitoring of the places where =
he used a cellphone over a continuous span of more than two months.=C2=A0 T=
hat individual has now filed an appeal at the Supreme Court.=20
WE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND=E2=80=A6=20
For nearly a half-century, it has been true that a private individual carri=
es around as a kind of personal constitutional shield a right of privacy.=
=C2=A0 As the Supreme Court put it in a famous decision in 1967, =E2=80=9Cw=
herever a man may be, he is entitled to know that he will remain free from =
unreasonable searches and seizures.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0 All that is necessary to=
 have that shield available as that individual moves about, the court said =
then, is that he or she is doing something that they personally regard as p=
rivate, and that society in general would agree that it should be private.=
=20
In technical constitutional terms, that decision in Katz v. United States =
=E2=80=93 extending protection to what an individual said while using a pub=
lic telephone booth =E2=80=93 was the origin of the idea that the Fourth Am=
endment protects =E2=80=9Ca reasonable expectation of privacy.=E2=80=9D Tha=
t amendment, the court said, =E2=80=9Cprotects people, not places.=E2=80=9D=
=20
In the case of the telephone booth, the caller may have been entirely visib=
le through the glass doors, but was still expecting that the actual message=
s spoken into the telephone were meant to be heard only by the person on th=
e other end.=20
It is too much to say, however, that the individual never loses that privac=
y once the activity moves outside the enclave of the home into the larger w=
orld.=C2=A0 The catch is that part of the test that says society must share=
 the perception that the activity does deserve to remain private.=C2=A0 Eve=
n in that 1967 ruling, the court was careful to say that =E2=80=9Cwhat a pe=
rson knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is no=
t a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.=E2=80=9D=20
That, of course, makes the protection of that amendment depend in part on t=
he specific action the individual takes to show that the activity was meant=
 to be private =E2=80=93 such as closing the door on the telephone booth.=
=20
Complicating the constitutional question, however, is the situation when an=
 individual tries to keep something private, but strangers (=E2=80=9Cthird =
parties,=E2=80=9D in the language of law) learn of that activity.=C2=A0 Tha=
t was the scenario that the Supreme Court encountered in 1979, when it allo=
wed law enforcement officers to obtain from a telephone company the numbers=
 that a user had dialed.=20
That, the Justices ruled in the case of Smith v. Maryland, was not even a s=
earch under the Fourth Amendment, because the individual gave up the privac=
y about those numbers merely by dialing; that allowed a record to be made i=
n the files of the company.=C2=A0 Besides, the court added, the officers di=
d not learn much from that data; they could not even be sure that any call =
actually had connected.=20
Lately, though, that part of Fourth Amendment law is being reexamined in th=
e courts, as changes in technology make it far more likely that a person=E2=
=80=99s activities in public can be tracked much more closely, and thus mor=
e intrusively.=20
Three years ago, the Supreme Court for the first time examined what it mean=
s to privacy that police can use a tracking device, linked to globe-circlin=
g satellites, to trace the movement of a suspect=E2=80=99s car, and thus so=
me of the activities of the car=E2=80=99s driver.=C2=A0 The decision in Jon=
es v. United States was limited, based on a theory that installation of the=
 device was a =E2=80=9Ctrespass,=E2=80=9D but it has come to stand for two =
larger principles: first, that officers should get a warrant before they do=
 such monitoring, and, second, that technology can definitely change the Fo=
urth Amendment equation about what is private.=20
Last year, the court went further in this examination, concluding that poli=
ce should get a warrant before they check out the stored contents of a cell=
phone that police take away from an individual they have arrested.=C2=A0 Wh=
at is logged on a cellphone, the Justices said, can include a vast amount o=
f intensely personal data, and police access to that should only be allowed=
 if a judge has found a good reason to issue a search warrant to get at it.=
=20
The next step in this constitutional evolution has just arrived in an appea=
l to the Supreme Court, in the case of Davis v. United States.=C2=A0 It is =
a test of the privacy =E2=80=93 or lack of it =E2=80=93 of the information =
that police may gather by checking stored data on cellphone towers located =
around a community.=C2=A0 The majority of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the=
 Eleventh Circuit decided that this did not even implicate the Fourth Amend=
ment, because an individual has no =E2=80=9Creasonable expectation of priva=
cy=E2=80=9D in the location data; that is a record kept by the tower operat=
or, the telephone company, and the individual whose calls were logged gave =
it up merely by using his cellphone.=20
The data, covering 67 continuous days of use on that cellphone, was technic=
ally so refined and detailed that it actually placed the user =E2=80=93 Qua=
rtavius Davis =E2=80=93 at the scene of a series of robberies of local busi=
nesses in the Miami, Fla., area.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Davis=E2=80=99s lawyers have =
calculated that the towers yielded more than 11,000 bits of data about wher=
e he was when he made or got a call.=C2=A0 The data was used to convict him=
 of a series of federal crimes, and his lawyers failed to get that excluded=
 from his case on a theory that it invaded his right of privacy in his move=
ments, so should have been barred unless police had a search warrant.=20
Taking that case on to the Supreme Court, his attorneys argued that the Jus=
tices needed to step in now =E2=80=9Cto ensure that the Fourth Amendment do=
es not become a dead letter as police accelerate their warrantless access t=
o rich troves of sensitive personal location data.=E2=80=9D=20
The court is expected to act on the case early in the next term.
