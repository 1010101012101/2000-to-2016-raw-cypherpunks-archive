In my home town the P.O. got in a snit 'cause the local newspaper was putting 
its paper in people's mailboxes. Solution ? People put up separate boxes for 
the paper.

I think you still have to get some sort of certification from the P.O. if you 
want to manufacture or  sell a box to be used as a mailbox. Go figure. 

I always liked my friends idea of solving the green house effect by requiring 
everyone in the US to permanently store the junk mail they receive thus 
storing the CO2 in the paper (that or requring everyone to stop breathing for 
 5 minutes).
