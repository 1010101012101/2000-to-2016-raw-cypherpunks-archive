Bill is of course welcome to invite the neighbor's kids to steal his 
stuff.

My mileage varies.

I think it is a moral necessity to kill anyone trying to steal anything 
(beyond the utterly trivial or confusable, e.g., one should not kill 
someone picking up a toy left out in the yard...might be a mistake, he 
might be trying to return it, etc.).

Someone stealing a television or PC has certainly earned killing.

This is what strong crypto will make more possible: the deliverance of 
strong vengeance, untraceably. (Hint: This preceeded Jimbell by many 
years.) Fact is, many people have already earned killing. The only 
reason we cannot dispose of them is that liberal shits interfere with 
vengeance.

Again, my mileage varies. And since I decide what is important to me, 
it's "my house, my rules."

I don't mind that  a lot of people are liberal pansies who believe 
thieves are not worthy of killing. However, if they help to pass laws 
restricting my own choices, then they have earned killing themselves.

Certainly nearly every member, with but a handful of exceptions, of 
Congress has earned the death penalty many times over.
