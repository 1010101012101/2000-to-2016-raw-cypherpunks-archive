How many attacks have there been based on automatic trust of
verisign's feckless ID checking?   Not many, possibly none.

That is not the weak point, not the point where the attacks
occur.   If the browser was set to accept self signed
certificates by default, it would make little difference to
security.

A wide variety of ways of getting big name certificates that
one should not have, have been discovered.   Attackers never
showed much interest.
