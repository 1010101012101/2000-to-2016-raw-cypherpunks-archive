One still wonders if a point-of-contact approach could work in some of these 
situations.

As an example, how different would Nazi Germany have been if male Jews above 
18 agreed to kill at least one nazi Soldier or obvious cooperator each?

Likewise, any possibility of honey-potting and then baseballbatting the 
scumbags who are writing these letters?

In other words, if the simple day-to-day employees (who don't have combat 
training) of these agencies knew they were taking their life into their 
hands by asking for such information, would this still be happening?

Kind of a reverse-rubber-hose approach to democracy.
