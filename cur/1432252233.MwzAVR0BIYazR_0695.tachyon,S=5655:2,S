The point is, it's not fair to punish someone for a genetic defect
that isn't his or her fault.  The U.S. medical care system is set up
in such a way that insurance is necessary, because if you don't have
insurance, and you can't pay for treatment, then you're screwed.
Therefore, if we want to keep the system the way it is, but still
maintain a healthy population, we must remove the possibility for
insurance companies to deny coverage.  Either that, or revamp the
medical system, and get rid of insurance altogether.

I don't see it as unreasonable if it saves lives.

That's basically my argument.

Their desire to make money is secondary.  The medical industry exists
(in theory) to save lives and keep people healthy.  That is the first priority.

So what?  Insurance companies have loads of customers.  Spreading the
cost out among all of them, each person would only have to pay a small
amount extra.  I can live with that.
