What an aggravating show , most disapointing. But then I am not really
surprised. On the one side ,you had persons from EMI , Mavrick , and Ira
Dean from some country band , and on the other , you had John Perry
Barlow from the EFF , as Well as Chuck D. The show was moderated by Leo
Laporte ,and interviews done by Mickela Perria(sp).

So , the usual suspects spouting their own opinions ,and party lines.
The upshot is that the recording industry is still fighting a rear guard
action , wishing to move the downloading over to a pay per download biz
model.
