Hmm, pseudo-conspiratorial indeed, to say the least.

I certainly noticed the fact that Rijndael was not mentioned in the Hitachi
claim.  However, so did Bruce Schneier, and he pointed out that Rijndael's
ShiftRow operation is in fact a rotation, and so it should be also be
covered by Hitachi's claims.  Therefore, all AES finalists were
seemingly equally endangered.  I personally find Hitachi's claims absurd, and I
wanted to know whether NIST thought the same way as I did.

However, I think you might use the 21st century US legal system to manifest your
concerns, if indeed you have any, that Hitachi's patent hindered the choice of
any other algorithm (as this was rumoured a few days ago in this list -- I
wonder who posted it, don't you, Vin?), against NIST's own statement on the
contrary, made in the final report available from NIST's web site.

I'll bet most people that were committed (perhaps financially) to
any other of the finalists will show a reaction similar to yours. Well, this
reaction is not unexpected anyway -- just remember that saying about Greeks and
Trojans.

Auguri,

Paulo.
