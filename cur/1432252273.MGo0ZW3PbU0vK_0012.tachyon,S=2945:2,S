And of course, that's a perfectly legitimate choice.  Even in my case, I
wouldn't repeat that response.  Different times, different situation.
Today, though, I'd still want to know what they were after, so I'd step out
of my door, close it, then engage them long enough to question them, then
bid them a good day.
