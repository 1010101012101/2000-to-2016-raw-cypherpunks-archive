Subcommander Bob,

You might get promoted to full commander if you'd learn to attribute quotes
properly.  The quote you attributed to me was excerpted from a newsletter
written by Joe Burns, Ph.D.   If you'd like to relate your wisdom to him,
his contact information can be found at:  http://www.htmlgoodies.com/ .

My view is that BS like Burns is proposing precipitates the things he's
whining about.
