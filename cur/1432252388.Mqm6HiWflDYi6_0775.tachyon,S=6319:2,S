Many of those who have been quibbling about whether "freedom fighters" 
are terrorists, or whether Osama bin Laden is or is not a FF, etc., are 
MISSSING THE BIG PICTURE.

Take the long view, the more agnostic view. Whether one likes the 
actions of bin Laden or Pablo Escobar or James Jesus Angleton is not the 
point

Privacy and untraceability tools will be used by many who are seeking to 
evade others. Some we are taught in American schools are heroes, some we 
are taught are villains.
