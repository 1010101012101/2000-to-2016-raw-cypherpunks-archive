Looks like the "toast" and "goner" comments are right on...as expected.

I've been watching a press conference of D.C. politicos, mayor and 
company, on CNN. Looks like several inhalational anthrax cases 
confirmed, and *two deaths* of postal workers over the weekend with 
"suspicious" symptoms and test results.

(Don't know if one of them is the postal worker already diagnosed with 
inhalational anthrax since last Friday...it's possible this is one of 
the people. Sounds like the two deaths were of others, though, with 
anthrax only being suspected post mortem.)

Expect more chaos, then.

And more police state measures.
