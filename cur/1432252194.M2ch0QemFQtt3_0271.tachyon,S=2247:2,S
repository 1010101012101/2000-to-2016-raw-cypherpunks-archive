If you pay taxes, you are a terrorist.  Even if you pay them under
threat
of violence, as most do.

9/11 was a commando/specops operations against an invader on par
with Rome.  If the US were invaded by troops from Arabia, one would
expect that American Patriots (tm) would perform similar military
actions.

What part of "beware foreign entanglements" does Congress have a
comprehension
problem with?

Give part of germany to the jews, and give palestine back to the arabs,
and blame the history of British imperialism.  Buy whatever oil, hash,
carpets you find on the free market.
