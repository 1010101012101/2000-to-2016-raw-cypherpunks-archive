New EDRi members
============================================================

At the EDRi General Assembly of 30 October 2010 in Barcelona, Spain, EDRi
welcomed two new members.

The Panoptykon Foundation is a Polish organisation focusing on human rights,
in particular the right to privacy, in the clash with modern technology used
for surveillance purposes. The NGO wants to analyse the risks associated
with the operation of modern surveillance systems, monitor the actions of
both public and private entities and intervene when human rights or
democratic values are threatened.

The Liga voor Mensenrechten (Human Rights League) has a focus on human
rights in Belgium and a campaigner of privacy, including the organisation of
the Big Brother Awards.

EDRi now has 29 members that are based or have offices in 18 different
European countries, all within the territory of the Council of Europe.

1. Google admits it was gathering passwords and emails via StreetView
============================================================

Google faces further investigation in the UK and Italy, after it has
publicly admitted in a blog post on 22 October 2010 that its StreetView
service has gathered more data than intended, "in some instances entire
emails and URLs were captured, as well as passwords."

The UK Data Protection Authority - Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
has decided to reopen its investigation on Google over the personal data
gathering by its StreetView system. Initially, in July 2010, ICO declared it
would not take measures against Google, considering that the company could
not have gathered much personal data with its StreetView vehicles while
mapping Wi-Fi networks in the areas they covered.

However, according to an investigation carried out by Canada's Privacy
Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart, it appears that Google has gathered, in this
way, entire emails, highly sensitive personal information and even
passwords. As Google admitted Stoddard's allegations, ICO is now
reconsidering its position.

"Now that these findings are starting to emerge, we understand that Google
has accepted that in some instances entire URLs and emails have been
captured. We will be making enquires to see whether this information relates
to the data inadvertently captured in the UK, before deciding on the
necessary course of action, including a consideration of the need to use our
enforcement powers," was ICO's statement.

While Google stated that the data was collected by error because of a code
being included in the Street View software by mistake, during a two-hour UK
parliamentary debate on privacy on 28 October 2010, MPs discussed the issue
and accused of Google of having deliberately collected WiFi data for
commercial gain.

Ed Vaizey, the UK communications minister said that although Google could
still be fined for collecting the WiFi data without people's knowledge, as
the offence had occurred before the entering into force of the legislation
giving ICO the power to levy punishments of up to 575 000 euro, the fine
would probably be much lower. He also added that for any future services
such as StreetView, Internet companies would be asked to establish "ground
rules" together with the ICO, before starting projects that might endanger
privacy.

Italy also started an investigation against Google for potential invasions
of privacy in its Street View online mapping service. "Italian citizens will
be informed of the presence of Google cars taking pictures of places and
individuals to be posted online via the StreetView service," stated the
Italian Data protection authority on 25 October 2010, adding that Google
StreetView vehicles would have to be "clearly marked by means of visible
stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for
the purposes of StreetView."

The Italian privacy authority also imposed Google to previously list, to the
public media, the neighbourhoods its cars would photograph. The
non-compliance would bring the company a fine of up to 1 800 euro.

In the meantime, in Germany, over 244 000 residents have specifically
requested that the images of their households be removed from
StreetView. While Google seemed to be happy that just 3% of the population
used the opt-out system, the number shows the huge interest in privacy of
German citizens.

"Going to a website, and entering all this information it takes a hell of a
lot of time and effort, and I am just staggered by this 200 000 plus
(number)," explained Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger, a professor of Internet
Governance and Regulation at Oxford University, to Deustche Welle.

2. ECJ decides private copying levies are not allowed for business use
============================================================

On 21 October 2010, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decided that private
copying levies on blank CDs, MP3 players and other digital media are allowed
under EU copyright law only when charged on goods sold to individuals but
not to companies.

ECJ ruled that "the application of the 'private copying levy' to
reproduction media acquired by undertakings and professionals for purposes
other than private copying is not compatible with European Union law. Such a
levy may be applied to such media when they are liable to be used by natural
persons for their private use".

In some European countries the unauthorised copying of works that a person
legitimately owns is allowed, on the condition that it is for private use.
The European Copyright Directive permits this, provided there is fair
compensation to the copyright holders. The compensation can be ensured by
charging a levy on the media (such as discs or media players used for
copying material) which is then distributed to rights holders through
collection societies.

ECJ thus ruled against the Spanish collective rights management agency SGAE
(Sociedad General de Autores y Editores) which had won a case filed against
Padawan, a store distributing discs and other devices, for unpaid copyright
levies. Padawan had claimed that the indiscriminate application of the levy
was not compatible with EU law and appealed the decision. The appeals court
asked the ECJ to rule on this case in relation to European law.

"The purpose of fair compensation is to compensate authors adequately for
the use made of their protected works without their authorisation. In order
to determine the level of that compensation, account must be taken as a
'valuable criterion' - of the 'possible harm' suffered by the author as a
result of the act of reproduction concerned, although prejudice which is
'minimal' does not give rise to a payment obligation. The private copying
exception must therefore include a system 'to compensate for the prejudice
to rightholders'," said the ruling.

ECJ considered the level of fair compensation was linked to "the harm
resulting for the author from the reproduction for private use of his
protected work without his authorisation." And therefore "fair compensation
must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by the author."

A levy was a reasonable mechanism for private individuals who were likely to
use material to copy and who should pay for the harm caused to authors, but
this should not be applied to other sales because the levy could not be
applied indiscriminately.

"The indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to all types of
digital reproduction equipment, devices and media, including cases in which
such equipment is acquired by persons other than natural persons for
purposes clearly unrelated to private copying, is incompatible with the
directive."

3. EC refers Austria to ECJ for lack of independence of DPA
============================================================

Since a complaint was filed by the data protection association Arge Daten
back in October 2003, the lack of adequate independence of the Austrian Data
Protection Authority (DSK - Datenschutzkommission) has been on the European
Commission's (EC) agenda.

Years later, in 2009, the Commission asked Austria, in a reasoned opinion
under EU infringement procedures, to revise the way the authority is
organised. However, as the Austrian authorities failed to comply with the
reasoned opinion and the Commission has decided to refer Austria to the
European Court of Justice (ECJ). This decision was officially published on
28 October 2010.

The Commission considers that provisions setting up the Austrian data
protection authority do not conform to EU rules, which require Member States
to establish a completely independent supervisory body to monitor the
application of the 1995 Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC).

Although the Austrian data protection legislation (Datenschutzgesetz 2000)
spells out that the authority exercises its functions independently and
takes no instruction in its performance, the Commission considers that
"complete independence," as required under EU data protection rules, is not
guaranteed because:

- the authority remains under the supervision of the Federal Chancellery
as integrated into the Chancellery in terms of organisation and
staff: it controls neither its own staffing nor its equipment and it does
not have its own budget;

- since its creation in 1980, the authority has been run by a senior
official of the Chancellery as executive member ("geschdftsf|hrendes
Mitglied"), subject to the supervision of the Chancellery;

- the right of the Chancellor to be informed at all times by the chair
and the executive member on all subjects concerning the daily management of
the authority potentially hinders the members of the supervisory authority
in the independent performance of their tasks.

The Commission's approach to the independence of data protection authorities
reflects the case law of the European Court of Justice. In its ruling of 3
March 2010 (C-518/07), in which Germany was declared in breach of EU rules
on the independence of the data protection supervisory authority, the Court
confirmed that authorities responsible for the supervision of the processing
of personal data must remain free from any external influence, including
the direct or indirect influence of the state. According to the Court, the
mere risk of political influence through state scrutiny is sufficient to
hinder the independent performance of the supervisory authority's tasks.

Earlier this year, the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has
also seriously criticised the status of Austria's data protection authority.
The FRA study 'Data Protection in the European Union: the role
of National Data Protection Authorities', published in May 2010, casted a
damning light on the Austrian DSK. The study detected both a lack of
independence from the government and a lack of financial resources and staff
of the DSK. The Austrian DSK is not equipped with full powers of
investigation and intervention. As a consequence, the supervisory body
"cannot enforce its decisions in warning the data processor/controller as to
its unlawful conduct" - a serious deficit which occurs only in three of the
27 EU Member States, i.e. Poland, Hungary and Austria.

No official statement has been published by the Austrian government since
the EC announced it would refer Austria to the Court of Justice in this
matter. It remains to be seen whether the Austrian government will stick
to its former plans to close down the DSK. According to a draft law promoted
in 2007 and reconditioned in 2010, which is aiming at changing various
regulations of the Austrian Constitution, the government intends to assign
some of the duties of the DSK to nine administrative courts of the "Ldnder"
instead. By which organisation(s) the remaining duties of the DSK should be
fulfilled, remains unclear till today. In its recently published bi-annual
report of the years 2007-2009, the DSK criticised these plans and argued
that only 10 % of its tasks were suitable to be carried out by
administrative courts.

In light of its ruling of 3 March 2010, in which Germany was declared in
breach of EU rules on the independence of the data protection supervisory
authority, it is more than likely that the ECJ will come to a similar
conclusion in the Austrian case. It's also more than likely that neither the
EC nor the European Court of Justice will appreciate the further demolition
of the Austrian data protection authority by closing down the existing
insufficient body and scattering its competencies to regional
administration.

4. Is YouTube back online in Turkey?
============================================================

After almost three years of blocking, Turkey has finally lifted its ban on
YouTube. Google's site was blocked in 2007 for videos considered insulting
to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder.

In 2007, Turkey's parliament adopted a law allowing a court to block any
website in case there was "sufficient suspicion" that a crime had occurred.
The Appeal Court of Ankara has recently decided to lift the ban on Google's
site but the decision is not considered entirely a victory as it came along
with the removal of the videos in question.

Transport Minister Binali Yildirim said there was no longer any reason to
ban the website because the offending videos had been removed. "I hope that
they have also learned from this experience and the same thing will not
happen again. YouTube will hopefully carry out its operations in Turkey
within the limits of law in the future," he added thus implying that the
site could always be in danger of suspension in the future in case similar
content is posted on it.

YouTube wanted to emphasize the fact that the videos had been removed by a
third party: "We want to be clear that a third party, not YouTube, have
apparently removed some of the videos that have caused the blocking of
YouTube in Turkey using our automated copyright complaint process. We are
investigating whether this action is valid in accordance with our copyright
policy."

But the victory may be short-lived, as the Dr. Yaman Akdeniz has pointed out
that the videos are back online:

"Despite the earlier news that Turkey has lifted its ban on YouTube after
almost 2.5 years, YouTube reinstated the four videos that were removed by a
licensing agency in Germany. YouTube, in a statement circulated in Turkish
late Monday night stated that the four videos did not violate its copyright
violation policy and therefore they were put back into the system (...)

It remains to be seen how the Turkish authorities will react to this
action by YouTube but I strongly suspect that they will issue a new
injunction to block access to YouTube."

OSCE (the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe) which, in
June 2010, expressed the opinion that Internet censorship in Turkey was one
of the heaviest in the world by the the law allowing the access blocking to
more than 5 000 sites, welcomed the present decision but urged Turkey to
continue in this direction "by reforming its Internet law and lift the
remaining website bans."

Thousands of other websites, especially those related to sensitive topics
such as Ataturk, the army and minorities, remain blocked.

5. Free Culture 2010 in Barcelona
============================================================

Barcelona was the capital of free culture at the end of October 2010, with
two events - Oxcars and then the Free Culture Forum (FCF) - organized by
Exgae for awarding and promoting free culture concepts across Europe and
beyond.

The third edition of the Oxcars ceremony took place on 28 October 2010, with
1000 people joining the event on the spot and many more watching it live on
the Internet. The event awarded prizes for the Spanish free culture
supporters (such as the academic Josi Luis Sampedro) and users (Txaber
Allui - an e-cook blogger).

Following the ECJ ruling on private copying levies just a few days
earlier, the stars of the event were the lawyer Jover Josep and Ana Marma
Mindez - the owner of the computer store that started the proceedings
against Spanish collective society SGAE. Javier characterized the
current situation of the copyright levies by a powerful metaphor:
"We are in a country where blind men pay for what they don't see and the
deaf for what they can't hear."

British filmmaker Kate Madison was another star of the night, following her
implication in the minimal budget fan-made film "Born of Hope", which
recreated the world from the Tolkien trilogy. The film, available free on
the Internet, had over 2 million views in less than one year.

The first round of discussions at FCF were related to the political and
economic copyright framework. MEP Eva Lichtenberger made an appeal to
civil society action in the debate saying that "We have lost the battle on
the Gallo resolution, but this is just a resolution - so we will need to
continue the battle on the future legislative framework and we need the
civil society input." She also underlined that the discussion was more
balanced now, a group of MEPs already exist that are not indoctrinated
only by the lobby copyright approaches.

But the FCF focused this year on a very sensitive topic related to free
culture: sustainability. The "flat rate" was the main topic of the
discussions, with opinions pro and against a solution that might require
users to pay a fixed monthly amount to be distributed to creators, as
compensation for the free circulation of works on the Internet. The solution
that might be adopted in Brazil has triggered a lot of attention and
references from presenters or participants in the debate.

But other solutions for sustainability were publicly presented, from
individual solutions, such as the crowd funded movie El Cosmonauta, to
overall approaches, such as flattr presented by Peter Sunde or the Kick
Starter, that had 500 projects funded and over 20 million USD pledged in the
first 18 months of the project.

Alice Wiegand from Wikimedia Germany correctly underlined that it was not
just financial sustainability that needed to be better researched, but also
the technical and social sustainability, without which a project like
Wikipedia can't last.

The debate on FCF was also broadcasted online and now videos of both
events are publicly available on the Internet.

6. Continuing the battle against data retention
============================================================

During the 32nd Annual Conference of the Data Protection and Privacy
Commissioners "Privacy: Generations" that took place on 27 and 28 October
2010, EDRi-member Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called for the
abolition of the European Union's Data Retention Directive.

"The Data Retention Directive is highly controversial, if not wildly
unpopular throughout the European Union. The directive was strongly opposed
by European privacy activists ... as each country in the EU has implemented
the Data Retention Directive in their own law, they have faced challenges in
state courts," explained Eva Galperin of EFF, in a blog post.

"The experience in Europe makes clear that mandatory data retention regimes
are disproportionate and unnecessary. We continue to believe that the
legitimate needs of law enforcement can be met by a more targeted data
preservation regime, without the collateral damage inflicted by the 2006
directive. Rather than fighting the privacy battle across Europe one state
at a time, EFF urges European Privacy Authorities to call upon the European
Commission to stand up for Internet users' fundamental rights, and repeal
the 2006 Data Retention Directive outright", stated the EFF.

Indeed, the EU Data Protection Directive has been facing a strong and large
opposition for several years now. Even the Roadmap published by the EU is
indicating that the national implementation has been more complicated than
initially thought. Thus most Member States were late in transposing, and 6
have not yet introduced transposing legislation, whereas in 2 Member States
the Constitutional Court annulled the national law transposing the
Directive. (Germany and Romania, plus a pending case in Hungary). Also there
is already a referral to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling at the behest of
the Irish High Court .

Also the expert group on data retention that should "unite in a single
platform all European stakteholders" seems to be missing the civil society
representation or the human rights experts.

According to a Commission source, the review report of the directive,
which was due on 15 September 2010, has recently been postponed to March
2011. The Commission seems to have difficulties to get data from the
member states that proves that data retention is necessary and
proportionate in a democratic society.

7. Belgian Court upholds Creative Commons licence
============================================================

A local court in Nivelles, Belgium upheld in a case decided 26 October
2010 on the validity of the Creative Commons licence in a copyright
infringement case when a music group published its music under CC BY-NC-SA.

In this case reported by Professor Siverine Dussollier of the University of
Namur, a theatre adapted the music published by the band to make an
advertisement for their theatrical season. The ad was broadcast on the
national radio several times (with no attribution). The band refused the
damages of 1500 euro that the theatre proposed and decided to sue for
copyright infringement.

In its decision, the court recognized the CC licence as a valid permissive
copyright licence that has already been accepted by Dutch, Spanish and
US courts.

The decision also noted that the conditions of the decisions were breached
by not attributing the song to its creators and using it for commercial
purposes, which was prohibited by the CC licence used.

The court decided to award damages of 4500 euro to the complainants.
