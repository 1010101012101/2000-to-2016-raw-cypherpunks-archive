            Something I'm going to have to start looking for, I guess. Just
did a Bibliofind search for True Names, found only 3 copies -- two were $100
each (one like new, the other "signed by author" ) and the other was $60.  I
buy a lot of used books, and those are pretty amazing prices for fairly
recent paperbacks, and especially a high volume sci-fi.
  Sigh!
         I read his "Deepness In the Sky" and liked it.
