Yup. In fact, some IPSec firewalls rely on the corporate having a local
CA root to issue keys for VPN access. from there it is only a small step
to using the same (or parallel issued) keys for email security.
The problem there really is that the keys will be flagged as faulty by
anyone outside the group (and therefore without the root key already
imported), and that will usually only work in a semi-rigid hierachical
structure. There *is* an attempt to set up something resembling a Web of
trust using x509 certificiates, currently in the early stages at
nntp://news.securecomp.org/WebOfTrust

you made a minor config error - you need to make sure clearsign is
enabled.

It's command line. Most cyphergeeks like command line tools powerful and
cryptic :)
