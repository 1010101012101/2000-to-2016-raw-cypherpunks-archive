Practically, would it matter? Maybe.

If an attacker knew that you were using Pi as your "random" stream, I guess
that would reduce your "random" stream to a stream cypher with a key of
about 24 bits.

There are a lot of random-appearing number sequences. Are there enough to
add a significant number of bits to the effective key? Against an attacker
with the resources to compute and store the first billion digits of a lot
of sequences?

Meh. I'd started this response with the plan to argue that a slice of Pi is
good enough for practical purposes, but I convinced myself otherwise. It's
only good enough for security-by-obscurity. Meh.
