The whole purpose of MAPS is the Balkanization of the internet.
Balkanization of the Internet is a good thing.  There should be parts
of the Internet that are spam-free (that's where I want to be) and
other parts where peoples' mailboxes are constantly full of
get-rich-quick-find-out-anything-about-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarves-penis-enlargement-offers.
People who want that kind of mail should get it, and those who don't
shouldn't.
