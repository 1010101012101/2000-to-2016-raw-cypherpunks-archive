As Jim Burnes said in his post this morning, increasing fascism may 
be a Good Thing.

(Though I've been watching the escalation of fascism for 35+ years 
and it hasn't seemed to have brought us any closer to the point where 
patriots will rise up and take back their country. A few nests of 
statists blown up, a few corrupt politicians assassinated, but not 
much else.)

As for this new law, it's par for the course. It's Yet Another Law to 
pressure the proles with. Used as a bargaining chip.

Tell me, anyone, will Bill Clinton ever face _any_ actual prison time 
for lying to a court, for suborning perjury by his staff, for 
threatening Kathleeen Willey and others?

Is anyone in the White House facing imprisonment for illegally 
obtaining and using confidential FBI files for political purposes? 
The Feds are anxious to prosecute poltical opponents for merely 
obtaining Social Security Numbers illegally, but do nothing when the 
White House does it.

(And what of the U.S. Marshal's service releasing the SSN of _me_ and 
including innuendo that I am planning to assassinate a federal judge? 
Believe me, when this happened I went on high alert. I figured a set 
up raid was coming.)

This new law cited above, one of thousands, will be used precisely by 
the Power Elite to suppress their enemies.
