I believe that the intent of the Founding Fathers was that an armed
populace would be familiar with the letter of the Constitution, and
tolerate no creative reinterpretation of it by any of the three branches
of Guv'mint.

He rehabiliated himself through terrible suffering, repented his racist
views, and made friends with Jesse Jackson.  People can change.  I can
still remember from back in the 60's Mike Wallace reporting with a
perfectly straight face on the "Negroid Characteristics" of some monkey
skull found by a archeological expedition.

One of the nice things about ignorance is that it is curable.  Unlike 
Neo-Conservatism.
