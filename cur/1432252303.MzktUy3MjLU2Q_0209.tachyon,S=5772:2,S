not at all. it's the "who are you to believe you can pass judgement on
all of human history?" argument.

you forgot intend. otherwise, innocent bystanders who get hit will
always call the "good" guys who missed the target "evil" (according to
your definition), and rightly so.

but even with intend it doesn't work too well. your local police force
will gladly introduce you to the concept of doing hurtful things to you
without requiring you to do some to them first. all you have to do is,
say, speed on the highway and refuse to stop when they ask you to.

your definition works, I can't deny that, but only for extreme cases
such as the nazi regime. then again, the nazis *were* convinced that the
jews were not only doing bad things to them, but had been doing so for
hundreds of years (the "jew world conspiracy", zion, etc).
I'm afraid the nazis would have agreed to your definition just as well,
pointing out the necessity of eliminating the jew conspiracy, or the
whole world will suffer greatly.


what about the israel/rest-of-the-near-east problem? both sides call
themselves good and the other side evil. both sides have done and
received their fair share of killing. both sides are convinced that the
other will do hurtful things to them unless they get 'em first.
is one or both of them evil? your "definition" doesn't answer that
question. as I said, it works as a simplification for extreme cases,
much like the florida election system works fine unless it's a close
call.
