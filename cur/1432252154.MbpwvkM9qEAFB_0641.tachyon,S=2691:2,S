When I was reading about other nations' plans to do what Ken Brown pointed
out only Iceland does now, it occurred to me that even with 
an anonymized database, you could infer parentage from the raw
anonymized data -its a harder problem than testing a particular
parenting hypothesis (is A likely descended from B + C, given
samples of A,B,C?), but maybe possible.  

Maybe the EULA will have a no-reverse-engineering-pedigrees clause..
