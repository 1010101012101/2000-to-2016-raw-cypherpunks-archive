LECTURE 30 - POISONOUS AND ALLERGENIC PLANTS 

[...]

2. Saponins (e.g. tomatine in tomato, solanine in potato) 
a. Natural soaps (as in century plants (Agave))- develop bubbles 
    but poke holes in membranes (by aggregating cholesterol)
b. Causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
c. Solanine present in potato (Solanum tuberosum) - most of 
    plant except tubers is poisonous. Tuber contains solanine

    (which turn green after exposure to sunlight) can cause fatal
    poisonings. Green and damaged potatoes are even more toxic.
