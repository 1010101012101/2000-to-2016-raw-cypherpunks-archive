I'll bet you all were running the risk of facing arbitrary enforcement of a
whole slew of restrictions on firearms, explosives, etc. Talking about organized
training in a public forum isn't going to make it any easier for you.

Quite a nice little collection of straw men you have there. Too bad for you
they have nothing to do with what I think. The archives speak for
themselves; I doubt you can find one post where I said any of that claptrap.

Absolutely not. I've made it crystal clear how I feel about gun ownership, the
right to defend one's life and property, and the first and second amendments.
I draw the line at initiating force though. What I find dangerous and 
counterproductive is your repeated escalation and provocation of law
enforcement. Surely you knew by responding to the troll you'd be kicking
it up yet another notch. What's the point? Aren't you in enough of a balance
of terror already? I guess not.

>provided "dangerous" people with knowledge they didn't already have.

The dangerous people I have in mind are all the pissed-off federal agents on
the "domestic terrorist" jihad who are circling the wagons and looking for more
rope to hang you with. I have no idea how much they knew about whatever you were
doing, but it was the first time I ever saw you speak as if you're getting
something in particular organized. That's the way it came across.

How much of all this boils down to the fact that you profoundly relish playing
high-stakes intimidation games and would love to be known far and wide as
a "force to be reckoned with"? Just a thought.


>Your "policeman inside" has been getting way too loud. Stop listening to 
>her or him.

Bah, I just believe in taking personal responsibility for my statements and
actions in a public forum. Show me where I ever said anything pro-censorship.

Nah, just a common human feeling called sympathy.

As you wish.

No, just that due to your wee touch of megalomania, you didn't much
mind when the troll was characterizing the entire group as having something
rightfully to fear from the sedition laws because of support for encryption
itself. That's not right.

What makes you think I want or need to filter you?

Please direct your rant to the appropriate person(s) or anyone remotely
connected to the above complaints. Thanks!
