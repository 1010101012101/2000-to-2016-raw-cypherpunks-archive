     The Threat of Cyberwar Has Been Grossly Exaggerated



There's a power struggle going on in the U.S. government right now.

It's about who is in charge of cyber security, and how much control the 
government will exert over civilian networks. And by beating the drums 
of war, the military is coming out on top.

"The United States is fighting a cyberwar today, and we are losing," 
said former NSA director -- and current cyberwar contractor -- Mike 
McConnell. "Cyber 9/11 has happened over the last ten years, but it 
happened slowly so we don't see it," said former National Cyber Security 
Division director Amit Yoran. Richard Clarke, whom Yoran replaced, wrote 
an entire book hyping the threat of cyberwar.

General Keith Alexander, the current commander of the U.S. Cyber 
Command, hypes it every chance he gets. This isn't just rhetoric of a 
few over-eager government officials and headline writers; the entire 
national debate on cyberwar is plagued with exaggerations and hyperbole.

Googling those names and terms -- as well as "cyber Pearl Harbor," 
"cyber Katrina," and even "cyber Armageddon" -- gives some idea how 
pervasive these memes are. Prefix "cyber" to something scary, and you 
end up with something really scary.

Cyberspace has all sorts of threats, day in and day out. Cybercrime is 
by far the largest: fraud, through identity theft and other means, 
extortion, and so on. Cyber-espionage is another, both government- and 
corporate-sponsored. Traditional hacking, without a profit motive, is 
still a threat. So is cyber-activism: people, most often kids, playing 
politics by attacking government and corporate websites and networks.

These threats cover a wide variety of perpetrators, motivations, 
tactics, and goals. You can see this variety in what the media has 
mislabeled as "cyberwar." The attacks against Estonian websites in 2007 
were simple hacking attacks by ethnic Russians angry at anti-Russian 
policies; these were denial-of-service attacks, a normal risk in 
cyberspace and hardly unprecedented.

A real-world comparison might be if an army invaded a country, then all 
got in line in front of people at the DMV so they couldn't renew their 
licenses. If that's what war looks like in the 21st century, we have 
little to fear.

Similar attacks against Georgia, which accompanied an actual Russian 
invasion, were also probably the responsibility of citizen activists or 
organized crime. A series of power blackouts in Brazil was caused by 
criminal extortionists -- or was it sooty insulators? China is engaging 
in espionage, not war, in cyberspace. And so on.

One problem is that there's no clear definition of "cyberwar." What does 
it look like? How does it start? When is it over? Even cybersecurity 
experts don't know the answers to these questions, and it's dangerous to 
broadly apply the term "war" unless we know a war is going on.

Yet recent news articles have claimed that China declared cyberwar on 
Google, that Germany attacked China, and that a group of young hackers 
declared cyberwar on Australia. (Yes, cyberwar is so easy that even kids 
can do it.) Clearly we're not talking about real war here, but a 
rhetorical war: like the war on terror.

We have a variety of institutions that can defend us when attacked: the 
police, the military, the Department of Homeland Security, various 
commercial products and services, and our own personal or corporate 
lawyers. The legal framework for any particular attack depends on two 
things: the attacker and the motive. Those are precisely the two things 
you don't know when you're being attacked on the Internet. We saw this 
on July 4 last year, when U.S. and South Korean websites were attacked 
by unknown perpetrators from North Korea -- or perhaps England. Or was 
it Florida?

We surely need to improve our cybersecurity. But words have meaning, and 
metaphors matter. There's a power struggle going on for control of our 
nation's cybersecurity strategy, and the NSA and DoD are winning. If we 
frame the debate in terms of war, if we accept the military's expansive 
cyberspace definition of "war," we feed our fears.

We reinforce the notion that we're helpless -- what person or 
organization can defend itself in a war? -- and others need to protect 
us. We invite the military to take over security, and to ignore the 
limits on power that often get jettisoned during wartime.

If, on the other hand, we use the more measured language of cybercrime, 
we change the debate. Crime fighting requires both resolve and 
resources, but it's done within the context of normal life. We willingly 
give our police extraordinary powers of investigation and arrest, but we 
temper these powers with a judicial system and legal protections for 
citizens.

We need to be prepared for war, and a Cyber Command is just as vital as 
an Army or a Strategic Air Command. And because kid hackers and 
cyber-warriors use the same tactics, the defenses we build against crime 
and espionage will also protect us from more concerted attacks. But 
we're not fighting a cyberwar now, and the risks of a cyberwar are no 
greater than the risks of a ground invasion. We need peacetime 
cyber-security, administered within the myriad structure of public and 
private security institutions we already have.

Earlier this month, I participated in a debate: "The Cyberwar Threat has 
been Grossly Exaggerated."  Marc Rotenberg of EPIC and I were for the 
motion; Mike McConnell and Jonathan Zittrain were against.  We lost.

We lost fair and square, for a bunch of reasons -- we didn't present our 
case very well, Jonathan Zittrain is a way better debater than we were 
-- but basically the vote came down to the definition of "cyberwar."  If 
you believed in an expansive definition of cyberwar, one that 
encompassed a lot more types of attacks than traditional war, then you 
voted against the motion.  If you believed in a limited definition of 
cyberwar, one that is a subset of traditional war, then you voted for it.

     Internet Kill Switch



Last month, Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., introduced a bill that might -- 
we're not really sure -- give the president the authority to shut down 
all or portions of the Internet in the event of an emergency. It's not a 
new idea. Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, 
proposed the same thing last year, and some argue that the president can 
already do something like this. If this or a similar bill ever passes, 
the details will change considerably and repeatedly. So let's talk about 
the idea of an Internet kill switch in general.

It's a bad one.

Security is always a trade-off: costs versus benefits. So the first 
question to ask is: What are the benefits? There is only one possible 
use of this sort of capability, and that is in the face of a 
warfare-caliber enemy attack. It's the primary reason lawmakers are 
considering giving the president a kill switch. They know that shutting 
off the Internet, or even isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world, 
would cause damage, but they envision a scenario where not doing so 
would cause even more.

That reasoning is based on several flawed assumptions.

The first flawed assumption is that cyberspace has traditional borders, 
and we could somehow isolate ourselves from the rest of the world using 
an electronic Maginot Line. We can't.

Yes, we can cut off almost all international connectivity, but there are 
lots of ways to get out onto the Internet: satellite phones, obscure 
ISPs in Canada and Mexico, long-distance phone calls to Asia.

The Internet is the largest communications system mankind has ever 
created, and it works because it is distributed. There is no central 
authority. No nation is in charge. Plugging all the holes isn't possible.

Even if the president ordered all U.S. Internet companies to block, say, 
all packets coming from China, or restrict non-military communications, 
or just shut down access in the greater New York area, it wouldn't work. 
You can't figure out what packets do just by looking at them; if you 
could, defending against worms and viruses would be much easier.

And packets that come with return addresses are easy to spoof. Remember 
the cyberattack July 4, 2009, that probably came from North Korea, but 
might have come from England, or maybe Florida? On the Internet, 
disguising traffic is easy. And foreign cyberattackers could always have 
dial-up accounts via U.S. phone numbers and make long-distance calls to 
do their misdeeds.

The second flawed assumption is that we can predict the effects of such 
a shutdown. The Internet is the most complex machine mankind has ever 
built, and shutting down portions of it would have all sorts of 
unforeseen ancillary effects.

Would ATMs work? What about the stock exchanges? Which emergency 
services would fail? Would trucks and trains be able to route their 
cargo? Would airlines be able to route their passengers? How much of the 
military's logistical system would fail?

That's to say nothing of the variety of corporations that rely on the 
Internet to function, let alone the millions of Americans who would need 
to use it to communicate with their loved ones in a time of crisis.

Even worse, these effects would spill over internationally. The Internet 
is international in complex and surprising ways, and it would be 
impossible to ensure that the effects of a shutdown stayed domestic and 
didn't cause similar disasters in countries we're friendly with.

The third flawed assumption is that we could build this capability 
securely. We can't.

Once we engineered a selective shutdown switch into the Internet, and 
implemented a way to do what Internet engineers have spent decades 
making sure never happens, we would have created an enormous security 
vulnerability. We would make the job of any would-be terrorist intent on 
bringing down the Internet much easier.

Computer and network security is hard, and every Internet system we've 
ever created has security vulnerabilities. It would be folly to think 
this one wouldn't as well. And given how unlikely the risk is, any 
actual shutdown would be far more likely to be a result of an 
unfortunate error or a malicious hacker than of a presidential order.

But the main problem with an Internet kill switch is that it's too 
coarse a hammer.

Yes, the bad guys use the Internet to communicate, and they can use it 
to attack us. But the good guys use it, too, and the good guys far 
outnumber the bad guys.

Shutting the Internet down, either the whole thing or just a part of it, 
even in the face of a foreign military attack would do far more damage 
than it could possibly prevent. And it would hurt others whom we don't 
want to hurt.

For years we've been bombarded with scare stories about terrorists 
wanting to shut the Internet down. They're mostly fairy tales, but 
they're scary precisely because the Internet is so critical to so many 
things.

Why would we want to terrorize our own population by doing exactly what 
we don't want anyone else to do? And a national emergency is precisely 
the worst time to do it.

Just implementing the capability would be very expensive; I would rather 
see that money going toward securing our nation's critical 
infrastructure from attack.

Defending his proposal, Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this 
capability. It's debatable whether or not it actually does, but it's 
actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about 
its citizens.

Here in the U.S., it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president 
the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans 
in this way.

neat, though.  And I am very much in favor of research along these lines.

The Chaocipher is a mechanical encryption algorithm invented in 1918. No 
one was able to reverse-engineer the algorithm, given sets of plaintexts 
and ciphertexts -- at least, nobody publicly. On the other hand, I don't 
know how many people tried, or even knew about the algorithm. I'd never 
heard of it before now. Anyway, for the first time, the algorithm has 
been  revealed. Of course, it's not able to stand up to computer

     Third SHB Workshop



Last month I attended SHB 2010, the Third Interdisciplinary Workshop on 
Security and Human Behaviour, at Cambridge University. This is a two-day 
gathering of computer security researchers, psychologists, behavioral 
economists, sociologists, philosophers, and others -- all of whom are 
studying the human side of security -- organized by Ross Anderson, 
Alessandro Acquisti, and me.

     Data at Rest vs. Data in Motion



For a while now, I've pointed out that cryptography is singularly 
ill-suited to solve the major network security problems of today: 
denial-of-service attacks, website defacement, theft of credit card 
numbers, identity theft, viruses and worms, DNS attacks, network 
penetration, and so on.

Cryptography was invented to protect communications: data in motion. 
This is how cryptography was used throughout most of history, and this 
is how the militaries of the world developed the science. Alice was the 
sender, Bob the receiver, and Eve the eavesdropper. Even when 
cryptography was used to protect stored data -- data at rest -- it was 
viewed as a form of communication. In "Applied Cryptography," I 
described encrypting stored data in this way: "a stored message is a way 
for someone to communicate with himself through time." Data storage was 
just a subset of data communication.

In modern networks, the difference is much more profound. Communications 
are immediate and instantaneous. Encryption keys can be ephemeral, and 
systems like the STU-III telephone can be designed such that encryption 
keys are created at the beginning of a call and destroyed as soon as the 
call is completed. Data storage, on the other hand, occurs over time. 
Any encryption keys must exist as long as the encrypted data exists. And 
storing those keys becomes as important as storing the unencrypted data 
was. In a way, encryption doesn't reduce the number of secrets that must 
be stored securely; it just makes them much smaller.

Historically, the reason key management worked for stored data was that 
the key could be stored in a secure location: the human brain. People 
would remember keys and, barring physical and emotional attacks on the 
people themselves, would not divulge them. In a sense, the keys were 
stored in a "computer" that was not attached to any network. And there 
they were safe.

This whole model falls apart on the Internet. Much of the data stored on 
the Internet is only peripherally intended for use by people; it's 
primarily intended for use by other computers. And therein lies the 
problem. Keys can no longer be stored in people's brains. They need to 
be stored on the same computer, or at least the network, that the data 
resides on. And that is much riskier.

Let's take a concrete example: credit card databases associated with 
websites. Those databases are not encrypted because it doesn't make any 
sense. The whole point of storing credit card numbers on a website is so 
it's accessible -- so each time I buy something, I don't have to type it 
in again. The website needs to dynamically query the database and 
retrieve the numbers, millions of times a day. If the database were 
encrypted, the website would need the key. But if the key were on the 
same network as the data, what would be the point of encrypting it? 
Access to the website equals access to the database in either case. 
Security is achieved by good access control on the website and database, 
not by encrypting the data.

The same reasoning holds true elsewhere on the Internet as well. Much of 
the Internet's infrastructure happens automatically, without human 
intervention. This means that any encryption keys need to reside in 
software on the network, making them vulnerable to attack. In many 
cases, the databases are queried so often that they are simply left in 
plaintext, because doing otherwise would cause significant performance 
degradation. Real security in these contexts comes from traditional 
computer security techniques, not from cryptography.

Cryptography has inherent mathematical properties that greatly favor the 
defender. Adding a single bit to the length of a key adds only a slight 
amount of work for the defender, but doubles the amount of work the 
attacker has to do. Doubling the key length doubles the amount of work 
the defender has to do (if that -- I'm being approximate here), but 
increases the attacker's workload exponentially. For many years, we have 
exploited that mathematical imbalance.

Computer security is much more balanced. There'll be a new attack, and a 
new defense, and a new attack, and a new defense. It's an arms race 
between attacker and defender. And it's a very fast arms race. New 
vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. The balance can tip from 
defender to attacker overnight, and back again the night after. Computer 
security defenses are inherently very fragile.

Unfortunately, this is the model we're stuck with. No matter how good 
the cryptography is, there is some other way to break into the system. 
Recall how the FBI read the PGP-encrypted email of a suspected Mafia 
boss several years ago. They didn't try to break PGP; they simply 
installed a keyboard sniffer on the target's computer. Notice that SSL- 
and TLS-encrypted web communications are increasingly irrelevant in 
protecting credit card numbers; criminals prefer to steal them by the 
hundreds of thousands from back-end databases.

On the Internet, communications security is much less important than the 
security of the endpoints. And increasingly, we can't rely on 
cryptography to solve our security problems.


This essay originally appeared on DarkReading.  I wrote it in 2006, but 
lost it on my computer for four years.  I hate it when that happens.
http://www.darkreading.com/blog/archives/2010/06/data_at_rest_vs.html

As several readers have pointed out, I overstated my case when I said 
that encrypting credit card databases, or any database in constant use, 
is useless.  In fact, there is value in encrypting those databases, 
especially if the encryption appliance is separate from the database 
server.  In this case, the attacker has to steal both the encryption key 
and the database.  That's a harder hacking problem, and this is why 
credit card database encryption is mandated within the PCI security 
standard.  Given how good encryption performance is these days, it's a 
smart idea.  But while encryption makes it harder to steal the data, it 
is only harder in a computer security sense, not in a cryptography sense."
