Can't be that difficult to find someone to act as his typist. See? Jim Bell 
isn't even touching the computer.

That might work in prison, as the Powers That Be might not let him within 50' 
of a computer. But any hypothetical post-release restrictions should be 
easily circumvented.

As for the terrors of Thought Crime, you're absolutely right. Hacking a web 
site and grabbing a million SSNs is just a nuisance. Publishing personal 
information on our Lords and Masters is a heinous crime. Giving the peasants 
a tool to kill the Lords and Masters must surely be a capital crime, probably 
treason.
