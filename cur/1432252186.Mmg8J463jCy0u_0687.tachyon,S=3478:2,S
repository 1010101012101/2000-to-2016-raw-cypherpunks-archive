I'm starting to do something slightly similar, for different reasons. It's
part of a deniable encryption project.

If you have perfect compression, and you encrypt a message which has been
compressed, any decryption will look sensible.

This means that you don't need long keys, that brute force attacks won't
work, and that any supposed decryption is deniable. Unfortunately it's
theoretically impossible to achieve, and difficult to usefully approach,
perfect compression.


What _is_ possible, at least in theory, is super-perfect compression,
wherein the set of possible messages is reduced. The way I am attempting to
do it is quite similar to your proposal, but there's a long way to go yet!



There's an August 2001 thread in the sci.crypt.research archives called
"Grammar/dictionary-based compression for deniability:" in which I explain a
bit more about it (or rather, about an earlier version). The "super" bit
solves, at least in theory, the unicity problems.
