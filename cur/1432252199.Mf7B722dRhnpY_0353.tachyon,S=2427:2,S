   from the most-places-bad dept.
   [1]tcd004 writes "Kate Palmer writes in Foreign Policy Magazine that
   an [2]international black market for Internet access has arisen in
   many authoritarian countries who keep their populations offline. Savvy
   black marketers in cybercafes, universities, private homes, and
   elsewhere are exploiting technological loopholes to circumvent
   government filters and charge fees for access. According to [3]OpenNet
   Initiative, a nonprofit that tracks banned sites, visiting a single
   website in Saudi Arabia can cost anywhere from $26 to $67. And as
   censorship spreads, the prices are only going up." It's just a few
   paragraphs, but thought provoking.
