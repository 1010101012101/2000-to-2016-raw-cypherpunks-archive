That explains a lot about the California SS.  Down in the United States,
or at least in the few areas I have personal knowledge of, New York (City
PD and State Trooper) and New Mexico, there is a great deal of
constitutional education.  This education is seen as necessary to
"properly" interpret *when* (not if, sadly enough) an LEO may take certain
actions.

You are confusing "civilians" and LEOs.  Only civilians are held to the
personal knowledge standard.  Leos are held to profoundly lower probablity
models.

If you honestly believe this, then someone needs to beat the shit out of
you with a clueclub.  By definition, LEOs are [daily] involved in all
issues, from 1-ad to no-ad...

Please document this assertion.  1/2 is just plain *wrong*.  The tax
issues are restrictive, but not ablating, i.e., if you can afford the tax,
then, *in theory*, you have no problem.   I am talking about totally [2A]
destructive laws, such as felons losing their RIGHT to ownership of
firearms, civilians losing their RIGHT to own "assault
weapons" (interesting note: it is still legal to collect missiles, but not
certain types of rifles - the idiocy continues).

Yes.  Period.

No it is not: it is directly on point.  There is NO constituional basis
for the government to be able to regulate firearms.  Period.  Whether for
"good", "bad", or indifferent.  There is a very clear constitutional
mandate that any and all firearms be available to "the people" -
period.  Any infringement, even if it is "for my own good" is
unconstituional on it's face.

Again, returning to the oath of office taken by LEOs: their FIRST
responsibility is to defend the CONSTITUTION.  Not to follow orders.  You
want mindless droids enforcing laws, you get the kind of defacto police
state we are living in now.  You *should* be looking for THINKING *humans*
to be filling this position.

This is a nice academic pretence, but you are now dealing with The Real
World (tm).  Things like the abstract "Reasonable Man" and "Common Good",
and the thousands of other interjections you could assert here, simply do
not apply.  Save this shit for Philosophy Club.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
