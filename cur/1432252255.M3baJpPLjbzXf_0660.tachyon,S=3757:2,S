The most interesting Britishism to suddenly invade our shores and 
spread rapidly is "gone missing." I'm now hearing this in American 
movies, t.v. shows, and, importantly, television news. "The hunt is 
on for the fugitives in Texas who have gone missing." This is 
definitely new to our shores; I'm surprised (and pleased) at how 
rapidly it has spread.

"At university" and "at hospital" have not become common (though "at 
college" and "at school" are fully equivalent and are common).
