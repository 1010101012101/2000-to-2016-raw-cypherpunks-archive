use on screen keyboards using mouse action or use non-bios routines that
remap key codes.

If you need this level of security you probably need to look at the whole
environment and do some serious thinking.

If you use standard keyboards then the scancodes can be intercepted, if you
have standard PC's with non-custom OS then almost anything can be sniffed
out.  

(The moot list is in need of any good advice on this, basic discussion
already covered)

	cya,	Andrew...
