"The Deputy Ombudsman began an inquiry into the circumstances of the 
shooting of Gary Abdallah and after an eight-month investigation suggested 
that the two detectives at the fatal shooting appeared to have agreed to 
corroborate each other's false accounts (The Herald, 22 December 1989)."

FROM

Gary Abdallah

Abdallah was wanted for arson in connection with a $300,000 fire at Simons 
Disco in Northcote.

He grew up as a young armed robber in the Flemington area and a member of a 
well known criminal gang which resided in his suburb and its neighbour, 
Ascot Vale.


Other members of the crew included Mark and Jason Moran, Graham Jensen, 
Frank Valastro, Mark Militano, Jedd Houghton, Victor Pierce, Peter McKevoy 
and Santo Mercuri.

Houghton, like Abdallah, was killed by police during investigations into 
the 1988 Walsh St police shootings.

On March 31, 1988, a bank robbery occurred at a State Bank branch in Oak Park.

The armed robbers left empty handed but shots were fired. Forensic records 
showed the gun used was definitely the same one used in the Walsh Street 
shootings. This robbery was linked to four unsolved recent hold-ups, police 
dubbing the perpetrators as the Flemington Crew. The gun used was retrieved 
next to tram tracks in Parkville's Royal Park Golf Course in 1990.

In late 1988, the TyEyre Taskforce into Walsh Street undertook a series of 
dawn raids on drug dealers, armed robbers and other known criminals in some 
way connected with the police shootings. Abdallah was one of the men at the 
top of the list of people police wanted to speak with.

Abdallah became a Walsh Street suspect on the evidence of the prosecution's 
key witness, Jason Ryan, whose statement was changed four times and finally 
thrown out by the court. Ryan, part of Richmond's feared crime family, the 
Pettingill's, claimed that Abdallah's part in the killings was to provide 
and drive the getaway car which the alleged killers had sought from his 
Carlton commission flat. The evidence was collected in an interview with 
Ryan conducted by Det John Noonan. He had taken Ryan on a trip out of the 
city, to Mansfield in the states north-east. It was there Ryan was 
interrogated and from his ever changing information and statements, Noonan 
initiated a case against his uncle, Victor Pierce, friend, Anthony Farrell, 
associate, Peter McEvoy and uncle, Trevor Pettingill.

Abdallah feared for his life after he heard rumours that the police were 
out to kill him. He had good reason to be fearful: Jedd Houghton was shot 
dead by police in a Bendigo caravan park in November 1988.

For two months Abdallah eluded the police. Raids were made on all known 
associates including his girlfriends family and the family of Jedd 
Houghton. News filtered back to Abdallah that police intended to kill him 
if they got to him first. He kept away from them until visiting Detective 
John Noonan at St Kilda Rd Police HQ on February 22, 1989 when he arranged 
a meeting with the task force head and his lawyer. Noonan told him that he 
was not wanted for the shooting, and Abdallah said he hadn't come in 
earlier "because people were telling me I was going to be knocked [killed]".

Leo Musgrave, a Melbourne justice of the peace who knew Abdallah and 
Houghton as young criminals in the inner western suburb of Flemington, was 
also anxious about the atmosphere after he saw Abdallah's name on police 
bulletin boards.

According to Roma Carew, the mother of Stephen Carew, a close friend of 
Abdallah, Musgrave warned her in December 1988 that if the police got to 
Abdallah first "the bastards will kill him". Stephen Carew said Musgrave 
approached him twice and urged that Abdallah give himself up to police, 
promising to ensure that Abdallah got the warning.

Noonan assured Abdallah that he was not wanted in any relation to the case.

Abdallah's car, suspected of being used in the getaway, had been sold 
before the murders. It was later obtained by police although their tests 
proved nothing. He claimed not to have heard of the murders until the 
following day in the newspaper. Abdallah also said he never used telephones 
throwing police accusations that he'd phoned fellow suspects McKevoy and 
Pettingill out the window. Abdallah told Noonan that he didn't believe his 
friend Jed Houghton would ever have anything to do with Jason Ryan. 
Abdallah thought that Houghton couldn't stand him thinking that he was 
untrustworthy with a big mouth. Noonan sent Abdallah to arson over the 
Simons Nightclub incident. He was then bailed. Although Noonan assured him 
of his presumed innocence, Abdallah was immediately trailed. The police 
then planted a listening device in Abdallah's flat in Drummond Street, 
Carlton, and set up a permanent surveillance position in the building 
opposite.

Abdallah's lease ended on Sunday April 9, 1989. Police surveillance was 
also about to end. He left his flat momentarily, was trailed by police who 
intercepted him and returned him home.

Police claim he was being arrested for the attempted murder of a 
policeman's son several weeks before.

It was there that Abdallah allegedly pulled an imitation pistol on 
detectives Cliff Lockwood and Dermot Avon from City West CIB. Lockwood 
fired six shots from his gun and then let off another one from his partners 
weapon. Abdallah was critically wounded and died after 40 days in a coma 
from complications arising from a bullet wound to the back of the head.

When Gary Abdallah was shot and eventually died there was a large amount of 
media attention paid to the circumstances of his shooting. The Abdallah 
family and their solicitor were vocal in questioning the police version of 
events and demanding an independent public inquiry.

Other influential groups and individuals also publicly questioned the 
shootings. The fact that Gary Abdallah was shot at seven times and had a 
bullet wound in the back of his head were not matters that could be readily 
explained. It was announced that there would be a special series of 
coronial inquiries into the shootings. The inquest has examined the 
circumstances of the shootings in a way that has never been done 
previously. The Deputy Ombudsman began an inquiry into the circumstances of 
the shooting of Gary Abdallah and after an eight-month investigation 
suggested that the two detectives at the fatal shooting appeared to have 
agreed to corroborate each other's false accounts (The Herald, 22 December 
1989).

One level of criticism against police suggested that in the wake of the 
killing of the two police officers revenge overcame reason in the police 
force. A lawyer representing a man charged in relation to the 'Walsh 
Street' killings said in court, while objecting to his client being held in 
custody, 'he is probably safer in Pentridge than on the streets where he 
could be subjected to a bullet in the back of his head' (The Sun, 13 
September 1990).

The coroner was told that 'After the two young policemen were killed, it 
was if the police had some kind of vendetta' (The Age, 13 September 1990). 
Mrs Carew, a local resident, told the coroner that a local Justice of the 
Peace, who she had known for many years, came to her house and asked her to 
get her sons to tell Abdallah, who at the time police wanted to question 
about 'Walsh Street' to come to his home and he would make sure that 
Abdallah 'got to the police station all right'. She said the Justice of the 
Peace told her: 'If they get to him first, the bastards will kill him'.

In 1989, the Victorian government appointed state coroner Hal Hallenstein 
to conduct an inquiry into police killings following the shooting of Abdallah.

Abdallah's family asked the deputy ombudsman, Dr Barry Perry, to 
investigate the shooting. His 329-page report was completed shortly before 
Christmas 1989. It said that "the evidence seems to provide some basis for 
believing that there was criminal conduct" in the police shooting.

During the inquest, the Abdallah family lawyer expressed a more direct 
view: the pistol was a plant and Abdallah was on his knees, his hands 
behind his head, when he was shot like a dog on a short lead.

In Victoria there were eleven fatal shootings by police in the two year 
period up to April 1989. This compares to only ten fatal shootings by 
police in the previous thirteen years. The number of fatal shootings by 
police had increased from only two in 1985 and one in 1986 to five in 1987 
and five in 1988. The fatal shooting of Abdallah led to growing demands for 
a judicial inquiry into the shootings. Those calling for such an inquiry 
included families of some of the deceased, the Federation of Community 
Legal Centres, the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties, Member of 
Parliament Mr Neil Cole, Pentridge prison chaplain, Father Peter Norden, 
and the Bar Association. These demands were based on the growing number of 
shootings, the circumstances surrounding some of the shootings and the 
belief that the usual investigation by the Homicide Squad overseen by the 
police Internal Investigation Department and an inquiry by the coroner 
would not be sufficient to uncover any wrongdoing by police involved. The 
shootings became the subject of growing media attention and a public 
meeting was organised by the families of the deceased and the Flemington 
Legal Service. Hundreds of people attended the public meeting and passed a 
motion calling on the government to set up a judicial inquiry into the 
shootings and police accountability.

There may be something wrong with Avons left eye,one time he faced me and 
his wandering eye was moving around the ceiling in the corner.If I was 
partnering this dingbat I would carry a knife as well nic.(should 
regulations allow of course.)
See you weds,suckers.Get your stories straight.
