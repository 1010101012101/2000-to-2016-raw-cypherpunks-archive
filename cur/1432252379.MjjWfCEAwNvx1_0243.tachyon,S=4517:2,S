This is a very common tactic: I received RIAA complaints of this form 
almost daily at the abuse desk.

Unfortunately, if they go to trial on these *losers*, the victim usually 
finds it cheaper to pay the settlement offer (usually around $300) than to 
pay a lawyer to get the thing thrown out of court.  We have a local lawyer 
that does the vast majority of these cases for the victims, and even he 
recommends settlement as the preferred step.

2gb? Are you serious? Not since the 90s. Today I would expect something 
more along the lines of 100gb to 500gb aggregated across a mid to large 
backbone.

Most ISPs dont even bothe with deep inspection, as it unnecessary: they 
already have immunity, so whatever happens is the victims problem not the 
ISPs. The exceptions would be on hosted networks where deep inspection may 
be done for firewalling or statistical purposes (we did both: an inline 
splitter tap for statistics and an inline router for firewalling. 
Interestingly, these high volume lines are only rarely anywhere near 
capacity, and any reasonably current hardware can deal with deep 
inspection easily.

The ISPs are completely uninterested in litigation based on content: doing 
this would remove their current immunity as a simple carrier.  What they 
*are* interested in (at least some of them) are blocking or slowing 
down traffic which directly interferes with their own offerings, for 
example, VOIP.
