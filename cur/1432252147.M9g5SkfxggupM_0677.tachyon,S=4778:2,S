This is well-trod ground. I'll have to be brief here.

You are talking about what game theorists call "defection," or what 
drug dealers would call "burning." Cheating, deception, etc. No one 
can deny that animals, humans, and other agents use deception, 
hiding, coloration, etc. Nothing is perfect, not even in the 
"law-regulated economy" some folks seem to think is the only economy 
which can function.

How non-law-regulated (black) markets work, and how they deal with 
deception and cheating, is a huge topic. (I recently suggested to 
David Friedman that he consider taking on this topic for a major 
book.)

But the "paving stone," or touch stone, I want to bring up is this: 
the role of third party escrow agents.


Use Google or a similar search engine and search on "cyphernomicon 
escrow". The section on use of escrow agents will come up immediately.

One such URL is http://calvo.teleco.ulpgc.es/cyphernomicon/chapter16/16.24.html


(I have written dozens of articles on this over the years, answering 
the same tired old question that Ray Dillinger asks.)

When you have read this, and thought about the issue, we can discuss 
things further.
