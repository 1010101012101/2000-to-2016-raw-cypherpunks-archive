Wrong headed or not, LEOs are manufactured out of human beings, and
because of this, the spend a considerable amount of time in the Maggot
Academy (tm) being taught the fine points of this very issue.  In fact,
a great majority of an LEO's "education" time is spent instructing them on
how to determine [decide] what is and is not constitutionally protected
{speech, action}.  If they did not use this "ability", they would have to
arrest *everyone*, and let the courts sort out the mess.

Actually, she is the perfect example: she interpreted the constitution her
way.  The "Rule of Law" has to be implemented at the individual [enforcer]
level: therefore, each enforcer is putin the position of having to make
and act on their [constitutional] opinions on a moment to moment basis.

The fact that you [and in this rare case] I agree that Reno is a fascist
sack of shit is completely irrelevent.

Yes.  

And if you are at all familiar with the history of 2A case law, you
will understand why the SCOTUS has been so meticulous in avoiding a
ruling.  Of course, our friends [hrmmm... Never thought I'd say THAT] in
Texas may well put an end to the charade soon.

Virtually the entire 2A ablating federal infrastructure is based on a
truly scary "finding" that *any* firearm is the product of Intertate
Commerce, regardless if it has been out of the state in which it was
manufactured.  In fact, IIRC, there is an early 1970's case where a felon
was convicted under federal laws, even though the weapon he posessed was
self-manufactured using components found completely within the state in
which the manufacture took place.  The ruling basically stated that since
the manufacture of the weapon utilized federal notes, there was an
interstate commerce nexus.  Go look: there are *thousands* of these.

Als at the risk of going Choation, what part of "Shall not be
infringed" don't you understand?

No. This is a free market issue.

Again, no.  The market will not support a gun manufacturer that does not
produce reliable weapons.

I don't know what world *you* live in, but you have just described the
world the *rest* of us live in.

Irrelevent.  We are not discussing abstract legal theory, we are
discussing factual implementation.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
