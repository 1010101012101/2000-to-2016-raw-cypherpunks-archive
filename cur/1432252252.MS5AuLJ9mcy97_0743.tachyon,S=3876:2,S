Actually they do share some of the blame. They are swore oaths to support
the constitution and the ideals of the this country. Which in many cases
is clearly not the intent or result of their actions. They are actively
looking for methods to circumvent current laws that put a bridle on their
activity. LEA's don's say "OK, we have a 4th so we have to have probable
cause first", it's like "OK, we have a 4th. We need to find a way around
it."

In many cases it is the LEA's themselves which ask for these laws or a law
that gives them the latitutude to get around other restraints. 

And LEA's are a part of the 'executive branch'.
