   Secret Service Raids E-Gold
   by Declan McCullagh (declan@wired.com)
   11:10 a.m. Mar. 30, 2001 PST
   
   WASHINGTON -- The Secret Service has raided a New York state business
   that exchanged dollars for grams of the digital currency called
   e-gold.
   
   A bevy of agents from the Secret Service, Postal Service and local
   police recently detained the owners of Gold-Age, based in Syracuse,
   and seized computers, files and documents from the fledgling firm.

Let this be a lesson to those operating such legal but controversial services 
that they keep all important records off site and use offshore systems to 
process and store data related to their transactions.  This way seizures 
of equipment become only a minor annoyance.
