Lasers can be good too.

APCs do make it harder to use the traditional Anglo-American
approaches techniques developed for speed-trap cameras,
which involve ski masks and spray paint or baseball bats.
But rifles can be fun.

On the other hand, cameras keep getting cheap,
and you can hide radio-equipped web-quality cameras
for nearly no money anywhere you've got electricity,
so getting all (or enough) of them can be harder.
