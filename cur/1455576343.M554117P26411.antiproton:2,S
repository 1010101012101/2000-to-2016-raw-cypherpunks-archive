Ukraine and Members of the EU Have Given up Their Sovereignty to the US

The US has successfully infiltrated the governments of many European
states with its own citizens
Allen Baldanza


The governors under US influence

This is a 9 minute video, although you only have to watch till 7:40 to
get the main argument.

It seems state sovereignty in the EU has become a thing of the past.
Not only does the EU seem to obey every foreign policy decision the US
asks it to, but there are many US citizens, educated in the US, who
have become important members of government in certain states. In the
Baltic States, namely Estonia and Lithuania, even heads of government
were US citizens. Under these heads of government, the Baltic states
had joined both the EU and NATO. Of course, there is also Ukraine,
which, after the coup in 2014, the new government appointed a US
citizen to be finance minister.

Even more striking is these members of government had retained US
citizenship even while "leading" their nations. Why does this matter?
It matters because when acquiring US citizenship, like all people
obtaining US citizenship, they had to take an oath swearing allegiance
to the United States and no other country. You can't help but ask
yourself, are they really "leading" their nations, or obeying US
orders?

This is just a taste of US involvement in many European nations. The
video gives even more details of US involvement in the region. One
can't help but wonder, when will these nations stand up for their
sovereignty?

I prefer to watch such vids is on double speed, and pause with the
space bar when subtitles go too quick.

And BTW, for those who don't want to watch it, there's an easy solution.

Towards the end, there's some detail re the bunch of countries that
the USA runs its "National Security Initiative for Youth" run by the
US dept of state. Quite the eye opener.
