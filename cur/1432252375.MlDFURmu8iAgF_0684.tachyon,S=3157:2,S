I think your walls would start to mold after a time.  Best to get rid of
laws that allow survelience by means that cannot be rationally avoided by
the average citizen.  This "peeking through walls" crap has to go.  (Of
course, the law and order crowd will find some horseman to trot out as to
why they need that and more.)

I wonder if the average citizen can buy this sort of equiptment?  Would be
interesting to start scanning the houses of LEA officials and see what
kind of justification they use to try and stop you.
