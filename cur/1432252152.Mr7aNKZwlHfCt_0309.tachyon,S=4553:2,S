No, that's not waht the decision means.  Access to stored messages also 
requires court permission.  The (U.S.) ban on wiretapping without judicial
permission is rooted in a Supreme Court decision, Katz v. United States,
389 U.S. 347 (1967) 
(http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=389&invol=347)
which held that a wiretap is a search which thus required a warrant.  I 
don't think there's ever been any doubt that seizing a stored message 
required a warrant.  But in an old case (OLMSTEAD v. U.S., 277 U.S. 438 (1928))
the Court had held that the Fourth Amendment only protected material 
things, and therefore *not* conversations monitored via a wiretap.  
That decision was overturned in Katz.

The crucial difference, from a law enforcement perspective, is how hard 
it is to get the requisite court order.  A stored message order is 
relatively easy; a wiretap order is very hard.  Note that this 
distinction is primarily statutory, not (as far as I know) 
constitutional.
