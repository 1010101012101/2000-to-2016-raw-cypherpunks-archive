I'm working on designing the programming projects for a data security class.  
What do you think of this one?

I love its intrinsic irony, but can we actually get away with requiring it for
a university class?  I mean, Elcomsoft really is in court for this.  My
University is unfortunately not the type of organization to stand at the
forefront and protect our civil rights.

-------
DRM Lab
-------

Options
-------
* Make the lab open-ended - they get to pick what to break and how, as long as
they don't use a pre-packaged tool.  DVDs, CDs, .WMA, etc.

Objective
---------
To demonstrate the fundamental futility of current attempts to prevent
unauthorized copying of published works.

Requirements
------------
_Here_ you can find a copy of Dmitry Sklyarov's Defcon slides in Adobe's eBook
format.  They were created with the eBookPro compiler, advertised as "the only
software in the universe that makes your information virtually 100%
burglarproof!".

Extract all text from the slides using the method of your choice and turn in
the resulting text file.  It needs no special formatting.
