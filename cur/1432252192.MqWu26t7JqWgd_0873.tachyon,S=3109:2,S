I was unable to find my ref.  But I also know that muscles
can work anaerobically; also that asphyxiation-feeling is from
too much CO2, not a lack of O2.  Also, you can't really
empty your lungs.

I once saw a show about medicine.  In it, an M.D. rebreathed
his own CO2-scrubbed air as he wrote the alphabet, on camera.
Halfway through he started scribbling incoherently and fell over,
unawares.
(There were assistants to save him.)

FWIW
