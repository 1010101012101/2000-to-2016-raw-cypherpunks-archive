I don't think so. As far as I understood, the 
bus system (PCI,...) will be encrypted as well. You'll have
to use a NIC which is certified and can decrypt the information
on the bus. Obviously, you won't get a certification for such
an network card.


But this implies other problems:

You won't be able to enter a simple shell script through the
keyboard. If so, you could simple print protected files as
a hexdump or use the screen (or maybe the sound device or any
LED) as a serial interface.

Since you could use the keyboard to enter a non-certified
program, the keyboard is to be considered as a nontrusted
device. This means that you either

* have to use a certified keyboard which doesn't let 
  you enter bad programs

* don't have a keyboard at all

* or are not able to use shell scripts (at least not in
  trusted context). This means a 
  strict separation between certified software and data.
  
  If Microsoft was able to do so, we wouldn't have 
  worms.
