Isn't the Internet the 5th horseman, so saith Cyber Command
underlings recruiting at DefCon and all the universities and hacker
hangouts and net cybersecurity-as-crime forums.

Nice thing about the horsemen is that you got to be one to
know how to fight them for many, many years, with budget
upgrades by "unexpected" failures. Human failures always
the best. Insiders next best. Never you or us angels.

Today GAO issued a study of State Department worldwide
information security evaluation and not once mentioned Wikileaks 
which only weeks ago was State's horse to bet on for great gobs
of additional cyber security. Must be policy to keep secret from
the public the greatest threat. Shhh.

Ok, ok, so it was DoD who let the State's swayback out of the barn
and Cyber Command promises to not ever let that happen again
as soon as Bradley Manning agrees to become a poster boy
recruiter of hackers for the NSA who failed, failed, failed, OMG 
how those hovering buzzards missed the emanations of FOB Gaga.

Or did they? Was it a trap all along, poor Bradass87 the bait?

State thinks DoD ran Bradley in an op. Bet on that filly.
