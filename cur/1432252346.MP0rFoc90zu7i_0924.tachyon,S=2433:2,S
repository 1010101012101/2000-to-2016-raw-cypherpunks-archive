In a somewhat similar vein, I'm currently assembling a number of contracts
for my company (Trust Laboratories), and I'm looing for truly effective
anti-spam clauses. So I'm looking for any examples (preferrably examples
tested in court). The value of $500 per spam reported in the CNN article
would certainly be enough deterent, and I'm already planning out a spam
reporting mechanism. If anyone has any examples of such clauses I would
greatly appreciate receiving them, private email to ashwood@msn.com would
probably be the best way (and it would avoid adding to the cypherpunks
bandwidth). I greatly appreciate all replies.
