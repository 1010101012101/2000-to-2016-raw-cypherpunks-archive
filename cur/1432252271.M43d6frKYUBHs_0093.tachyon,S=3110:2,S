John:
Anything besides the relatively obvious at work here? I'm thinking your ISP 
got a visit or two from MwG suits and just didn't want the heat. I'm 
surprised this didn't happen a few years ago.

Though you don't appear to be the type, it wouldn't be out of place to 
solicit any Cypherpunk support in terms of donations or other support if a 
final solution ends up being costly. Or at least, I wouldn't be any more 
offended than I normally am by some posts on this list.
