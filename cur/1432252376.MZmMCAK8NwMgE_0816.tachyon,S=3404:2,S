Indeed. With Linear A, the connection to ancient Greek was what solved the
puzzle. OTOH, hieroglyphs and similar ideographic writing systems do have
some figurative characteristics which can help in their interpretation. Not
so with syllabary/alphabet based ones, in which you would prefer at least a
cursory understanding of the spoken form before going for an interpretation.

Such exceptions always arouse my curiosity. Any online sources?

Aye. Hit me.
