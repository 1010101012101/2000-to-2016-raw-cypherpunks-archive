Honeywell Tests Brain-Wave System

By ANDY PASZTOR

November 13, 2007; Page B6

Honeywell International Inc., seeking to speed up how fast humans can
analyze intelligence data such as aerial photographs, is testing a system
that monitors analysts' brains for early signs of electrical activity when
they see something interesting.

With funding from the Defense Department, the three-year-old project
instantaneously keys on certain faint neural signals -- before analysts
themselves can consciously react to them -- as a way to identify and flag
images worthy of further assessment. Supported by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, tests so far have allowed human analysts to
process images five to seven times faster than current computer-based
methods, said Bob Smith, head of the advanced-technology group for
Honeywell's aerospace unit.

Officials of the Morris Township, N.J., aerospace-and-industrial company
are expected to release information about the project later this week.

The project uses head-mounted sensors to detect brain signals associated
with the recognition of targets analysts are looking for. Initially, images
are flashed in front of them in bursts of 10 to 20 a second. That
high-speed scan is followed by slower and systematic analysis of the
portion of images deemed by the brain-wave monitor as most likely to
contain the desired data. By eliminating the need for analysts to
thoroughly assess all parts of each satellite image, for example, the
system is intended to significantly increase productivity compared with
current computer-based techniques.

The result has been "remarkable speed improvements" in analysis because of
the system's "capability to filter out the background," Mr. Smith said in a
recent interview. He compared the principle to seeing "something out of the
corner of your eye" before being able to describe or realize exactly what
it is.

The system has potentially broad commercial applications in future years,
including evaluating medical images and assisting researchers conducting
long-term studies requiring frequent comparison of medical scans. Mr. Smith
said Honeywell has contracted with university researchers in Oregon to
study the applicability of the technology, dubbed the Honeywell Image
Triage System.

Honeywell's push in the intelligence-analysis arena comes as Congress and
intelligence officials debate the future mix of human and technological
spying.

"The real challenge of the intelligence community today is how to keep up
with the proliferation of data sources," Mr. Smith said. The Honeywell
system is designed to get high-priority data, including battlefield
threats, back to commanders faster than they currently can receive it.
