Hi,

I am looking for 10 leaders to handle free leads 
for a 15 year old, solid network marketing company
with a tremendous compensation plan.

These leads are very hot, double qualified leads, 
most of which are ready to sign up, so there will
be very little selling of the opportunity involved.
Many of these leads you will simply be signing up 
underneath you.  We cannot handle all of the leads!

We are generating massive spillover so if you are
an experienced network marketing leader or are
motivated and not afraid to talk to people about
getting paid to save money and helping others save 
money, reply whith the word "ready" as the subject.

Do not reply unless you are seriously interested in 
making a change in your life and earning at least 
$5000 a month with the help of our professional 
marketing team.

If you are ready for change, reply with the word "ready"
as the subject.

Sincerely,

Daniel Lee
3066 Spring Street
Hendersonville, NC 28739

P.S. Only serious individuals please, as we are focusing
our efforts in signing up the leads we already have. If
you would prefer not to be contacted again about increasing
your wealth, reply with the word "remove" as the subject.
