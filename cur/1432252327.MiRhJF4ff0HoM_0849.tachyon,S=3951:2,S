Microsoft tentacles squirm deeper into software hosting

...

Don't be fooled by the chirpy half-truths in the company press release, ...
Utter rubbish.

...

So Redmond owns the software you use and controls access to your data. It's for your benefit, after all; it's cheaper than owning
it, and you do love a bargain, don't you? It's more secure too, we are told, because you communicate directly via a pre-encrypted
client-to-client link in which you have no opportunity to stuff things up. Hell, you don't even know or have access to the key --
and what could be more secure than that?

...

... it's unfortunate that your data has to be stored on the M$ trusted network along with the software you use, but this could not
be helped. Your PC no longer needs, or even has, a hard drive. It has, instead, a non-volatile ROM chip which identifies all the
software you're eligible to be billed for using, the amount of time you've spent playing with it, and your credit details. It's
brilliant, but God help you if there's a stuff-up.
