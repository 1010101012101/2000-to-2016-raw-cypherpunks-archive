Matt Blaze did some work on non-subvertable key escrow, where you
escrow keys with random folks, and when you, or Uncle Sam, want the
key, you announce that, and hope to get the key back.  Let me be clear 
that this also is not what we're doing. :)

Thats not really it.  We're much more focused on layered locks than
series locks.  I would worry a lot about the architecture you outline
above being vulnerable to a whole slew of attacks on any one key,
which means an N key system is at least N times as vulnerable.

When we say 'nasty l-word' you can assume we're refering to CALEA,
RIP, and that sort of thing.  When we talk about legislative
compliance, we mean complying with that whole slew of privacy laws.

As to the hypothetical that Tim will ask, we'll work very hard to
prevent laws requiring key escrow from coming into being.  We spend
time and energy maintaining relations with law enforcement in a lot of 
places, explaining to them why we don't build in back doors.  And,
suprisingly, when you go and talk to them, rather than hissing and
shouting, they listen.
