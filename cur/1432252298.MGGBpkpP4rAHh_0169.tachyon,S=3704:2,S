To further illustrate this effect, a brief summary of the background for 
the Felten suit might be of interest:

1.      RIAA/SDMI invite people to break their new copy protection
2.      Copy protection breaks are identified in peer-reviewed academic paper
3.      Attorney who is Sr VP at RIAA and Secretary of SDMI threatens suit 
against researchers after seeing pre-press copy of paper
4.      Paper is withdrawn from conference, not published
5.      Researchers sue for declaratory relief that they *can* publish
6.      RIAA/SDMI says they weren't going to sue, tries to dismiss 
researchers' suit due to lack of controversy for court to adjudicate
