1. It all depends on where and how it's applied. Give me a scalpel
and I suspect I can kill you with far less than 85 Joules.

2. Even if we dismiss point #1 above and assume for the same of
argument death was impossible, serious injury, blinding, etc. was
possible. And use of deadly force seems appropriate in cases where
you have a reasonable belief that you're about to be seriously
injured, even crippled.

Although Choate does make one point, and that's the guy getting run
over once or twice. Once I can understand -- the police vehicle
seems like it's up against a wall in the front. Twice seems unusual
and worth an explanation.
