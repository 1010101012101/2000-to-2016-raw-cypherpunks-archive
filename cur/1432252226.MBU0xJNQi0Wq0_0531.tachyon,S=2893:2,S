Some of us get spyware more than others.

Further, genuinely secure systems are now becoming
available, notably Symbian.

While many people are rightly concerned that DRM will
ultimately mean that the big corporation, and thus the
state, has root access to their computers and the owner
does not, it also means that trojans, viruses, and
malware does not. DRM enables secure signing of
transactions, and secure storage of blinded valuable
secrets, since DRM binds the data to the software, and
provides a secure channel to the user.   So secrets
representing ID, and secrets representing value, can
only be manipulated by the software that is supposed to
be manipulating it.
