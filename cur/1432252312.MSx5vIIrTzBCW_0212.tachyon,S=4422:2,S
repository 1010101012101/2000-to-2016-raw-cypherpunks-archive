Interesting question.

Fair.

For the magnetics I'd use a SQUID array. You couldn't use any sort of NMR
because of the intense magnetic fields. They'd wipe the disk. Though 
resolution may be an issue even for the SQUID's. I've only played with one
and it was lab, not industrial (ie $$$$), quality.

For the CD I'd probably use some sort of NMR at a high scan frequency (ie
higher resolution) and create a 3D map of the geometry of the CD (ie where
are the edges and where are the bubbles). Then I'd import that into a
AutoCAD and use AUTOLisp to overlay a standard template. Then the AUTOLisp
routine could deduce what recognizable filesystems were on it. From there
it could convert it into a dd sort of image. This would get more
complicated for multi-layer disks.

Note that using AUTOLisp doesn't bode well in the speed deamon department.

So the technique must be repeatable? Or do you mean what would be the
mechanisms to verify that it had in fact been snooped (ie we know
'somebody' snooped it)?
