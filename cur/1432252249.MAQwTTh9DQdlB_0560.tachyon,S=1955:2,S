It should be easy to create a test for memes.  The cave dweller experiment
to find natural circadian rythm could be done with a group of people.  In
the control group, don't introduce anything new, and in the experimental
group, introduce a specific meme.  If meme theory is correct, you'd be
able to predict how the experimental group does compared to the control
group.  If it's true there are not possible predictions, that would put an
end to meme theory once and for all.  Any psycologists doing this kind of
thing?

Patience, persistence, truth,
