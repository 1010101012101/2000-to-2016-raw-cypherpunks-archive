I agree that under-the-hood encryption is becoming more and
more prevalent, and that it generally improves security.  Also,
the widespread use of encryption technology helps protect
cryptorights in general as important to the public good.

The fundamental problem with "under-the-hood" is that the user
is not required to have any understanding of the process. 
Furthermore encryption technology is often also authentication
technology.

This includes transparently sending S/MIME documents (encrypted
and/or signed) as a default without requiring additional user
intervention.  In many places this results in legally binding
documents.  Furthermore, anyone with access to a system can
send legally binding e-mail documents on the user's behalf. 

Both legally-binding and authentication technology should not
be completely transparent.  Even "EULA's" require
user-intervention.  Digitally signed messages should require
user-intervention.
