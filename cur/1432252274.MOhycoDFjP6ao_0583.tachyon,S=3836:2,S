A survey of the road to killer robots + more.  Pretty remarkable  
collection of information.

Was just posted to the English-language YouTube channel of the venerable  
Chaos Computer Club:
http://www.youtube.com/user/CCCen

Here's the video they start off the talk with, an old Saturday Night Live 
skit featuring Sam Waterston pitching Old Glory Insurance's killer robot 
plan:

And here's the mentioned Boston Dynamics Big Dog Beta video, which at 4.7M 
views I was a little disappointed I had not seen it before :)

~22:25 - Spends a little time on iRobot, which is interesting considering 
their co-Founder was in the news a few days ago:
