>Religions are essentially collections of stories about the latter method

Religions are artificial shortcuts to "knowledge" and excellent method to
neutralize congenital human curiosity. If you can't comprehend it, fake it.
They all offer explanations of various phenomena by using familiar human memes
(fathers, mothers, children, birth, death.) It works most of the time.

The major difference between politics and religion is that politics is
streamlined, it doesn't count on the internal consistency (and related effort
to grasp it) but instead uses (via media) brute force of repetition.

It all boils down to getting masses to farm out the inquisitivness and then
servicing it.
