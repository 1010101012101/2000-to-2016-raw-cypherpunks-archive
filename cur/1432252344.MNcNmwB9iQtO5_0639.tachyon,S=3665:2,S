Wow! A GOOGLE search did you say? Well I'm convinced.

Well kind of. But even Qin Shr Huang Di knew that you couldn't force-march 
soldiers from Xian to Suzhou in 4 days. And the remotest parts of China at 
that time (the borders are far larger now, of course) weren't any closer 
than a month or two, no matter what the orders. (Qin Shr Huang probably was 
no idiot...if it was physically impossible then he could not gain power.)

You seem to be thinking that I am arguing that Qin Shr Huang was not a 
despot. However, comparisons to modern totalitarian states are filled with

Well, this was difficult given that there were probably a good number of Qin 
Shr Huang's 'subjects' that didn't even know they were subjects until well 
after Qin Shr Huang died. Camodia is just a TEENSY bit smaller than China.


Now the reason this excersize is not completely futile is that it's pretty 
clear that the notion of a "Despot" is very different from place to place. 
If push comes to shove, I of course will probabluy agree that most of the 
leaders you claim were despots probably were (though I'd bet my list is MUCH 
larger than yours). However, the nature, reasons, and byproducts of any 
particular instance of despotism very hugely...trying to pack them all into 
one simplistic grid is a formula for...Iraq II, come to think of it. Without 
understanding the details on their own terms, you're liable to get the 
locals a little upset with you if you try to force-fix their problems.
