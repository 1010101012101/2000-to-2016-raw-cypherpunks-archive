Collateral damage.  We are not targeting them.

Analogously, if someone grabs a human shield, and starts 
shooting at me, I am entitled to shoot back, and if the 
shield gets it, his blood is on the head of the guy who 
grabbed him, not my head.

I am unimpressed with lectures on morality given by those who 
worked for the KGB against their countrymen.

http://www.zmag.org are bunch of commies who have never found 
fault with any mass murderer, only those who defend 
themselves against mass murder, never opposed any
totalitarian tyrant, only those who make revolution against
tyrants.

I went to their web page.  The second person on the masthead 
was John Pilger, who used to be a KGB agent.
