Hi there,

As I am running a local cryptoparty and do a lot of basic encryption/pr=
ivacy=20
talks and workshops, I am often recommending Tor as one of the means of=
=20
protecting one's privacy and yes, even security (for example, by runnin=
g a=20
hidden service and making it possible for users not to leave the darkne=
t).

Of course it's far from being enough, and I make that very clear.

But lately I got to wonder if using Tor does more harm than good? If th=
e NSA=20
can impersonate any IP on the planet, they can impersonate any Tor node=
; tis=20
has two important consequences:

1. they know when you're using Tor, and can flag you accordingly, and (=
for
   example) deliver some nastiness when (not "if"!) they get the chance=
,
   because "when you have something to hide..."

2. they can guess with high probability whom are you communicating with=
; they
   don't have to break encryption, it's enough they listen-in and see t=
hat a
   Tor packet from your IP to Node A is x bytes; a packet from Node A t=
o Node
   B is x-( header + Tor encryption layer size ) bytes, and so on.

So, is using Tor today doing more harm than good? Would ordinary Joe Sc=
hmoes=20
be far better of not using Tor? How about more high-profile targets, li=
ke=20
activists/hacktivists, etc?
