> The piece linked above pretty much presents a gung-ho support of the
> awful online identity proposal, and notes compliance would likely need
> to be legislated by Congress.  (See "Why the New Federal 'Trusted
> Internet Identity' Proposal is Such a Very Bad Idea" 
> ( http://bit.ly/9j4X0w [Lauren's Blog] ) for background on the proposal.

> But what's particularly interesting are the reader comments.  At this
> point, none are clearly positive, and virtually all are negative
> toward the concept to one extent or another, in ways ranging from
> logical to wacky.  This mirrors most comments on the proposal on
> forums around the Net -- there appears to be overwhelming resistance
> to a government-involved universal Internet ID, despite claims of
> wonderful technological protections that would be provided in its
> design and deployment.

> I should add that the proposal plays directly into the hands of the
> more "fringy" New World Order conspiracy fans, and provides political
> fodder for Big Telecom's "the feds are going to take over the
> Internet" Big Lie campaign against Net Neutrality.
