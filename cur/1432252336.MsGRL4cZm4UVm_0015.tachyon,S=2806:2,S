 >>fellow officers protested and declared a work "slowdown." The union was 
all for it. Don't look for a fast response from 911 calls, I guess, if you 
live in certain Maryland suburbs of DC.

Guess they wont find chandra levy anytime soon.A cop in sydney the other 
day ,admitted to stealing large sums and dealing drugs quite routinely then 
blushed a little as he recounted how he'd sold his badge once to a drug dealer.
All vic drug squads have been told to resign and reapply.The union's 
considering their options.
