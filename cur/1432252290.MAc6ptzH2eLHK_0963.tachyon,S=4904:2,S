I didn't say my views on Palladium and TCPA/DRM are already contained in 
an 8-9-year-old document, only that the ground is well-trod. Especially 
the ground involving voluntary vs. mandatory, Brin's ideas, and the 
"policeman inside" notion that if we don't install DRM Big Brother will 
have to do it for us.

I don't try to discourage others, but I have better things to do with my 
time than to argue futilely with statists who are not even reading my 
stuff! (Many of them are cross-posting in from Perrypunks, so my replies 
are unseen by them.)

Probably _not_, for the very reason Palladium will fail: a plethora of 
extant systems which people will not scrap just so they can watch "The 
Fast and the Furious."

Anyone who believes this, or even repeats it as a rumor, is on drugs.

I have half a dozen computers, all usable in various ways. Not even in a 
Chinese-type police state could these legally-acquired computers, 
acquired for a lot of money, be declared "outlawed."

Not even counting your computers, and my computers, and 500 million 
computers already out in the U.S. alone, there are the designs of 
processors like Pentium 4, Athlon, McKinley, Thoroughbred, Duron, etc., 
_none_ of which are of this Valenti-friendly TCPA form. None of the 
hundreds of millions of systems now being prepared for sale are of this 
form. Saying that general purpose computers lacking TCPA/DRM will be 
"outlawed" is silly.
