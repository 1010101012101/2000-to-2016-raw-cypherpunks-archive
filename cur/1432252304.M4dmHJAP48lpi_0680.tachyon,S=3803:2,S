According to the Daily Telegraph, the US took most of the credit for 
breaking Japanese codes during WWII. The paper says that Bletchley 
Park deserves more credit according to recently declassified papers. 
Only traditional British reticence kept them from claiming credit 
before.

Of course, the British also stood on the shoulders of the Polish.....
