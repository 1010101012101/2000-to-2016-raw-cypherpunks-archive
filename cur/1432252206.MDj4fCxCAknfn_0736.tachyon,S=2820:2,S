"New PCs Likely to Cede Some Control
Sun Nov 3, 1:58 PM ET

By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Technology Writer

SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - To thwart hackers and foster online commerce, 
the next generation of computers will almost certainly cede some 
control to software firms, Hollywood and other outsiders.


That could break a long-standing tenet of computing: that PC owners 
ultimately control data on their own machines.


Microsoft calls its technology "Palladium." Intel dubs it "LaGrande."
"

I say we call it "LaGrab."
