How is this conceptually different from a 2-node Tor network, where each 
ISP operates one node of the pair linking to every other ISP (so there 
are I^2 pairs)? Additional benefit of using Tor would be mixing and 
making traffic analysis harder. Threat modelling could draw on the 
existing research on Tor vulnerabilities.

Also, an ISP could easily, today, run single-node Tor network to obscure 
end point locations.

The problem does not seem technical at all. The problem is that ISPs 
have physical addresses. What you need is a floating ISP ... go 
anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man 
alone.
