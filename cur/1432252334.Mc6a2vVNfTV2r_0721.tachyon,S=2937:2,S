Just for the record you are still allowed to carry on a plane
personal smoking items, eg., a butane lighter.  You can't
use them of course, on US flights, but there is no
prohibition.  [A camping tank of butane fuel is a no-no]

I don't see how plant matter can be used as a weapon unless the
stems are waaay too big :-)
