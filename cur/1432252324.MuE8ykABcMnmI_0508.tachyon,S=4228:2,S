>Hello dear tor talkers,

>I'm running the tor router "mini", located in paris, france, and I
>believe I have to share with you what happened to me last wednesday,the
>10th of May. My router was an outside gateway, doing request for tor
>anonymous users.
>
>Last wednesday morning, at 7:45, three cops did knock at my door. They
>suspected me to have downloaded some child porn videos. As I was waking
>up, I understood it was tor-related. I did explain them I was a TOR
>outside gateway, but they didn't knew about it. They searched everywhere
>in my small home and took every support they could find: hard drives
>they removed from computers, cds, disks, and then they took me to the
>police station, at the child protection service, jailing me the whole
>day while they was searching my hard drives and cds for traces of the
>video they was looking for.
>
>They did asked me if they was a way to trace back to the criminal who
>downloaded this child abuse video, but I told them "not in my knowledge"
>and "the tor network is designed to make this impossible, keeping no log
>of traffic".
>
>At 19:00, having not found these video, having learned more about tor
>and confirmated I was running it, they freed me, giving me back my cds
>and hard drives.
>
>It's sad the way some people use their freedom, e.g. participating in
>child abuse, but I'm still a strong believer in the necessity of
>anonymity on the internet.
>
>As I asked them, they did assure me they accessed my hard drives
>read-only, using hardware write disabler, but I still prefer not to run
>it straight from the hard drive they had in hand for the whole day as I
>know cops are not that trustable. The "mini" router will be back in a
>few days. Not getting paranoid, but using paranooa to make sane decisions !
>
>Do you know if similar things did happenned to other routers ?
>
>If you wants some more details, or have advice for me please ask and /or
>give.

>Thanks everyone for making this possible !
