RuBee is a new tagging standard that mostly uses magnetic rather
than radio signals, making it better at penetrating metal and liquids
which are common in warehouse environments where RFID would be useful.
Range is about 10-50 feet.  Frequencies are below 450 MHz.
The main drawback compared to RFID is that it's slower,
about 10 reads per second instead of 100-200.
