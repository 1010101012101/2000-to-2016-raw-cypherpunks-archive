I've answered none of the questions.  Just simply put the questionaire
in the appropriate recycling bin.  And the follow up.  I made sure I didn't
answer the door when the Censuswhores were walking the streets.

Perhaps ten years from now when the next one hits, I'll tell them why I
won't answer any questions, and when they inform me of my protected 
privacy, I'll point to the recently mentioned bills.
