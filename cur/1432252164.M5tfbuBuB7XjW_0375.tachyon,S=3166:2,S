Bush's New Surveillance Proposals Could Bring Information Overload

<snip>
Under another proposal being considered Tuesday night, all of the enhanced surveillance capabilities that the bill would give law-enforcement personnel would phase out after December 2003. Negotiators from both sides were still weighing that idea, participants said. Mr. Ashcroft Tuesday testified before a Senate panel that he opposed any "automatic sunset" of the proposed legislation.
========================

By not allowing an automatic sunset Ashcroft says we intend to keep the country on a permanent war footing and permanently curtail 4th Amendment freedoms.  SS indeed!

"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."
                                                       -Hume 
If the leglislation passes as Ashcroft wants this may be one of those times...
