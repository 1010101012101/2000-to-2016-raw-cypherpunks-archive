Yes, in addition to my other thoughtcrimes, I lived for several years 
very near to Central Expressway, just north (west, actually, but 
"north" is the logical direction) of Santa Clara. On Mathilda Avenue, 
right near those castor plants.

(Minor historical note: I moved to Mathilda Avenue, to "The Apartment" 
(now something like "Northpointe"), in 1975. Central Distressway, as we 
called it, was actually very uncrowded in those days, compared to 
today. It was one of the undiscovered commuting pathways of those 
years.  This was before gridlock on 101 and 280 (and Highway 85 was of 
course not finished until the 1990s). Things have gotten a little bit 
better since all of the "Loudclouds" and "Fireponds" went bust, but not 
by much.)

Yep. As a felon, I know these things.
