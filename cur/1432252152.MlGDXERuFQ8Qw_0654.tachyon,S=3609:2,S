FROM: 

Dr. Chukuma Okpara


DATE: 24th July 2001

Dear Sir,


URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL: STRICTLY 
CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr Chukuma Okpara Director of procurement and contracts with Nigeria 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Sometime ago, my corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract to Total Oil 
International, to service Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work in Kaduna 
Refinery and Petrol-chemical Company (KRPC) plant in Nigeria. This contract was 
over-invoiced by us to the tune of US $75 Million (Seventy Five Million Dollars). 
Some officials and myself reached a compromise to transfer the fund into a foreign 
bank account that will accommodate this fund.

For providing the beneficiary's account you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum, 
70% for myself and partners, while 5% will be set aside to offset any expenses that 
may be incurred by either party during the transfer process.

To enable us put up claims, we would require the following information: (1). Name to 
be used as beneficiary, telephone/fax number. (2). A written and signed letter of 
guarantee to confirm to us that the said fund is safe when transferred and our share 
will be given to us accordingly. After the successful completion of this deal, we intend 
to use part of our share to invest into your corporation or any business as may be 
advised by you.

Please contact my financial adviser Mr. Yaya Ahmed in the Netherlands who will 
give you brief details of this transaction. His telephone numbers are +44 771 369 
3506 or +31 612 309 149 and fax number is +44 870 135 2749. Be advised that 
confidentiality is required because we are civil servants and do not want any scandal. 
My email address is yahammed@yahoo.co.uk.



Yours Faithfully



Dr. Chukuma Okpara.
