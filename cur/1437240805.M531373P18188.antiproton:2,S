I want to say "You're new here, aren't you?", but I know you're not.
Parallel construction and intelligence laundering take care of this in case
they want to abuse your data. Big Data is never very much of a privacy
issue, but when they silently use that Big Data for their (or their
companies') profit, well, without competition you'll lose. And then there's
straight business-secret-stealing, which they also do, and which is very
hard to ever find out about (parallel construction is also possible here).

So, yeah, they'll protect their billions in income and valuation. And
they'll use all the intelligence the US can bring to the table to do it.
