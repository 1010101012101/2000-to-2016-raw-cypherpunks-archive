Mark cited the Bank of England, not U.S. law. I don't know what British 
law is in this regard.

But I will tell you that the notion that U.S. dollars must be accepted 
as "payment" in the U.S. (using the variant that corrects Mark's 
typographical error above) is false.

The language is along the lines of "this note good for all debts public 
and private." This does not stop parties from agreeing to transfers in 
yak brains, or houses, or gold, or tantalum.

It says that if Alice agrees to pay Bob 50 dollars ($50), with no 
special payment instructions agreed to, and Alice at some point gives 
Bob a $50 piece of U.S. currency, she has fulfilled her debt obligation 
under U.S. law. I surmise, but have not verified, that this sort of 
language was added to banknotes to better ensure that people accepted 
the banknotes as being equivalent to specie (gold and silver).
