Another "fix" that is being used is passengers who will act to keep the
plane from being used as a weapon.  If the hijackers have to kill people
with small sharp objects that they can smuggle on board, instead of mass
killing devices like machine guns, then a large number of passengers can
overcome a small number of hijackers.  (Remember, your seat cushion makes a
good shield.)  If the cockpit door keeps the hijackers out, then there is a
good chance that there will be survivors.
