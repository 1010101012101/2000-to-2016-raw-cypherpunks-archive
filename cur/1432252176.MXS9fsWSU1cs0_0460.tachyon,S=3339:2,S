Hash: SHA1

AN INVITATION

WHAT: IRC network for liberty builders.
WHY: The time for waiting for others to do things is over.
HOW: Using our energy and talents, rather than waiting until some
unspecified date.
WHERE: Server: agora.anarplex.net Port: 14716  (SSL Required)
TOOL: If you don't have an irc client so far, use chatzilla with firefox
    (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16)
    This link will connect you:  ircs://agora.anarplex.net:14716
    You may want to use an anonymizer to protect your connection.
    However, the IRC server does not know your IP address and cannot  
make it
available.

Mission:
    - Take risks for liberty. It is up to us to change our lives. Being
obedient keeps us serfs.
    - Learn, create, cooperate, advance.
    - Create reputation and networks of trust.
    - Talk with people who are not fully brainwashed.
    - Prove that people can live with each other without coercion.

Hints:
    - Use "/msg nickserv help" to find out how to create a persistent
identity on the network.
    - Invite others that might want to contribute to liberty.
    - Respect others. This is a place where only minds meet. Be  
courteous
and mature.
    - Read the posts at http://fau.anarplex.net/

This is all about creating parallel solutions to establish pockets of
tangible liberty for you and
the people you want to associate with.

Politics does not work. Loopholes do not work forever. We must build  
liberty
as a separate realm.

Consider our server a country in itself - a place outside of any  
state. So,
don't bring the state to
it in your mind and do not draw the state's agents to this place.

The Free and The Unashamed
