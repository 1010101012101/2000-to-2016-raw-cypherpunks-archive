I wonder what kind of security they have at the Old River Control Structure
(ORCS) ?

Background:

The ORCS was built by the Corps in the 1960's to prevent the Mississippi
from changing its path from the route that  goes through
New Orleans to a more direct route via the Atchafalaya River ( a route that
is 170 miles shorter than it's current path). If the river did
change course, It would destroy a large wildlife sanctuary and would
eventually leave New Orleans and Baton Rouge without fresh water,
not to mention economic impact it would have.

It was almost destroyed during the massive floods of 1973 by scouring
(basically the the river undermining the foundation of the structure).

The Corp has since reinforced the structure and built a additional
structures to control the flow.
