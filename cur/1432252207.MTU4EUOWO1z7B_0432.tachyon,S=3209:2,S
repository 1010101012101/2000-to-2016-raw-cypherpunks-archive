That's just shit rolling downhill.  How long is a manager going to have 
his job if he *doesn't* fire slackers?  Or how long can an employer 
continue to make a profit and thus remain in business if they never 
clear "dead-weight" employees out of the company?  

Reminding a slacker of this fact is merely a reality check.  

Now, if it were an attractive member of the appropriate sex who was 
refusing to have sex with the employer, *that* would be a pure show of 
force...
