While agreeing about the rights of property owners, many of the newly build or renovated ballparks have either been financed with municipal bond offerings making the government a creditor of the team or are owned by municipalities and leased to the teams and thus not even nominally private property. For instance here in New York the issue of where the Yankees will play in the future involves the governor, the mayor and the borough presidents of the Bronx and Manhattan as the current stadium is owned by the city as a result of the last renovation and the proposed new stadium on the upper west side would be paid for partially with tax free municipal bonds and partially by the state, owned by the city and leased to the Yankees at a concessional rate.  Though I don't have  the facts about all the stadiums built or renovated in the last decade or so, I think this is pretty standard stuff.  Governments try to impose their rules on anyone who partakes of their largesse thus the own!
er!

s have compromised their independence.
