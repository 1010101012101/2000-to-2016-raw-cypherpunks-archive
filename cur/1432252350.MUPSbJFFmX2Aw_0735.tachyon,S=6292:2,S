And now that I think about it some more as well, I wonder if some of the 
more controversial black bag jobs are subcontracted out to NGOs. The 
stuff of many a bad B-movie on late night cable, there are still a lot 
of reasons why gangs would be hired to hit the homes of political 
dissidents.

(Lon Horiuchi still has a bounty on his head by some Aryan groups, and 
has dropped off the face of the "official" earth, so the Fedz are 
probably upping their use of Beltway Bandits. I know I would if I were 
them. I'd hire some Original Gangstas to do my dirty work...through 
cut-outs, of course, so that if they didn't get zapped by the target, or 
by the clean-up crew, they couldn't narc out their employers. Like I 
said, a bad B-movie on Cinemax, probably starring either Lorenzo Lamas 
or Don "The Dragon.")
