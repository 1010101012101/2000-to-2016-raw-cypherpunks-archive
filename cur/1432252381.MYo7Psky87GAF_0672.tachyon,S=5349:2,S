Oh, you mean like the volumes of research on the future of domestic terrorism
and information warfare scenarios gamed and developed by analysts at the RAND
Corporation, the Institute for Defense Analyses and other government FFRDC think
tanks?

But since the research was paid for by the DoD and RAND analysts aren't
generally in the habit of selling their books to "suspicious types" at gun
shows, it's somehow different, right?  And if a researcher happens to wants to
have a look at the $10 CD for his work or out of intellectual curiosity, you're
going to have him stalked down by some cro-magnon donuteater like everyone
else, or is he somehow "special status" for being a "good guy" working in
a "privileged position"? And do you really think that anyone curious enough to
put out ten bucks to learn about what they're up against is automatically going
to trot out and do it? You equate possessing a fermentation vat full of anthrax
with possessing a book about anthrax? "Ordinary folks read as they're told?"

Absolutely bankrupt.

But analysts inventing and debating all sorts of fiendish scenarios on an
internal DoD mailing list covering potential terrorist threats and
infrastructure vulnerabilities are somehow exempt and have "special
status", right. 

Your entire plan revolves around an arbitrary decision which
divides people into categories of who you like and who you don't.

"If you don't believe in rights for people you despise, you don't
believe in the idea of rights at all."

You're going to see whatever you want. And therefore, you'll never know.

Banning information becuase "ordinary folks read as they're told" is a colossal
problem, as big as any I can think of. People like you risk being responsible
for bringing on the Dark Ages again.

But then, it sure sounds like a lot of you are already there.
