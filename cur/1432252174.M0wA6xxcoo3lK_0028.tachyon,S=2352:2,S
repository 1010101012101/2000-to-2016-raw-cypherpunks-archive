Didn't thought about this. Noticed the "generated by server" thing, but 
thought it'll be a local process collecting entropy from some hardware 
source. Yes, your Honor, I admit I am guilty from assuming lack of 
stupidity on the vendor side. :(

Perhaps because they don't want to make a really secure system, aren't 
aware about this possibility, were politely told to not use it by some 
Third Party, don't know how to do it this way...?

Maybe it could be a good idea to ask them.
