By popular demand, I've created a moderated alternative to the UKCrypto 
mailing list. See 
https://mailman.aldigital.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/ukcisnac for the 
charter and subscription information.

This is intended to be complementary to the cryptography (because its 
about the UK) and ukcrypto (because its moderated) mailing lists, rather 
than competitive with them.

And no, I'm not interested in discussing why we haven't burnt our money 
buying a cert from your favourite money sink.

Cheers,

Ben.
