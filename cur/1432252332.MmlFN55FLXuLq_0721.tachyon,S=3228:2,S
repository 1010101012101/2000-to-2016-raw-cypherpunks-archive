What can society do about these people who think that they know something?

Well, first we deny the possibility that they have anything novel to 
say, then we arrange to have them find fault with themselves for what 
they perceive as their own shortcomings. Then after they have injured 
themselves trying to correct this implied deficiency, we tell them that 
maybe their ideas had merit, but the only efficient way to assess any 
idea, is for the originator to take responsibility for making them 
happen. If they are unable to demonstrate the successful application of 
the idea, we take this as proof that the idea was no good to begin with. 
Such is the application of market theory to the systematic suppression 
of unsupported ideas. The attitudes of Winners and Losers alike, are 
taken to be the causative factor. We recognize the effect of the self 
fulfilling prophesy. In both cases what is going unmentioned is the 
structural context. Winners are those we give credit to, Losers face 
responsibility for not being creditable. Winners will credit their 
success to luck and hard work, but Losers are left to reach the 
conclusion that either it is all their personal fault, or they have been 
the victim of bad luck.

 

What to do about the illusion of functional autonomy vs. the principle 
of independence?

 

Self control: we must become sufficiently self aware to realize that 
this vital instrument of independence is exactly the force that 
imprisons so many of us within a personal hell. As a society we would be 
well advised to examine the structural realities that leave so many of 
us with broken dreams and a poverty of options. The merit principle is 
all very well, but isnt it is a clear sign of a sick society, when we 
conflate winning the lottery, with demonstrating competence?
