And my point is a very serious one: saying that "anarchy" cannot work 
in markets is not much different from saying anarchy (uncoerced 
transactions) cannot work in areas where in fact uncoerced 
transactions are the _norm_.

It's much like the school choice issue. People in the U.S. tend to 
treat their local public schools as immutable consequences of the 
system we live in. Regardless of the issue of how bad schools are, 
etc., this is simply not true.

Try replacing "school choice" with "grocery store choice."

"How will parents ensure the nutritional needs of their children if 
this "nutritional anarchy" is allowed to replace our orderly system 
in which households are assigned a regional grocery store and 
nutritional standards are satisfied?"

As I said to Ray Dillinger, the mistake many make is to try to solve 
the whole problem, the whole enchilada. They balk at the complexity 
of transforming an economy into an untraceable digital cash and 
pseudonym economy. Well, this is crazy.

Better to think about selective markets bypassing U.S. or Saudi or 
French regulatory control. And not just by U.S. businesses moving to 
France, and vice versa, which only "slows down" the regulators, but 
to  make the leap into cypherspace.

Which markets? Not for me to worry about, except to consider some 
examples to see how things _might_ evolve.

Anarchy is much more the norm than people think.
