I swear you can see flopsweat on Rumsfeld as he's trying to explain troop 
buildup as being more or less a deployment accident (though soon to be 
followed by non-accidental buildups). Even this arrogant little fuck now 
realizes he's stepped in deep doo-doo.

As for the laughter, I'll be laughing too until the next round of planes 
perform a little touchdown downtown here. Ah well. I suckle from the breast 
of US big-business...those are the risks I take.
