not true.  in fact, i would argue that the difficulty of finding good music 
is widespread throughout the states.
i attribute this to the clueless, braindead fools who are governed by the 
radio...and we all know the stupidity of the people who control the radio 
stations.
yet, go to just about any country in europe (i say europe because my 
firsthand knowledge is limited) and you can easily find just about anything 
you want.  i have far better luck finding many american bands in europe than 
in america.  why?  because many albums are simply not _released_ in america. 
  a lot of albums that are released in america are released in europe first 
(even american bands).  then again, just listen to european radio.
