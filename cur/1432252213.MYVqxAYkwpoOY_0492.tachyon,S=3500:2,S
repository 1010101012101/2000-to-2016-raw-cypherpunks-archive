He posted a comment the other day about my sending private notes was
unwaranted in responce to comments made on the public list.

I was wondering why he got them at all because previously he hadn't been
receiving them. Well today I made the same mistake, I didn't look at the
header until after I'd sent it. Then I realized that Declan is now sending
these messages not only to the list, but to me privately (something he
says is against netiquette?), something he wasn't doing before. The
private messages bubble to the top first so I reply to them. I was also
wondering why I was getting multiple copies of his inbound too.

So, if Declan would please forward the responce to his public post back to
the list (and send his commentary w/o me cc:'ed specificaly please) we can
proceed with a reasonably civil debate until he finds something else to
play with instead of the topic at hand.
