Ray, your Texas drawl sucks.

Yankee's start sentences with "Well,...." and there is no Texas drawl on
'...el...'.

People from Kansas and Oklahoma (definitely not southern) say 'awl'.

I don't know anyone who pronounces it 'natcherl', definitely no native
Texan.

Yankee's say 'it's a gonna', we say 'it's fixin' to'.

'Tha' isn't Texan, 'Thuh' would be.

'bidness' is a (black) yankee term, not southern.

And we don't say 'ya see'.

You have yankee/mid-west confused with Texas/southern. But me and my
native Texas friends got a kick outta it, thanks for the giggles.
