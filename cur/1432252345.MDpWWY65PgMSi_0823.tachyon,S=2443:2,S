AES 128 in hardware under a buck

I'm currently working with low power radios in consumer electronics.  
Zigbee/RF4C, Bluetooth low energy, etc.

The interesting thing is that there are chips which contain a processor, 
a 2.4GHz radio, and AES 128 in hardware. 

For a few bucks or less.  Going into things like TV remote controls.  Great 
for protecting your keystrokes on a qwerty remote control when using TV 
like a computer. Makes you wonder about AES 128. .... 

Also, adding a microphone (think Siri voice control) is becoming
commonplace.  
Which can be fun but the microphone is in a system which can be manipulated.  

As someone (DIRNSA ?) recently said, folks are bugging themselves. 

At least certain Sun workstations of old turned on an LED when the microphone 
was enabled. .... 

It is now trivial to make a bursted, encrypted audio bug the size of the
battery 
plus a little.
