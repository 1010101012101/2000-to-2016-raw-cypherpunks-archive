No, it would be testing the professionalism of the cop/pig in question.

Any cop who reacts to being called "useless pig" is, in fact, one.
And should be removed from positions of authority.

Problem with Nat'l Guardsthugs (or any MIL) 
is they don't have the training of a cop.
[Professional] Cops know force gradations, psyops, constitutional
law and case history.  Professional soldiers know shout, shoot.
Civil ops, civility, is not their domain.
