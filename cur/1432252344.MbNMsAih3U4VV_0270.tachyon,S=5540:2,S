The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a |ong-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-We|l Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverable Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and dri|led 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 million barre|s of oil and about 2 bil|ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparably smal| market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
dec|ine
slight|y, you will stil| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi|l
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wil| be 
staggering.

Overal|, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
p|ays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Early investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area will really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
