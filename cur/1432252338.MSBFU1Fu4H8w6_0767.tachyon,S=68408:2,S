 interesting, in that it=0Amakes it impracticle for most citizens unless a =

 gap with ideas, the loss of concepts altogether within<br>computing: "tool=

e ---<br><br>e-ink has been for me the great potential for a more 'idea-bas=
ed'<br>approach to display, such that larger format interfaces such as<br>c=
alendars or maps could feasibly become updateable and readable in a<br>non-=
projected-light or blaring screen approach that scorches the<br>eyeballs or=
 loses readability in the sun or forces extreme fatigue in<br>high-contrast=
 viewing (screens when read at night in low light or for<br>long periods of=
 time, hours to days and weeks of interaction).<br><br>an upgraded version =
of the Kindle DX was in my estimate the best<br>change of finally having a =
tool or platform for sharing ideas, beyond<br>the failure zone of email lis=
ts and blogs and social media sites, that<br>'ideas' and conceptualization =
both in a realm of scholarship and<br>thinking, as this relates to
 discussion and feedback and debate, could<br>be opened up by a tool that m=
eets this realm of *advanced literacy* --<br>and yet instead, when the next=
-gen Paperwhite Kindle was announced,<br>the large format DX had no such up=
date and then was said by some<br>Amazon representative to not be in furthe=
r development, thus the only<br>viable PDF reader at size of actual documen=
ts was left in an unlit<br>condition, eventually removed from their website=
.<br><br>this basically killed off my remaining hope in technological<br>in=
novation because it forced any such publishing platform that could<br>devel=
op for ideas into a constricted zone of haikus only and penguin<br>classics=
 small-book formats, great for reading on a bus, bad for<br>complex ideas a=
nd diagrams and visual and written communication<br>combined, at a readable=
 type size where formatting does not need to be<br>pinched &amp; zoomed rep=
eatedly to move through information, and thus<br>issues of
 formatting as it relates to standards, the web deteriorated<br>into variou=
s formatting approaches, canned 'big box' solutions,<br>monoculture, deafen=
ing sameness that adds up to nothing more than the<br>part.<br><br>when i c=
onsidered the Kindle DX as a platform it seems ideal for<br>fishing and top=
o maps, for documents yet also calendar like<br>scheduling, day planning, e=
tc. though in years of thinking about it<br>(and never yet using the device=
), one day it dawned on me the missing<br>functionality was the very attrib=
ute that originally seemed the<br>greatest feature: free 3G connectivity to=
 Wikipedia.<br><br>this is one of those issues for a person like myself who=
 grew up<br>without an encyclopedia within the home, yet had a yearning<br>=
fascination with information yet no access. as it remains today in<br>many =
ways, sans cellphone, though having ready access to an online<br>reference =
work could then open up questioning and the imagination
 to<br>further considerations instead of stopping or limiting next steps in=
<br>thinking.&nbsp; this is equivalent to the advice 'if you do know what a=
<br>word means look it up in the dictionary' as a life practice, to<br>impr=
oving literacy, yet at the larger connected realm of ideas in<br>their expa=
nded explanation and description, integral<br>conceptualization.<br><br>and=
 thus in reverse, the idea arose that wouldn't it be ideal if the<br>Kindle=
 DX was a _writing platform as well as just reading. not simply<br>writing =
a computer, but also, at the e-ink device via touchscreen or<br>other inter=
face (handwriting, diagramming).<br><br>a related concept i have described =
as 'fractal reading/writing' is in<br>some ways connected to this ability t=
o write in categories versus<br>long-strings of conventional descriptive la=
nguage, more like<br>programming or code for structures of concepts, as if =
molecular<br>entities. going into a concept, not just across it, via
 language.<br>modeling the ideas, concepts, structural 'forms', where scaff=
olding<br>may exist as substructures hidden or not in given views (xml, tag=
s,<br>etc)<br><br>the realization then that if every Kindle shipped with wi=
ki software<br>that would allow people to write these structures and link t=
hem<br>together in a new public zone of the internet that is based upon ide=
as<br>and concepts and their organization. a public realm like cafe society=
<br>where debates and discussions could occur, conceptualization beyond<br>=
boundaries of websites or separated blogs, and into the structures<br>thems=
elves, that would move from individual POVs in relativistic<br>frames, grou=
nded or not, into a larger empirical structure, if<br>mediated this way, or=
ganized, managed, maintained, say by public<br>discourse, debate, challengi=
ng of hypotheses.<br><br>this, tools for thinking and tools for developing =
literacy, to battle<br>the engrained ignorance that one-way media
 and vested opinions<br>together establish, especially when separated and l=
eft unchallenged or<br>untested beyond a comfortable isolation. what if too=
ls could<br>reestablish or allow a public zone or square or environment whe=
re<br>today none actually exists. and what if it is wiki and e-readers and<=
br>those who use these for scholarship and exchanging ideas, and thus<br>va=
rious platforms and vendors could exist and participate, allow<br>access an=
d interface, yet also it would involve those with knowledge<br>of particula=
r domains to develop and model them, and potentially<br>transform existing =
conceptions of what a field or discipline actually<br>is, in contrast to th=
e outdated or detached academic models that may<br>limit what is approved.<=
br><br>being someone who is intrigued by innovative technological tools wit=
h<br>purpose, it was completely devastating when Amazon dropped support for=
<br>the larger format DX. i lost faith in Bezos vision because it at
 once<br>manages a future of books while removing the larger purpose of ide=
as<br>and concept development they involve, making it a read-only scenario<=
br>with Kindles versus a read-and-write platform for those developing<br>id=
eas, the people who are creating the documents, so they can review<br>their=
 own work at scale, away from the PC screen and read others ideas<br>likewi=
se, beyond its domination over context and interpretation, via<br>distracti=
on and requirement of multitasking with an OS or other device<br>with deman=
ds.<br><br>thus the [concept] + [concept] =3D [concept] / [concept] approac=
h that<br>wikis allow could be a new way of 'writing' that is non-linear an=
d<br>fractal, going into other networked data structures or particular<br>v=
ersions, to create various models of ideas and concepts and new<br>organiza=
tions or a worldview, new interface to online information that<br>could be =
developed that is integrated into a single model, and data<br>could be
 attached to this, instead of having individual branded<br>websites reinven=
ting the wheel, they could be data structures instead<br>with basic facts a=
nd details. certainly would deal with information<br>anxiety issues at ever=
y level, from finding out info in a Wolfram-like<br>computational approach,=
 to the phone-book aspect of just wanting the<br>facts without the 1mb down=
load of advertising banner ads and all the<br>tracking data to locate an ad=
dress, etc. and then it could be<br>visualized atop that via the various ap=
proaches, instead of tied down<br>into static rendered css/xml sites as UI/=
display.<br><br>there is no reason this wiki-approach could not exist on ta=
blets and<br>cellphones likewise, (in the sense of 'tools for thinking') th=
ough it<br>is this issue related to readability adn those who are writers o=
r<br>thinkers or scholars or communicator/conveyors, debaters of ideas,<br>=
etc, that in reading or considering ideas, the issues of the
 screen<br>and its biasing does influence what is read, how it is read, and=
<br>within what parameters (in browser, often with animations running or<br=
>OS notifications, or various errors) versus a device purpose-made for<br>e=
asy readability and reading, the pleasure of textual communication,<br>even=
 into embedded visuals/diagrams, versus the hassle that is email<br>or all =
the formatted bureaucracy blogs require to upkeep while<br>limiting referen=
ce or url-rot or whatever. versus having data stored<br>as documents in a l=
ibrary within a device -or- accessible as a<br>structure, as with a wiki-st=
ructure of networked data models, that<br>could become a new realm of the i=
nternet, expanding further than<br>wikipedia yet still accessible. another =
variant like gopher or mailing<br>lists, yet more permanent, like earlier d=
ays of (lynx-like) Yahoo<br>categorization yet public, developed as areas o=
f integrated knowledge<br>and areas of debate and discussion, not
 limited to the outdated<br>worldviews held within and requiring censorship=
 to control and<br>discourage feedback, within institutions. thus, the oppo=
rtunity for<br>Galilean/Copernicun remodeling and working-through such cond=

corporate or institutional or private control over<br>shared reality.<br><b=
r>so Amazon dropped out, and Sony went conceptual and introduced a<br>fasci=
nating upgrade to their e-ink future with a prototype now<br>deploying for =
testing in Japan. see the video:<br><br>13.3-inch Sony tablet // the future=

ust an e-reader, it is described as a 'digital<br>notepad' and 'digital pap=
er', perhaps tending toward the concept of a<br>clipboard functionality for=
 this kind of device, where it could be<br>used for formwork, charting, cen=
sus, notes and writing, scheduling,<br>etc. and likely would be much more u=
sable than a tablet (including<br>large sized) due to weight, battery life,=
 readability, and better<br>functionality with dedicated or programmable ta=
sk buttons that are not<br>needing to relate to MP3 and videos, other non-r=

used on Universities, so it has an inherent<br>educational purpose, (potent=
ially: tool for thinking) and is currently<br>in trials in Japan from what =
i last read. and a price of approximately<br>1k USD was recently
 mentioned, which is also interesting, in that it<br>makes it impracticle f=
or most citizens unless a niche or supported<br>project.<br><br>this must h=
ave freaked out Amazon and reawoken their Kindle DX program<br>because the =
device has since reappeared on their website, and for a<br>heavily discount=
ed price (169 USD, when previously in the 379 USD<br>range). it was a close=
out special before, yet reintroduced, it is a<br>reactivation of a forfeite=
d category, something that was said<br>officially a dead-end, and to me was=
 a betrayal of ideas and the<br>Kindle as a publishing platform, thus the h=
eartbreak that the soul of<br>books have become only about the money made f=
rom them, not the<br>continuance of ideas they contain and culture they dev=
elop and<br>sustain. yet, along with quadrocopters, suddenly Amazon and Bez=
os are<br>back in the realm of critical relevance in this same context by w=
hat<br>is potentially a vital reversal, hopefully and likely
 indicating a<br>renewed interest in the large-format e-ink reader as futur=

fficult for a person like me, heavily vested in strange ideas<br>requiring =
a platform for their public exchange, to be removed as a<br>possibility. it=
 was preface to extinction for the very relevance of<br>thought within netw=
orked media, to have the literacy device disappear,<br>taken over by more j=
ukeboxes with electronic money-slots required for<br>each &amp; every inter=
