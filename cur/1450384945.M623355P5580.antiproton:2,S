	Well, radiation certainly *can* be deadly. For instance, if you
	were to stand near an ordinary wood fire long enough you could
	easily get burns caused by *infrared radiation* that would kill
	you in, say, hours. Not a nice death either. Notice that the
	heat is being transferred by radiation, not direct
	contact/conduction.

	Regarding the moon trips, random 'mainstream' source : 

	"There was no shortage of threats facing Apollo astronauts on
	missions to the Moon. Like radiation. Specifically, the dense
	radiation environment of the Van Allen belts. NASA...had
	studied the “Van Allen problem” as it were, knew the risks, and
	made the decision to go anyway. 

	http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts

	Seems to me that asking about radiation is rather sensible
	whereas dismissing people who ask as not-so-well-educated
	'conspiracy theorists'  isn't.

	Oh, ok. I thoguht the first landing was a bit a earlier.
	Anyway, so far nobody has provided much detail about radar
	resolution. Yes, voice comms were allegedly followed, yes, you
	can bounce microwaves off the moon. I freely admit that my
	knowledge of em theory is lacking so I wouldn't mind more
	information to go from "bounce radio off the moon" (big object)
	to realtime tracking of a small object on the moon, and without
	any fancy 'dsp' microelectronics.

	But that's not the same thing as getting an accurate position?

	I never said nor suggested that everything was fake. Just as an
	hypothesis, the fake part may be the landings, or some of them.
	If the landings were technically impossible at that time, or at
	least the first one(s), then they had to be faked.

	Well, that's where we certainly differ. You seem to be
	conveniently overlooking all the incentives all the state
	parasites and nationalists have to lie.

	I don't know. That sounds like unfounded 'anti cospiracy'
	'theory' based on the dogma/irrational belief that secrets
	can't be kept.
