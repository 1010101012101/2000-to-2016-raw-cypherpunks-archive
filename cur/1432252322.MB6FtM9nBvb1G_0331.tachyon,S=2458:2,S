#    I don't know if Reno is a traitor, but consider this:
#    Between 1992 and 1997, there were approximately 2,500
#    national security wiretaps requested by the FBI.  Only one
#    of these 2,500 requests was turned down:  Wen Ho Lee's!  And
#    this turndown took place while Wen Ho Lee was still
#    downloading nuclear secrets from Lost Alamos.

True/False?
