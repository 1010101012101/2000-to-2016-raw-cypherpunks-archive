Seems all it just was a scare.

Powder proves harmless after Sydney anthrax scare

   Authorities have described as harmless a white powder-like substance
   found at the international terminal of Sydney Airport earlier today.
   An area near the Qantas check-in service was cordoned off as
   authorities in protective outfits examined the suspicious substance
   found on ticket documentation in the Qantas ticket sales office late
   this afternoon.
   A Qantas spokeswoman says the white powdery like substance was found
   on pre-printed documents.
   The scare comes as United States officials deal with five new cases of
   exposure to anthrax.
