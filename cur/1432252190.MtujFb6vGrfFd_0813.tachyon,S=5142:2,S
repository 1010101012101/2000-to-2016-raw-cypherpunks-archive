You're forgetting 
      e) A remailer which silently ignores (and deletes)  all mail which is 
      not still encrypted after the remailer's decryption key is applied. 
      (Complaints from Choate that I don't show how to  distinguish 
      encrypted vs cleartext mail with 100% accuracy will be silently 
      ignored (and deleted).)

This protects the remailer operator from:

(1) having any knowledge of the ultimate destination of the mail, 
since there is a good possibility that the next email address 
is just another remailer.

(2) having any knowledge of the content of the email, since it is
still encrypted. Thus, a remailer operator in Afghanistan doesn't
knowingly pass on copies of 'The Satanic Verses'.

(3) passing on 99.9999% of spam. Spammers do not use encrypted
mail - it requires far too much per-message processing, in terms of
obtaining public keys, constructing nested encrypted messages, etc.

And yes, BU's point about not generating logs at all is well taken -
I've not looked at remailer software, but commenting out a few lines
should take care of this. If I ran one, I might consider keeping
aggregate data (# of messages/week, MB/week), but I can't see anything
useful I'd do with individual message data.

This ties into the discussion about headless, disposable remailers - many
of the discussed designs have no mass storage to speak of, so of course
they would not keep logs.
