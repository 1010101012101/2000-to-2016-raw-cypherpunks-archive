Gee, that goes without saying. Well, it should have.

If the systems you connect to don't get your IP, it's a proxy.
All of AOL is a proxy.

[checking...] You're right. It's not proxying. It's just got a fixed first frame
going through netaddress which keeps the netaddress.net URL in the URLbar. The
other frames are direct connects.

I was distracted by an Anna Kournikova commercial, okay?
