i dont see it as poetry or emotion i see it as logic but prove logic to be
lacking poetry or emotion empirically/logically

these kinds of degrading segregations or silos of thought are also
christian in my mind which in turn for me is capitalist like in an
anti-enlightenment kind of way ie logic good emotion or instinct bad

instinct is really important to understand like in the tsunami that hit
thailand remember ? Animals didnt really die en mass as they knew it was
coming so they got out of dodge as they say ... did they have a gauge that
told them to get the fuck out sure they are closer to life so they can
sense it better or they got a signal in some form .... sound probably its
really logical actually but why didnt oh so logical humans get the same
info?

ethics are not emotional by nature - really ethics are logical we may get
hints that something doesnt feel right in our gut but then i think it can
be logically laid out as to why as well : murder isnt just emotional there
are lots of factual ramifications that follow from the murder as i am
native american and basically my family was murdered by the fake USG i can
first person talk about the logical ramifications of my family not being
allowed to exist

please prove your point about `lateral thinking` which i would term
horizontality ... if it isnt effective in a given space i often have seen
that the structures that are monolithic are why so i would be interested to
see any other formulations ... as i am a problem seeker ...uuuuhhh then i
know where to work

i think we agree that ideology is not functional but i am not sure we see
the same problems to solve ... i am not sure there is a clear understanding
that life is being heavily designed by a 'few' people in power and they are
designing it for many years to come like they have plans and shit so...

somehow i dont think the plans include medicine for the sick or literacy
for everyone... lets not even discuss food and water or combating mass
murder of the planets inhabitants

heres a video about what people often section off as logic and emotional or
creative sides of the brain ... our own interfaces should be looked at as
evidence not only because of their structures information but to show our
limited scope and not just thru our form but thru the
manipulation/propaganda about our form/forms which you seem to be driving

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU

i think in order to make the machines of the future - like the ones that
will decide on their own wether to kill you or not in a battle - then this
kind of emotion/logic mis-equation will need to be worked on
