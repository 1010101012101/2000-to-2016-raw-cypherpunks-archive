Paint ball guns are too big and noticeable. Anyone
have any ideas on a high powered squirt gun in a 
small concealable package -- like maybe CO2 powered 
from the same little powerlets they use for paint
ball, feeding a tank in a fanny pack, up a flex tube
in your sleeve to a nozzle in your hand. 
   Shooting a fine stream allows easy aim correction, 
and you could even use the thing inside buildings more
easily. Make it all plastic if possible, so to evade
metal dectors. 
   Could also fill tank with DMSO and nicotene and have 
a deadly weapon. Or just a knockout weapon.
