The legal and societal significance of this technology is open to 
debate, and will be decided differently in different places, based on 
local values, economic interests and raw political power.  All I am 
asking is that the debate be informed by accurate statements of what 
this stuff can and cannot do.

As well it should. There is a big difference between "can we do it?" 
and "should we do it?"

One other point, and let me shift to upper case for this one:  THERE 
ARE NO "SOLID MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS" FOR ANY OF THIS STUFF!!!!! 
THE DIFFICULTY OF BREAKING PUBLIC KEY SYSTEMS HAS NEVER BEEN PROVEN 
MATHEMATICALLY.  It is all hypothesis and empirical argument. A lone 
mathematician working in his attic could come up with an algorithm 
that would blow some or all of the existing systems out of the water. 
Who get to cover that financial risk?

Well said.
