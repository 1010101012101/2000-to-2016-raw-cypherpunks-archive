Not acceptable. DMCA is too one-sided. It is an unjust evolutionary
dead-end.

How would this play out : Hello Clay and Hay Brick Corp, sorry to rain
on your hacienda but I've figured out a way to compromise your new
eContent system. You might as well tell us, we'll have the FBI kick your
ass if you tell anyone else. It was a lot of work and I'm really clever,
I should get paid for my efforts. Sounds like cyber-terrorist threats to
me. 

You'd better factor the likely scenarios into your backup policy.

I suppose the only bright spot is that 99.99% of the content that is
"protected" by DMCA is not worth consuming in the first place.
