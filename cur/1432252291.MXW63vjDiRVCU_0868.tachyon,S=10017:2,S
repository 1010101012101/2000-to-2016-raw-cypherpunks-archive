<PRE>
We at AdvisorTeam are horrified and saddened by the events of
September 11. All of our lives, and our sense of safety and
security, have been immeasurably changed. Our thoughts and prayers
are with the victims, their families and friends, and with all of
those people whose lives have been directly affected. We're grateful
to those who are at the site contributing to the ongoing relief and
rescue efforts.

In an effort to help, we are sending you this special newsletter.
In it, we provide information about ways you can show support, as
well as some suggestions for understanding and coping with symptoms
of stress and anxiety.

During the days and weeks to come, it is to be expected that many
of us may experience unpleasant symptoms, including those listed
below. These vary with each individual and tend to diminish
gradually as time passes. 

We believe that temperament theory is a useful source of
understanding about the human condition and contains some wisdom
that can help us deal with extreme situations.

As you try to understand your reactions, as well as those of your
loved ones, friends and others with whom you come in contact, keep
in mind that we all have certain core needs. We usually speak of
Artisans, Guardians, Idealists, and Rationals as if they were "four
kinds of people." In reality, the temperaments are clusters of
traits and needs that represent four patterns of the human
experience, each of which comes to play in every one of us. It's
important to remember that we're all affected by these patterns,
particularly when we are jolted out of our usual routines. 

Our feelings of well-being are affected when we experience
temporary restrictions on our freedoms; disruption of the order and
structure that we take for granted in our daily lives; a shock that
may have brought up questions of "meaning"; and a loss of our sense
of control.

You and the people around you may experience some of the following
symptoms, which may or may not be connected to your conscious
thoughts, opinions, or feelings about the events. At a very basic
level, they are how we respond to disequilibrium - manifestations
of the "flight or fight response."

 - Increased or decreased need for food, sex, and/or sleep 
 - Social withdrawal or increased need for social contact
 - Irritability or anger
 - Being easily startled
 - Restlessness
 - Mood swings
 - Difficulty concentrating, "spacey-ness"
 - Preoccupation with troubling thoughts, images, or nightmares
 - Feelings of fear or hopelessness, or of personal responsibility 
 - Shock or denial
 - Grieving 

Here are some things you can do to manage your anxiety:

 1. Be aware that you and people around you may be affected.
 2. If your symptoms are severe, speaking with a counselor or
    clergy member may help.
 3. Be patient with yourself and with other people.
 4. Acts of kindness can make a world of difference, not just to
    those to whom they are directed, but also to those who perform
    them.
