Of course!  How could I have been so blind?

Tar is good for your lungs.  In support of this, the FDA will release a
Minimum Daily Requirements update listing tar as an essential nutrient -
with the caveat that it must be breathed in rather than swallowed - any
day now.  Those pictures of black lungs are nothing to be worried about
- black lungs are more efficient, and the tar coating helps shield lungs
from harmful substances like oxygen.

Nicotine is good for you.  All the proof needed is that it calms down
hypertensive type-A personalities.

The dozens of carcinogenic compounds formed by combustion of plant
matter aren't really there.  A lab mixup resulted in the
misidentification of the compounds produced by burning cigarettes.  The
compounds are really vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E, calcium, "soy
protein," and zinc.
