I'm right here. But you have missed something very important: "Bear" did 
not write that article for the _Cypherpunks_ list. It was one of many 
articles cross-posted between the _Cryptography_ list and the 
_Cypherpunks_ list and even some of Hettinga's many lists.

Here are the headers:

Bear left the Cypherpunks list a long while ago, citing fundamental 
disagreements.

"Cryptography" was formed as a putatively apolitical list. Apparently 
this is no longer so, and its politics are at odds with the main themes 
on our list. (I believe this partly comes about precisely _because_ it 
supposedly has no political compass heading.)

I have strong views on all this DRM and TCPA stuff, and especially on 
the claim that some form of DRM is needed to prevent government from 
taking over control of the "arts."

But we said everything that needed to be said _years_ ago. No point in 
repeating the same points.
