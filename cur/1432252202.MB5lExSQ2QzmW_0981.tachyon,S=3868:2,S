Bear in mind that most spying is not done by TLAs but by
commerce, contractors, orgs, edus, religions, hackers,
entreprenuers, comsec peddlers, criminals and venal
individuals. Against these lightly- or un-regulated swarming,
ubiquitous data harvesters encryption and anonymization
is essential. Not least because they sell data to the TLAs
without the pretense of regulation aimed at limiting official
spying which serves as a diverting cloak for the other
kinds who join the far greater crowd fingerpointing away
from themselves.

One of the greatest online deceptions are privacy policies,
along with nefarious log files and other management tools,
tricks, traps, con-jobs, built into every digital enterprise,
defended as necessary for sysadmining and protecting
the democracy, the internet, the people. Far worse duplicity
than official propaganda which, no surprise, copies the
unofficial practices as advised by self-serving advisory
boards and consultants from com, org, edu, religion,
individual, criminals, the lot.

Best way to spot a duplicity expert is to gander a
cryptographer or a proponent of ubiquitous encryption
anonymization and privacy. These stalwarts work
both sides for MITM rewards.

Which is why these lists are predominately popluated
by leeches with a few newbies looking for mentors.

This has always been the case, not new with digital
intercourse
