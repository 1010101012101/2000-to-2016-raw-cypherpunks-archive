Don't know if you are the right contact but I am still having a problem =
with the GAY newsletter.  Had rec'd it for months, than it stopped after =
making some purchases! I contacted you, and started to receive them =
again, only to have it stopped again?

if you are NOT the correct contact, please advise, if you know, where I =
would send an e-mail.

Thanks
