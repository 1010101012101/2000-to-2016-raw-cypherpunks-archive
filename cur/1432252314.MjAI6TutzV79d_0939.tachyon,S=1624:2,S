"On Sunday, the Washington Post wrote the obituary for the United States'
effort to find Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction.
"Frustrated, U.S. Arms Team to Leave Iraq," read the headline, confirming

the invasion and occupation of oil-rich Iraq was in fact one of history's
great frauds."
