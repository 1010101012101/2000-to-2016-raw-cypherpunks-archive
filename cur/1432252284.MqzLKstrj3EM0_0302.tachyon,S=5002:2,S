No, they demonstrate that Black Unicorn drops the 'intent' requirement in
his cites when he find it convenient.

No, as far as I'm aware there is nothing that prevents the operator of a
system from munging the packets that hit his NIC as they see fit.

Not without a significant change in the laws for 'common carrier'.

No, they can't even be compelled to continue operation of the remailer.
Though it could be 'confiscated' and operated by the LEA's and courts.

All the cite's require 'intent' in one definition or another to be
specific toward obfuscating the future case. You know you fucked up, now
hide it fast before anybody finds out about it. Oops, didn't hide it fast
enough.
