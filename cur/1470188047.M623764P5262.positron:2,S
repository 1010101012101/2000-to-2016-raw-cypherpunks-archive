PHILADELPHIA =E2=80=93 The National Security Agency (NSA) has =E2=80=9Call=
=E2=80=9D of Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s deleted emails and the FBI could gai=
n access to them if they so desired, William Binney, a former highly placed=
 NSA official, declared in a radio interview broadcast on Sunday.
Speaking as an analyst, Binney raised the possibility that the hack of the =
Democratic National Committee=E2=80=99s server was done not by Russia but b=
y a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker concerned about Clinton=E2=80=99s =
compromise of national security secrets via her personal email use.
Binney was an architect of the NSA=E2=80=99s surveillance program. He becam=
e a famed whistleblower when he resigned on October 31, 2001, after spendin=
g more than 30 years with the agency.
He was speaking on this reporter=E2=80=99s Sunday radio program, =E2=80=9CA=
aron Klein Investigative Radio,=E2=80=9D broadcast on New York=E2=80=99s AM=
 970 The Answer and Philadelphia=E2=80=99s NewsTalk 990 AM.

e of the FBI=E2=80=99s ability to access various secretive databases =E2=80=
=9Cto track down known and suspected terrorists.=E2=80=9D
Stated Binney: =E2=80=9CNow what he (Mueller) is talking about is going int=
o the NSA database, which is shown of course in the (Edward) Snowden materi=
al released, which shows a direct access into the NSA database by the FBI a=
nd the CIA. Which there is no oversight of by the way. So that means that N=
SA and a number of agencies in the U.S. government also have those emails.=
