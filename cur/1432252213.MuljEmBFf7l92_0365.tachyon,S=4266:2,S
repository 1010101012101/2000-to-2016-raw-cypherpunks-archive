I'm not on Chomsky's board.

You've yet to make a coherent argument that will stand on its own, I'm
telling you a third time now:  I am not a Chomsky hater, nor am I a Chomsky
admirer; his is a name I've heard on this list, but I've not investigated
him.  I've engaged only in a campaign to verify what you've said, I've not
attempted to defend him against your accusations.

As yet, you've not presented compelling, irrefutable evidence.  After what
I've seen the past couple days, Occam's Razor tells me it is because such 
evidence does not exist, but I'm giving you one last chance to convince me.

Give me a valid, pre-79 quote, give me a valid, conflicting, post-79 quote,
and tell me what is damning about the two quotes, if you can.

The clock is ticking.

Reese
