Indeed the 5th is up to you to decide ---after all, only you know what
you've done.  You can only be forced to talk to a GJ if given immunity for
anything you say,
by arrangement beforehand; I think this came up during Monicagate.  JY
or DM could easily take the 5th if they so chose.  

How would anyone (including themselves or their council) prove to them that
any answer associating them with JB would not be incriminating in the next
wave?










An interesting twist against compelled key disclosure is making your
passphrase
something incriminating.
