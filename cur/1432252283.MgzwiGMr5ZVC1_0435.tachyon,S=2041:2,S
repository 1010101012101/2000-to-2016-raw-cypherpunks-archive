This is  a nightmare scenario for
the Vatican. There is no legal route to remove a
living Pope, and there are certain documents required
for the running of the Church which can be
signed *only* by the pontiff.

A vegetable Pope would basicly lock up the
mechanisms of the Church.

I have no doubt that a lot of Canon Law lawyers
are trying to find a loophole at the moment. JP2
is clearly circling the drain.
