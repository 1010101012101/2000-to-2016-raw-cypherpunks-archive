Attacks on computer freedom will just keep escalating, Doctorow contends. The copyright wars, net neutrality, and SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) were early samples of what is to come. Victories for freedom in those battles were temporary. Conflict in the decades ahead will feature ever higher stakes, more convoluted issues, and far more powerful technology. The debate is about how civilization decides to conduct itself---and in whose interests.

bCory Doctorow is one of the great context-setters of our generation,b says Tim ObReilly. Co-editor of the acclaimed blog bBoing Boing,b Doctorow writes contemporary science fiction blending contextual insight with journalistic depth.  His recent books include For the Win; Makers; and Little Brother.

"The Coming Century of War Against Your Computer," Cory Doctorow, Novellus Theater, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, 7pm, Tuesday, July 31.  The show starts promptly at 7:30pm.
