Well maybe.  What if a US ISP is incorporated with all foreign residents 
and no local employees (only trusted local contractors).  No one to serve 
legal notice upon.  ISP is housed in a standalone building which is owned 
outright (no landlord to serve).  Site is monitored 24/7 via Internet and 
satellite links with remote controlled self-destruct devices (which to be 
effective must be capable of destroying the entire building).
