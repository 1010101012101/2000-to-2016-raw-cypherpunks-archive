During your "rant" on re-mailers I mentioned the desirability of using 
popular P2P services in conjunction with remailers, possibly as middleman 
nodes.  Len pointed out the problems with re-mailer system stability if P2P 
clients were used as they come and go.  During the break there was a short 
discussion of using the P2P clients to generate cover traffic on 
remailers.  This should be simple and involve no risk to those running the 
clients.
