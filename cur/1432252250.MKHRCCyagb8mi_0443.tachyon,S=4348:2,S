On the web pages I quoted in the posting you are replying to:

http://www.uu.se/Adresser/Directory/HS.html#HS (Economic History)
http://www.uu.se/Adresser/Directory/deps/HH8.html (History)

we have references to  Prof Ragnhild Lundstrvm, who I assume from the
name is a woman. But, as I said, their are dozens of references to
other  female academics there who, to the Americans on the list) would
count as "professors". Heck, in France, schoolteachers can be called
Prof.

Not that it matters because I doubt if anyone seriously thinks that that
spoof has been anywhere near either Uppsala or Zimbabwe. It is still
funny though.
