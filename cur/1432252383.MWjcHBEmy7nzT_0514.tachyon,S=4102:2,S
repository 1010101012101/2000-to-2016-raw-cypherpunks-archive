Here's an interesting tool which might make things a little easier...it also
ought to be useful for seperating authentic posts from forgeries, as well.


N-Gram Analysis Tool v1.5

What are N-Grams?

N-Gram Analysis is a a method patented by the NSA to compare the semantic of
two texts or audio or video data files. The algorithm is pretty simple, all you
have to do, is take a sliding window of length N and move it over the text, and
remember, how often which text-fragment of length N occured in the text. 
This implementation of the N-Gram Method is a pretty simple ANSI-C-Program, I
wrote to distract me from my end-of-semester exams. It would be nice, if you
send me patches, comments or so to rhoehndo@imn.htwk-leipzig.de. I will do some
more to this code as soon as I finished my exams.
