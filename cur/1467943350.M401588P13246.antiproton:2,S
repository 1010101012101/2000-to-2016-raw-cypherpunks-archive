Trump is going to lose by a landslide. The American press are pretending
it's not a shutout because otherwise they'd have nothing to report and
people would accuse them of being biased. They are, and people accuse them
of it anyway, but Trump is so unpopular that it appears inconceivable that
he could have been nominated by a mainstream party, but the only reason
he's even on the stage is that the Republican party is in the process of
self-destruction. This is unprecedented in living memory, and certainly
since the existence of television or radio and the 24 hour news cycle, so
few people realize that this is what it looks like.

Go read up on the election of 1872. The roles of the parties were basically
reversed, with the Democrats being the dying party of the angry white man,
throwing their support to the nominee of the Liberal Republicans because
they hated Grant so much. Grant himself was surrounded by scandal but still
managed to get the Republican nomination uncontested and then win by a
landslide. I imagine he was more popular than Clinton, but then again
Greeley was undoubtedly far more popular than Trump. As were the two guys
who split the electoral vote after he died.
