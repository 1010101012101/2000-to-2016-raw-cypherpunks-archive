The Oil and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing fie|d that was discovered and drilled 
by major oi| companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantial recoverab|e 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mi|lion barre|s of oil and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbo| - EOGI
Price   - .075

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi||ions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new techno|ogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|ar|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company
with a comparably smal| market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But all that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oi| and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay f|at, or 
decline
slight|y, you wil| sti|| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wil|
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area will rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
