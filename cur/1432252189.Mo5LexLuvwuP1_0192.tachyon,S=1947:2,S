A government report that urges the U.S. Postal Service to create "smart 
stamps" to track the identity of people who send mail is eliciting concern 
from privacy advocates.

The report, released last month by the President's Commission on the U.S. 
Postal Service, issued numerous recommendations... One is that the USPS 
"aggressively pursue" the development of a so-called intelligent mail 
system... [that] would involve using barcodes or special stamps, 
identifying, at a minimum, the sender, the destination and the class of mail

...The report proposes a broad expansion of the concept to all mail for 
national security purposes. It also suggests USPS work with the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security to develop the system...
