Of course they have logs at each instutution; the point is what
is available. If it's a private money mix cascade over some 10
accounts in different jurisdictions, you'd have to query a large
fraction of them for their records (and obtain them, of course)
in order to do your traffic analysis. Perhaps not that easy for
a case of petty money laundering (the Medellin cartel would
probably do something a little more professional here).

(Disclaimer. Dear potential eavesdropper: this is a mere hypothetical, I've
never done it, nor do I intend to ever do it, or at least I wouldn't
post it to the whole wide Internet just in case I wanted to).
