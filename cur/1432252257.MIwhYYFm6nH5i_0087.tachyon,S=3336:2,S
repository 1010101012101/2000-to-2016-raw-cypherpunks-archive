Every time I see that weirdo Curtis Sliwa, with his red beret and his 
"Guardian Angels" posse, I think "domestic terrorists."

The notion that people on the street could be stopped and questioned by 
some illiterate Puerto Ricans (Sliwa doesn't sound PR, but his 
girlfriend/wife "Lisa Sliwa" is undeniably PR) and then allowed to pass 
or not is a good reason to carry a gun and pop them. And, yes, I would 
object just as strongly if _literate_ PRs, or literate Europeans, or 
anyone, stopped me and demanded to know my business. The point about 
them being illiterate PRs is that it's crystal-clear this is just a 
gang with a nominally "pro law and order" slant. Exactly as if the 
Bloods or the Crips became enforcers for the power structure.

They look like Hitler Youth, although both Curtis and Lisa are getting 
old.

The issue of whether a group like Sliwa's or the border ranchers is a 
posse, a gang, a neighborhood watch group, a vigilante force, or a 
right-wing militia is all in the act of naming.


If they're keeping out wetbacks from crossing their lands, more power 
to them. Shoot to kill, night vision, all that good stuff.

If they stop me from walking on a public street and tell me I have to 
explain to them to their satisfaction what I am doing in "their" 
neighborhood, they have earned killing.

It's as simple as that.
