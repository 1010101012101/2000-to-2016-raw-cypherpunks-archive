Please publish their true names, that more of these narcs may be killed.

Despite my linguistic differences with you, you have done a good job in 
accelerating the liquidation of traitors. Killing the supergrasses and 
their ilk is a Good Thing.

Due it for the narcs in the hacker movement and I will be even happier. 
Only one of them has been discovered and sent to his earthly reward, 
which is not enough. I think I know the identity of one who lives in 
Emeryville, mostly, and another who lives in Santa Clara, but it's best 
to be more certain before they are whacked.
