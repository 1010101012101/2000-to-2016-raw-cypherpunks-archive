A skivvied MoD scientist from Portland Downs raced past me ogling 
Buckingham in my red plaid tam and matching sweater, whispered, 
"you ugly fuck," and sliced a sample of my nose for cloning a least 
beloved cousin, and my half-blind soused SO yelled at the one-legged 
runner "Markov, help Bear Hatted Bobby, 'e pelleted him." BHB twitched,
'is nose twitched, by God in truth, in Morse, "cow."

If you saw the fighting for seats we saw in the London Underworld
you'd nere doubt how much skin and hair is afloat, and the skinning
of the tourists with double ugly cashmere and Monty Python legends
and Beatle-mania ad nauseum aint odd it's royal history.
