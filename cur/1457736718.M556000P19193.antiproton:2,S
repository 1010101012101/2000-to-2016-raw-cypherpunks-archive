XML is a pain to write by hand, for sure.  But one shouldn't be doing
that.  There are perfectly good libraries for working with XML in almost
every programming language.  It's a bit over-engineered, but one really can
represent almost any sort of data as XML.  (Whether that's a good idea is a
whole different question.)

YAML is a lot easier to write a small file by hand, but it's kinda brittle
& easy to fuck up.  Not nearly as expressive as XML either.  Great for
small config files; imho not so great for most other things.

JSON strikes a nice balance between expressiveness and human readability.
That's probably why REST (or if you eschew buzzwords, JSON over HTTP) is so
popular these days.
