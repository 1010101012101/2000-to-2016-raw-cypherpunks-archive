Yeah, maybe.  But it's still true that the city folks get 
all high and mighty and superior until they need food or 
power, and then all of a sudden they're willing to play nice 
with the rednecks and hillbillies, drawls and all.  I think 
it's darned funny myself, and coming from an oil-producing 
area, I always have.  

I was thinking of a particular person I used to know when I 
typed that.  It's how he talks.  But to be fair, he's from 
Louisiana.
