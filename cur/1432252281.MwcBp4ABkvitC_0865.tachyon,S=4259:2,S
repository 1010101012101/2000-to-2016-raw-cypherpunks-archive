I would recommend the HAC as a reference and something else as an
introduction (my favorite is "Decrypted Secrets" by F.L. Bauer, but
there are lots of good books). Schneier is a bit of both, but not
particularly good at either. Peter Wayner wrote a book about digital
cash a couple of years ago.

Friedman's "Hidden Order" is interesting. It includes many of the
ideas from the Machinery of Freedom in a newer form, and I suppose it
is a pretty good start for learning about economics.

On the fiction side, there is Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon".
E-cash, data havens and all that...
