hmmm.  I would guess that if the list program prepended [cypherpunks]
to every subject, then peoples could still filter and organize posts
even though they arrived from random exit points. One  listop could do
this, and if it was too much of a pain people could resubscribe from a
different CDR node.  It might also provide interesting metrics for both
goodguys and badguys (dropped messages, latency, etc. could all be
measured against a subscription to a non-mixed CDR node.

What are the traffic analysis implications?
