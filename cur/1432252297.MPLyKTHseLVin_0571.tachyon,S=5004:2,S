Showing the foolishness of converting a more nuanced, vector form of 
voting records into a simplistic, scalar form. Consider some of these 
questions:

Supporters of liberty don't like "campaign disclosure" laws at all, 
let alone "online disclosure." Consider the equally onerous violation 
of the First Amendment:

"Those writing articles must disclose online anyone with whom they 
have had financial relationships over the past 5 years." A clear 
violation of the First, right? So is any limit on who I support 
financially, who I give money to, how candidates raise money, etc.

Just another special interest tax loophole. Those interested in 
liberty know that these loopholes distort the free market. The usual 
result of such "training credits" is a series of mostly-bogus "Learn 
to Operate Keypunch Machines at the Control Data Institute!!" radio 
ads for fly-by-night schools in areas very far from technology 
centers. Getting the training subsidies is what matters.

In these cases, I would argue strongly that a "No is 1."

No wonder the Dems did so well.

Again, the real problem is trying to collapse multiple issues into a 
simple-minded "technology score." At least the Nolan Chart 
understands that at least two dimensions are needed.
