opportunistic IPsec requires:
- additional latency during initial communication (sometimes excessive
waiting for timeouts)
- static public IP endpoint capable of IPsec
- keys published in DNS records
== totally unworkable for most users on the Internet.

SSH/SSL VPN's are much more suitable IMHO.  tied into a p2p style
NAT-punching configuration with simple key management (perhaps
opportunistic key exchange that can be upgraded to authenticated
exchange in person, etc) this _might_ be enough to blacken a majority
of Internet traffic.

OE via IPsec is certainly not though...

Wireless networks are a different story, and I am very much in favor
of IPsec for such networks.  The propinquity of participants can
facilitate other stronger / easier key management as well.
