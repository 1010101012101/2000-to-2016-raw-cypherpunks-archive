Locally, the police department decided to partner with PredPol
/(snigger: 'Server And Protect')/. Early one morning at Starbucks I saw
a shift captain who also did PD PR work on the phone discussing an
article that was about to appear regarding the topic in a local
newspaper. He emphatically and repeatedly said:

"DO NOT call it 'Predictive Policing'!"

He obviously didn't believe it was a correct phrase to describe "Guessing=
".

RR

Ps. The use of computers to resolve cold-cases mentioned below isn't
really relevant to the topic of computers allegedly predicting future
crime. ALso, I suspect predictive software will simply create better
opportunities for more convincing false flag operations by people
affiliated with (but perhaps not directly connected to) police agencies.

I'd extrapolate on those operations (at least ones noted locally) but
[off-topic], so I decline.
