"earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul"


Your sig: "earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul" (EWAFMSS)
pretty well covers the area of operations needing ubiquitous comsec
against ubuiquitous spying of EWAFMSS.

Certainly there will be violations and spying by those who design,
run and abuse the systems of EWAFMSS.

Especially those who are excused from accountability to "maintain
the systems, or debug" EWAFMSS.

More narrowly, system operators, network operators, maintenance
staff, repariers, holders of keys to and lockpicks of the systems, ie, the
Snowdens, the spies, the governors, will usurp control and unilaterally
or collectively decide they know what is best for the systems' users,
and that inevitably coincides with self-interest of the system operators
of EWAFMSS.

Given that inevitability of self-interest, cloaked in high-minded rationales
of public service, or national security, what inevitably must be done to
reign in the inevitable abusers of privilege, public service, national
security, ie EWAFMSS.

A range of options: assassination, revolution, counterspying, treason,
war, founding of new faiths, schemes and con jobs in EWAFMSS.

For comsec that could entail implantation of electroshock devices
in every system operator which punishes, or in extremity, kills, for
misbehavior programmed into the widgets. Hack a key, pick a lock,
mosh RNG, open a backdoor, break a vow of public service, get
singed as a warning, keep it up, get fried.

This is basicly what NSA is implanting around the globe in systems
if not witting and unwitting operators. Starting with implantation of
their own Snowdens of devices of disinformation which leads the
poor goofs to think they know the system vulns. Then the goofs
spread the disinfo to, say, the Greenwalds, Poitras's and Gellmans
who then goofily spread it to the public goofiness consumers.

Blessing this operation is the FISC judges who mightily try to
understand WTF DoJ is blowing at them to cloud what NSA is
actually doing with its systems of EWAFMSS.

Read the FISC orders to see the solons gyrate and spasm
a pretense of understanding what is intended ot be non-understandable.
NSA proceeds totally unhindered to do what it wants with abusing
EWAFMSS, condoned by FISC glossing of the abuse -- what is
done in the US is done worldwide for managing and exploiting for
self-interest EWAFMSS.

Yes, these very lists foster the appeal of exploiting the expoitation
of EWAFMSS by pretending to oppose it, to found a new scheme
of assassination, revolution, etc, etc. This will inevitably lead to
compromisable proponents to be bribed and recruited for service
in the established exploiters: billionaires, journalists, lawyers, courts,
tech corporations, telcos, LEs, TLAs, Vaticans, Israelis, Muslims,
Tea Parties, nations, black marketers, financial crime syndicates,
freedom of information hustlers, leakers, and, most beautifully
remunerative, crypto-comsec mofos.

There's the pitch for comsec public utility, crypto-comsec mofos
signing up to be implanted with EM devices for a Tor-Greenwald-grade
lifetime of comfort bribe to loyally and patriotically run the sysems of
EWAFMSS. Then immediately break the vow, hack the devices,
cheat, lie, steal, bolthole an embassy, refuge in a rogue state,
for a while enjoy the warm feeling of triumph, then be Zapped
remotely for belief in knowing more than the Devil in the Details.
