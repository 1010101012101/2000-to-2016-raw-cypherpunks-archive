I was really interested in Plug Computers a year or two ago, and I have a 
couple development units.  For this kind of application, it seems that a 
certain range of applications, like personal servers and remote access to 
archives, is obvious (and there is an "app plug computer" for that, about 
$100).  For really solving the decentralized problem, you'd want to pair it 
with mesh communications.  I see several possibilities.  Wifi-Wifi would be 
great, but there are antenna and power issues in many cases.  
Wifi-cellphone-picocell is more interesting because cell phones already can 
make significantly more distance than typical WiFi.  This is also 
interesting if you add in resilient routing / store and forward / dynamic 
multi-modal addressing (including geo).  Ideally, you can cover any 
distance and gaps for at least some transmission, and great transmission 
when possible, by opportunistically hitching a ride on any device to any 
device proximity.

These devices (plug computers, smart phones, picocells, wifi base stations, 
bluetooth, zigbee) are inexpensive and low power enough that they could be 
just about everywhere.  Every vehicle, street light / signal, business, 
person, and even important street surfaces and similar could be wirelessed 
with an open, cooperative, protocol.  Doing it while controlling abuse and  
making use fair is the problem.

The biggest hard problem is probably preventing bombing by e-signal.  Some 
possible solutions: A) blackout in appropriate conditions (hard to prevent 
abuse of) and B) super-tracing / persistent following after the fact when a 
bad event happens and enough people vote for extreme transparency.  In 
other words, detect the explosion or whatever, people hit the panic button, 
and every possible trigger is tracked back to a likely source and those 
sources are tracked for some time using all methods.

There are a number of obvious apps for this kind of network: shotspotter (a 
la Bump) for all devices.  Person-aware (what I mentioned yesterday a la 
traffic safety to prevent hitting children and animals in congested traffic 
areas).  Emergency service / help expediting.
