Afraid this was a late follow-on to the 1987 program out of Ft. Monmouth 
(via Battelle/DARPA at USAF request).  The RFP outlined above is nearly a 
word for word copy of the one I saw in 1987 (right around the time of the 
Morris Worm).  The company I worked for at the time actually bid on it 
(and lost, thank god!).
