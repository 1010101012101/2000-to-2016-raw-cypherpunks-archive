BAH! *shudders*

All we need for this is an external cryptographic token - a smartcard with
a keypad, an USB device, a Bluetooth-enabled thingy. You plug it into the
machine, the server you connect to sends its certificate name and
challenge to the browser, which passes it unchanged to your token. The
token asks you for a PIN, and calculates a response. The browser then
transparently relays the response back. There is nothing in the unit
that's accessible from the computer, and because of a physically different
keypad nothing can be sniffed from the computer. The cost of the unit can
get as low as few dollars, can easily interface with just about any OS
including PDAs, and doesn't require The Megacorp Whose Name Shouldn't Be
Spoken to take over your machine.
