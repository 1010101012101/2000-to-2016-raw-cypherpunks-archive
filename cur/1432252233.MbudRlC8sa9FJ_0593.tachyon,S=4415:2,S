It is certain. Impossible it is to urinate without striking the yard
of the temple or the game or the building or the school of the
government. In a city in where the pigs do not have any better thing
with doing than to give outside tickets the smokers who have ends when
fucking is even no ash tray around, it astonishes the drain-heart of
some kisses would think that it is necessary. Who wishes to bet that
this asshole has its own security, uniforms in safe Irvine?

At least it gives twit the advantage of the complete quotation:

"In this time of crisis, most of us can't lift a pick and shovel to
aid the rescue effort. We can't shoulder a gun to fight the enemy,"
said Chris Mears, an Irvine attorney leading the campaign [to fly to
New York on Veterans Day to spend money there]. "We view this as an
act of economic patriotism."

> Some folks just need killin' 

Yes.
