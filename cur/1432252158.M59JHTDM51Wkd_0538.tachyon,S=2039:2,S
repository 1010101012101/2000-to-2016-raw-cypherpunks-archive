I'm thinking about high-latency (suitable for nonrealtime things
like leaking and email/messaging) anonymity-enhanced versions of Tor.
Delays from hours to days are tolerable here, provided the result
is reliable. 

It would obviously have to be run as a private Tor network, though
perhaps with gateways to Tor and other networks. A fraction
of total nodes should be unlisted bridge relays. It would probably
profit from a botnet-like approach, especially if global scrutiny
increases. It should default to a much larger number of hops, 
introduce random delays and chaffing. Each node should come with 
a hidden service to Tahoe-LAFS or similar. A version should come 
as a convenient and containable virtual appliance, or packaged as 
plug computers.

Comments, other suggestions?
