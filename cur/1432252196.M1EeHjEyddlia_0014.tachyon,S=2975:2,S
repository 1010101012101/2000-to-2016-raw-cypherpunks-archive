1. Simply done by hacking a few lines of legal code when you sign your
subscriber agreement
(eg to a cable service)

2. In a poodle-run society you can consider paying the BBC tax as
consenting to an agreement

3. Other oppressive societies may consider the RF spectrum as State
property and simply use
their threat of violence to force contracts on passive interceptors of
signals.  (And woe to the
'trespassers' who would actually transmit..)
