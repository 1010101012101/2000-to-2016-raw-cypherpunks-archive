Hi,

I've just returned from Burma in the last month.

There is total surveillance in Burma on the commercial YTP ISP. They
censor plenty of sites and their BlueCoat proxy devices fail to deliver
content for unblocked sites often. The other networks seem rather under
surveillance as well and they also have censorship.

We (OONI) have data from my trip there and it includes all of the major
networks. We'll write it up and publish all of it soon.

I haven't seen FidoNet but I did see lots of WiMax, VSAT, GSM/CDMA and
even some discussion of X.25, etc.

Ethiopia has extremely sophisticated censorship:

The serious problem is the infrastructure even if today it is only used
on a few sites.

All the best,
Jake
