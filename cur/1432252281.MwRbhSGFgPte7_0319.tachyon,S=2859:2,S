Lead is only useful for radiation shielding, ungrounded lead with unshielded
windows and power wiring with no frequency filters leading outside is a not
particularly good Faraday cage. Lead base paint doesn't even contain metallic
lead, but lead oxides in a small proportion.

If you have to also shield against magnetic fields, then
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu-metal & Co are your friends.
