Not at all, the question is what YOU believe. Not what I believe.

Unless you're willing to concede my point now?

I didn't think so. Now, you wanna keep dancin'?

Where in the Constitution is the term 'natural rights' used? The
Declaration of Independence talks of natural rights, and it's not
recognized as a basis for any law. There are two places in the
Constitution that describe how laws will be predicated.

I'm not the one who starting quibling over what 'civil law' meant. You're
the one who brought up the distinction.

My question, and point, still stand.

EXACTLY my point, thank you for recognising it so openly. Now go read the
Constitution about law, and courts. Who in this country is the ONLY two
groups that can make law? One is the states through constitutional
amendments. There's one other and it ain't a court.
