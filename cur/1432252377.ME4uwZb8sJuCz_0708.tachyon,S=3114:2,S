You're missing the diversity of adversaries that various Tor users might
care about.

For example, imagine you're using Tor to prevent a local observer (e.g.
your government-owned ISP) from discovering that you're going to Skype's
payment page.

More generally, there are people who use Tor to ssh to a server somewhere
-- they really do want to make sure the ssh server is the one they wanted,
and the ssh server really does want to make sure it's them, but they
worry about network-level observers on both sides of the transaction.

Yet another variation is where you don't mind that Skype knows *who*
you are, but you don't want them to know which country you're in today.
