Like Nathan Saper, you are now altering the thrust of your arguments. 
You wrote at length about ECL and SOS and gate arrays and all that 
crap, and I said they wouldn't make a hill of beans difference for an 
exptime problem.

("Well, what if you put a _lot_ of them together?" is the refrain I 
expect now.)

And I'm _quite_ aware of factoring algorithms and their importance! 
Several times I mentioned "absent factoring breakthroughs" and 
suchlike and I even went on to quote material on the best known 
factoring methods.

Could a factoring breakthrough happen to convert this exptime problem 
to polynomial time? Maybe. I said as much. Is it likely? See 
discussions on progress toward proving factoring to be NP-hard (it 
hasn't been proved to be such, though it is suspected to be so, i.e., 
that there will never be "easy" methods of factoring arbitrary large 
numbers).

You don't appear to be familiar with the literature. I suggest you do 
some reading.

(BTW, one of the most important brute force breaks of RSA was done 
for the so-called Blacknet key. Cf. Leyland et. al. Irony abounds.)

I made no claims that this was a proof of the unbreakability of RSA. 
I cited the work factors. The burden of proof is on you and on Nathan 
for your claims that such ciphers are in fact being broken by the 
NSA...you even claimed "near realtime," citing NSA VLSI capabilities. 
_This_ is the point being rebutted by me, not some "spouting" of a 
claim that RSA has been "proved" to be "unbreakable."

They laughed at Ludwig Plutonium, they laughed at Detweiler. And now 
they laugh at Kerry Bonin.

"These are merely postulates," said the stuffed shirt.

What happened to "near realtime" and "cracking farms"?

Repeat after me: polynomial improvements are of no use for solving 
exptime problems where the keylength can be increased trivially. 
Putting things into silicon is just a polynomial improvement...maybe 
a factor of 100, maybe even 100,000. Uninteresting.

A lie, actually. I stated quite clearly that there may be factoring 
breakthroughs. I included an entire paragraph on this, and how big 
the breakthrough--either algorithmic or via a quantum computer, a la 
Shor's algorithm--would have to be to make a difference.

Once again, it was _you_ who spoke of "near realtime" and "cracking farms."

So, these folks think RSA-2048 is being cracked in near realtime?

Or even that the lowly 3DES is being cracked in near realtime? (It 
may be, for a few very, very, very high priority messages...but I 
doubt even this. The MIPS-years are enormous, and the peak compute 
capacity is unlikely to be available to handle a message in seconds 
to minutes, which is what I would call "near realtime.")

This is a more debatable point. I think there's ample evidence that 
the non-NSA expertise in cutting-edge ciphers has exceeded the NSA 
expertise for the past decade or so. For every Brian Snow the NSA 
has, the universities have their share of Shafi Goldwassers and Adi 
Shamirs and Neal Koblitzs and David Wagners.

The days when NSA was the main source of funding for math guys like 
Berlekamp and number theorists and algebraists are over. Hundreds of 
universities, dozens of crypto companies, massive competition.

And for things like factoring, it is _unlikely_ that some GS-14 at 
the Fort has proved that P = NP or has proved that factoring is not 
hard.

You may claim that this is "just an assumption" and that your spook 
buddies have told you "off the record" that they can factor 700-digit 
numbers in "near realtime."

Whatever.
