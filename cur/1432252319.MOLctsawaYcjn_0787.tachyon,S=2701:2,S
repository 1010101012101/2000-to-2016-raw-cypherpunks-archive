Holy Crap! Am I on crack? I think I agree with everything here!

However...

That's basically why Kerry lost. He didn't seem to challenge anything Bush 
did, only the way he carried things out. That means the republicans 
successfully caused any debate to happen on their terms. Kerry's willingness 
to kowtow to the idea of a benevolent invasion of Iraq just made him seem 
like a scumbag to me, no matter what he actually believed.

However, there are some things that Bush did that, symbolically at least, he 
should have been drummed out for. The fact that he won and with large voter 
turnout is more or less a vindication of his crimes. It means that Bush 
won't be afraid of doing even more, and then the countless mountains of 
hillbillies out there will watch his back and take the inevitable bullet or 
two for him.

Well, every people deserve the government they get, and these hillbillies 
are no exception. Bush will dominate them, take away their rights, make them 
poor and scared, and they'll deserve every bit of it. (Where's a Tim May 
rant when you need one?)
