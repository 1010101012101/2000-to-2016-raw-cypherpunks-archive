There's a definition of government that one of my friends
routinely quotes to me.  I don't recall the original source,
but the quote goes something like this:

"A government is a group which holds a monopoly on violence,
particularly violence which results in fatality, over a
given geographic area."

It's terribly simplistic, but these days, accurate and
appropriate none the less.
