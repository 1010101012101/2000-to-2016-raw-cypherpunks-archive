I don't need the list. Goddamn heise has more cypherpunk content than the
list. Tim May's tired trolls have more cypherpunk content than the list.

I'm trying to keep it going by keeping a steady trickle of relevant info but
I'm honestly wondering if it's worth the effort.

If you think I'm going to add editing effort, thus cutting some 10 minutes out
of
my already busy day you're out of your fucking mind.

If you want high quality content, post it yourself.
