Adam, 

I believe you. I can't see ZKS supporting CALEA/RIP/etc

But ZKS appears to be all in favor of "data protection" legislation
(EU data directive, Canadian legislation) that regulates business'
privacy practices. This makes sense: It's apparently Austin's personal
view, and the more data collection regulations companies must abide
by, the more incentive they have to buy your product.

You've placed yourself in the unusual position of directly benefiting
from additional government regulations. I would expect that your
lobbyists will step up their efforts in ths area (one lawyer who does
work for you here in DC is a vocal supporter of such private-sector
regulation).
