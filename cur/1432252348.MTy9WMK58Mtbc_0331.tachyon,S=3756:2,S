Yes, the 16,000 declassified Chile/Allende overthrow docs 
are available:

   http://foia.state.gov

>From files of the State Dept, CIA, FBI, National Security
Council, NARA, DIA, NSA, et al. A bounty of patriotic 
gore and defense/intel pork thanks to Dr. Strangelove 
and Dickster.

And a new report on remaking the NRO to accelerate
sat-spying technology development and at the same time
lay on fat new layers of secrecy:

  http://www.nrocommission.com/toc.htm

The commission was co-chaired by Official Secrets Porter 
Goss and hero Bob Kerrey.

The report says openness is threatening US survival.

Which mirrors SecDef Cohen's warning that technology
is empowering citizens, business and allies to challenge
USG supremacy.

There has never been a better time for ever small claques
demanding deeper government secrecy.
