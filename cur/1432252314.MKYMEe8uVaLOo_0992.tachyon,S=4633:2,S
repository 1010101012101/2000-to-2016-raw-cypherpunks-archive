Funny how these same names keep cropping up in all sorts of talks and 
road shows.

As for the "five points," I certainly don't see any representation 
from the broad contingent (users of PGP, Napster users, punks, 
students, anarchists,...) who basically say "Fuck it, I'll do what I 
want!"

In any case, having attended several of the various crypto, Clipper, 
privacy, and net regulation panel discussions over the years, I know 
them to be a waste of time.
