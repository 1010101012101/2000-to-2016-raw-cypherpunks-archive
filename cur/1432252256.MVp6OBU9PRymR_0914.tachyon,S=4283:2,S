Hello All Freebie Lovers,

It looks like the Taliban has been kicked out of Afghanistan!!! 
Now women, children, clergy, teachers and everyone else will be
able to walk the streets (Dirt Roads) without fear of getting
cained.   I expect to have Osama in American hands, dead or
alive,  very shortly!

Even my kids love this game!!!
