You are full of shit.

I went to groups.google.com and did a search for usenet posts using the 
word "nazi" http://groups.google.com/groups?q=nazi

Every single hit among the first page of hits was an appropriate and 
relevant use of the word nazi,   Typical fragment from one of the posts

: : 	 whites are EXPECTED to support and feel simpathetic for
: : 	 what happened 400 years ago. When in reality its the best
: : 	 thing thats ever happened to the half breed monkeys that
: : 	 plauge our society.

If usenet threads tend to feature the word nazi, it is because there are 
plenty of nazis on usenet, whereas in published books the publishers screen 
them out.

Same thing for the frequent invocation of McCarthy by commies.
