Yes, however my emphesis was on the *deployment* of
the tools by "piggybacking" on other very-popular p2p-ish tools.

Not if the next versions of IE or Windows or Morpheus contains remailer
functionality
enabled by default!  That's the point.

If every copy of Windows(Chinese) came with <dissident software package 1.0>
then it would be hard to bust people for possession of the tools.  If every
copy of Windows(English) came with <remailer> enabled, it would be hard to
bust people for running a remailer.

Yes; however its also possible the author didn't want their ignorance
associated
