Yes, but which natural data sources have that signature?

Not uniformly distributed noise, unfortunately. Perhaps somebody should
put hardware entropy generators mixing white noise into multimedia steam
LSBs. People should definitely package stegano decoys into Open Source
streaming multimedia warez.

By running a simple statistical test (most packages don't even pad, so you
can vgrep for it). There is some pretty bulletproof stego out there, but
90% of it wouldn't stand a trace of scrutiny. Of course it limits the
processivity of the screening.

The point of stego is not leaking the information that you're sending
other information.
