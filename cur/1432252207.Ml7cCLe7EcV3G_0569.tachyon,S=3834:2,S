????? I'll have to disagree - it's simple and reliable. What makes this
incident stand out is how little mail gets lost. How few problems we
realy do have over a given period with the network. Usually there is little
if any question of which box has thrown a bit or gone deaf. Getting a hold
of the operator can be a chore sometime. There's not a lot of discussion
between the operators really. Now, as to dropped mail. It happens
sometimes. 3 messages from one user getting dropped sounds more like a
problem on the source end than in the CDR itself. Usually when a node
starts throwing dup'es or dropping email wholesale (we've had this problem
in the past) the hue and cry go up pretty quickly. Perhaps somebody rm'ed
some buffer, sendmail went core, whatever. The question is does it happen
again and if so what are it's characteristics compaired to this incident.

Cover your sixes.
