Yeah.  In the dim, dusty recesses of my memory I seem to recall the
Communitarian zeal with something the NWO types are calling 'The
Third Way'.  A way of involving business and government together
to create social change.  Last time I checked thats called Fascism.
But it has a fuzzy "community" flavor to it that smaks of the communist
meme.

A memetic psychologist would have a field day with it.
