Declan offers his motion to quash the feds subpoena:


http://www.mccullagh.org/subpoena/motion.032901.html

Worth reading not for the customary hoary press privilege, 
but for the protection requested to avoid what Jim Bell 
allegedly wants to use McCullagh for, and for Declan's 
affirmation that he covers the " 'cypherpunk' movement," 
gathering and archiving information for future use.

Did you write this yourself Declan or your mouthpiece
working alone without privileged sources about what you
intend for the "cypherpunk movement?" WTF movement,
by the way is being alleged and what is the evidence
being concocted? Smells like the feds are feeding
the evidentiaries all around the legal and press privileged
pigtroughs, jesus fucking christ.
