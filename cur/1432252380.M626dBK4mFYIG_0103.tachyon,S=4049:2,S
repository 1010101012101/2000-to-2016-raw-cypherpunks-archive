If the sending node doesn't know about the destination node, how does it
konw where to send the traffic (even if the sender provides the address)?
The reality is that the remailers must 'know' of each other one way or
another. Simply being part of a 'remailer network' (anonymous or not)
tends to already put one in a 'conspiratorial' situation.

Truly robust remailers MUST be located in domains that protect speech and
association with something similar to 'innocent until proven innocent'.
That's the only defence against 'conspiracy'.
