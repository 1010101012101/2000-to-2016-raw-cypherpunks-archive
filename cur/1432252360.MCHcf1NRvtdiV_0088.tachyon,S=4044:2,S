The NRO's web page "How to Contact Us" information doesn't say
         "Put a big sign on your roof and we'll call you."
but it does have pointers to CIA recruiting information.

NIMA has cut back on what pictures they'll distribute,
according to John Young, but there's still some good stuff there.
