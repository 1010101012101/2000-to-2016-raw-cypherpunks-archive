It's not silly at all: look again.  He said "becoming".  And it is.  Fast.
It's *long* past time for the inhabitants here to have taken up arms and
blown holes in a *lot* of Federal heads.

Just a few hundred dead federal goons, spread over a relatively short period
(~6 months), where the attacks were obviously coordinated, made against
officers enforcing particularly rancid unconstitutional laws (say the federal
tax code), and without discoverable perpetrators, would result in an almost
instantaneous shortage of officers available to enforce such uncontitutional
laws - the survivors would simply refuse.

Long fucking overdue.

Father, you are a great and mighty God. Help our governments to remember the
lessons of our history and to appreciate the purpose of your son Jesus. Teach
our representatives not to be so arrogant as to speak in one way, but doing
another, for surely this not the way of truth. Help us to understand that
your will is not death but life, not the darkness of hatred but the light of
friendship in Christ. In the name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
