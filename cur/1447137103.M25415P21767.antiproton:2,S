Doesn't apply to govt sysops. Notice how the rhetoric is
also not directed at businesses internally (they're partners),
only to what end users are using.

No, they're protected crony class.

As are telcos, and GSM is moot, they have the voice anyway.

Yes, because they have free time to think,
beyond work (taxes) and TV (programming).

Ever hear of book burning? Censorship? Murder? Theft? Etc?
It's really popular with out of control govt and corp entities.

The people are not their real targets, only pawns, thus they don't care
to read their stuff. They're also often not really enemies of each other.

True, but it's not going to fly as an argument, because
the govt will just tell you that's not your role, *they* will
protect you from everything, now to go back to your TV.

There's an invite-only cabal of
oligarchic dynastic old cronies in place in governments
and mega corporations. Yes, the occaisional motivated
group of attackers "terrists" can cause them and the
populace temporary / containable harm (911 was a joke,
the US should have just rebuilt the buildings identically
as a "fuck you" and moved on, but instead its govt...).
Anyway, what they really fear is that the populace as a
whole will wake up and rise up against their needless
structure, excess, and quiet enslavement. The real reason
they want to spy is to see, regarding them, what you're
thinking and up to, so they can head you off and remain
in power. This is exactly what all governments in history
have done, and the end is showing no signs of being
any different. Just more and more power, all to them,
none for you, until... invasion or revolt.
Pretty sad eh?
