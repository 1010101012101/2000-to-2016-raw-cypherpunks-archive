Not at all.  All that would be required is traffic duplication from less 
than a dozen (less than half a dozen at that time) backbones.  Easily 
doable technically, and from their bugetary perspective.

I think at least one of us is misremembering :-)

This is a processing issue, not a collection issue.  Collection of 100% of 
the internet traffic is easily achieved, and we should all assume that it 
has in fact *been* achieved for close to a decade now.  Processing that 
collection was the big issue, and likely still is - although, great 
advances have been made in automated language recognition. Anyone who 
doubts that should forget about Dragon, and just go look at a new cell 
phone: I have ~600 entries in my address book, and although the phone has 
no ability to refine it's interpretations based upon prior 
failures/sucesses, it still gets my verbal dial requests correct roughly 
85% of the time.  Heuristic systems should be doing some *fabulous* 
automated processing at this stage of the game.

Exactly.  One other thing we've learned is that George Orwell's 
DoubleSpeak has finally arrived with Obama!  "Yes, we can!" was his 
rallying cry: Yes, we CAN throw fiscally irresponsible scumbags who caused 
the financial melt down in prison!  Yes we CAN help out Main Street before 
Wall street!  Yes we CAN end all of these insane wars (the fact that that 
these wars are ALL illegal doesn't faze him in the least).

Well, prosecution meant giving TARP loans and other financial bailouts; 
Main Street is being hit with horrific cutbacks across the boards, as well 
as the virtual dismantling of Medicare and Medicaid; Wall Street *STILL* 
runs the show! Tim Geither is one of the main Wall Streeters who *CAUSED* 
the meltdown, yet he's been put in charge of running the economy in 
recognition of his "fine" and "outstanding" work creating this mess in the 
first place!  Obama has added several new wars [now illegal under the War 
Powers Act.  Yes, we can!... Can war and whore our way across the planet!

Oh, did anyone notice that "Mr. Transparency" has been prosecuting 
"whistleblowers" at a rate that makes GWB look like a lefty! 

I really would really have preferred the expected rapture ;-)
