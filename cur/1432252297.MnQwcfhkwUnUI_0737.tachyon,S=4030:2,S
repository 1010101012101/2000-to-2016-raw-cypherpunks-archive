Sampo, somewhere in the world today, there is a child starving to
death.  I have no doubt that you could have done something to
prevent it.  However, having chosen to spend your time reading and
writing to the cypherpunks mailing list instead, you failed to do
so.  Hence, I think it only fair that you be arrested and charged
with murder for having failed to save that starving child.  Since
you are so brave and caring, I know you'll have the decency to run
down to the nearest police station and turn yourself in.  Thanks.

(On second thought, considering the thousands of people around
the world who've starved to death over the years in the face of
your inaction, I think it safe to say that you are actually a
mass murderer many times over.  I think you'd better turn yourself
into the World Court for Crimes Against Humanity.)
