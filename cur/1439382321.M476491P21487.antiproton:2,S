You should hold yourself accountable for your inflammatory and divisive 
"actions and mindsets" as well.

Generally I ignore your posts and stay out of your misdirected, hot air 
bleat-fests.  But I'm really tired of dealing with this type of 
self-aggrandizing, rude vitriol that detracts from an otherwise valid 
point, thereby alienating even your best allies.  Like the so-called "black 
lives matter" attention-whores who completely disrupted a Bernie Sanders 
rally in my city this weekend.  It makes no damn sense to alienate the 
people most aligned with their cause and then spew racist language (as you 
do, as well), thereby harming any cause unfortunate enough to have itself 
associated with such behavior.

There is righteous anger tempered by wisdom, e.g. Dr Cornell West.  He 
doesn't mince words and he absolutely holds people accountable while 
understanding that allies come in all colors and from various walks of 
life.  Anger is valid: being intentionally racist and rude is not.

/rant on OT bullshit.
