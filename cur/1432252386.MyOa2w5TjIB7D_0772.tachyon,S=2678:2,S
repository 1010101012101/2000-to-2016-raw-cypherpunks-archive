But Saddam's regime itself stemmed from illegal takeover of a previous 
regime -- doesn't that make all of his regime illegitimate and his 
authority void?

The only reason Saddam has a plausible claim to authority is because he 
has taken gotten it by force. By the same reasoning, US or US-installed 
regime, which is being put into power by the use of force, has a 
plausible claim to authority as well.
