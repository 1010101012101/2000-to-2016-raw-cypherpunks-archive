The Web is the best place to search. Using Google, I just turned up 
more than 1200 hits in a few seconds. A main site is: 
http://www.mitsubishi.com/ghp_japan/misty/200misty.htm

As for its strength, this, too, is available from analyses on the Web 
and from the Crypto Conference Proceedings.

As for the jokes, you need to read the context. Some guy, or bot, 
would appear on the list and pretent to be asking questions in broken 
English. A la "What am Misty?"

Then he offered to sell access to the source code. Then he asked 
"What am Misty?"

He never responded as a person, not even getting upset at the 
derision directed his way. He gave no indication that he was even 
receiving mail.

I would have thought this was all clear from reading a handful of the 
"light-hearted" posts you spoke of.
