First, you depend more than you think on government actions for
essentials even though they have private brand labels.

Second, why do you think that when someone is a government employee they
are automatically inferior to everyone in the private sector? That's
irrational.

I've talked with several friends about pooling efforts and creating a
small private school. It ain't easy. It is something I would like to do.

The financial reform part is probably hopeless in the short term. Once
the hooks are into the green they don't like to let go.

What the fuck do I care how the services are provided? Show me the
services and I'll rate them myself without the benefit of your
ideological prerating system. That's what rational means. I do resent
the financial handcuffs.

Big challenge, most people don't know diddly squat. 

It may be just as difficult to find or create alternative schools that
are affordable ( even with financial reforms ) and provide a good
education as it is to improve what we have. Out of the frying pan and
into the fire. And not everyone has the ability to home-school for
various reasons. All I said was that I don't think the solution to the
problem is as simple as throwing it all away.

Do a better job of education than ...?

As for the religious bit, they're easily as dangerous as governments.

I usually get the new car before I get rid of the old one. All I said is
that before you dismantle what you don't like start building the
replacement, get a few prototypes to the working stage.

You live in a community. Been to a third world country? I don't really
want to see that here. In some ways we have progressed in that direction
over the past few decades...

One thing I disliked about CA's recent attempt at the voucher system is
that it would let some people take out more than they put in. It was
still a socialist program. Funny that, coming from a generally
right-wing angle. In addition there are very limited choices for private
schools where I live. The voucher proposal SMBTAHS.
