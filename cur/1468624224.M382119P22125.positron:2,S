I think I already did that?

Looking at the motives and means of people who have opportunities is
usually very relevant in determining who did what and why.  Of course,
that might be inconvenient for anyone who comes in with a preconceived
notion that explains it all.

What I see here is an assumption that the TOR Project itself, or some
element thereof, would be the actor behind any effort to kick Our Mr.
Applebaum out of the project and "activist" communities in general,
via a reputation attack.  I would not rule that out, but I would
include the whole alphabet soup of TLAs on the list of potential
suspects.

The TOR Drama includes multilateral conflict of interest between the
State Department (funding TOR as a vector for transmitting State
propaganda to foreign audiences), CIA (a love/hate relationship with
TOR; helps some missions, hinders others), the FBI (we hates all nasty
TORses, hates them we does), and God knows who else.

If the TOR Project ever manages to well and truly piss the State
Department off that would mean Big Trouble: Including maybe a huge
shake-up like we are seeing now?  Just closing it down by pulling the
funding would probably not be an option, as that would massively
complicate lots of political warfare projects in progress against
"regimes" targeted for disposal.  The incoming President wouldn't like
that, and we know what happens to people who do things she doesn't like.

Now yer just being silly.  A project like taking Applebaum down could
be paid for out of petty cash and/or by raiding the office coffee fund.
