Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
fu||-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment wi|l be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
milli0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wi|| supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annua|ly for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
electric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mil|i0n for a
project this size.

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimulate the
deve|opment of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Po|and through the construction
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
re|evant policies, strategies and plans. To fu|fil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
