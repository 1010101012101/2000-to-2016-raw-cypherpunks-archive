I am not going to analyze adverts from your site - if you have to say something
say it here - as I tried to explain in simple terms, spamming with canned stuff
is not the point of a discussion.

Or is it too expensive for you in cognitive terms to come up with arguments
yourself ?

Your perception is impaired. I never mentioned the author.

*You* qualified author as "Cato's". Another granfallooning. I simply pointed
that out and re-qualified what you implied about Cato, in your manner of using
implied values to build a point out of nothing.

This is not bad in itself. Single-mindedness is not really a quality I am

These are rhetorical questions. The answers are supposed to be, let me see ...
"no" and "yes" ? The analogy is false, of course. Take a look at US propaganda
shorts from 50-ties and learn what to avoid.

> Yep. And it's also pretty accurate. The protesters have no coherent message,

There it goes again. Is it too hard to understand that these people are not
corporate employees adhering to company's policies ?

Declan, you proved beyond any doubt that you have nothing to say. You just talk
an re-shuffle buzzwords you deem popular. You are also incompetent propagandist
- I do enjoy discussing with the skilled ones, though.

Therefore I see no point in furthering this exchange.
