   Subject: 2007 Collegiate Voting Systems Competition

   UMBC is organizing a Collegiate Voting Systems Competition [1]
   to engage students in nationally important, state-of-the-art
   security and privacy research projects and course work.
   Professor Alan Sherman [2] has received an award from NSF's
   CyberTrust program to organize and run the first of what is
   hoped to be an annual conference and competition.  Student
   teams will design and implement a complete voting system that
   must have been used in some election, such as one for a
   student government or organization, by May 2007.  Papers
   describing and analyzing the system are then submitted for the
   conference and used to select candidates for the final
   competition.  The conference, to be held in Portland in July
   2007, will include demonstrations, mock elections, submitted
   presentations and invited talks.  A panel of judges will make
   awards for the best overall system, best presentation, best
   attack, and best paper on voting system metrics. More
   information on the competition, its rules, and an example
   system is available at [2].
