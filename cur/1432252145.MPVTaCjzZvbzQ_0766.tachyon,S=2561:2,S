Actually, it's a slightly older reference. It comes from Ken Kesey's "Acid
Test" LSD parties in the Bay area, Stanford included, in the late 1960's,
as in, "Have you have the Kool-Aid yet?", which was, of course, a reference
to the garbage can full of Kool-Aid (tm) drink mix slowly being shoved into
the middle of the dance floor. See, not coincidentally, Tom Wolfe's "The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test", for details.

Handed down through Deadheads, et at., to Silicon Valley, to mean, roughly,
"do you believe the company 'vision'", um, thing...

Not only more charitable and less gruesome, but much more in keeping with
actual facts, like "the Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field", and so on.

I blame the MBA/IBM/Novell/Wintel crowd for the disparaging Jim Jones
reference, myself. :-).

Cheers,
RAH
