            Police Itself or Else 
            By Kalpana Srinivasan
            Associated Press Writer

            WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Joe Lieberman decried a
            "culture of carnage" surrounding Americas young
            people and told a Senate committee Wednesday that
            the government should stop the marketing of violent
            movies, music and video games to children if the
            industry fails to police itself.
