This reminds me of a story at theregister.

On a large exchange, a trading bot behaved weirdly.
It buys at highest possible and sells at lowest possible.
As expected, the trading bot owner lost _a lot_ of money
in very short time.
IIRC the bot's transactions were rolled back per some rule
and the situation was explained with "beta testing gone wild".
