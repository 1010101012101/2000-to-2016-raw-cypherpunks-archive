So 28 days' detention without charge, more CCTV cams than the rest of
the planet put together, stop-and-search without probable cause and
.gov.uk collection of all telephone, email and web headers hadn't
scared you away already? ;o)

The UK has the tightest government control of anywhere in the west,
and has had for a very long time.  It's just that the plutocracy has
been in charge for so long (since 1649, really), and they've been
fairly smart about it; control has been absorbed into the fabric of
society without disrupting anyone [important] too much.

There is most definitely simmering resentment amongst the populace
here, but it's going to have to get a lot worse before anyone does
anything about it.
