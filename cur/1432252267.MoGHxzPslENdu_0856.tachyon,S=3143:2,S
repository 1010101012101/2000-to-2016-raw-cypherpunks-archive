A hardware keylogger doesn't exist in software and cannot be detected 
in software.  

A software keylogger will be somewhere on the interrupt chain that 
handles keystrokes, if it exists independently.  This is *THE* 
spot where it would have to be planted for maximum coverage of all 
keystrokes starting right after bootup, and ought to be easy to 
detect. 

However, in both xwindows and microsoft windows, there are higher-level 
key handling routines that have 'hooks' which something can be attached 
to so that one application can detect keystrokes directed to another. 
These constitute independent sequences that would have to be checked, 
and that would be a bit harder.
