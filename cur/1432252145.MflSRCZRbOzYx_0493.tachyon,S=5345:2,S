You are right in noticing the one way trend here.  Funny thing is, this 
failed Amerikan political system seems to suggest that voting for the 
"other official party" will correct the imbalance.  All I can say is that 
during Clinton/Reno, civil liberties advocates were still quite busy 
fighting back totalitarian BS being inserted here and there.  Then Bush 
comes along, and ups the ante, now that They've got their brand new 
boogeyman of "terrorism" to scare all the proles.  Who could have thought 
it could have been worse than Clinton-Reno, and then we now see the horror 
of Bush-Asscroft to prove us wrong.

The Amerikan system has failed, all the so-called checks-and-balances have 
been subverted.  No band-aid reform can pretend to correct the thorough, 
systemic corruption and perversion of justice which now exists within the 
govmint of the united Slaves of Amerika.

Only total revolution (whatever that means) will fix the problem.  From a 
systemic standpoint, look at the linchpins that hold this slimy gangsterism 
in place:  THE MEDIA (principally TV), and the POWERLORDS (govt-corporate 
plutocracy).  The media, in covering up the main game plan of the 
plutocrats, would be an obvious logical target of applied pressure, by 
whatever means possible.  The so-called powerlords, could be individually 
targetted so that they are less cocky about their personal power and 
physical safety.

How  far will it have to go?  Will we just sit back passively, and watch 
our "Masters" increasingly lord over us, in our homes, in our courts, 
everywhere?  Will we just watch as they build the Beast databases of DNA, 
etc etc etc and track us like lab rats.  Will we send our children off to 
die for their empire, while those remaining "at home" are enslaved in 
meaningless, subserviant work?

Then it all comes down to figuring out who the REAL TERRORISTS are.  Who 
has the power to truly oppress, enslave, and murder you?  A sad day indeed, 
when Asscrofts and Bush's are more terrifying than Bin Ladens, et al.

We need citizen's grand juries convened under their OWN declared 
jurisdiction of We The People and the Constitution, and the immediate 
arrest and trial of those responsible for this fascist nightmare.  The 
"Potomic Trials"... like Nuremburg II...
