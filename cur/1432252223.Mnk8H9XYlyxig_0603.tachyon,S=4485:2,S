I absolutely said no such thing. You are a liar.

Please reference when I said anything about a "poor little vicimized
Saddam", "Terrible mistreatment", or anything even similar. Fact is, you
are full of shit. You are not only full of shit, but you are also
attempting to further your statist goals by attacking people who might
say that you are full of shit.

No matter what I say, you will hear what you will hear. Which reaffirms my 
general conclusion, which is you're not interesting.

Simple: the people who want to do things like knock over buildings,
should die. That taxpayer funded operations should kill them is silly,
for both the base reason and the effect.


Getting back to what we were talking about, here's a bit that you didn't

Are you going to babble, or respond? Read out loud as: "James Donald has
failed to respond". Or perhaps, "James Donald only reponds when he can
score a point."

Really, if you want to talk, then talk.

Terrorism is stopped at home. (Synonyms abound. Freedom fighters have
killed lots of counter-ensurgents.) If you would like to do anything
more than promote war profits, then at least be a patriot. At least
patriots were statists that were interesting.

James: Give up before you really squander your goodwill.
