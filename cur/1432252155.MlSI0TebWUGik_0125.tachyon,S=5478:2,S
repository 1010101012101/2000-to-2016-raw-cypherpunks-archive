I voted by absentee ballot in 96.

Iowa:

1. Mail in a request for one (Used a form I received in some Democratic
campaign literature, though I didn't vote that way :) )
2. Get  the ballot in Mail,
3. Fill it out (#2 Pencil Please!),
4. Place ballot  in an "anonymity" envelope,
5. Put it in another envelope you sign saying it's truly your vote.
6. Put it in the mailing envelope and send it on its way.

Went to the polls this year (Didn't get a form from anyone in the mail, too
lazy to write my own letter).
