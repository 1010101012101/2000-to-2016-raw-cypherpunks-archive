You need to know more to answer your doubts.  You need to know
background rates.  FWIW I'm a registered lib and fly out of an airport
with a bronze sculpture of John Wayne monthly; I've not felt singled out.

Certain flights are going to have certain demographics -are you
on a biz shuttle w/ dot-commers to SF or a grandma & kids flight 
to Disneyland? 

What fraction of citizens are registered as Demopublicans anyway? 

....
I'm not belittling your questions or claims but I'm pointing out
you have to look at how much others are hassled too.  I've seen
upper crust whitehaired women get hassled more than hirsuit me because
I have the fractional clue to remove metal from my person, and
don't wear steel-toed boots.  Or earrings, chains, rings, belt buckles, 
etc.

*quality control* on their regular magnetometer/screening points.
