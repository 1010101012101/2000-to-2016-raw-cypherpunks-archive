I can't believe i read bullshit like these kind of arguments from educated
persons. Well, i will try to answer in the most political-correct manner.
It's my last comment on the Moon issue, i promise.

It is not pointless at all, buddy. Because the past SHAPES the present.
There is NO today without yesterday. And there is NO "good" today with
"rotten" yesterday (part of which is the moon flam).

We are talking here about a lie. A LIE as big as the size of the moon. *And
if a state can lie such lies, this kind of state has no right to call
itself "democratic/special/good/free/honest" state... or the leader of the
human race. Not talking about bombing other states "for the good sake of
all the others". Such State should be called with an appropriate name. And
have no rights on the world stage, not to mention a Leadership.*

It is indeed pointless to talk about the "great new world of today" which
you and many others see through pink glasses (and there is no such world
today). Because the US fabrication like the "moon" lie is shaping our
present (which you love so much), and even more -
*it is continuing to happen "HERE & NOW".*
Now, the US lie is not about the "moon" but about the bad Assad in Syria,
chemicals in Iraq, freedom to Lybian people, Russian invasion to
Ukraine...etc. It's all happening right here and right now, buddy (On
20/12/2015). *And will continue to happen until good and smart people will
believe in these lies *(this is the cause i write to this list trying to
prevent this)*. Or until there will be "sheeple" like you, who live in an
illusive "here & now" without caring about their yesterday/the truth.*

You missed the whole CORE point. Or misleaded the discussion on purpose.
Well, you have failed.
