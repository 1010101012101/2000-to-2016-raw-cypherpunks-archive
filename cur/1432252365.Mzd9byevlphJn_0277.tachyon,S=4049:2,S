 >>I think there are a few possible routes to doing this: 0) Cypherpunk 
applications continuing to be few and far between, not up to "commercial" 
standards, and not widely deployed. The default. <<

Publicity,ryan,the daughter of invention.Start raising money on ****** then 
*******,*******,*******.The usual suspects.
I can see the headlines.KILLER APP! HAVEN of DEATH! ASSASSINATION POOLS! 
Your arrest will make the headlines.Casanova ran the 1st lottery and died a 
wealthy man.The tempo of declan's knittings just picked up speed.
The 4 horsemen will be wheeled out on you soon,anyway,you and I know 
that.You have to make a virtue out of what's seems to be ,(but isn't) a 
liability.APster for the masses.Tell them your only doing it because an 
aussi mass murderer and cyberstalker threatened to tear your heart out and 
eat it.Hell,tell the masses of the media,their bosses are next.

Its a hard sell but its starting,Its going to be global,your going to be 
the most famous man that ever lived.The APster craze will 
amaze.Assassination politics is already here,the global panopticon is 
already here.Think fusion on Jupiter.Collapse of govts."Eternal vigilance 
is the price of liberty" used to mean us watching # the government, not the 
other way around...."Michael Rimmer did not hesitate to save the PM.Dennis 
More died so that lupins could run free.What would austin Powers do in your 
shoes? Stig of the dump? Christopher Robin commands it Ryan,for the rebel 
alliance and the tower of the beautiful maidens,do it.Let he who shall be 
the rightful king,draw this sword from the stone.Stand on me.
