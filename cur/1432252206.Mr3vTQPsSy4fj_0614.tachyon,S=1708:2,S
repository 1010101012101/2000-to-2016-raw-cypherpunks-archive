I doubt you're even here any longer (are any of us really here any 
longer?), but I lost your direct email a long time ago...

Someone sent me this, and I could swear it was you.  Is it?

"Never belong to any party, always oppose privileged classes and public
plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to
the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always
be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by
predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty."

Joseph Pulitzer, 1907 Speech
