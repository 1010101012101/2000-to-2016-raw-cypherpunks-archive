You are incorrect. "Both are illegal" is not correct. The Home 
Recording Act of 1992 explicitly made home use for noncommercial (no 
renting, no selling, no commercial use in bars or radio stations) fully 
legal. The text can be Googled and the topic has been covered here many 
times.

In shyster terms, it created a "safe harbor" for home taping.

The HRA even established a "blank tape and media tax," which is why 
many CD-Rs sold say "Music" on them (ostensibly these are the media for 
which the blank media tax was paid by someone, with revenues ostensibly 
given to Hollywood).

The DMCA threw a spanner in the works in various ways, partly rewriting 
the HRA, partly adding new stuff.

But the existence of the HRA and the money sent to Hollywood and 
Nashville through the HRA music taxes make successful prosecution of 
any home taper nearly impossible.
