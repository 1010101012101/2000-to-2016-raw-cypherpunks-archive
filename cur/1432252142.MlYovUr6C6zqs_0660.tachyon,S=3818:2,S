"For a very sweet dirty trick along those lines, one could embed a link to a porn picture on-line, resized at 1x1 so it's invisible
in the e-mail. Network logs will show that a given employee requested, say, preteen_bestial.gif from
www.loathsome-sex-offenders.com. Even better, if the company has spyware in place, the jack-booted network thugs won't even have to
be notified by the trickster before grassing him out to senior management."
