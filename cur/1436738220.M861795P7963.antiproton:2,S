Yes, jamming ordinary (non-military) GPS would be easy. =C2=A0The two frequ=
encies involved are: 1.57542 GHz (L1 signal) and 1.2276 GHz (L2 signal). =
=C2=A0(The former is the civilian signal; the latter is the military signal=
.) =C2=A0The system uses spread-spectrum techniques, but even these can be =
defeated readily with only very tiny amounts of power. =C2=A0The ERP (effec=
tive radiated power) of the L1 signal is about 250 watts (meaning that the =
signal is equivalent to an isotropic, or non-directional, radiator emitting=
 250 watts.) =C2=A0Due to the inverse-square law, the emissions at 20,200 k=
m altitude are equivalent a signal a trillion times (120 decibels) weaker a=
t a distance of 20,200,000/1,000,000 or 20.2 meters away: =C2=A0A signal 25=
0 watts/1 trillion is 0.25 nanowatts. =C2=A0I don't know offhand what the s=
pread-spectrum advantage of the system is, but a nearby signal of 1 microwa=

=C2=A0What would be needed is a square wave oscillator at a frequency of 1.=
57542 GHz/9, or =C2=A0175.04666 Mhz. =C2=A0This signal, filtered to remove =
