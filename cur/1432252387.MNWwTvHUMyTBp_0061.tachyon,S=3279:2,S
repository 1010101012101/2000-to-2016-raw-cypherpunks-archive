Inventor? Shit. 

You can achieve this result with the "canned air" dusters sold to 
computer techs and photo people by simply turning the can upside down
so the magic stuff emerges in liquid, not gaseous form - drip or spray
it on the envelope in question, and the paper becomes (partially)
translucent. 

The human rights activists are just pissed off they can't afford it
themselves if they order it from a spy catalog. Everyone can afford it
at Fry's - and learn thing about their friends and neighbors that they'll
someday wish they hadn't.
