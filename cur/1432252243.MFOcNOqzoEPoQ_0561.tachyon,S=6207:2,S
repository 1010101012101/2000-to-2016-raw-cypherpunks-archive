### That actually prevents you from being a small investor, since you
are using institutional intermediaries - and if they are using
algorithmic trading on your behalf, you gain as well. Long-term stock
investment as retirement savings is not a problem, it's the solution.

### The broken parts of the US system are the involvement of the state
in Social Security (which is the opposite of investing, it's fleecing
workers to allow immediate consumption by parasites and bureaucrats,
indeed a Ponzi scheme like the ones in Europe), and the money
counterfeiting actions of the Fed (which have a negative effect on the
stability of stocks, bonds and currency).

### I am all with you there. But where do you see the problem with
algorithmic trading? Wouldn't algorithmic trading be still possible
(and of course, useful) in distributed financial system independent of
large counterfeiters?

### Wall Street (i.e. the system of large government-regulated banks
and businesses) is a centralized government creation, and I fully
agree with you that devising technologies that could allow distributed
short-feedback money management would a boon for humanity. One of the
reasons why governments succeeded in taking control of the monetary
system (aside from simple brute force) was the sheer difficulty in
establishing verifiable information flows about solvency of various
intermediaries and creditors in the pre-electronic era. An FDIC, for
example, initially provided some short term benefits by imposing a
floor on the quality of banks (in the long term it contributed to a
hollowing-out of the system by inducing a false sense of security in
users). It's possible that the acceleration in information flow
possible with modern communication tools could allow the existence of
a self-policed private banking system (and mean really private, not
like Goldman-Sachs, Chase or other government regulated banks) with
low latency of response to solvency changes.
