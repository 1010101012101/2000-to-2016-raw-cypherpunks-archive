I was thinking about this some more, and I wonder if cowpox still
exists in the wild.  I know that all livestock in developed countries
receive certain vaccinations, and it would be logical for
cowpox/smallpox to be one of them.  Hmm, this also makes me wonder: if
there is veterinary vaccine for *pox, could it be safe and effective
for humans, or easily adapted for human use?  Trivia buffs: The word
vaccine comes from the Latin word vacca, meaning cow (vache in
French).

Um, I must correct you: Someone has it in stock, and it would be a
criminal offense (in the US) to make it available, I would imagine.

That may or may not be correct.  If you could vaccinate an old-timer
with exactly the same preparation as was used before it would be safe,
but there is a risk that any preparation could be contaminated with
something, so there is always some risk.  It could be very small
though.  The original vaccine was quite safe, and has been studied
exhaustively.  They have been vaccinating for smallpox since the
1800s.  Here is a woodblock print from Japan from circa 1850
advertising the smallpox vaccine:

Sorry to have to shatter your world, Marc, but, in the US, you have
absolutely no right to weigh those risks for yourself.  The government
will make all those types of decisions for you.  What, did you think
you know what's best for yourself?  That's un-American.  I bet you
also think that you are responsible for your own safety in general?

You could definitely make a protein vaccine for smallpox that wouldn't
involve any of the virus itself.  However... that is quite a project.
It would be much easier to use some non-human pox (cowpox, monkeypox,
whatever), or even use inactivated human pox.  Your neighbor gets the
pox, you collect some of the pus, and inactivate it, perhaps just by
drying it out or heating it a little, and you have an instant
vaccine.  The reason why smallpox is the first and only virus ever
erradicated from the wild is because the vaccine is quite easy.

I hope someone takes up this project in some non-US country, but I
doubt anyone will.  I know it would sell well to Americans right now
if someone did.
