There are a bunch of these kinds of cases in the U.S. today. Suits 
against gun makers, against Hollywood studios ("Natural Born 
Killers," for example), against record companies, etc.

It used to be that one was held responsible for one's own actions. 
These suits are going forward because, as so many folks have pointed 
out, we are a "victimization society." "He made me do it!" "Twinkies 
caused me to kill." "Colt made the weapons, so they should pay."

I have no patience with such arguments. (I have little patience in general.)

Strong crypto will mean punishment is ultimately delivered to the 
tens of millions who need to be dealt with.
