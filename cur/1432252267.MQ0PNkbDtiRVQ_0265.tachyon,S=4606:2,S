When I was served with a subpoena in the CJ Parker trial, I had had a party 
the night before and let a friend of a friend sleep over in my living room. 
The process server showed up around 7:30 am the following morning and my 
houseguest let him into the foyer. Grr.

When I was subpoenaed in the Parker trial, I did not give any pre trial 
statement or affidavits or whatnot. (There's no incentive for me to do so, 
and presumably little incentive for list members to do so, unless they see 
it as a way to avoid further involvement.) My lawyer was the person who had 
contact with DoJ.

Yes. It's a standard government form. They also paid something like $25 a 
day while you waited outside the courtroom before being called to the 
stand, and $40 a day you actually testified. Yay.
