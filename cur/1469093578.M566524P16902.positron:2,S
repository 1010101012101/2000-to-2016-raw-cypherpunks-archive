	No they are not mine. They belong to the people who the US
	gov't/military robs. No taxes no tor.

	What, the pentagon puts more money on bitcoin than tor?? =)

	My feelings about tor are the logical result of basic moral
	principles, reasoning and bla bla bla. 

	I am not a 10 year old girl having a fit about dressing.
	And actually I'd expect 10 year old kids to be smarter about
	authority and the establishment than any tor apologist =P
	
	Tor is criminal garbage created by the pentagon to serve their
	ends. It would be very weird for a libertarian anarchist(your
	caee I think?) to believe otherwise.

	Come on Sean, do not take me for an idiot. My arguments are
	arguments. They are not based on 'feelings'.

	If anything the people driven by feelings, not logic and
	evidence, are the tor supporters.
