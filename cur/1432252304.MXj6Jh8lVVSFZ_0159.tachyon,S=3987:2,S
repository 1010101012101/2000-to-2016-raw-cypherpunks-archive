Here's a link to an online paper from a CRIS Institute workshop, "Mitigating
the Vulnerability of Critical Infrastructures to Catastrophic Failures" held
Sept. 10-11, 2001. Don't know if this was actually presented because of the
ironic timing, but at least it's on the web now.

Brilliant, brilliant stuff!! It's not really fleshed out yet, but here's hoping
more people start working towards these kinds of solutions. Tremendously
encouraging.

Critical Infrastructures Will Remain Vulnerable:
Neighborhoods Must Fend For Themselves

Edward E. Balkovich and Robert H. Anderson
RAND

Power grids, telecommunications networks, and information services are three
strongly inter-dependent systems whose collective functioning is critical to
other infrastructures. All three are either unregulated, or in the process of
being deregulated. This has introduced at least one new failure mode in
addition to many other existing ones: bankruptcy.

We present a concept for restructuring the relationship between these three
critical systems, which we believe merits investigation. We propose using
emerging power generation technologies in telecommunications networks and
information services to augment power grids and/or provide neighborhood sources
of backup power. Critical "neighborhoods" should also assure that they have a
secondary, heterogeneous source of telecommunications.  These principles could
provide the foundation for more robust communications infrastructures and
information processing sites. We discuss the technology and market factors that
motivate this concept and some of the issues it raises.
