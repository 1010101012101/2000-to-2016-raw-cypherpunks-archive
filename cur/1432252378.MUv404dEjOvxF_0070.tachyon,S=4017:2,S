I have been working on this project for several years, and 
have not got much done.  It is a big project, to do it right, 
with a user interface that is going to be reasonably usable 
and intelligible for a casual user,  I would say it is about 
eighteen months full time work if done at home, and if done 
as a dot com business, a couple of million dollars.

Doing it right requires a reasonably competent programmer, 
someone with experience in producing consumer products.  Such 
people tend to be busy.  I have kids to put through college. 
Because of the illegality of likely applications, this is not 
a project that bodes well for making a lot of money.

This project is the upper edge of what can be done by an 
enthusiast.  Having done it, then comes the scary part -- 
deploying it.  No way can I deploy it -- I have too many
assets.   Anyone that has the skills and time needed to
create this is apt to have too many assets to himself deploy
it.
