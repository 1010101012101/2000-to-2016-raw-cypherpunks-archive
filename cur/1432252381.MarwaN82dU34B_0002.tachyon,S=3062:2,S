The obvious mechanisms for including it are a header line,
         X-Hashcash-Version-1212: 0x20A13490B8219048243
which is easy pretty easy for almost anybody to add.
You could also do an ESMTP extension of some sort, which is much more 
annoying to add,
but lets you reject non-hashcashed messages before receiving them.
(The ESMTP approach also has the problem that it's only useful for
direct connections, as opposed to mail relayed through your ISP,
so that probably isn't as interesting.)

Some of the hashcash proposals have required near-real-time interaction
between the sender's client and the recipient's server,
to collect the string of the day or string of the moment,
which has privacy/anonymity problems,
while others either use a fixed or slowly changing parameter set,
e.g. find a string that matches the first N bits of the SHA1 of
         recipient@example.com-YYYYMMDDHH
or      recipient@example.com-YYYYMMDDHH-KEYPHRASE

So the recipient's mail server or client looks for the X-Hashcash string,
makes sure it isn't recipient@example.com-YYYYMMDDHH-KEYPHRASE,
hashes it and makes sure that the number matches, and you're good to go.
