Clue 1: Hollerith cards are not intended to be read by humans.

Clue 2: The first computer count, the second computer count, and in 
some cases, the third computer count, gave substantially identical 
results.

Clue 3: One party, seeing it was approximately 500-1000 votes behind 
the other party, initiated a series of diversionary measures, 
including folderol about butterflies and confused Jews. The diversion 
lasted long enough for planeloads of New York shysters to arrive. 
Then the focus shifted to "the will of the people must be listened 
to."

Clue 4: Hollerith cards in banks and corporations around the world 
are _still _ not read by human eyeballs.
