All of the most recently leaked documents pertaining to Tor (from 2007
to 2011 IIRC) treat it as far too expensive. These documents are largely
congratulatory for Tor, and most of the fears of the research community
(correlation attacks in particular) are as yet unrealized.

As coderman says, there are a wide variety of lucrative active attacks
that the NSA is not shy about using. Given these attacks, there's no
reason to try to become a global passive adversary or implement
correlation attacks. You don't need a correlation attack if you've owned
your target's computing platform with a 0day or several.

To respond to another comment of yours:

Virtually all academic computer science in the United States is
government-funded; Tor isn't substantially different.

Further, the Tor developers include people whom the US Government is
openly hostile towards (Jacob Applebaum), and are generally very
principled people.=20

What is your source for the "fact that the american government has
influenced and bribed virtually everybody in the security community"?
