I have had it explained to me, many times more than I want to remember,
:-), that strong crypto is strong crypto.

It's not that I'm unconvinceable, but I'm still unconvinced, on the balance.

OTOH, if markets overtake the DRM issue, as most cypherpunks I've talked to
think, then we still have lots of leftover installed crypto to play around
with.

Cheers,

Who still thinks that digital proctology is not the same thing as financial
cryptography.
