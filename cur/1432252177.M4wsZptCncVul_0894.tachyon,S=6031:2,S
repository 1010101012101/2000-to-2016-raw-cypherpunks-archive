   THE 10TH WORKSHOP ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC 2006)

   The Fields Institute, Toronto, Canada

   September 18, 19 & 20, 2006


   FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT                February 26, 2006

   ECC 2006 is the tenth in a series of annual workshops dedicated to the
   study of elliptic curve cryptography and related areas. Over the past
   years the ECC conference series has broadened its scope beyond
   elliptic curve cryptography and now covers a wide range of areas
   within modern cryptography. For instance, past ECC conferences
   included presentations on hyperelliptic curve cryptography,
   pairing-based cryptography, side-channel attacks, voting protocols,
   quantum key distribution, AES, hash function, implementation issues,
   and deployments.

   At the same time ECC continues to be the premier conference on elliptic
   curve cryptography. It is hoped that ECC 2006 will further our mission
   of encouraging and stimulating research on the security and
   implementation of elliptic curve cryptosystems and related areas, and
   encouraging collaboration between mathematicians, computer scientists
   and engineers in the academic, industry and government sectors.

   As with past ECC conferences, there will be about 15 invited lectures
   (and no contributed talks) delivered by internationally leading experts.
   There will be both state-of-the-art survey lectures as well as lectures
   on latest research developments.

   FIELDS FALL 2006 THEMATIC PROGRAM IN CRYPTOGRAPHY:
     ECC 2006 will be one of the events being organized in conjunction
     with the Fields Institute Fall 2006 Thematic Program in
     Cryptography. ECC 2006 attendees who are interested in office space
     or funding can apply to Fields for funding:
     http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/06-07/crypto


   SUMMER SCHOOL:
     Tanja Lange will be teaching a course at Fields on "Elliptic and
     Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography". The course is intended for
     graduate students in cryptography and mathematics, and will take
     place from September 11-15. Further details are available on the
     Fields web site:
   www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/06-07/crypto/courses/index.html


   TRAVEL AND ACCOMMODATIONS:
     The Fields Institute is located in the downtown campus of the
     University of Toronto. The Fields web site
       http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/resources/travel/index.html
     has travel information information, directions to the Institute
     including a map, and a listing of hotels that are within walking
     distance the Institute.


   REGISTRATION:
     The second announcement will be made in the beginning of May and
     will include registration information and a list of speakers.
