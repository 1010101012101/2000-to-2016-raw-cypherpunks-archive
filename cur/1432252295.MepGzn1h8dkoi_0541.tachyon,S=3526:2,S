I'm also not going to argue with it, because arguing with lefties who 
spout tired old chestnuts like:

>>'Workers are routinely and systematically exploited by capitalism. 
>>After all, if
>>workers were actually paid the value of their labor (represented by the goods
>>they produced), the owners wouldn't make a profit! Profit is, in its nature,
SURPLUS. "

is a waste fingers applied to a keyboard.

That you would say "beautiful sentiment" to the overall article you 
quoted is...scary.


Jeez, what kind of fools are we attracting to the list these past few years?
