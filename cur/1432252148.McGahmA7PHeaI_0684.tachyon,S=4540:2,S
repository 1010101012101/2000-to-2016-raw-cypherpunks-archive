Modulo the recent discussion of how some remailers
treat traffic from other known remailers differently than
mail from unknown addresses, remailers don't need to
know about each other. 

If they don't know know about each other, and there is
nothing on the machines which suggest they no about
each other, it's difficult for a law abiding remailer operator
to become inadvertantly linked to a non-lawabiding one.

Of course, IANAL, so we're going to hear about 'happy fun
court' not being amused (sigh...)
