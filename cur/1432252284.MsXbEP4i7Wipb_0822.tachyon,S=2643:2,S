Remember:  Before it's actually happened, any discussion is just  
reckless speculation, rumor-mongering, or worse.

After it's actually happened, it's either (a) not a real issue; (b) a  
major new attack that could not have been foreseen but that will be  
dealt with immediately by top people.  Top people.
