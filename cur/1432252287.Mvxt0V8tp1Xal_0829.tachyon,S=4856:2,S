metabolites of plants that inc|ude more than 2,OOO different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including capi|laries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary technology, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|| its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2004-20O5 are more then  $100 mil|i0n USD
