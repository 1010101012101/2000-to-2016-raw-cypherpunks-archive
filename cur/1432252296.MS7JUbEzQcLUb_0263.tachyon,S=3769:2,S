"...the exhibition of 'plastinates', his name for the preserved corpses, is 
designed to inform the layperson about the intricacies of the human body.
He calls the exhibition 'an anatomy of experience'. Von Hagens' method of 
preserving the bodies involves replacing bodily fluids with reactive 
polymers such as silicone, epoxy or polyester polymers, and was patented by 
the professor over twenty years ago.
The method enables cells, sinews, and veins to remain in an identical state 
to that preceding preservation, even down to the microscopic level. Hence, 
microscopic examinations are still possible."
