Google denies FBI interest in Gmail

Google on Thursday denied that it has had any contact with the FBI
regarding the design of its Gmail Web email service.

 The search firm's denial came after the Electronic Privacy Information
Centre (EPIC) submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI
seeking information about whether the bureau was considering the "possible
use of Google's Gmail service for law enforcement and intelligence
investigations." EPIC, which gave an award last week to a California state
senator who is trying to ban Gmail, announced the request immediately after
Google said it was filing for an initial public offering.

 Critics immediately criticised EPIC's request as a publicity stunt because
the nonprofit likened Google's Web-based email service to the FBI's
controversial Carnivore wiretapping utility and the Pentagon's discontinued
"Orwellian Total Information Awareness program."

 EPIC's request also asked whether Google had discussed licensing its
search technology, in use by customers in the private sector, to the FBI
"to further law enforcement investigations or intelligence gathering
activities." Google spokesman Nathan Tyler replied: "I cannot confirm
whether they're using our technology."
