But there's no real meat here--it's the kind of thing that tells you just 
enough to make you feel like you know what you're talking about, but 
doesn't go nearly deep enough to be worth anything. 

So what's on my summer reading list? The Institute for National Strategic 
Studies and the National Defense University just came out with a 
monstrously long (1124 pp.)two-volume compendium of essays: "The Global 
Century: Globalization and National Security" that explores the 
implications of globalism in 49 essays from every angle you can think of by 
a collection of genuine heavy hitters. I think I'll certainly be better off 
for having invested the time in reading it.

here's a link to the pdf:
