You are kind of slow on the uptake.

The government has been using the judicial process itself as a punishment 
for many years, most infamously the PGP grand jury.

These subpeonas are a form of harassment.  I curb my speach not for fear 
that I will be prosecuted, but for fear that I will  be summoned as a 
witness, in the course of investigating a supposed conspiracy.

Recollect the great indignation during the fifties about the way the 
government used an investigation of an entirely real conspiracy, a 
conspiracy directed by a hostile foreign power seeking the destruction of 
the US, as a punishment against those of certain political views.
