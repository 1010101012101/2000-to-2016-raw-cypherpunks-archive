Notice the reference to "Jurisdictional Defects", below.  They were trying to pretend that the filing of an Interlocutory appeal did not divest jurisdiction from the District Court case below.  For those looking up, see the "Dunbar Rule".  My filing was proper, and was jurisdictional, so Judge Tanner shouldn't have been able to proceed with what in reality was a phony trial.
