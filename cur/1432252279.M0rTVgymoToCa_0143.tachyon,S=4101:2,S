Unfortunately for "citizenq"'s tender sensibilities, sometimes it actually 
makes sense to call a fool a fool. This is one of those times. "citizenq" 
clearly does not understand the difference between a news article written 
by the general public that does not permit line-by-line analysis of the 
bill and more technical commentary that it suitable for other fora. I did 
write a detailed description of the bill for Politech, where such an 
analysis is appropriate:
http://www.politechbot.com/p-02518.html

"citizenq" has proven itself someone who needs killfiling.
