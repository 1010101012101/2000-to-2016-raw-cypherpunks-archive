In what imaginary universe?

Perhaps you need to be chipped and your blood pressure/
penile turgidity monitored when watching FOX, like
the brits will soon have.  (Proposed for sex offenders,
actually.)  Of course getting a stiffie
while watching US videogame death qualifies you for
a cabinet post...

........

A recent pop-Merkin 'News' rag described US psyops which
fund 'moderate' moslems.  Refurb a mosque here, beam
Sesame Street in arabic there, you get props, or so the
future-trinitite in DC seem to think.  All the more reason
for the Colonized to harvest the Collaborators ---they really
are Western puppets, knowingly or not.

Maybe every Iraqi collaborator needs a US SpecOp team
to wipe their ass, like Karzai has.

Remember, George in Georgia just missed a *live* grenade.
Next time, no hanky to foul the lever, eh?

Render unto Caesar..
