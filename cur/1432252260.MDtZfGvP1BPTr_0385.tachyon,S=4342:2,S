WebRTC sockets in browsers for P2P would be an interesting project;
this has been brought up here and there for various purposes, yet I
can't find many resources on this either.

interop is much better than when i last checked!
  http://www.webrtc.org/interop
and WebRTC is actually working in the browser i'm using:
  https://apprtc.webrtc.org


widespread use given a compelling use case is feasible, and a much
lower bar than third party application installs or Java apps require.


i would be interested in following your progress if you do start
coding on this...


best regards,
