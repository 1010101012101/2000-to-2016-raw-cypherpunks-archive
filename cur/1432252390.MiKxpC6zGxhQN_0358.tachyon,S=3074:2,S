Correct, except that you haven't grasped that it will be impossible
to trace anything to anyone.

To see this, you need to imagine truly anonymous payment schemes
and truly anonymous information publishing.  [The latter tech
exists, the former has to deal with interfacing with the US dominated
financial web, and exchanging ecredits for meatthings.  Meat being
succeptible to guns & cruise missiles, of course.]

Bell's observation is simply: if you have these two (cash & freedom of
speech), look at what one could build.  And the social implications thereof.
