If you really must chant I'd prefer "Freematt" over "Free Huey" but 
then I'm somewhat biased.  Really you shouldn't say anything to a 
reporter anywhere that you wouldn't mind seeing on the front page of 
your local newspaper.  And you really, really, shouldn't post your 
innermost feelings and plans for world domination on cypherpunks, 
unless of course you want everyone who cares to look know your 
innermost feelings and plans for world domination.
