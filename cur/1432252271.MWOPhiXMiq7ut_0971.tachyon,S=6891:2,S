Sorry, no. It is absolutely important to be exhaustive and correct here.
Otherwise this whole thing could get out of hands and could get much worse.

There is a very big difference e.g. I (and a lot of other people too, I
guess) will react to vendors whose debug interfaces where just hijacked
by the NSA to install backdoors and where the vendors worked hand in
hand with the NSA to do so deliberately. And we cannot just assume that
because it looks like the easiest way to deal with this for us now and
blame others! Also, if this talk does not specifically say that those
vendors were working with the NSA, it would have been important to make
clear that we don't know and we cannot judge them by the facts presented
now. A lot of people, which seem to be really loud, often get this wrong.

If such FUD is spread against vendors, which in my opinion, do actually have a
valid interest in trying to stop those back doors, what do you think will a
lot of members of this community do? Cut off communication with those vendors,
place them on their I-will-never-work-there lists? And I say, that they will
still sell shitloads of trucks of hardware.

As a manager with no technical background on such an accused company,
what do you think will they do? Will they push things like secure boot
down our throats?  Will they make all the hardware much more closed
in fear this community does bad PR against them otherwise? Is that the
outcome we want?

On past Chaos Communication Congresses I really think those vendors would have
been cheered for having an open JTAG interface on a board. It seems days have
changed.

Until now I saw no facts that I distrust the major hardware vendors. I
already have a bad feeling with that but I need to be still reasonable
here, too. I cannot accuse those companies by the facts presented
until now. But essentially, it is important that this community does
work hand in hand with those vendors who are willing to and just got
exploited by the NSA to not bring them to the wrong conclusions and
make tampering with the hardware more hard but instead make open source
bios and firmwares that users can build and verify themselves. Make
documentation more open, show them people do care about that. If secure
boot or other means get established, show the users how they can use
that for *their* own good, build up *their* own crypto chains etc. Make
firmware source-code trackable via source repos, provides ways to rebuild
those code bit-by-bit. Provide repositories with changes, instead of
giant source code drops. Otherwise a new generation of NSA backdoors
will have it much easier to be really hidden in those hardware.

That may add additional costs for those companies. So show them it is worth
it!

Yeah, the NSA and NSA only. Until now I have no facts that anyone but
the NSA does so deliberately.

Let's don't make it worse ourselfs. ;)

I don't want to see what the PR persons on those accused companies' twitter
feeds will have to go through now. I guess lots of overreaction is happening
now, which is not helpful at all.

Greetings,
