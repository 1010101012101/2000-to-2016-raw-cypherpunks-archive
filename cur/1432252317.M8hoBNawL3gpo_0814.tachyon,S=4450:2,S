[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  loverscaughtontape.com are the producers 
of the most successful selling adult titles worldwide.  If you're 
easily offended or are not legally able to view adult only material, 
don't click on their link.  Eric <eric@vidbidness.net> who owns 
loverscaughtontape.com and who subscribes to Freematt's Alerts, was 
kind enough to send me me a box full of their DVD's and videos.  Eric 
has appeared on the Howard Stern show and The New York Times did an 
article recently on what happens when an adult business gives money 
to a charity, in this case St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis. 
St. Jude didn't like it when loverscaughtontape.com posted their 
thank you letter on their website.  BTW, the videos are just what 
you'd expect-  People having sex, while being filmed by surveillance 
cameras.]

Hey Matt-

LOVE Freematt's Alerts; please keep it coming.

This may be a little off your beaten path, but it has affected us 
strongly, and I believe there's a first-amendment issue here. We run 
an adult site (well, more a 'risque' site), and had a good year - 
then donated some money to charity, and being very self-satisfied, 
linked to the charities from our site. They got wind of it (because 
of rants from some religious-righties we were battling with), and 
threatened to send the legal goon squads after us. The story is here:

A fan of ours entered the fray also:

I hope you find it suitable to run, but thanks either way!

Best,

Eric
