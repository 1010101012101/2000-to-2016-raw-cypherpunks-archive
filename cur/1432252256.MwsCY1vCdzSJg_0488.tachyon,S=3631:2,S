The Village Voice has an article which approaches the question of how
to make a citizen's arrest of Henry Kissinger:
http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0133/ridgeway.php

The article is apparently hostile to Kissinger, but plays down the
horror and extent of his crimes.  Boilerplate excuses are offered.
Outrage at murder and kidnapping is curiously absent.

"Kissinger was simply a very loyal, opportunist subordinate."
  -- Daniel Ellsberg

Does this exonerate other criminals under our laws?  No.
Is it the truth?  No.
