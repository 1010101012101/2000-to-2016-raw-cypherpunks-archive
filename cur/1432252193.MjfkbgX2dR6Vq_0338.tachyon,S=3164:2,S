                     Ellison to pull plug on protest websites
                     Sean Parnell and Matthew Fynes-Clinton
                     07nov02

                     THE Federal Government plans to stop Australians
gaining access to
                     websites used to organise protests.

                     The move is part of a major crackdown on
Internet-assisted crime.

                     Justice Minister Chris Ellison, acting on a request
from NSW Police Minister
                     Michael Costa, will look at upgrading federal
powers to block certain
                     websites.

                     A police ministers meeting in Darwin this week
agreed it was "unacceptable
                     websites advocating or facilitating violent protest
action be accessible from
                     Australia".
