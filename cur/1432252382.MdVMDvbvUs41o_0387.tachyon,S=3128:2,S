Did a search and found this.Bruce Schneier's article
suggests that BitLocker be used without the diffusers.
As you have mentioned chaining with CBC looks good
enough.

 
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/bitlocker.html
Encryption particulars: The default data encryption
algorithm is AES-128-CBC with an additional diffuser.
The diffuser is designed to protect against
ciphertext-manipulation attacks, and is independently
keyed from AES-CBC so that it cannot damage the
security you get from AES-CBC. Administrators can
select the disk encryption algorithm through group
policy. Choices are 128-bit AES-CBC plus the diffuser,
256-bit AES-CBC plus the diffuser, 128-bit AES-CBC,
and 256-bit AES-CBC. (My advice: stick with the
default.)

This must be it :-)


Thankyou,
