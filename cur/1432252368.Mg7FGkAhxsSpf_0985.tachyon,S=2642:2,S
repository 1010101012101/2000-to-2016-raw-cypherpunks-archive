you can: http://www.lessemf.com/paint.html

there are also a few companies selling faraday cloth, though i don't
recall the attenuation provided.  what i'd really like is something
toggle'able, although the product described in this thread sounds more
like snake oil than truly "nano reconfigurable faraday surface"

a friend also has an attic/loft well coated in many layers of lead
base; there are two small windows and the attenuation with lead based
appears to be pretty decent as well.  (a little hard to find these
day, though :)
