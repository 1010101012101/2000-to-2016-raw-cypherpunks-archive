Several people have written to remind me that PeerPunks
will conflict with the Creative Commons reception.
That's worth rescheduling for, so please note the change-


  Tuesday December 17, 7pm onward  

James



------

The second monthly...er, semi-annual South Bay 
PeerPunks meeting will convene Tuesday December 17 - that's
a week from next Tuesday at the time/place below.

PeerPunks is just my clever name for the Silicon Valley 
contingent of p2p enthusiasts, hackers, well-wishers, 
etc. who can't make it up to Bram's monthly meeting
in SF on a regular basis.  Any and all are welcome, so
please come and join in...

If you don't know what I look like, just look for the guy
in the red EFF "Fair Use Has A Possee" t-shirt. 


See you there and then.

James
