Same here of course.

The only reason for mentioning it was that it is perhaps a  way people
who somehow got hold of the the fissile material, but otherwise had
access only to stuff you could pick up on the street,  could bodge
something together that that would scare others. I'd have no expectation
of a nuclear explosion from such a rig.  The only advantage is that it
is cheap and can be set up in a few hours and (perhaps) might make a
truly scary booby-trap. It might be even more effective if it didn't
have a timer. A few kilos of fissile uranium literally hanging by a
thread in a housing project would make the TV news worldwide.

Back to Heinlein again...

Shit. If the UK government passes this law they are proposing then this
email would probably count as illegal. And anonymous postings are often
so tedious.
