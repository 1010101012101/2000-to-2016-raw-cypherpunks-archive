Cryptome offers Microsoft's second patent on digital rights management, 
invented by the same three persons as the first, Paul England, 
John DeTreville and Butler Lampson:

  http://cryptome.org/ms-drm-os2.htm

This second patent was issued on December 7, 2001, a week before the 
first available here:

  http://cryptome.org/ms-drm-os.htm

John DeTreville wrote on July 8, 2002, that neither he nor Butler
Lampson were Palladium programmers, as distinguished from Paul England
who was cited by Steven Levy in Newsweek as a Palladium programmer.
John referred to another patent underlying Palladium.

Cryptome did a search of the US Patent Office archives for other 
patents by the three inventors and for those assigned to Microsoft from 
1996 to July 9, 2002. Only two patents for digtial rights management 
were listed, out of more than 2,000 Microsoft patents for the period:
the two referenced above on Cryptome.

Ross Anderson reported yesterday that MSNBC has pulled the Palladium 
article by Steven Levy, which is now here:
