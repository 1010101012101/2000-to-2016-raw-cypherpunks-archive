A hell of a lot more than it takes to just make it squirm.

According to the article it leaves dents.  So instead of a focused
blast puncturing a hole, it gets splayed out all over the place.

Yeah, that's what makes the RPG a useful weapon now, isn't it.
U238 shells do similar things, but it's the chemical reaction with
the steel that's the suprise.  the gassious U238 and steel inside
the tank is the major nastyness.

While I admit this is fun, I think we're kinda off topic :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
