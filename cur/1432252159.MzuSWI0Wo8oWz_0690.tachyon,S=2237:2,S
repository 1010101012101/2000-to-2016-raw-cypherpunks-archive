No no, Stalin was "a very bad man" - yet, not however,
as bad as Ronald Reagan et al.  Furthermore the five
year plans involved no bloodshed whatsoever, well only a
teensy weensy little bit, nothing like what General
Motors does in its well known slave labor camps, and the
liquidation of the kulaks was self defense against a
vicious attempt by the peasants to starve the
proletariat.  :-)
