Dear oddodoodo,

This September, Adult Friend Finder welcomed over 
400,000 hot, new members! There's someone for every 
desire, so come back to http://AdultFriendFinder.com 
now, and get it on!

* CREATE A PROFILE THAT WILL GET YOU LAID!
* GET WET, STAY WET. A GUIDE TO LUBRICANTS!
* READ A MEMBER'S SEXY SUCCESS STORY! 

------------------------------------------------------- 
CREATE A PROFILE THAT WILL GET YOU LAID!

A hot profile is the easiest way to connect with 
other Adult Friend Finder members. Be specific. Be 
outrageous. Be yourself. Here's some tips on how to 
make your profile do all the work while you reap 
the rewards:

1. Be specific. Write about a fantasy or fetish. 
   Reveal your favorite sexual positions. Because 
   we have millions of members, you're sure to find 
   someone with similar tastes.

2. Be honest. It may seem awkward, but if you want 
   a partner with huge breasts or a dick that has
   been circumcised, say so! Being direct will narrow 
   your choices and let you find desirable partners.

3. Be yourself. Let your personality show. Even 
   online, people will be able to "see" right through 
   you. If they think you're phony, they'll skip your 
   profile and tell other members to do the same.

4. Be visible. Upload a photo or two or five! Photos 
   are the finishing touches for your profile! 

Once you've created the perfect profile, upgrade to 
a Gold Membership and push your profile to the front 
of the line. Gold members appear first in the listings 
and get viewed 4 TIMES more often than Standard Members. 
Upgrade today at http://AdultFriendFinder.com!

GET WET, STAY WET. A GUIDE TO LUBRICANTS.

Lubricants, also known as sex lube or just lube, are 
usually a water-based, condom-friendly liquid or jelly 
used to enhance or replace natural lubrication.

There are two types, oil and water-based. Oil-based 
lubricants, like Vaseline or mineral oil, aren't so 
great. They destroy latex on contact, making condoms, 
diaphragms, cervical caps, sponges, and the protective 
coatings around some IUDs useless. Here's a list of 
some of the most common brands of sex lubes:

* KY Jelly
* Wet 
* ForPlay
* Probe
* Pride
* Aqualube
* Astroglide
* Elbow Grease

Remember to read the label carefully before you buy 
as each product differs from the rest. Some are only for
masturbating. Others are scented. Sample small bottles 
of each to find the one that works for you. Have fun!
------------------------------------------------------- 
READ A MEMBER'S SEXY SUCCESS STORY!

"It was over three years ago that Michael found my 
ad on AFF...We exchanged several e-mails, but after a 
while we lost contact because of traumatic events in 
our lives. I posted a new ad on AFF a few months before 
I was to leave Maine for college in New Mexico, when he 
found me again - that was more than a year ago, and 
we plan to spend our lives together... 

Thanks so much for giving us the chance to connect! Now 
we use AFF to find other couples and singles to play 
with, because we both want to explore and experiment all 
that sex and life have to offer. So rock on, AFF, and 
feel the love!"
