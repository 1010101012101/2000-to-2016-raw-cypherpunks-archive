and Public Health Management"

@ http://jama.ama-assn.org/issues/v281n18/ffull/jst80027.html

"The nonflagellated vegetative cell is large (1-8 microns in length,
1-1.5 microns in breadth). Spore size is approximately 1 micron."

The germinated B anthracis is _larger_ than the _singular_ spore
(dormant) state (the gram positive rod). The spores are being milled to
the "spherical" and "singular" spore size, around 1 micron. The spores
unmilled may clump greatly (as reported for the Boca Raton letter) as
part of the process that was used to cause sporulation of the growing B
anthracis stock. Also they clump because of electrostatic charge (which
is now being reported to have been defeated).

My question is how do the TB and HEPA masks function with 1 micron size
particles that are  electrostatically neutral. I would assume that all
these masks were designed from the premise that small particles will
always have a electrostatic charges--since only artificially made
particles (requiring great technical skill) can be made
electrostatically neutral.

Is the filter a physical barrier at 0.3 microns? Or is this a physical +
electrostatic barrier at 0.3 microns (which means that the physical
component may be much greater)?

----ORIGINAL MESSAGE-----
I think that the TB mask is sufficient protective equipment from
airborne spores, although there is no indication that it would be needed
while treating a patient.  Also, there is no reason to decontaminate the
patient with soap and water.  If he is worried, remove his clothes and
send him
home.  He can take a shower there if he likes.   If you wash the
patient,
the water can go down the drain.
