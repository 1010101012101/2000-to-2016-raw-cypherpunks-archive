I suppose, but don't forget that there really is a reason they're
called "Schelling" points instead of anything else. People really
ought to invest a little time in reading the genuine article:

The Strategy of Conflict, Harvard University Press, 1960
Choice and Consequence, Harvard University Press, 1984 
Micromotives and Macrobehavior, Norton, 1978

Did you know that Thomas Schelling is still very much alive and
teaching strategy around the country? Amazing man, sharp as ever.
