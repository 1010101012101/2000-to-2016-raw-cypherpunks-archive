	Yes, exactly. Valid criticism of stuff that doesn't work and is
	morally fucked up.

	You have a problem with that? You want people to try to sell
	garbage and go unchallenged?

	What information is out there?

	Are you missing the point on purpose? The networks are 'owned'
	by the government and friends, and there obviously is no
	fucking way for joe six pack to use their infrastructure to
	'watch' his masters.

	Not what I was getting at, not to mention, the amount of stuff
	that gets posted is (pretty) small.

	Of course. Like I said, the networks are owned by the
	government. Temporary glitches in security don't mean much, if
	anything. 
	
	Oh, and let me know when the nsa really gets 'hacked'  as
	opposed as having one employee betray them.
