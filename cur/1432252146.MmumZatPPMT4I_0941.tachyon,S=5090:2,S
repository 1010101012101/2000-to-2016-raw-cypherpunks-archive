Great!  Could you please explain it to *US* then?  I [seriously] doubt
that most of us know what it is we do here!

Information wants to be Free, Mitch.  Kinda sucks to be you, doesn't it?

But, as you indicated, you wanted it "the easy way" - TANSTAAFL.

It's good you can learn from your mistakes: it shows you are a little
higher on the food chain than most of the folks you will run into out
there.  Kudos.

Unfortunately Mitch, that's not likely to be the only archive of your
posting(s).  I usually refer to google as "your friend", although in this
case...

Even if this archived post is killed by the persona running the archive
(which I doubt), you would still have an "internet history".  Probably a
lot more history than you expect: http://www.google.com .

You are right in your assessment that it is time to put your mistakes
behind you and move on, but unfortunately, there is literally no way [that
I know of] to "erase yourself from the face of the internet".

Good luck to you Mitch.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
