On the road to truth and madness
(Filed: 22/02/2005)

The opening of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:

We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs
began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should drive 
" And suddenly there was a terrible
roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all
swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a
hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was
screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?"

Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was
pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process. "What the
hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his
eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind," I
said. "It's your turn to drive." I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red
Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I
thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.
