Yep.

You need the following ingredients:

a) One (1) human being with an at least average IQ
b) One (1) public library (an ordinary school library would do)
c) One (1) hardware store or garden centre or any other source of
chemicals in kilogram quantities
d) One (1) ordinary garage or workshop with basic DIY tools & materials

Mix (a) & (b) together for as long as it takes to get a human being with
science and/or technology education to at least high-school level. 

Then add (c) and (d) and stand well back.
