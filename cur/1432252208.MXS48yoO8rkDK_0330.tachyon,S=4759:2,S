+1.  A fiat currency with no capital controls and reasonably free
trade is probably the best currency system yet.  Details do matter
though.  It helps when the issuer doesn't inflate, for example.
Still, the U.S. dollar has been that sort of currency since the 70s,
and it's worked out rather well.  (Which isn't to say it will
continue, but if it doesn't, it won't be due to any flaws in this
currency system.)

A simple digital coin would be one with double spend detection, and
blind signatures for anonymity.  Double spend detection is a problem,
because it requires online infrastructure, which then becomes a
super-critical part of the economy, but I'm not sure how we can avoid
it.  The proof of computation idea is a total waste of precious energy
(check the news, energy shortages are likely to be a common problem in
Japan and Europe as a result of Fukushima, and probably elsewhere
too).

Good point.  It's all in what's in that basket, and the rate of
transactions (i.e., whether people use this thing).
