It takes just a moment to remember that Aimee is allegedly
based in Waco, TX, though probably with a TLA in Fort
Worth -- Texas TLAs never stop joking about Waco
to hide their own addiction problems. Choate is in Austin, TX, 
when he's not electromagnetically rocketing around the
stars. Mike Godwin's Texas background is a disturbing, if 
pleasurable, fact. The EFF dustup was rooted in 
hypersensitive sensibilities about a party's birthplace.

It's the water, Declan, the water in Texas has stuff in it that
drives natives to say, to write, to behave in odd ways. The smiles
of Texans are not signs of friendliness but evidence of 
contaminated ground water. Scientists can find no difference
in the ground water and white lightning.

I'm a Texan.

Like Texas, the water in DC, the water is New York City, in 
California, the East and West Coast, some say the New World, 
is laced with something that induces crazed, condescending
braggartly superiority, the urge to never lose an argument
that's winnable by lying, by denying that's what you said,
wrote, did. To shoot if nothing else wins.

This is not about superpower foreign policy.
