I'm watching Jesse Jackson on CNN, saying he and others (Al Sharpton, 
etc.) will be rallying to investigate "irregularities" in Florida. 
They plan marches.

Both sides are now scrambling to find the extra votes they need. I 
wouldn't be at all surprised if both sides don't turn up 
"undiscovered" votes. Or if both sides don't sue to invalidate entire 
blocs of votes (from certain precincts).

The longer the recount goes on, the more suspect the final tally, 
ironically enough.

The one good thing out of this circus is that neither party will have 
the "mandate" to push for lots of new laws.
