Not as far as I know, and I spent a bit of time reading through both
Author Unknown, by Don Foster (who named Klien) and "Analyzing for
Authorship," by Jill Farringdon.

Foster is an English professor, and reads the work under analysis, and
then works by the potential authors.  His technique would be described
as intuitive, but the human brain has large power to make linkages.
Analysing for Authorship, from the University of Wales press.

"Analyzing for Authorship" really didn't strike me as better. It uses
a technique called "CUSUM," but the methodology and graphs (as I
recall) vary from text to text, and neither I, nor Alice, who read the
book for ZKS, wondering if we could build this stuff into a product,
was very impressed by it.

So, the question boils down to economics.  There's how much you need
to communicate, how much someone is willing to spend to tag you, and
how good their proof needs to be.  I suspect that for most purposes,
proof does not need to be very strong in relation to your need to
communicate.   That is, if Tricky Dick thinks you're Deep Throat, or
Saddam thinks you're the guy who betrayed him, etc.
