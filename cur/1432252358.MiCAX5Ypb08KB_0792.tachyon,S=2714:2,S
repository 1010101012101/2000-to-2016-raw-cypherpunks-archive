The AP is reporting that the three year old son of a police officer, in
Clarkesdale, Mississippi, climbed into the back seat of the family truck
while his off-duty father stopped for gas, picked up dad's pistol, aimed
it at the gas station attendant, and shot him in the face.

The attendant, an unfortunate James Collins, 43, is in critical condition.

Remember, guns don't kill people, toddlers do.
