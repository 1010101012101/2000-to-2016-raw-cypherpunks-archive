I think this goes a little too far (though I'm also pretty skeptical about 
the underlying proposal). True, it's very unlikely that cops will arrest 
themselves for violating a mandatory disclosure law - expecting any group 
to reliably self-police is unrealistic.

It would not be practically, impossible, to enforce such a provision the 
same way that parts of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth amendments are - by 
making evidence which has been gathered illegally unavailable in court. 
That sanction isn't intended to be punitive - it just removes (some of) the 
motivation to engage in the forbidden activity.
