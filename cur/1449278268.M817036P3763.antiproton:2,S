  "No longer are their [terrorists] attacks carried out without many,
if not a majority, suspecting the governments in the West at least as
equally as shadowy terrorist organizations."

Perhaps some find it hard to believe?

OK, these guys appear to be trying to present an Islamic/ Iran
position to English readers, yet don't have any links (in this article
at least) to primary information or quotes of the alleged email
interview. Quite frustrating.

My first reaction was dismissive of such poor 'journalistic practice',
yet I get a sense of genuine intent to create a better public dialog
which overrides my initial reaction. Based on this I briefly searched
without success for a "Contact" link, to email them which this
viewpoint I have about their article, as I would like to see all sides
of public debate lift their respective games.

I will forward this privately to the whois (non-cloudflare) email in
the hope that this might be useful to someone there... any better
suggestions appreciated. Evidently having a "Contact" email/ form is
also recommended for a news website.

Leader’s letter helped ‘discover shadowy faces of terrorism’: American Analyst
IIT Exclusive News, Imam Ali Khamenei, Iran, Leaders of Ummah, Middle
East, North America
3 December 2015 10:10


An independent American analyst believes after Leader’s letter,
international public awareness would never allow governments to
support terrorism without impunity.

Anthony Cartalucci wrote to Payman Yazdani of Mehr News International
Service in an email interview about the recent and second letter by
the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei to
youth in Europe and the US, where he said the letter contributed to an
environment which would make public alert, who otherwise would only
watch passively their fellow governments’ nebulous acts in sponsoring
terrorism. Cartalucci also believed that the West had shifted the
blame to Islam and Islamic countries, since they saw clearly the
backlash of their own act in arming atrocious terrorists in Islamic
lands:

In his second letter to western youth, Ayatollah Khamenei has talked
about the terrorism and its roots. What is the significance of this
issue?

To solve any problem, one must first understand it fully. The problem
of terrorism has long been poorly understood by the majority of the
Western public, and even policymakers. Their inability to grasp the
true roots of terrorism have allowed it to flourish indefinitely.

For most in the West, the reality that special interests in their own
governments have created and perpetuated terrorism intentionally as a
geopolitical tool is incomprehensible. Unfortunately, it is also the
truth and until they grasp that, those behind the terrorism will have
a carte blanche to continue using it both at home and abroad, as a
proxy force of violence, and as a tool to create fear and coercion.

The wars, instability, growing domestic police states, distrust among
nations, and even within nations, among citizens, refugee crises, and
others all are wrought from the use of terrorism as a geopolitical
tool. Thus, it is at work within the heart of some of the most
pressing issues of our time.



The Leader has emphasized in his message that Islam is the religion of
peace; why do some try to introduce Islam as the religion of violence?

The majority who claim Islam is a religion of violence are merely
repeating witlessly propaganda they themselves heard. The source of
this propaganda are the same interests which themselves are driving
the violence – particularly the state sponsors of terrorism, the
United States, their Persian Gulf allies, NATO, and others.

By blaming Islam and appealing to both ignorance and bigotry which are
still deeply rooted in Western culture, these very interests feeding
the violence can deflect blame onto others – in this case, Muslim
nations and peoples. By appealing to ideology, rationality, history,
geopolitics, and critical thinking can be side-stepped and emotional
responses can easily be elicited.



Why would some try to make connections between Islam and terrorism
after any terrorist act happening around the world?

Again, it is a matter of deflecting responsibility by those who are
actually driving terrorism. The recent attacks in Paris were carried
out by terrorists the United States and its closest regional allies
have been arming, training, funding, and harboring for years now. All
of the attackers were well known to Western intelligence agencies. By
all indications, this attack should have been easily foiled by Western
security agencies, but it was not.

Conveniently, it was carried out on the eve of the Vienna talks on
Syria, and just as the West’s agenda in Syria began unraveling in the
face of a joint Syrian-Russian-Iranian alliance. Some would say this
was a little “too convenient.” Blaming the attacks on Islam is the
best way to appeal to people’s emotions directly, and hopefully
overwhelm their ability to critically think and ask just who really
benefited from the conveniently-timed attacks and why, again, Western
security agencies knew of the attackers beforehand but made no
attempts to stop them from carrying out their horrific acts of
violence.



What is the importance of this letter at this juncture?

The importance of this letter is that it adds to a growing body of
evidence and voices around the world speaking up and confronting state
sponsors of global terrorism. The constant efforts of those who know
the truth to inform those who yet do not, is having a gradual effect
on the special interests driving global terrorism. No longer are they
able to act with impunity. No longer are their attacks carried out
without many, if not a majority, suspecting the governments in the
West at least as equally as shadowy terrorist organizations.

It is important for this process, this dialogue to continue, to speak
to the truth with every opportunity and in every format, so that as
people begin to see the truth for themselves, they can also take note
of who has been saying it all along.
