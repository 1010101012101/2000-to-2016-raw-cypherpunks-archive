There are many facts linking George W to moving drugs. First, the airplane 
he would occasionally fly while Governer of Texas was the same plane used to 
move the drugs during Iran-Contra. Second, there's that strage rumor that 
George W. actually took a bust in Florida after having landed a planeload of 
coke there. (Apparently him getting busted was a result of one of those 
inter-agency snafus...he was released quickly but there's apparently some 
video somewhere.)

This may seem unlikely, but when one remembers that 1) George W is a 
licensed pilot, 2) His daddy is George Sr, ex-CIA chief and mastermind of 
Iran-Contra...

Search around on www.spitfirelist.com and you can find the references.
