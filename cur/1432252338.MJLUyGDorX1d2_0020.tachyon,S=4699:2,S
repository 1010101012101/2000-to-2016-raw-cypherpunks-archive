My father in-law makes some extra dough by converting modern  power tools
(Delta table saws, belt sanders, and lathes) to run of a  central drive
shaft so the Amish in our area can build furniture.  Evidently it's "kosher"
to use a centrally located diesel engine (with a battery to start it even!)
to turn line shafts, belts, and pulleys to transmit power instead of wires.
They even use pre-manufactured drawer  guides and other hardware in their
furniture (and air compressor powered sprayers to apply stain and varnish).

Several Amish farms put telephones in their barns for emergency purposes (or
drive to nearby store to use a phone booth to call relatives, etc.).

So much for being "independent".
