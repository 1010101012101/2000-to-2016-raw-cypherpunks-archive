>FINLAND MULLS PUTTING NATIONAL IDs ON CELL PHONES
>The Finnish government is considering using SIMs -- the subscriber
>information modules inside every cell phone -- to take the place of its
>national identity card, and eventually even a passport. Under the plan, the
>computer chip embedded in every SIM would store personal information,
>transforming the SIM into a person's legal proof of identity. Of course the
>drawback would be what would happen if you lost your phone -- about 9,000
>cell phones are left on the London Underground alone every year. The
>solution, according to Roger Needham, manager of Microsoft's British
>research lab, is to store the information on secure servers accessible via
>a WAP connection to the Web. The SIM in this case would store only a
>personal identifier -- an encryption key -- that the owner would have to
>punch in a PIN to use. The Finnish government is already taking the
>initiative with a national technical standard called FINEID. Currently
>FINEID uses a smart card and a card reader attached to a PC, but the plan
>is to migrate to an SIM, says Vesa Vatka of the Finnish Population Register
>Center in Helsinki. (New Scientist)
