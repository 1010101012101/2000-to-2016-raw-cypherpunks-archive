Indeed. 

These Wave-oids have been at this book-entry-to-the-screen-buffer
world-domination nonsense since before Adam, or at least I :-), was a
cypherpunk: <http://www.phuber.com/huber/forbes/101893.html>. They've
been delisted and re-listed so many times it's a wonder that their
shorts don't have carpal tunnel in their sell-button fingers...

One can imagine all these financial-crypto-clueless idiots standing
around in their silver-lame Nehru-suits with their pinkies at the
corners of their mouths.

Of course, as a famous basketball-player-turned-senator said once,
"It's bad luck to be behind at the end of the game."

And so, boys and girls, the game of geek-versus-Fed continues
apace...

Cheers,
RAH
