I think there's a lot in the game to that.  He *will* resign,
he won't be fired :-)

That has nothing to do with it.  The pentagon had a choice, fire
Poindexter or lose all of DARPA.  DARPA  has a lot of cool programs that
are too important to lose, and Poindexter was giving them bad publicity.

Poindexter was no big deal.  For the pentagon it is a big deal.  So they
rid themselves of Poindexter and save everything else.  Even Rumsfeld can
understand that :-)

Patience, persistence, truth,
