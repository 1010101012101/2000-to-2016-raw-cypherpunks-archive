>
>   Reality television takes an exciting turn when TBS Superstation presents
the
>   first-ever in-depth original entertainment production detailing
authentic
>   combat-readiness military exercises.
>
>   WAR GAMES offers a rare, up-close look at military competitions
including
>   air-to-air dogfighting, submarine warfare, urban combat and "live fire"
>   fighting
>   exercises.
>
>   This action-packed, two-hour original special, premiering in March 2001,
is
>   being
>   produced with the full cooperation of the United States military.
>
>   "The unprecedented access and cooperation that TBS Superstation's
cameras
>   have received from the U.S. military will take our viewers to the front
>   lines of
>   authentic combat exercises," said Jim Head, senior vice president of
> original
>   programming for the Superstation. "WAR GAMES fits perfectly into our
> strategy
>   of providing exciting, high-profile and provocative original programming
> that
>   appeals to the Regular Guy and the people in his life. We are already
>   looking at
>   this special as a pilot for a potential series."
>
>   WAR GAMES will present four different combat scenarios, with
commentators
>   reporting from each competition, as well as personal stories from the
>   participating military troops.
>
>   The following are descriptions of the four games scheduled to be
included
>   in TBS
>   Superstation's WAR GAMES:
>
>   RED FLAG
>
>   After Vietnam, the United States Air Force created Red Flag, an
air-to-air
> and
>   air-to-ground military exercise designed to better train pilots for the
>   high-stress,
>   high-action situations they often confront in combat. In this scenario,
> pilots
>   engage in a dogfight over the Nevada desert before diving into "enemy"
>   territory in
>   an attempt to bomb an airfield.
>
>   WOLF HUNT
>
>   Enemy submarines claimed 80 percent of the ships sunk in World War
II--and
>   the threat of subs is just as potent today. The United States Navy
conducts
>   critical anti-submarine warfare exercises off the coast of San Diego in
this
>   exercise, in which two helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft must
locate
> and
>   sink an enemy submarine before the submarine sinks our battleship.
>
>   JRTC (Joint Readiness Training Center)
>
>   Increasingly, military operations are conducted in cities and towns.
>   Recognizing
>   this, the United States Army built an entire mock town to train troops
in
>   urbanized warfare. In this realistic 11-day war game, U.S. forces must
> rescue a
>   town and its residents from hostile forces, as soldiers are exposed to
the
>   hazards of urbanized warfare, including civilians and media on the field
of
>   battle.
>
>   CAX (COMBINED ARMED EXERCISES)
>
>   CAX features the United States Marine Corps in a three-day, locked and
> loaded,
>   live-fire deployment involving thousands of Marines. In this exercise,
> Marines
>   must first assault and occupy enemy territory, then defend it against a
>   counter-assault in the California desert.
>
>   Executive producers for War Games are J.J. Jamieson and John Barchilon.
Mike
