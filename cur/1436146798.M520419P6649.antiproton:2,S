Way back in the beginning I said an ever growing block chain would cause 
unacceptable costs and inconvenience, and lo and behold, it is causing 
substantial and ever growing costs and inconvenience.

Of course, restraining the block chain to manageable growth without 
losing other good characteristics is inherently hard, and it was a lot 
easier for me to point at the problem than to fix it.
