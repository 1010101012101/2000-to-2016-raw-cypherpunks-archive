Ultimately it's impossible to have security where one side is a machine
handling many live customers. Whatever central machine does can be emulated or
simulated in human's eyes - by subverting the machine itself, the transport
mechanism or the client machine/software. This is the ultimate limit of
squeezing out middlemen (aka e-commerce.)

The security is proportional to wetware cycles burned per transaction.
