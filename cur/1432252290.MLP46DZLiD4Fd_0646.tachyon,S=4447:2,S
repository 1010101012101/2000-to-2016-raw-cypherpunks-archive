In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to 
attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed 
herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.

You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively 
have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are 
males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and 
expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office 
for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for 
a second pilot to do the actual piloting.

You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that 
the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, 
and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built 
for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they 
have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, 
in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was 
the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings 
regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.

Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting 
with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of 
potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, 
such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia 
Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks 
for real, killing them.

In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as 
male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions 
will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. 
References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. 
But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier 
planes.
