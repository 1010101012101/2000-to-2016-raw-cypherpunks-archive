Keith Winstein and Marc Horowitz implemented DeCSS in perl.

	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/qrpff-fast.pl

There is some description of using it here:

	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/

Does anyone have test vectors for DeCSS.  If one had a DVD player and a
content scrambled DVD one could use the example they give:

% /mnt/dvd/VOB_FILE_NAME | qrpff 153 2 8 105 225 | \
extract_mpeg2 | mpeg2dec -

Someone want to extract a few frames from a DVD and include the associated
plaintext for testing purposes.  I'd like to try reduce the size of the
program.
