Personally I think having to expose the phone number of a smartphone to
another user to establish a chat is an incredible security risk in the
short and long run and leads to all sorts of metadata harvesting of your
unencrypted info. It appears one should keep a low-budget smartphone for
that use instead of their main number for better persec.=20

I questioned Morgan Mayhem (Intercept's sysadmin/cybersec guy) about
that when he broached how secure signal is (he's one of the developers)
on his twitter feed. Never got a reply.

Telegram allows the use of an @name instead of exposing your number if
you set up an account but I'm unsure what happens when a connection is
established and the contact is added to you contact list
