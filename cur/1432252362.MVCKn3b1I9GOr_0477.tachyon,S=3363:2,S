                Presently, FLUENT can translate Chinese, Korean,
                 Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian,
                 Reuters says.

                 The omissions are almost as telling as the languages
                 included. What, no Japanese, no Arabic, no Spanish, no
                 Hebrew, no French? Laotian and Navajo we can
                 understand, but what have we here? Laziness,
                 discrimination, or misplaced trust?

                 You make the call. ®

Silly lad, you believe the list is complete??

I thought reporters were supposed to think critically.

"Disinfo = Diplomacy"
