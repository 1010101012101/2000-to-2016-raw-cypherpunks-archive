There are a couple of projects like that right now, but I do no know
how much action they are seeing.

https://github.com/sanity/tahrir

https://github.com/endymion/sneakernet

Project Byzantium has considered using this to synch the datastores of
unlinked meshes via sneakernet:
https://github.com/campadrenalin/EJTP-lib-python

Also, the FidoNET protocol is alive and well:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/fidoip/

http://control.zcu.cz/~flidr/fido/

That would be doable.  I am playing with something like that for CouchDB.

Say, if originating nodes get their packets back (the distribution
cycle is complete), and expire the message?

That might not be a good idea.  Not only would it result in a list
that can be used to identify nodes, but it also increases overhead and
complexity.  Perhaps 'best effort' is the way to go about this.

It would be useful to determine the capabilities of existing
implementations to see how  many reimplementations of wheels could be
avoided.
