Police hunt for rabid mice

AUTHORITIES in the Lithuanian city of Siauliai are searching for 23
rabies-infected mice that disappeared from a research laboratory. Police say
the mice, which disappeared on Monday, were either stolen to sell as pet
food for snakes or that someone stole the containers holding them without
realising what was inside. The city's veterinary service head said: "This is
a very dangerous situation. The mice must be brought back, dead or alive."
