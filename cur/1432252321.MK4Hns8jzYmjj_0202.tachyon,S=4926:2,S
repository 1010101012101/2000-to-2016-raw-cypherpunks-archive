Easy there Bill.  I specifically ignored the "suggestion" that he be "kicked
off the list".  If there's anything you should know by know, it's that such
a proposal would be *totally* out of character for me.

Please note that (as I have stated a long time ago), procmail and mattd have
long since been acquainted ;-)

Note that _I_ do not reply to his stuff, as I never see it directly.

To make a long story short Bill, what I *meant* was *exactly* what I said, no
more, and no less: "Can't we just kick him: period?".  The suggestion was to
implant a foot in his ass - literally.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
