Airlines would only be allowed to provide passengers with plastic knives
and butter knives to eat their meals, an FAA spokesman said.
http://sg.news.yahoo.com/010912/1/1fwyc.html	

Also: only crayons, no pens or pencils.  All PDAs, with their sharp
styli
and brittle glass displays, will be replaced with Etch-a-Sketch toys.

Also all fingernails must be trimmed to 2mm past the fingerpad, this
must be done
before passing through security as nailclippers with nailfiles will not
be permitted on board, 
either.

Good thing none of the Martyr Airlines dudes shorted out their laptop
batteries to make a diversion...

......
 
Jeezus guys, get a clue.  You can't pull the same stunt twice, whether
its a 'normal' hijacking
which turns out to be different (so much for passenger compliance..), or
the latest 
social-engineering virus trick.  The rubes *do* learn.

The next time, its a bottle of Japanese Subway Perfume.

Alas, a lot less eye candy with that.
