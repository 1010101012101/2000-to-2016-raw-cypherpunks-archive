An extreme rightwing Web page lists progressive, radical and cultural 
groups in Montreal and Quebec City, calling them enemies of our people and 
our race. The list includes addresses, telephone numbers and, in some 
cases, specific names. There are also photos of individuals and buildings.
The content of the La Droite Nationaliste Website (Nationalist Right) is 
entirely in French. The site promotes itself as an information index and 
news source for the francophone, nationalist world. It boasts of 
referencing 265 sites. While the sites URL isnt always working, La Droite 
Nationaliste was up at the time this story was posted. If you have trouble 
getting it, try again later.
The Website is updated regularly, and contains news and events information 
from all over the world, and links to many other far-right electronic 
bulletins and Websites. It is a well-maintained, comprehensive site. La 
Droite Nationaliste has an e-mail address and a post-office box in Anjou, a 
suburb on the island of Montreal.
But this Web page also features open lists of cultural and left 
organizations from Montreal, Quebec City and elsewhere in Quebec.
Montreal
Translated, this section is called The anti-nationalist file: A small 
address book of anti-national organizations and publications in Montreal. 
The site explains that, With this little address book, we are able to 
denounce those who, in one way or another, block the full realization of 
our destiny. They are in fact the number one enemies.
Here, there are over sixty groups listed  with addresses, phone numbers 
and, in many cases, fax numbers and Web and e-mail addresses. (See La 
fillihre anti-nationaliste at the end of this article for a full list of 
these organizations and publications.)
The addresses are divided into seven sections:
Foreign and Non-European Communities
Jewish Lobby, Zionist Lobby
Pink Lobby, Homosexual Lobby
Anarchist Organizations
Anti-Racist Organizations
Communist Organizations
Institutions like the Jewish Public Library and the Musie du Fier Monde (a 
museum of working-class history in east-end Montreal), as well as 
publications like the Canadian Jewish News and Fugues (a gay and lesbian 
magazine) are included. So are cultural community groups self-defined as 
Black, Caribbean, Jamaican, Asian, Latin American, South Asian, Iranian, 
Haitian, Afro-Canadian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Palestinian and 
Jewish. A refugee support organization, Action Rifugiis Montrial, is also 
listed.
The Pink Lobby, Homosexual Lobby includes gay help lines and discussion 
groups at Concordia and McGill universities. The description of the 
Association of Gay Fathers even specifies the address of the building in 
which its members regularly meet.
The anti-racist section lists Anti-Racist Action (ARA), Skinheads Against 
Racial Prejudice (SHARP) and the Ligue des Droits et Libertis  a very 
mainstream civil liberties organization.
The anarchist and communist sections include some student organizations at 
colleges and universities. The leftwing student group, ASSI (Association 
pour une solidariti syndicale itudiante), receives special attention, with 
twenty individual activists being named (including, in most cases, their 
college-affiliation and course of study).
Other groups mentioned include the CLAC (the Anti-Capitalist Convergence), 
the Comiti des sans-emploi (with some of their members specified), COBP 
(Citizens Opposed to Police Brutality) and various communist and socialist 
parties, as well as anarchist publications and collectives. The site also 
mentions a book publisher, Icosociitis, that produces many radical titles.
Disturbingly, La Droite Nationaliste includes the photos and addresses of 
the Alternative Bookshop, an anarchist infoshop, as well as the 
headquarters of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Quebec (PMLQ). There are also 
photos of two unnamed members of SHARPs, a local rabbi, as well as me.
Another person singled out for attention on the site is UQAM professor and 
anarchist Normand Baillargeon. His office location is specified.
Extra, Extra
The Website also includes so-called anarchist organizations in Quebec City, 
as well as groups in Granby and Drummondville. There are also several 
requests to e-mail information about more anti-national groups.
A glance at the links and information on the Website provides a clear 
portrait of the fascist, racist, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-queer 
and anti-woman views that the site promotes. The links on the Quebec 
section include the MLNQ, an anti-choice group, the Holocaust denying 
Zundelsite, a variety of National Socialist groups as well as the Ku Klux 
Klan of Laval, just north of Montreal.
Other sections on France, Belgium and Switzerland include predictable links 
to far-right parties (such as the Front National and MNR), anti-immigrant 
groups, as well as far-right music links. There is also a section devoted 
to the works of Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson.
There is an updated events section, with far-right events from France, 
Belgium, Great Britain and even the United States.
The news section provides a clear example of the hatred promoted by this 
Website. An item from Zimbabwe refers to African savages. Another news 
item from Serbia positively reports on a brutal racist skinhead attack on 
Belgrades first Gay Pride parade. Referring to the cancellation of other 
parades and conferences by the gay and lesbian community due to the fear of 
attack, the Web page states approvingly: Direct action is sometimes more 
convincing than the words of politicians.
La Droite Nationaliste shows a detailed interest in, and knowledge of, the 
activities of a variety of cultural and left groups in Quebec. It includes 
photos, telephone numbers and addresses, making it easier for rightwing 
extremists who are interested in participating in verbal and physical 
attacks, as well as harassment.

article for rabble news was A Speech Without the Speaker (November 6, 2001).
