Agreed.

In my defense, I was replying to "I'm getting the impression that all
the Snowden stuff that gets 'leaked' to the public has been somehow
approved by the US govt?"

:-)

Agreed, as per above.

These do indeed seem like good outcomes for a totalitarian government.
It also unfortunately reinforces and brings about the predictions of
people like Orwell, Huxley and Zamyatin.

I still can't see that the cost is acceptable, unless:

This is my fear. They've outflanked us by making us think that there is
only one (or a small number of) effective solution(s). We just don't
know yet that it/they isn't/aren't secure.

> * Inflict political pain on rival agencies and political enemies

Again, I'd think that the cost of this one is too high, but I don't
know enough of the internal politics. It does seem to be a very high
price to pay.

I hope that your fourth point above is not correct.
