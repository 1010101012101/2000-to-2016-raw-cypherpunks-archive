If crypto follows the gun model, there will be a lucrative business
bringing crypto-phones into New York. That will follow the US
crypto marketers flooding the globe through immensely flexible
export controls favoring the most criminal leaders kept in
power with US armaments.

In the end, New York is so deeply corrupted, legally and
illegally as Europe Asia Africa Anartica, the crypto controls
will be as great a business as controls on money, taxes,
sex, medicine, religion, education, sports, natsec, above
all, justice.
