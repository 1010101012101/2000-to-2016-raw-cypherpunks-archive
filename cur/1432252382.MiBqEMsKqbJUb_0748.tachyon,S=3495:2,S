Yes, and no. I agree that tactically, he is being smart. Almost too smart:
His lapses of memory, if you read the full Q&A, are both frequent
and useful.

But what's good politics is not necessarily what's right, as is true
in this case. If the nation's top l.e. officer is asked about what
rights Americans should have under the law, I don't expect him
to hedge or quibble or made nice-nice noises to please the Democrats.
