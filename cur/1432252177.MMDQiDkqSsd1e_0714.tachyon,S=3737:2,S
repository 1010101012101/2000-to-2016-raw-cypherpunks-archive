Such a transfer would cause the entire value of the satellite to be taxed
as income to the selling company in at the end of the fiscal year.  Selling
the satellite to an island managed firm for $1 isn't going to fly.  Fair
market value will be assessed at the IRS's sole discretion and subject only
to an (expensive and normally futile) appeal to the U.S. Tax Court.

Bad move.
