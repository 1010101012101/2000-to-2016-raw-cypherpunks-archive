That's true, but it is irrelevant.  As long as insurance companies
and hospitals are privately owned, putting a requirement like this 
one on them constitutes theft of their resources.  If you want to 
have them engaging in charity, set up a charity and solicit money 
instead.  ie, you can ask but you don't have permission to steal.

Everybody dies of something.  Some are likely to die sooner than 
others, due to accidents of birth or extreme lifestyle.  That is 
reality.  I persist in thinking that "freedom" means everybody 
gets to decide how to use his/her own talents and property and how 
to deal with his/her own deficiencies, genetic or otherwise.

I also persist in believing that, as a philosophical point, nobody 
who is *compelled* to do something can be considered a good person 
for doing it.  I also feel that history has shown us that those who 
receive charity compelled from others have never appreciated the 
work and sacrifice that it represents.  Compelled charity is 
morally and emotionally meaningless.
