I've always had trouble with FreeS/WAN breaking at kernel
upgrades, but now that 2.6 is coming we're getting native
IPsec support (albeit FreeS/WAN seems to claim Opportunistic
Encryption won't be supported?).

We seem to have a curious situation here. The majority
of systems out there now support IPsec (NT/Win2K/XP; OS X),
but there's very little interoperability. Particularly,
there is no support for ad hoc encryption as default, without
going through a lot of jumping through hoops (why should I
be required to be able to publish DNS records just to have
an encryption link?).

Are there technical reasons for this situation?
If yes, what is required to enable IPsec default interoperability
at least with open source OSses?
