*possible at all *for them*

I'm trying to argue we need more convenient + secure
services/applications/workflows/etc. because apparently security wasn't
worth it for the reporters.

I'm also aware of the exceedingly detrimental effect copyright law has had
on general filesharing. Somehow information controls, huge dangers to
freedom of speech, are permissible because ideas aren't free but instead
licensable at owner's whims.


Reg backups - I think you have a far better way of managing things than I
do. It was actually on my mind to fix within the week (earlier if I'd have
found a client-side-crypto-cloud-backup-thing). There's no excuse really -
I just kept delaying it because I never /actually/ lost data before (I
always had a backup somewhere). I've never been very systematic about it
and it feels totally off that it isn't already automated in our operating
systems. (/vent... losing data hurts)

I mean so many of them that we do not have much security now. (btw:
geotagging is cool, it's bad for security, but so are all pictures)

I actually lost (a test server's) data before because I crypted it and
locked it up - and forgot the horrendously complicated extra-long passkeys.
Since then I opt for something easier to remember/derive, because
everything else is detrimental to security. Making physical notes means
"import sec.physical" which is a foolhardy proposition.

It makes you slower. Incompatibility makes you slower. Slowness makes you
irrelevant. Slowness equals failure. (depending on how much slower you'll
be, of course) I say this because it sometimes seems strategically so.
