Got another one today with a RAR attachment claiming it was a screen 
shot.  Text is:

Dear Sir
Yesterday you have arrived the amount of $1000 into my account. Of 
course, I do not object, but you probably were mistaken number of the 
account when transferred, and it happens not first time. Please look an 
attached screenshot of all your transfers into my account. I have no 
idea why you transfer money to me, as I do not know you, and I need no 
money. If you were mistaken, I'll return this money to you!
Sincerely.

Nice... what's next?  an egold transfer from a lawyer claiming a long 
lost uncle kicked the bucket and left me a fortune? :-D

Wheee!
