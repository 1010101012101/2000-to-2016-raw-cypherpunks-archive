The really funny thing about this is that if you search through for archives 
I'd be willing to bet you'd get a hundred hits or so for almost exactly the 
quote below.

I've been on and off the list at various times (mostly off because the 
volume of this list eventually buries me in electrons) since about '95 or '96.
Every once in a while this kind of statement is made. Hasn't happened yet.

I've actually enjoying lurking for the past few days as it's been 
entertaining reading. 

FWIW, I'm with Tim on Aimee. She's a fed or closely enough related that she 
might as well be.
