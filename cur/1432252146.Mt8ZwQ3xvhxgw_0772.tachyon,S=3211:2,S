This is somewhat unfair.  Ashcroft's answers were as bland and 
uninformative as possible, because he is being borked.  No matter what he 
said, it will be used against him, so the best bet is to say as little as 
possible.

If he said any good things on privacy, it would be used against him as gun 
issue is.  If he said bad things on privacy, it would be used against him 
as the abortion issue is.
