"During a routine search of his home."

This is becoming more and more common. King George is no doubt 
laughing at how the foolish colonists have created a system worse 
than anything ever imagined during colonial days.

I say so. What a person _writes_ cannot be a crime, no matter how 
repugnant the thoughts may be to others.

That we are sending people off to prison for 10 years for fantasies 
written in their journals shows what kind of society we now live in. 
That there is not an uproar over searching a man's journals "during a 
routine search of his home" shows the situation is probably hopeless.

Lot of Jews in the ACLU, and Jews are well-known to be censorious and 
hateful of liberty (Feinstein, Lieberman, Schumer, the whole qabal).

Already the case with shrinks, at least in many state. Confess a 
fantasy, even an absurd and non-credible fantasy, and "Tarasoff" 
requires the shrink to narc out his or her patient. Here in 
California, psychiatrists, counsellors, and family therapists are 
Agents of the State.

Thoughtcrime.
