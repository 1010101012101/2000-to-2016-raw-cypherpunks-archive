There is not yet any exchange that does not keep meticulous track of
transfers, also due to AML laws.

A meta-blockchain unfuzzer might still work, as the other coin would also
use one. Or there'd be central tracking. Or it would be zerocoin!

As long as zerocoin exists somewhere you can chain-switch (exchange) and
anonymize.

OK, big problem. Zerocoin was designed to help fix that problem, by<br>
minting a zero-knowledge-proof based &#39;coin, but it hasn&#39;t yet been<=
br>
implemented.<br>
<br>
What about simply exchanging different blockchain based coins, though?<br>
Would that not help to &quot;launder&quot; with reasonable efficacy, provid=
ed both<br>
participants use crypto to hide the transaction? From the outside,<br>
transactions occur on both blockchains, but there&#39;s no &quot;data trail=
&quot;<br>
correlating the transactions with one another as there is within each<br>
blockchain.<br>
<br>
So, Alice buys .4 btc from a friend, but knows the friend&#39;s opsec might=
<br>
be poor, or that the transaction may have occurred over a bad channel,<br>
or that the coins were purchased from an exchange that demands valid<br>
phone numbers, etc.: she wants to launder.<br>
<br>
She contacts Bob, a Dogecoin seller, to set up a private exchange. She<br>
asks him to sell her 0.4btc worth of Dogecoin in two transactions of<br>
unequal value (to prevent analysis by exchange rate to ID their<br>
transaction). They conduct the exchange over an encrypted channel.<br>
<br>
>From the outside, someone knows she&#39;s laundering, and just bought<br>

<br>
they&#39;ve lost the scent; she now has 0.4btc worth of Dogecoin, and can<b=

convert that back to btc again in the same way.<br>
