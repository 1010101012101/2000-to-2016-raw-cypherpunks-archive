Hawala networks already use some form of steganography...manipulating 
invoices of goods to hide the transfer of money.

http://www.interpol.int/Public/FinancialCrime/MoneyLaundering/hawala/default.asp

"...many hawala transactions (legitimate and illegitimate) are conducted 
in the context of import/export businesses, the manipulation of 
invoices, as discussed above, is a very common means of settling 
accounts after the transactions have been made."
