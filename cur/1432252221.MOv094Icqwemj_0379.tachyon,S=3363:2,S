MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE - Two laptop computers missing from Gen. Tommy
Franks' headquarters were kept in an ultrasensitive locked and alarmed
security room intended to safeguard some of the military's deepest
secrets in the U.S. war on terrorism, officials said Wednesday.

At least one of the laptops contained highly classified information,
they said.

The room is known in military shorthand as a SCIF, or Secure
Compartmented Information Facility. The government uses them at
installations worldwide and regulates their security features so closely
that voluminous rules have been written on how they are to be built and
protected.

It sits deep inside the building that houses U.S. Central Command
headquarters, which is running the war in Afghanistan and which is
tightly guarded by troops armed with M-16s. The building stands inside
the MacDill Air Force Base perimeter, which is well guarded, too.
