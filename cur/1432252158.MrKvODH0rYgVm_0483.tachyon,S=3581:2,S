French Teen Leads Bin Laden Cheer

The Associated Press
Friday, Oct. 19, 2001; 3:13 p.m. EDT

STRASBOURG, France  A French teen-ager was placed
under investigation after he allegedly organized a
demonstration at his junior high school where students called
out "Long live bin Laden," judicial officials said Friday.

                  A juvenile court judge in Strasbourg placed the
15-year-old
                  under formal investigation  one step short of being
charged 
                  on Thursday for "justifying acts of terrorism," the
officials
                  said.

                  The judge ordered the student to remain under the
                  surveillance of a teacher.

                  For adults, the charge of "justifying acts of
terrorism" can
                  carry up to five years in prison and a $42,000 fine.

                  The teen-ager is believed to have organized a
demonstration
                  Monday at the Lezay-Marnesia school in Strasbourg, in
                  eastern France. About 100 students gathered in the
courtyard,
                  burned a pair of red-white-and-blue underwear and
cried out
                  "Long live (Osama) bin Laden, down with the
Americans."

                  Bin Laden is suspected in the Sept. 11 terror attacks
on the
                  World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
