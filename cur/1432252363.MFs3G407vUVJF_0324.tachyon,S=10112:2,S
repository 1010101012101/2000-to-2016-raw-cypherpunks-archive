the natural vitamins, minerals, and supplements industry.  The
company has a unique relationship with Sears (S), which allows
the company to operate within Sears retail stores and enjoy
unique locations on Sears' mainstream sales floors.  A small
float of approx. 1 million shares will surely drive demand for
the company's stock.  Read below for the complete profile.

- Float (Est): 1,000,000

company specializing in the sale of natural vitamins, minerals,
and supplements as well as health information technologies and
home health care products.  Cetalon is licensed to operate within
Sears retail stores and enjoy unique locations on Sears'
mainstream sales floors - which is a first for Sears which
normally places licensees around the perimeter of their stores,
or in separate locations/buildings entirely.  Cetalon operates in
46 Canadian locations in Sears retail stores and have recently
opened in 10 California stores under the name Sears Health and
Nutrition Centers - five shops are in Southern California and
five shops are in Northern California.   These will act as
prototypes for the Sears U.S. market. 


Cetalon's business model forecasts a rapid expansion into
department stores in the US with products from leading
manufacturers plus a full line of specialty formulated products
to sell under the Company's private brand. The best-trained and
motivated specialists in the industry will provide superior
customer service through our partner retailers full line stores,
taking advantage of their advertising and logistical support. 
The Company also has an alliance with Innovative Botanical
Solutions, a company with a global reputation for innovative
products and superior quality, to supply its private label brand.


These factors coupled with Sears' 63 million strong consumer
base, with a target market of nearly 50% represented, should
bring Sears Health and Nutrition Centers to profitability within
a relatively rapid timeframe, as per the following: 



+>+>+>  COST FOCUS

* Sears Health & Nutrition Centers has been appointed as the sole
Health & Fitness licensee of Sears,  Canada & U.S.A. 

* Sears Corporation will fund all build-outs on behalf   of Sears
Health & Nutrition Centers 

* Sears is contracted to sweep each register and close out the
daily books of Sears Health & Nutrition Centers. Sears handles
all aspects of collection,  cash security, credit card processing
and accounting control 

* Sears Health & Nutrition Centers will benefit from low fixed
operating expenses, with no fixed minimum.  This includes
electricity and all utilities.  Also corporate support such as
(volume discounts,  telephone, postage, advertising expenses) 
can be leveraged to reduce expenses 



+>+>+>  SUMMARY

With Sears' 63 million strong customer base and a booming health
and nutrition market - look for Cetalon to add stores and
increase sales, revenue and shareholder value.  This is a company
on the move!
