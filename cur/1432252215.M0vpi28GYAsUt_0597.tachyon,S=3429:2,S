Old McCamael had a curse,
E-I-E-I-O


I'm trying to figure out the relationship in ol' Cornhole's mind between
Nambla and abortion. I'd think that Nambla would oppose aborting male
fetuses, at least, because in five or six years those fetuses will grow
into sex puppets.

Maybe Cornhole was unsuccessfully "partial-birth" aborted: they sucked
out his brain but he lived anyway.
