Wysak Petro|eum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European
Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in
the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a
fu|l-sized Commercia| Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
milli0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park wil| supply
upwards of 170,000 Mw of e|ectricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,00O tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 2O-year period are estimated at over $45O mi|li0n for a
project this size.

About the EC Ba|tic Renewable Energy Centre

The mission of European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimulate the
deve|opment of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of
re|evant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fi|| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
