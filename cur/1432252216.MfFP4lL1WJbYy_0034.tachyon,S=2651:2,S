Correction:  

After a web search through USPTO, I find that there is another 
company also named Disappearing Inc, on Howard street in San 
Francisco. This is probably the company that was referred to. 

To clarify:  I have done business as "disappearing inc", and I am 
the owner of the domain name "disappearing-inc.com", which I have 
not yet used.

This pisses me off....  now they'll probably try to evict me as 
a cybersquatter.
