'The Jerusalem Post recently interviewed Col. Sharon Afek, formerly deputy
head of the IDF's legal division, who wrote a 149-page treatise on cyber
warfare law - the first treatise of that comprehensiveness by a military
lawyer of his rank and stature.'

http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Analysis-How-Israel-is-dealing-with-cyber-warfares-new-stage-345578

'Many are also asking more strongly than ever: "Is international law still
relevant?" Afek, who views his treatise also as a "bridge" between the pre-
and post-cyber world of war, answers with a resounding "yes," but then goes
further to try to resolve some of the questions of how and where it applies.

One debate in the new wild west of cyberwarfare law is between two schools
of thought about where to draw the line of which cyber operations should be
declared illegal under international law.'
