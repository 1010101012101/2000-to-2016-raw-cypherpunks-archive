Although the british never succeeded in imposing a ruler of 
their choice on Afghanistan, they were highly successful in 
keeping rulers they did not like from ruling Afghanistan.

I predict that the American government will have a go at
imposing a proconsul on Afghanistan, letting the Russians
have a free hand to exterminate the chechens in in return for
the Russians letting America have a free hand to do as it
pleases in Afghanistan.  Whether it succeeds or fails,
taliban will be history.
