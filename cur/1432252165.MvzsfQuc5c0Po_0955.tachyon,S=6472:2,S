Guerilla Open Access Manifesto

> Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep
> it for themselves. The worldbs entire scientific and cultural heritage,
> published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being
> digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read
> the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? Youbll need
> to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.
>
> There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has
> fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights
> away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under
> terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios,
> their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up
> until now will have been lost.
>
> That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read
> the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing
> the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at
> elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global
> South? Itbs outrageous and unacceptable.
>
> bI agree,b many say, bbut what can we do? The companies hold the
> copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and
> itbs perfectly legal b therebs nothing we can do to stop them.b But there
> is something we can, something thatbs already being done: we can fight back.
>
> Those with access to these resources b students, librarians, scientists b
> you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of
> knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not b
> indeed, morally, you cannot b keep this privilege for yourselves. You have
> a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with
> colleagues, filling download requests for friends.
>
> Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You
> have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the
> information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.
>
> But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. Itbs
> called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the
> moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing
> isnbt immoral b itbs a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would
> refuse to let a friend make a copy.
>
> Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which
> they operate require it b their shareholders would revolt at anything less.
> And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving
> them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.
>
> There is no justice in following unjust laws. Itbs time to come into the
> light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our
> opposition to this private theft of public culture.
>
> We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and
> share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright
> and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on
> the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file
> sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.
>
> With enough of us, around the world, webll not just send a strong message
> opposing the privatization of knowledge b webll make it a thing of the
> past. Will you join us?
