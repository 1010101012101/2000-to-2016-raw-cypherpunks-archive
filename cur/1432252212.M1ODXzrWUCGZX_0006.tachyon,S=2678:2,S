Oh, I can do better than that - "Whichever fucking asshole is sending me
unwanted messages needs to stop now."

Shit, they haven't stopped. Why don't people listen when I boss them 
around? 

Maybe trying to shift responsibility for solving my problems to others
via the use of anonymous passive-voice messages (passive-aggressive
voice?) isn't a good strategy after all.

Spam databases which aren't designed to cope with false reports and/or
differences of opinion about what's spam are doomed. On the way to
their doom, they may take some of your inbound mail with them.

The Cloudmark/Vipul's Razor people don't seem interested in describing
their trust metric system in a public forum, so it's hard to say much
about it beyond "apparently it's not working very well."

You might try "man 5 razor-whitelist" if you don't like having cpunks
mail tossed in the trash with the spam.
