Call For Papers

CodeCon is the premier showcase of cutting edge software development. It
is an excellent opportunity for programmers to demonstrate their work and
keep abreast of what's going on in their community.

All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally accompanied
by source code. Presentations must be done by one of the active developers
of
the code in question. We emphasize that demonstrations be of *working*
code.

We hereby solicit papers and demonstrations.

    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls

Presentations will be 45 minutes long, with 15 minutes allocated for
Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.

connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on Windows,
