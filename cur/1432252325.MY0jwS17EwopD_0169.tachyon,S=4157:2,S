With "prior art" in the Austrian economic literature, which I hear is
considerably more interesting.

The term "asymmetric information" refers to a specific situation where you
e.g. do not know a whole lot about what you're buying. Small people
applying for jobs in big companies does not really fit the bill -- you'd
have to be pretty darn stupid to sign a long-term contract for a dayjob
you know nothing about.

Yes, there is a legal quagmire around employer-employee relations. No,
asymmetric information hasn't got a whole lot to do with it.

Sure, unions are good and using coercion to stop them from coming into
being is bad. But that only applies as long as unions are granted no legal
status apart from other voluntary organizations, and participating in a
strike is taken as what it is, a refusal to work. Likely a breach of an
enforceable contract, too. Any "workers' rights" beyond that are something
you'll have a *really hard time* justifying. Asymmetry does not help,
either.
