They are not your resources to redirect, but the resources expended on Tor
are tiny compared to, say, Bitcoin. Or even just Ethereum. This is not a
good argument, and I think it may be motivated by your own personal

should not be surprised when people who do not share those feelings don't
find your arguments based on them compelling.
