An EMBASSY-like CPU security co-processor would have seriously blown the
part cost design constraint on the TPM by an order of magnitude or two.
I am not asserting that security solutions that require special-purpose
CPU functionality are not in the queue, they very much are, but not in
the first phase. This level of functionality has been deferred to a
second phase in which security processing functionality can be moved
into the core CPU, since a second CPU-like part is unjustifiable from a
cost perspective.

Given the length of CPU design cycles and the massive cost of
architecting new functionality into a processor as complex as a modern
CPU, we may or may not see this functionality shipping. Much depends on
how well phase 1 of the TCPA effort fares.
