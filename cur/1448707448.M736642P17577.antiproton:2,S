Yeah, I saw someone like that on television once. He gave an interview
about how he ordered someone's murder, can you believe that? He got to his
position by promising a bunch of lies. He exclaimed, "We got him," when he
first heard that the guy was executed by his henchmen. After he saw the
photo of the dead man, his only thoughts were, "He's dead."
