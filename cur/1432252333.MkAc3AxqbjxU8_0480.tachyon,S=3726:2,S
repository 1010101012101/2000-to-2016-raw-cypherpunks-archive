A Nomen Nescio lectured:

Ah. The "look it up" rule. _May's Law_.

My recital:

-[[We used to hear the expression "Look it up."

-[[When a child asks what a word means, "look it up."

-[[When someone asks where Borneo is located, "look it up."

-[[When a list member asks what a KG-84 is, "look it up."

-[[--Tim May

May's Law stands for the proposition that one should not aggravate Mr. May.

You are smarter than I am. I'm bleeding all over.

Yes. The PLUNK.
