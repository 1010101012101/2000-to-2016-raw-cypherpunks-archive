In another life, I sell technical documents, so I monitor bookseller
lists. This could interest cypherpunks.

Presumably, the reports to be destroyed include everything to do with
crypto. 

If I had the money, I would zip over to the States, visit my favorite
depository library (where the librarians know me and are certain to be
as disgusted by this as I am) and offer to relieve them of anything that
can no longer appear on their shelves. Fill a container with "waste
paper and microfilm" and send it over here.

Dream on, Marc...

Subject: [BI] Goverment asking libraries to destroy government reports

Not only is the government removing much material from its websites it
is 
also asking depository libraries (which are sent government reports
free) to remove and destroy many government reports--because of 
the recent terrorist incidents.

Any comments? Any bookdealers destroying books which they think might be 
useful to terrorists?
