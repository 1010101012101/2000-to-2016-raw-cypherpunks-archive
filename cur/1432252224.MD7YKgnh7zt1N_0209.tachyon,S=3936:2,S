This shouldn't have to be said, but apparently it is necessary.

Piracy - unauthorized copying of copyrighted material - is wrong.
It inherently involves lying, cheating and taking unfair advantage
of others.  Systems like DRM are therefore beneficial when they help to
reduce piracy.  We should all support them, to the extent that this is
their purpose.

When an artist releases a song or some other creative product to the
world, they typically put some conditions on it.  If you want to listen
to and enjoy the song, you are obligated to agree to those conditions.
If you can't accept the conditions, you shouldn't take the creative work.

The artist is under no obligation to release their work.  It is like a
gift to the world.  They are free to put whatever conditions they like
on that gift, and you are free to accept them or not.

If you take the gift, you are agreeing to the conditions.  If you then
violate the stated conditions, such as by sharing the song with others,
you are breaking your agreement.  You become a liar and a cheat.

If you take the song without paying for it, you are again receiving this
gift without following the conditions that were placed on it as part
of the gift being offered.  You are taking advantage of the artist's
creativity without them receiving the compensation they required.

This isn't complicated.  It's just basic ethics.  It's a matter of honesty
and trust.  When someone makes you an offer and you don't find the terms
acceptable, you simply refuse.  You don't take advantage by taking what
they provide and refusing to do your part.  That's cheating.
