(or pranksters). Meanwhile, a congressman called for a global ban on all 
encryption software that failed to include a "backdoor" allowing 
government surveillance, and a senator tacked an amendment onto an 
appropriations bill that would make wiretapping considerably easier. 

Privacy advocates and civil libertarians are perpetually on guard, but 
after Tuesday's deadly airline hijackings, they are faced with a new and
