There are many private mercenaries that don't work for a state.
Organized crime and corporations use private security forces. In fact,
in situations where there is a state but law enforcement does not
exist gangs effectively perform this function. You adhere to a group
wherein your membership is an arbitration agreement that includes
protection in exchange for whatever it is you must do.

In certain ethnic areas private law enforcement is carried out on an
ad-hoc, hierarchical community level wherein citizens don't trust the
police (e.g. "illegal" immigrant enclaves). This is not too far from a
privatization of defense.
