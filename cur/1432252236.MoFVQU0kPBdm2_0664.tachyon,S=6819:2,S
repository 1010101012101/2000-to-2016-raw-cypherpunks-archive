This is about as off-topic as the mold issue. You've been warned.

No. I'm saying if you use bioethanol, biodiesel or oil made from
agricultural products you're milking a negligable fraction of the solar
constant (1.4 kW/m^2 flux hereabouts), even solar constant at the bottom
of this gravity well (varies greatly). Plus, you kill soil, reduce
biodiversity, contaminate ground water, reduce ground water level plus
cause salination in susceptible areas, burn energy for machines,
fertilizer & Co and create waste. There are also less tangible but
nevertheless real factors such as high material fluxes, associated
pollution, perpetuation of Carnot cycle machines and agromafia.

What we need is sufficient control of molecular self-replication that we
can use photons directly for photosynthesis or water photolysis. Before
we'll get that, we'll have to settle for conventional thin-film and
polymer photovoltaics, electrolysis and photoelectrolysis/photosynthesis.
I would think that CuInSe thin film would do very nicely today if
facade-integrated, before we get polymer.

Energy density of ethanol is about half of gasoline. You *can* use it in a
fuel cell or a fuel reformer, but methanol is easier. Methanol <->
synthesis gas conversion is really clean.

So, assuming these people haven't been pulling data straight from their
ass, you have to burn half of the ethanol you would get from a square
meter of a field in order to do it. Not counting the presence of said
field, the agricultural infrastructure and the agrohol plant.

Now this says something else than journeyforever folks said. 8:1 is
something else than 2:1.

Energy efficient as compared to what exactly? Nuke, fossil, photovoltaics,
wind? And, of course, energy is only a very small part of the picture.

Now, it's only 125%. Very strange numbers, these.

I do not refer to the study of Pimenthal, just seat of the pants ecology
and 8th class highschool level physics. I don't have time to google for
this stuff, but I'm sure you'll find enough references as to why
bioethanol and biodiesel are hardly a silver bullet.
