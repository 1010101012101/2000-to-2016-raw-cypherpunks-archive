Jeezus, wtf!  Julian has either finally lost his mind from living in exile 
or someone has gotten to him.  What is this defeatist fuckery?!

Of course we learn to adapt while living under a surveillance, militaristic 
police state - while we use and make the tech that pushes back, and will 
ultimately take it back.

The very fact that the recent atrocities committed by crazy religious 
extremists and other mentally unstable people (including the latest 
delusional asswipe to shoot up a woman's health clinic in my gun-obsessed 
country) were able to be planned and carried out right under their noses 
proves that they're not ubiquitous.  They just like to project that image 
so we will self-censor and cower in fear, as Julian seems to be buying 
into.  Fuck That, I say!

Part of it is just practicality:  the Digital Stasi collects so much 
information that they can't process it all in a timely manner.  Since they 
claim to hoard all encrypted communications (as though they don't hoard 
everything anyway), using existing encryption and other strategies while we 
develop something better will keep these pissant spies busy for quite some 
time.

I'm not a ter'rist, not doing anything particularly interesting or illegal, 
don't really have much I care to hide... and that's exactly why the fucking 
government is not allowed to read my email and track my every move.  
They're proven that their attempt at constant and total surveillance is 
useless for keeping "the homeland" (what a fucking nazi phrase) safe, time 
and again.  They're the ones we need protection from anyway.

Adapt to survive: yes.  Always!  But advising that their cancerous 
surveillance is malignant, that it is too late to stop it, is utter 
bullshit.  I refuse.
