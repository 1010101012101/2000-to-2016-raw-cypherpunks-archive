Actually, machinery and robots will deal with most of these issues.
Not Artificial Intelligence though.
This is because if we create AI to do our bidding then we have created a
new class of slave but by using non-AI machines then we avoid the
consciousness problem.

We have machines to cover the entire supply chain from raw materials to
end user delivery and machines to repair the machines (and of course
machines to repair the repair machines :D ).
This removes the whole market system because if you want it then the
machines will create it for you, for free.
Removing the market system removes any financially based conflict and if
everything is available to everyone for free whenever they want it then
greed/one-upmanship as a problem gets eliminated.

As for how to reach this great state of Nirvana? Its very simple, we
wait for the capitalists to replace all their current set of slaves with
far more efficient machinery to do their work and then we just take over
them :)

Oligarchs and bullies etc become less of an issue due to the removal of
money, leaving just the psychopath types.
These are dealt with by educating our children to be strong and face
down these psychopaths for the good of everyone including themselves
(re-purposing of the patriotism system to simply one of supporting life
and freedom in general).
People will die in these battles but also a deterrence is created by
raising the stakes that any attack on someone is likely to fail or
result in death of the attacker.
Also, we teach everyone that the only justifiable and decent fight is
one of self-defence (not pre-emptive self-defence either).

To peacefully reach this point would take (imho) at least three
generations if everyone on the planet committed to work towards it now.

When people talk of a free market, they are simply looking for a
justification for screwing over other humans. People need to forget the
idea that a free market is fair or decent and if they want a free market
then they need to know that their actions have consequences of suffering
for other living people and they need to square that with their own
conscience rather than try to excuse it away.

I know, unusually non anarcho-captalist views for this list but I am
what I am :P

Cheers,
oshwm.
