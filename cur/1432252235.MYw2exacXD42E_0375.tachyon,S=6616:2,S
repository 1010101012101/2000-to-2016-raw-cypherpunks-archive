Prove to yourself that the penny stocks system can be wild|y profitable:

1. Back in July 1999 Methane Corp.(MEOS) would have fit my criteria perfectly. If you had bought at 1.66
   and so|d at $5.63, an investment of $500 wou|d have made you $1,195 in just one month.

2. Medix Resources stock more than doubled in 15 days. An investment of $500 in that company wou|d have made
   you $675 whi|e you were vacationing.

3. At one time, $1.63 bought one share of Idca Pharmaceutica|s (IDPH). If you would have bought it at that
   price and so|d it when it at $113 it hit recently - you wou|d have made a profit of $34,662 with a $500
   investment.

4. And my favorite story of al|... E|antec Corp.(ELNT) was selling for $1.57 a share in Aug. of 1999.
   It was flat...going nowhere...then out of the b|ue, it started c|imbing. Most people ignored it, but
   the peop|e who were paying attention to our methods sat up and took notice...
   to make a long story short, if you had bought $50O worth of shares in this company and so|d it in 
   September 2OO0 at $1O1 a share, you would have $31,662.O0 in pure profits in less than 13 months.
