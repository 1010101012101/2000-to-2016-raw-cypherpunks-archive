    Where's the source, Faustine? Why would anyone concerned about
personal security want to use something like this? For all anybody
knows, this was put together by some of your friends in NSA to
lull the sheeple with fake security audits -- or maybe it finds
key loggers, just not the ones the feebs install.
   Besides which it only runs on shitty M$-OS, nobody who is even 
the slightest concerned (and has clue) would trust that. If it aint
linux, and ain't opensource, it ain't shit. 
   Building something like this seems like a very cpunkerly thing
to do -- the hardware logger is a question though. Keyboards are cheap, and you
can buy throwaway $15 keyboards just to do keys with. Should we be 
concerned about them going so far as to switch motherobards, and, would
they be able to manufacture the exact MB as what you had with a hardware
key logger built in? Seems improbable -- not impossible, but there are 
a pretty big variety of MBs out there at this point.
