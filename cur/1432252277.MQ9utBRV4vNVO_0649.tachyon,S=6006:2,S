Greetings -

 

I understand you are interested in making some money, and thought

you might be interested in this.

 

A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot

about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend

to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day

activities and it's soon forgotten.

 

The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very

seriously.

 

Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my

sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000

PAID members in my group!

 

As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I

have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had

never promoted?

 

I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking

for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free

sign-ups...like me :)

 

Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my group. This

is a program that I had never worked!

 

All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end

of the month and I would have my position locked in and a

group of 2365 people.

 

You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!

 

I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this

program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!

 

With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.

My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every

month...on time.

 

How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check

out this opportunity and watch your group grow?

 

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  ianroebuck@excite.com   

and write this phrase:

"Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities"

Be sure to include your:

1. First name

2. Last name

3. Email address (if different from above)

Once I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you 

will receive an e-mail from us requesting that you confirm for your FREE Membership.

 

We will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how 
you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.

  

That's all there is to it.

 

Warm regards,

 

Ian

 

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network

marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a

REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...

and finally make real money on the internet.

 

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the

program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free

membership.
