You got those assumptions wrong, actually. But it isn't very intuitive to
begin with, so nothing to feel sad about.

They use a load balancer, where traffic needs to be encrypted. Tor network
- Facebook's Tor node - load balancer - SSL acceleration machine (?) -
Facebook servers. That load balancer might sit outside Facebook's server
halls.

Vanity address. They bruteforced few dozen addresses with the first half
(Facebook*), the second half was one of the lucky outputs.

If you're wondering if this makes Tor weak - not very, but partially yes.
Bruteforcing the full address is waaay harder (about 80 bits), but Tor will
still move forwards to making these addresses longer in the future with
stronger algorithms.

Public announcements while hiding your location?
