You are full of shit.

I do not keep records of my butter purchases -- Why am I supposed to keep records of my ammo purchases?

The only records one is required to keep are those that you claim exist in some filing, for example supporting your tax deductions.

No one keeps the records they should, let alone the records law enforcement would like them to keep, and no one has every been punished for failure to keep such records.

If this law that you have conjured out of your imagination existed, everyone would be punished for it, for everyone has broken it.
