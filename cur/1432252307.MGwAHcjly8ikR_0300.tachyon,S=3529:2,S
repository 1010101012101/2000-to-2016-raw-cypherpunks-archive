What is the impact on behaviour of people when they know they're under constant
scrutiny? Why, if they're treated like criminals and terrorists they will
fullfill that expectation.

What's going to happen next, after this particular cargo cult is introduced?
Why, if you ask suspicious you'll be whisked away for questioning, including
fMRI truth machines. What kind of questions can you eventually expect? Why,
anything for whether you cheated on your tax return, take drugs, are a homosexual
or a pinko cypherpunk.

I don't see how this is going to make things better. I can see how this
is going to make things a whole lot worse.

See, this is why I don't fly.

The system is a complete cargo cult bullshit. It doesn't work.

Now you're starting asking questions. Still find nothing disturbing about
supporting security theater pork-barrel, and complete the transition of free
individuals into cowering serfs? Not to channel Tim May, but people behind
this need killing. Badly.
