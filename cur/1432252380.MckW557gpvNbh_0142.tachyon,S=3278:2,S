 >>Jim Bidzos of RSA, obviously not a disinterested source, claims that not 
only Zimmermann, but anyone using PGP, is at risk. He scoffs at 
Zimmermann's efforts to stay within the letter of the law, charging that 
the use of PGP is "an illegal activity that violates patent and export 
law." Bidzos has written to institutions like Stanford and MIT, informing 
them that any copies of PGP on their computers would put them on the wrong 
side of the law, and he says that the universities have subsequently banned 
PGP.)<< From Wired article on crypto-rebels.(Cypherpunk cover issue)

Jim a friend of yours Peter?

"Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.
