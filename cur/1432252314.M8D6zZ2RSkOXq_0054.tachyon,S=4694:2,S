9th June, 2002. 

Request for  Business Relationship. 

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue 
of its nature as being 
utterly confidential and top secret. We shall be counting on your ability 
and reliability to 
prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business 
transaction 
requiring 
maximum confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are 
interested 
in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently 
trapped in Nigeria. 
In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us 
RECIEVE the 
said trapped funds ABROAD. 

The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late head 
of state, Gen. Sani 
Abacha, 
the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts 
which were 
grossly 
over-invoiced in various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a 
Contract 
Review 
Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which 
are presently 
floating in 
the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). However, due to our position as civil 
servants and 
members of this 
panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have therefore, been 
delegated as a 
matter of 
trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO 
whose ACCOUNT 
the sum 
of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty one Million United States Dollars) WILL BE PAID 
BY 
TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. 
Hence we are writing you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
70% for us (the officials) 
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business. 
Please note that this 
transaction is 100% 
safe in all it's ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your 
account in latest ten (10) 
banking days from 
the date of reciept of the following information by email: A suitable name 
and bank account 
into which the funds can 
be paid. 

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job 
description respectively. 
This way we will use your 
company's name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your 
company name. 

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your 
confidentiality in this 
transaction. 

For security reasons and in order to move forward quickly, please respond to 
me by 
Tel/Fax:234 1 7742619 so I can 
bring you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more 
information as 
to the succcessful conclusion of this project. The best response however, 
would be by 
telephone, so we can 
discuss fully all issues needed to complete this venture in good time, and 
successfully. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours Faithfully, 
Paul Abbas.
