What the hell. A federal judge finally did something that wasn't completely 
cowardly. I'm interested to see how the Bushites will try to subvert this 
situation anyway. Come to think of it, I'd bet they've been brainwashing 
Padilla to blow up something the day after he gets out so they can squelch 
the remaining democratic "loopholes".
