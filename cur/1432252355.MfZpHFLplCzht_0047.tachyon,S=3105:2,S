Hahahaha. Actually, I'm starting to feel sorry for politicans, especially 
the folks in Congress. Think of it: They have such crude tools available to 
them. They can hold hearings or introduce legislation -- that's about it. 
Not much in the way of options. Poor saps. We should provide more creative 
outlets for them.

Thus we get wacky attempts like Sen. Torricelli's 
don't-email-someone-unless-you-want-to-go-to-jail bill I wrote about for 
Wired today.
