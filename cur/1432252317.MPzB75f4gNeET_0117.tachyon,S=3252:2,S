Foreign Policy (Nov 12) - "Senate to Start Sweeping Intel Review This
Month" by @shanewharris:
http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/11/12/senate_to_start_sweeping_intel_review_this_month

Harris, author of _The Watchers_ and not one prone to hyperbole, draws
comparison with the Church-Pike hearings.

> Not everyone had been convinced that Feinstein's promise to investigate the intelligence agencies was more bark than bite. A former senior intelligence official recently told The Cable that he believed the inquiry would be wide-ranging and would uncover more controversial programs that will embarrass the intelligence agencies.
