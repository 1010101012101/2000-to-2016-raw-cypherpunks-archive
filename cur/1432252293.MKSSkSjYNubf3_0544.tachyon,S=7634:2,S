Subject: PGP/MIME implementors: text mode vs. binary mode?

Please forward this message to any implementors of PGP/MIME you are
aware of.



To whom it may concern.

In the ietf-openpgp working group, we are about to finish a revised
version of RFC 2015.  While this looked like an easy task at first
sight, it is not, since OpenPGP breaks traditional pgp's text-mode
signatures.  This message is to solicit further input and comments
from other implementors of PGP/MIME.  (We thought we were done, but
then there were more arguments against the solution we believed to
have found...)

The current draft is draft-ietf-openpgp-mime-04.txt, and available
from: <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-openpgp-mime-04.txt>.

Please direct any answers to this message to the ietf-openpgp
mailing list.  In order to subscribe to that list, send a message to
<ietf-openpgp-request@imc.org> with the single word "subscribe" in
the subject.



The Problem.

To pgp 2 and 5, a text-mode signature meant that line endings were
transformed to a CR-LF sequence, and the result was then hashed.
However, with OpenPGP, preparing a text-mode signature has another
effect: Trailing blanks (and tabs?) are stripped - this is what used
to be done as a clear-sign signature with traditional PGP.  Of
course, this is a bug in the spec, but one which won't be easily
fixed now that all the implementations are out there.


Now, for PGP/MIME, this turns into a really ugly problem: RFC 2015
does not specify which kind of signature to use. However, it does
specify how the signed material should be canonicalized before
hashing.  This method of canonicalization exactly matched what was
done by traditional PGP versions for text mode signatures, which
means that the very same hash value could be used to verify either a
text-mode or a binary-mode signature.  That way, PGP/MIME according
to RFC 2015 and with traditional PGP had the desired one-pass
properties.

With OpenPGP, this construction breaks badly as soon as trailing
white space is involved.  Since it doesn't look right or elegant to
ask implementors of one-pass parsers (if they exist) to calculate
two hashes in parallel, some decision has to be made on the kind of
signature which should be mandated for the future.

I'm listing the choices and the pros and cons I'm seeing:

* text-mode signatures

  + easy to implement if you invoke a command-line tool to which you
    can leave the details of canonicalization.
  - Ian Bell of turnpike.com tells me that it's hard to persuade the
    PGP SDK to produce detached text-mode signatures.
  + the new-style text-mode signatures will nicely ignore any
    whitespace changes which are irrelevant to the message's content
    (When used the right way, MIME is invariant under modifications of
    trailing whitespace.)
  - there are incompatibilities between implementations which use
    text-mode AND leave trailing white space in messages.
  - thus, clients will need additional code in order to avoid
    trailing whitespace (e.g., apply quoted-printable).
  - this will make any clients non-compliant which are using binary
    mode today.

* binary-mode signatures

  + easy to implement if you use the PGP SDK (I'm told).
  + clients are interoperable regardless of the back-end version
    used and regardless of the treatment of trailing whitespace.
  - those people who rely on "pgp -t" will have to add some code to
    pass canonicalized data to the back-end.  In some cases, this
    may badly break things.
  - signatures will break upon changes to trailing white space which
    don't affect the message's content or MIME semantics
  - thus, clients may need additional code in order to avoid
    trailing whitespace (e.g., apply quoted-printable).
  - this will make any clients non-compliant which are using text
    mode today.

Bottom line: The decision what to mandate boils down to the question
what implementors prefer.  And, yes, both alternatives are bad
solutions.

Thus, if you are an implementor of PGP/MIME, please subscribe to the
ietf-openpgp mailing list, and let us know what should be done in
your opinion, and why.  Also, please tell us what mode you are using
nowadays, so we get a more precise impression of what software we
are going to break.


Thanks, and kind regards,
