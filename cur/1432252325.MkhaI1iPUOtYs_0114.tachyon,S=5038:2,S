Dumb Faustine, you usually make sense. I'm an anarchist - I am AGAINST those
in power. (And I don't believe THEY are ever innocent.)

Funny, we wanted that for over 50 years. We were waiting for the Americans
to come and rescue us from the Russians they previously sold us to. Now,
just when I woke up, the US starts to conquer the world... or at least tries
to.

I have an idiot on another list who believes "there should be a law" is the
solution for everything. Laws never did anything. The Constitution is some
words on a paper. It's an idea. It works only as long as politicians fear
it - which they didn't starting at least with Lincoln.

Of course not; they are the cause of your decay. The UNION??? Who is this
idiot? Oh, wait, it's Lincoln. Yeah, that definitely proves it - what was I
thinking?
