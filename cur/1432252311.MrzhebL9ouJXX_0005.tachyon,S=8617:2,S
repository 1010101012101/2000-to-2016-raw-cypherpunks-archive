Yeah, that's a legitimate worry, but one that is far from being black o=
r white=20
(as in: it's really hard to assess the net impact of such a tactic, and=
 how=20
effective it really is).

I would love to see JS disabled by default (blocked via NoScript, which=
 is=20
installed by default in TBB).

Thing is: even with that taken into account, Tor is of great value, as =
it=20
actually *raises the costs* of surveillance; consider:

One of the things I have learnt during the years of my brushing shoulde=
rs with=20
Teh Gummint (public consultations, conferences, etc) is that a huge=20
bureaucracy like a government is bound to have conflicting interests an=
d=20
fund/take conflicting actions.

Governments are not homogeneous, to say the least.

So I can see how a government can fund a tool that is useful for one of=
 the=20
departments or agencies, and which at the same time is detrimental to a=
ctions=20
of some other department or agency.

There's no Huge Plan Or Conspiracy behind it. Just Hanlon's razor, if=20=

anything.

Yup.

Care to elaborate on the "oddly put together" part?
