"Microsoft accidentally leaked the golden keys to the Windows kingdom. The =

s and other devices that are protected by Secure Boot. The most alarming pa=
rt about the leak is that it is believed that it may likely be impossible f=
or Microsoft to fully recover from the leak."
"The leakwas uncovered by two security researchers=C2=A0MY123=C2=A0and=C2=

security flaw allowed malicious entities with admin rights or physical acce=
ss to a device can bypass Secure Boot to not only run other operating syste=
ms (OS) like Linux or Android on the device but also install and execute ro=
otkits and bootkits, at the most deeply penetrated level of the device."
"The researchers wrote: "A backdoor, which MS put in to secure boot because=
 they decided to not let the user turn it off in certain devices, allows fo=
r secure boot to be disabled everywhere! You can see the irony. Also the ir=
ony in that MS themselves provided us several nice 'golden keys' (as the FB=
I would say) for us to use for that purpose."The leak serves as a reminder =
of the potential dangers in security when tech firms are pressured by gover=
nments and law enforcement agencies into producing special keys that can be=
 used by investigators to unlock devices, in the course of criminal investi=
gations."
"About the FBI: are you reading this? If you are, then this is a perfect re=
al world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a 's=
ecure golden key' is very bad!," the duo added."
