I'm just investigating alternative uses for stuff I already need for HBCI (a
kraut homebanking standard). The state of the art (especially for open source
smart card support) looks pretty rudimentary. The Dell Smart Card keyboard
I've got has some CCID drivers which run under Win2k but refuse XP, and
this thing isn't yet properly supported by the Muscle folks or libchipcard2.
We're not even talking about higher order functionality yet (RSA and 3DES),
just dumb data store. Gnucash on Fink doesn't seem to support HBCI at all
yet, not even mentioning smart cards.

What's weird is that the banks aren't pushing this to the customers (readers
are somewhere between 50 and 100 EUR, and the cheapest RSA card some 13 EUR).

The phishing issues aren't yet painful here apparently, due to predominance of
PIN/TAN
(the dead tree variant) in online banking.
