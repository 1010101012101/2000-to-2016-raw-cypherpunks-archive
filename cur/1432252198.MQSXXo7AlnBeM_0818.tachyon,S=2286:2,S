You're being way too unimaginative, or literal, or something.

This is at the discussion stage, and probably will be followed-through 
by others (if at all). The too literal part comes from thinking that 
discussions here mean someone here is going to kill some librarians. 
The too unimaginative part comes from thinking that publicity about the 
idea will not itself have an effect.

The Mob doesn't actually have to kill too many stoolies for it to be 
widely known that ratting can be a very dangerous business.

Maybe Big Brother will create a Witness Relocation Program especially 
for librarians who turn state's evidence.

(But we will still find their families...bawaaahaaahaaa!)
