Insubordination is always grounds for dismissal, unless an
employee is ordered to break the law or expose him or herself to
legally banned workplace hazards.  So Apple could handle
non-cooperation problems without involving the Feds:  If we was
Apple, would we want to piss off a client so big that it is a
lucrative market all its own, just to indulge some ungrateful
non-team-player's personal snit fit?  What would Apple board
member Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO of Northrop
Grumman, say about that?

If Apple receives a Court order or lands a contract that requires
re-purposing staff, they can just hire any skill sets they don't
already have on hand.  If special NDAs or even Federal security
clearances are required, no problem:  If it's a contract matter,
the additional costs are included in the bid; if it's a Court
order, Apple can ask for and most likely receive "reasonable"
compensation for following lawful orders.

"Self destruct?"  It is to laugh.  "Can't work around it?"
Hilarious.

These propositions only work if we assume Apple does not have an
in-house capability to analyze, troubleshoot and re-program its
own hardware, does not have the technical capability to read from
the storage media in its own devices, and lacks the engineering
staff and/or data necessary to alter Apple brand software.  In the
case of any such deficiencies, Apple (or the FBI) can hire any
required reverse-engineering done, under NDA (or gag order).

If Apple did not already do whatever was asked of them with regard
to one iPhone formerly owned by one criminal suspect, the FBI can
bring in the NSA on the basis of mere "suspicion" that the case
may have a link to non-U.S. persons.

Instead we get a legal dispute and minor media sideshow based on a
pile of false assertions by /both/ parties, apparently in
collusion, with the apparent intent of creating a legal precedent
for mandatory back doors in U.S. personal electronics - and/or
public demand for legislation to that effect.

The words "Security Theater" come to mind, but with a stronger
than usual connotation of "Security Propaganda and Disinformation."
