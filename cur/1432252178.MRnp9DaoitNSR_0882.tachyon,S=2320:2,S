Well, just speculation on my part - I am no professional in this area.
However, did he discuss _how_ common it is ?  Just because it is common
does not mean it is the norm.  Further, if your recent vision improvements
leave you now with a level of vision that still represents a retrograde
motion (albeit smaller) since you first got corrected, it could still be
consistent with my uninformed musing.
