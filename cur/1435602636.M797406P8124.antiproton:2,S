This is very close to what I would like to see created;

Identities and friend management:
https://roamingaroundatrandom.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/universal-p2p-addres=
s-book-software-using-namecoin/
PHB's phingerprints (can't find a good reference URL for it)

The data structure of the messages used in discussions:
https://roamingaroundatrandom.wordpress.com/2014/06/01/a-decentralized-hash=
-chained-discussion-system/

The properties that I want to see of the underlying signalling system is
similar to what Telehash does. Does its crypto behave like Axolotl
(supports asymmetric PFS)?

I want a system that is federated like email, except designed to be able to
work on a P2P fashion where everybody runs their own server if they wish,
rather than expecting dedicate servers.

I also want to see capabilities based delegation of tasks, see Tahoe-LAFS
for reference. Giving a server the ability to act as a cache or
store-and-forward server for me should require a signature, allowing it to
route incoming messages on my behalf to various devices under various
keypairs would require a signature, etc... There's many ways to
cryptographically delegate tasks in a revocable way.
