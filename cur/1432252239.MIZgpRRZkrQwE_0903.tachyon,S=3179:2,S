That's what targeted publicity is for -- making sure the right people see
the message and show up (and maybe publish something). While I didn't make
it to the 2001 Berkeley workshop, I know that some of the Freenet
developers were there. ZKS was well-represented. I think the Mojo people
were there, though I could be wrong. That's a start.

Then once everyone's there, the rest is a matter of (non)scheduling and
beer ordering. (well, and Kahlua maybe).

So what I should do now, I guess, is contact the Morpheus team and
convince them to come. maybe submit something if they feel like it.
