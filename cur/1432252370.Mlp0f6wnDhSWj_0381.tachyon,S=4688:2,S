You have realtime cracking farms for *some* ciphers.  I have always 
figured it this way: 

They get two orders of magnitude for being "ahead of the curve"
   in knowledge and technique.
They get five orders of magnitude of speed for custom hardware. 
They get seven orders of magnitude for massively parallel hardware. 

That totals 14 orders of magnitude (and I think that's generous). 

So use keys that are six bytes longer than a "reasonable" opponent 
could crack.  problem solved. 2048-bit RSA is still way out of 
their league.

Interesting.  I thought that was the sort of thing that you could 
tell the people who'd done it because they were the ones who weren't 
allowed to talk about it.
