One of the great long term hopes for nanotechnology is the "cornucopia" or 
StarTrek replicator, a device which can "manufacture" from raw materials 
and information a broad variety of consumables and hard goods.  If it ever 
does come about and is not something centrally controlled and monitored a 
'la Stephenson's Diamond Age, it could usher in an age of individual 
sovereignty the likes of which the world as not known since its transition 
from hunter gatherer to agriculture.  It might also spell the end of economy.
