The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:

Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.

Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.

Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.

QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.
