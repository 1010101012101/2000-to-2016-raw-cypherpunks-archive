Ms. Lynch,

I'm sorry to hear of your discomfiture. I believe I may be able to help in
some small manner.

First off Sean has no input into the operation of SSZ and it's resources.
If you are having a problem with a resource at ssz.com then you should
speak to me.

Let's address each of the problems in turn.

-	You are subscribed to a CDR node, which one?

	If your email says it comes from cypherpunks@ssz.com or
	something similar then you can unsubscribe following the
	instructions at,

	http://einstein.ssz.com/cdr/index.html

	Otherwise you'll need to contact the list admin at the
	site you do get it at. There are currently something in
	the range of six or seven active sites you could be
	subscribed through. They are listed in the above URL.

-	You didn't sign up to the list.

	The SSZ node does not allow 2-party subscriptions. This means
	that your email address can only be (un)subscribed from the
	list from the same address that is being (un)subscribed. A
	party at another address would require manual processing of
	such a request and I haven't had any and don't generaly grant 
	them If you are getting email from SSZ and you did not do it
	yourself,

	Your account is cracked very possibly, somebody has your password
	and is using it. Please contact your ISP or network system
	administration and request information for dealing with such an
	incident.

-	As to reporting this site. To alleviate your sense of injustice
	I can assure you there are several federal and foreign law
	and intelligence agencies monitoring this list.

	Fortunately, the majority of nodes (and SSZ in particular)
	are located in the United States so the legal recourse open
	to you is very limited under US law. I have a lawyer familiar in
	the legal standings, I'd be happy to to provide you his name if
	you're interested in further research into this matter.

Good luck getting your problems straightened out.
