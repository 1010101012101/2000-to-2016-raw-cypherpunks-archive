ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. How would an anarchist society deal with 
sexual crimes? A. The standard answer that many anarchists give when 
confronted with this question is that sexual crimes would decrease in a 
society based on the free expression of sexuality. Unfortunately this 
answer doesn¹t even come close to answering the question asked. Whether a 
more open attitude to sexuality decreases crimes of a sexual nature is 
difficult to say, what is undeniable is that anarchist societies will have 
to deal with sexual predators. If the problem is not discussed and 
guidelines are not set, it¹s probable that sexual crimes will continue to 
be a major problem in an anarchist community. The epidemic of sexual crimes 
that have been and continue to be committed against children have to a 
large degree occurred because adults in a position of authority have had 
almost unlimited power in their dealings with children. This combined with 
easy access to children, communities not willing to even discuss the 
possibility of sexual abuse and a culture of silence which blames the 
victim for the sexual abuse, combine and set the necessary preconditions 
for widespread sexual abuse of children. The problem of sexual abuse isn¹t 
exclusively a patriarchal, heterosexual or homosexual problem, it¹s a 
problem that exists in all cultures where the division of power is a 
problem. The greater the power held by an individual, whether in a family 
setting among workmates or friends in the community or in a 
institutionalised sense, the greater the level of sexual abuse. Ways in 
which sexual abuse can be combated, but not eliminated, include education 
about what is and isn¹t sexual abuse, the breakdown of inequalities between 
individuals whether institutionalised or non-institutionalised, exposure at 
the first hint of a problem and promoting individual financial 
independence. Practical ways of dealing with the possibility of sexual 
abuse include electing or appointing members of the community who act as 
points of first call for potential victims if there is a hint of a problem. 
Individuals within the community having the power to call a meeting to 
discuss a potential problem. The community involved having the power to set 
limits on the freedom individuals have who have been accused and found 
guilty of sexual crimes and long term compulsory counselling. What most 
experts agree on, is that imprisonment does not alter behaviour. In many 
cases imprisonment makes the problem worse as many people imprisoned for 
sexual crimes continue to re-offend when released. Sexual abuse is a 
universal human problem that has dogged all cultures and all societies. 
Those societies that openly discuss the problem break down the inequalities 
that exist between people. They provide an easy framework for reporting the 
problem and attempt to deal with cases of sexual abuse openly and quickly 
incorporate counselling and treatment for offenders, as well as restrict 
re-offenders access to potential victims, are those that have the best 
chance of managing a problem that poses a challenge for all societes 
including anarchist societies.
