Nope. Not at all.

1. Korea we lost by shoving the commies all the way up to the Yalu
river. And then leaving them to fester behind a still-extant DMZ
until they're almost enough of a "nuisance", to lots of people,
including the now-almost-former-communist Chinese to worry over.

2. Vietnam we lost by kicking their asses so badly that our campuses
"revolted", at the behest of a bunch of marxists. Whereupon we packed
up, partied for about 15 years, and killed their communist sugar
daddies in Moscow with just the *possibility* we could invent
something strategic missile defense, they couldn't copy fast enough.

The Cold War we lost by... Wait a minute. We didn't lose. See 1., and
2., above.

That leaves us, what, John? Grenada? Panama? Hell, Columbia? Oh.
Right. Lebanon. Tell ya what. Let's start the clock on this war at,
say, the assasination of Bobby Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan, include the
Beiruit truck bombing by reference as a battle, and see how we stand
in a decade or so, shall we?

C'mon, John. Think faster, or something.

Cheers,
RAH
