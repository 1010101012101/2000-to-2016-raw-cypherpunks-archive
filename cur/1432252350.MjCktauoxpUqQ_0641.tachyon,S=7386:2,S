You must mean non-commercial users since substantial number, probably a 
majority of commercial servers run this crud.

Are there good free one's?

Why?

But these are likely to be the most difficult to find and persist.  I think 
its a bad idea to hinge remailer network improvements on the participation 
of deep pocket parties who need convincing that this is a ideological fight 
they should take on and risk their resources and public image upon.

I'll look into this and report.

These restrictive ISP policies are almost always aimed at web hosting and 
mail and rarely against other ports or services (e.g., P2P) which are major 
driving forces for consumers purchasing broadband connections.  As for the 
judgement of whether something is wise I would love the remailer network to 
work as even as well as Gnutella or Freenet.

I see no need to follow only one path which might become a dead end.

I think architectures which lower the bar should be equally be 
explored.  Alternatives are the life blood of any business 
strategy.  Commitment to a single avenue increases risks.

Excellent.

If clients generate message digests for each link in the daisy chain then 
the Web interface to the remailers could enable automated checking whether 
a message was received and successfully processed by each 
remailer.  Provacy could be maintained by having the remailer response 
include all MDs for some client selected/fixed window.

Well certainly the few brave operators we currently have.
