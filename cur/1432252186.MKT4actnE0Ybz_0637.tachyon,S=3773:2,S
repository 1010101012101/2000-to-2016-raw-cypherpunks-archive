"...As recent events demonstrated, increased safety devices are needed to 
protect our pilots, children, teachers, managers, doctors, and government 
employees. The Insta-Brace™ is a secure, low cost, low visibility, and 
highly effective tool which provides a true physical barrier to attackers. 
At the first sign of trouble, only the Insta-Brace, with its stainless 
steel, aircraft strength cable and unique "occupant key," preserves people 
from harm until help arrives..."
Remember to plan ahead,plenty of ammo,plenty of water.
