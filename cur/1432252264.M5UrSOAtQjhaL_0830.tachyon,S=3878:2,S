The WTO is under attack both from anti capitalists and pro 
capitalists.  The anti capitalists are attacking it physically, with 
stones.  The pro capitalists are using more sophisticated weapons, 
the "trite, shallow and supercial" arguments he dismisses.

The pro capitalists are arguing that the multilateral approach to 
freeing trade has failed, as now too many people are looking for a 
gravy train in international regulation, and the solution is unilateral 
free trade policies, like those implemented by Singapore and Hong 
Kong -- that the WTO is beginning to be harmful, rather than 
helpful, for free trade.
