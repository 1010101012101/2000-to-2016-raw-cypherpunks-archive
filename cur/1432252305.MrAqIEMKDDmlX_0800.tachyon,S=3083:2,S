Posters to the cypherpunks list can be divided into idiots and others.
Idiots seldom contribute anything useful and love to fasten onto threads
which require no more than their uninformed opinions.  Interestingly,
many of the idiots work at low-paying jobs like system administration,
and several of them are unemployed.

The lists below can't cover everyone, but here is a sampling of recent
posters.  Note: if you are an idiot, you may not like being informed
of this fact.  Nevertheless you will find few non-idiots who will disagree
with your classification.  Go ahead and ask for anyone on the non-idiots
list to vouch for you, if you have the balls.
