NEW YORK(Reuters) -- Among almost 1,000 people being held in the United
States in connection with the hijacked-airliner attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon are people who made congratulatory telephone calls
minutes later, The New York Times reported in Sunday editions. 

Although transcripts of the phone calls have not been made available, the
Times reports that officials have said some of the calls were
"congratulatory, even gloating." 

These suspected associates of Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden's al
Qaeda organization are among 977 people held on various charges related to
the September 11 attacks, which killed almost 5,000 people in New York,
Washington and Pennsylvania. 

The paper said it had been unable to determine whether those who made the
jubilant calls were participants in the hijack plot or merely rejoicing
over the attacks. 

FBI agents intercepted telephone calls, moved in and made arrests, holding
the bulk of those arrested on immigration or criminal violations and a
smaller group on material witness warrants, the newspaper reported. 

Their identities and those of most of the people being held have not been
released by the Justice Department. 

The newspaper said officials would not say how many people were detained
through the telephone intercepts, nor would they discuss evidence that any
of them proved to be members of the group organized by bin Laden,
Washington's prime suspect in the attacks.

The obvious questions that come to mind are (1) How is it that the FBI was
listening in on the calls of a thousand people at that time, and, (2) with
this story in hand, how many of these poor victims will try to assert
their [obviously violated] 1st A rights?

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
