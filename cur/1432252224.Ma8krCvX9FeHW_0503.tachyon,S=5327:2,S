Bah. If you've always found that the women who are willing to sleep with you are
irritating, at odds with your emotional temperament and after your money, why
not spare yourself all the headaches and schedule appointments with an escort,
maid service and sperm bank? Seriously, doing a cold-eyed cost/benefit analysis
might save you some real misery in the long run. That so many people are driven
to go through the motions of the very things that bring them the most
unhappiness is a real shame.

Or else, you could keep always looking for a woman who has a view of things
more to your liking. If you're the kind of man who posts here, I can't imagine
you'd have much in common with "average people" anyway. So why fall back on
citing the flaws of the average woman (which, incidentally, I'm not denying) in
this case.

Who said anything about noble? There are more than enough flavors of
psychological pathology to go around--but of the infinite number of problems
that can come from dating a woman as strong-willed and unsentimental as you
are, being whinily pressured to measure up to an imaginary ideal just isn't one
of them.

But nobody's forcing you to shell out cash to goldiggers and breeders: find a
woman who doesn't buy into either scenario and you're in business. They're
certainly out there, just a lot harder to find.

It doesn't take a judgment by society at large to realize that some
people really are better off alone instead of inflicting their destructive
fucked-up personality on others (psychotics, alcoholics, etc). On the other
hand, if more people refused to cave in to societal pressures and thought about
what they really wanted to do with their lives (instead of blindly falling into
the "spouse, family, 9 to 5 job" trap out of conformism and a fear of the
unknown) it would be a great thing.
