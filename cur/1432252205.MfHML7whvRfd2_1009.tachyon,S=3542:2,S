But how do you know they've entered the anonymous system?  If you are
already being pursued by your antagonist, *and* you have been personally
identified, then you have trouble you can't solve by any current
software-based security technology.

If you have not been personally identified, then your antagonist must either
personally identify you or monitor all possible remailer network entrances.
Monitoring all remailer network entrances can be done, but it is not for the
weak of wallet.  Even large governments do not have unlimited resources --
they must pick and choose their targets, rather than trying to go after
everyone.  The Soviet government and its puppet states encouraged people to
turn each other in just so they didn't have to pay for 50% of the population
to watch the other 50%.  Large resources != infinite resources.
