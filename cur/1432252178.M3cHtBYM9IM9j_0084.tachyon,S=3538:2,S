Like that one-degree of separation is comforting...

Your face might be recognized later.  Willing to shave for the
transmission and then go on vacation to regrow the mane?

Bingo.  Use a rented car.  Or better, stolen :-)

Why bother even establishing one?  Simply use a fake name and domain
that your SMTP server takes.  Works for me :-) [1] though I don't get
personal
replies -not something you want anyway for your task.

[1] Though header-stripping lne.com can trace me ---real anonymity would
require b) or c)
or a trusted a) (only without my end being observed before the fact).

Or treat your fixed-MAC card as a one-time-use disposable and torch the
thing.
Along with the laptop, probably.   Separately.
