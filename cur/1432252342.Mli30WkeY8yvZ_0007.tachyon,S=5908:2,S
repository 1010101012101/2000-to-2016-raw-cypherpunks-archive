Hi Bob,

Can you pass this on to the appropriate lists, thanks.



The 2nd Annual Digital Identity Forum will be held in London on November 7th
and 8th 2001.

The Forum is sponsored by Hitachi, with additional help from NCipher and our
supporting publications: Net Profit and Finance on Windows.

The goal of the Forum is to share knowledge in the whole field of digital
identity: not just the technical aspects of PKI and the like, but the
business and social aspects that will shape this emerging field. The
speakers will therefore include legal personnel, IT specialists, an
economist, business people, a psychologist and others.

Confirmed speakers include:
John Bullard of Identrus (US/UK).
Stefan Brands of McGill University (Canada).
John Noakes of Microsoft (UK).
Alan Asay of Bolero (UK).
Psychologist Kristina Downing Orr (UK).
Steve Bowbrick of Another.com (UK).
John Borking, Data Protection Commissioner for The Netherlands (NL).
Economist John Browning, former editor of Wired UK (UK).
Enrique Mazon of SafeLayer (Spain).
David Jeal of Vodafone (UK).
Dave Wentker of Visa (US).
Peter Cattaneo of Sun Microsystems (US).
Mike Dell of Neurodynamics (UK).
Jon Matonis of Hush Communications (Eire).
Caspar Bowden of Foundation for Information Policy Research (UK).

It is an excellent opportunity to meet some interesting people working in
the field and, hopefully, get exposure to some different ways of thinking
about the issues in the Digital Identity field. We always strive to bring
together diverse interests to stimulate genuine debate and valuable
discussion.

As is traditional at the Consult Hyperion Fora, the first day will end with
champagne round tables to discuss a selection of interesting issues. The
round table hosts will include Nicko van Someren of NCipher and David Birch
of Consult Hyperion.

For more information, see http://www.digitalidforum.com/ or contact David
Birch at Consult Hyperion <d@consult.hyperion.co.uk> directly.

The Digital Identity Forum is a not-for-profit event and any surplus
generated will go to local charities. Thanks to the generosity of our
sponsors and delegates, in recent years we have been able to support:
The Pond Meadow school for children with severe disabilities, Guildford.
The International Myeloma Foundation, Edinburgh.
The Fountain Centre for Palliative Cancer Care, Guildford.
