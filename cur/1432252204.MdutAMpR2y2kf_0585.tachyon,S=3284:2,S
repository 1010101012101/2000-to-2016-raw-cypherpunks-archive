I posted a list half a dozen years ago of "enemies of the people." 
Quakers, Mormons, homosexuals, Protestants, Catholics, and on and 
on...my CFP slide listed about a hundred.

Search engines may turn it up. I would do the search myself, except I'm 
fed up with posting such information and not even having twits like 
Aimee Farr even read the oldest and most basic documents. (Her recent 
horrified reaction to very basic points is illustratative of her 
ignorance.)
