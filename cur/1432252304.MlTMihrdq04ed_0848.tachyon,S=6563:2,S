It's a careful difference between banning for everyone, and
banning/regulating that which is under your purview as given
to yourself in law. ('Official' currency... like govt issuing, for paying
taxes with govt, interacting with govt regulated banks, and among
govts, etc. Not for use purposes among private entities such
as people, stores, employment, etc).

Are there any countries where banks and/or currency are
independent entities from the government? Their position on
bitcoin would be interesting.

If I were a bank, I'd fight *for* bitcoin so that I could offer wallet,
exchange and retail services for fee, market the banks mining
operations as investments, etc. Lots of money to be made there.

Eventually maybe no one will care to define 'official', only that
things just work.
