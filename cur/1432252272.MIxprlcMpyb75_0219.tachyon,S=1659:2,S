June 6, 2003  |  WASHINGTON -- A man was arrested outside the Capitol
Friday for
carrying unregistered ammunition in his car, a police spokeswoman said.

Capitol Police spokeswoman Jessica Gissubel said police stopped the car
as it was
traveling on Constitution Avenue on the north side of the Capitol
because it had a
gasoline container strapped to its roof. The man, who was not
identified, voluntarily
handed over the ammunition, described as a shotgun shell. It is illegal
to carry
unregistered ammunition in the District of Columbia.

They can't find WMD, but they can find a dude with a shell in his truck.
