YYYYMMDD is also an option if (in the judgment of the writer) space
is scarce.  Everyone reading this thread should know that already.

Acceptable?  Maybe to a few Europeans.  That's a waste - requires
computing the order of fields, and adds a character in its written
representation.

As shitty as those systems are, you have to wonder whether it's cost
effective to use federal, state, or industry money to fix them when
an M82A1 and some jerk in a Hummer could cause just as much trouble.

Simply because Sir Poulsen used that term to describe a
