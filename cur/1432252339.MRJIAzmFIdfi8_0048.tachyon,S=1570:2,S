The community gardens near where my folks live are an excellent example of 
socialism.

Gardners spend hours all spring and summer tending their plants, hauling water 
in old milk jugs, weeding and fertilizing, just have the  "fruits" of their 
labor stolen by freeloaders or smashed by vandals.

And the saddest lesson is the fact that the garderners come back year after 
year.
