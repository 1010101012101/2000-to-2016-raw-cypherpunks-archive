I suspect that anyone caught by narus sending any sort of unusual
encrypted traffic (i.e. not skype or ssl on port 443), particularly
traffic to a published tor node or to a known mix node, is automatically
put in the "somewhat interesting" bucket.

Thus, the kind of people who can avoid being caught in the dragnet by
using stego have already been caught due to earlier experimentation.

If the NSA has access to ISP subscription records, which current news
reports suggest they do, even changing IPs or ISPs is not enough.  You
have to create a completely new identity, or you have to abuse an open
net connection somewhere.  And open connections like wireless hotspots
are probably already flagged due to interesting traffic coming from them
in the past.
