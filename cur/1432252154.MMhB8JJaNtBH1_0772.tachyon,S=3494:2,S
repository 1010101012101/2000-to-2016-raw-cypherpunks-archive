Am I the only one here that sees something terribly wrong?

AT&T is the bad guy because they hosted a website of an alleged spamer?
AT&T may have seen the "error of their ways" because they are now
performing content based censorship by shutting down the same website (no
SPAM was being sent over their network)? Exactly how far down this
slippery slope should AT&T go?

It is amazing how members of this list can go from cypherpunks to
censorpunks so easily, I guess SPAM is the root passphrase for some
members principles.
