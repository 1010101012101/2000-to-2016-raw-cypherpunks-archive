Don't think we can blame US foreign policy for the Bali
bombing.  Probably relates more to Australian foreign policy
and Singaporean internal policy.

Indonesian muslims were sponsoring terror against Timorese.
Australia let that pass as long as Fretilin was communist, but
when Fretilin swore off communism, Australia intervened,
thereby gaining a vital strategic advantage, in that Timor is
an unsinkable aircraft carrier covering the approaches to
Australia.  This had the effect of rolling back Muslim rule,
something that Bin Laden has told us is a no-no.
