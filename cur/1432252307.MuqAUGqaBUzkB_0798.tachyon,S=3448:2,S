One very common security model is that the security perimeter includes
the PC and you're only concerned with transmission interception.  

MS is swiss cheese but most OS have some weakness in many configs.

How many people actually look at the source of the code they
install on *nix machines???  How many of those who do are actually qualified
to do security reviews?  Cf. recent PGP bugs.

If you're really worried you'd use a sealed PDA (that you can control at
all times) to capture/render and the PC is just for transport.  [This
applies Tim's modularity argument to hardware.]

I'd consider a Starium unit a dedicated PDA in this context.

Of course, both PDA and Starium remain succeptible to shoulder surfing, bugs, 
your windows modulating a laser, etc.
