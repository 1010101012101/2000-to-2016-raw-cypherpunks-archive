I haven't gotten connected with the Cryptoparty movement, but it's 
been really encouraging to have them around.  Apparently there have 
been a bunch of them in Germany recently in response to revelations 
that the Bundeswhatever have been hanging out with the NSA wiretapper gangs.

There has been some tradition around here of baiting trolls for fun, 
but this troll really isn't worth the bother.  We certainly haven't 
had anyone of Detweiler's caliber around in ages.  (If the NSA can 
collect metadata on anybody connected to anybody they already collect 
metadata on, and we'll all Tentacles of Medusa, that means that 
either we're all targets or they've decided that the signal-to-noise 
ratio was too inconsistent.)
