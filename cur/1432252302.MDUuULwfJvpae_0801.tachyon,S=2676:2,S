There is still the prior restraint of having to notify BXA when code is
posted.
 
And there is still the influence of the securty types over export
licensing.

Also there is the recent DeCSS nonsense. Linking is not speech?

So what is interesting to me is not so much crypto export regs as it is
when is something speech and when is it not. I'm pretty much at peace
with my own opinion that I can write and publish in electronic form
anything that I can on paper in any language I please and that nobody
has any business trying to control me. The different treatment of
electronic vs. paper publishing is still open even if the crypto regs
have been tweaked
