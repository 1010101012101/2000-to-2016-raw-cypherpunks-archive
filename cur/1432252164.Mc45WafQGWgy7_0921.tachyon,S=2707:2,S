Interesting turn of events.  I'd have expected porno spammers to blaze this 
new territory.  But then, it seems that the Nigerian spam crew has more time 
to waste.  Reports like the one at http://www.geocities.com/a_kerenx/ tell of 
pulling what is essentially the telemarketer timewaster maneuver on the 
scammers.

Frankly, I'm surprised I haven't yet seen incidents of spammers following up 
via another comm channel to find out why their spam was ignored and/or repeat 
their pitch.  For that matter, with all the First Amendment blather heard 
from spammers, I'd almost expect one of them to argue for proactively 
enforced delivery and some sort of "obligation to read" statute.
