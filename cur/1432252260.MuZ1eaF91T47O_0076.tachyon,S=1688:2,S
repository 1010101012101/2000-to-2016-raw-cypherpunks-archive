Safe Haven works by transmitting a signal in a localised environment
such as a school, swimming pool, office facility or factory, which
"disables the camera functionality of devices in the nearby
environment", the companies claim.

The snag is that Safe Haven technology needs to be integrated at the
time of manufacture into new devices or installed as a Java download
update to suitable equipment already in the market.

"You need to have an approved camera," Blagden admitted, adding that the
incorporation of Sade Haven technology is unlikely to affect handset
prices.
