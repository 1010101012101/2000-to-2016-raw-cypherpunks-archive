Yeah, now that you say it outloud, it does sound pretty funny - but lets 
get real, there's not many people left here these days.  The paucity of 
people laves a paucity of posts, meaning a single troll can completely 
destroy the SNR all by themselves.  Hell, he's one of the most prolific 
posters here now :-/

> Wonder what's going to happen now!

Nothing.  I doubt there's a lot of interest.

So there *are* people who still have jobs?  Or are you working 2 jobs now 
:-)
