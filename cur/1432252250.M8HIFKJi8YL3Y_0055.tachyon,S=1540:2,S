A brief follow-up to my 6 Nov 2002 posting.  I just received a letter from 
the Alameda County Librarian stating that the library system "...has not 
been asked by the FBI to produce any records."  Considering the ethnic 
make-up of the county (many middle eastern aliens) I find this a bit 
difficult to believe.  Have any other list members contacted municipal 
libraries for such information?
