Phil probably means the infrastructure of email is the vul not the
crypto. Crypto alone is sterile, a boy in a bubble which requires
life support which can be assaulted.

Two boys in a bubble cannot make contact except in the same
bubble. End to end encryption is the bubble.

One description of the safest communication is do not
comm, unicate. Into the mountain refuge go thee, hermit,
ruminate thine self to find god ... is unspeakable.

This is not to suggest that every comsec wizard ever on
earth was not bought at birth or sold as idiot savant. Hell, the
essence of comsec is to sell security deception, aka
Typhoid Mary Mensa.

Hence this marketplace.
