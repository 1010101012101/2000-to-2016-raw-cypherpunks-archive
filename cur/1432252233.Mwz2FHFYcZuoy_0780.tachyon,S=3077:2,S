Computer scientists are very few. Most engineering
colleges and teachers emphasis simple on coding. If
you know c/c++/oracle etc.. and good analytical skills
and communication skills- one can get a job in
bangalore if you have a computer engg. degree.

The math education system from schools to colleges is
pathetic. They simply give us the final formula,they
dont bother to derive the  equation or give any
insight or intution of the problem. Most south indian
students are weak at math.

I see Steve Mynott's comment. Thats the cream,who
usually emigrate. You get to see some of the very
best.

no,they don't.These are usual who do diploma. These
people in india  have better practial experience and
aptitude than engineers.
Software engineers are given a proper degree by the
university.

It would mean that bangalore has around 16000 to 17000
programmers.The other 3000 would be computer
scientists.By computer scientists,I mean those people
who has indepth knowledge of theory of algorithms,more
of theorotical computer science.They can present you
with the final algorithm and all the others have to do
is code it.
