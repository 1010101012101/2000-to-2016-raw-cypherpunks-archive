Tonight's 60" had curmudgeon Andy Rooney and some handwriting
experts. They went over a Bush campaign letter that had blue
cursive writing of Dubya. (mass reproduced).

The experts agreed: it was computer generated from a number
of samples of Bush's handwritings.

Anyone familiar with this software?
