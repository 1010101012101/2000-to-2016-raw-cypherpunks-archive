I spent more time exploring links which I previously ignored, expecting them
to be just more random bits.  Here's an interesting explanation, from
http://www.obn.org/generator/uteengl.htm:

[excerpt]:  She plays all roles promising success: manager, advertising
agent, model, trickster or thief. Cornelia Sollfrank steals images, films,
texts and programs on her raids through today's mass media. She snatches
away from servers and services all she needs to replicate the hidden
principles of the net and consumer culture. What might first appear as the
trendy use of authorship models soon turns out to be a bewildering game of
deception and disillusionment, seduction and ethics. Ms. Sollfrank's
"artistic" programs recreate unforeseeable power relationships and hidden
mechanisms, questioning production and responsibility in the Net.  Sooner or
later her seduced or conquered users have to reconsider authorship and their
own ends.
