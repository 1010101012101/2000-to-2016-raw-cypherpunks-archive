The U.S. would have screamed up and down in front of the U.N. and 
threatened severe reprisals if a U.S. prisoner were to have his (or 
her) mouth, hair, and medical exam televised by the Iranians, Syrians, 
Serbians, Iraqis, Panamanians, or any of the other nations we have gone 
to war with.

There are specific clauses which refer to not publically humiliating a 
prisoner. I'm surprised the Agitprop Division didn't show video of 
Saddam taking his first dump while in custody.

Saddam is not a good guy. But this went beyond the pale. I hope the 
next time a U.S. fighter is captured he is shown publically humiliated, 
with an Iranian or Syrian or French doctor forcing his mouth open and 
checking his hair for lice. The U.S. would be in no position to 
complain. (But they would, of course.)

But, what can one expect of a country which refers to its own 
terrorists who blow up commercial Cuban planes as "freedom fighters" 
and to Palestinians seeking to expel the Zionist Jew invaders as 
"terrorists"?
