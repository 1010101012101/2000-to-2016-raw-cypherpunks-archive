What Andrew said.  And anyone who glibly says that people's lives can rely
on the privacy of their software like that is lying, naive, and/or stupid,
to be blunt.

We had releases in the wild of Tor we knew people were using (and may still
be) that are out of date and we know are security compromised - and we have
no way to reach every one of those people ever (nor would she even with
registered users necessarily) to make them update, and it makes me weep.

So every release you sweat because, if there's a security compromise, an
exploit found, a bug somewhere (and hey even my archgeeks are only human ;)
-- I mean, Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and Andrew are angels.

How many release engineers have to worry if they miss something, people
could get hauled away from their families, tortured, and/or killed?  It may
not be the commonest case of some person using it for pedestrian daily
privacy, but it is our critical case that we must model and plan for - and
understand and empathize with -  and it's thousands of activists,
journalists, and so on.

No glib "yes" answers please.  If you aren't losing sleep you don't get
it.  Write social apps for suburbia, where you can lie or be naive or be
stupid and it won't stand out.  In the "Zynga" community of practice that
seems to be normative at least - not that it's good for society either,
but perhaps it's habit forming, sheep and shepherd.

Don't do "social app" marketing to activists.  Do risk assessment and
education.

Open your source, do not register your users (either they give you real PID
which you can be forced to give up, or it's encouraging them to break TOS
on probably a US email provider - which in any US service makes any
activist a felon under the US law Aaron Swartz was accused under - this is
my current area of research).

Yrs,
