A 1 watt IR laser diode used for burning wood.  They show up on eBay
for ~$100.    Might start a fire though :-)   Also has pointing issues.

Regular tungsten driven to red but not bright, with a piece of
low-pass filtering glass over it.  You can't get rapid modulation
with tungsten, of course, but a few Hz is possible.

Years ago IR leds on baseball caps were posited for defeating
certain (eg ATM) cameras.  Don't know if they worked.
