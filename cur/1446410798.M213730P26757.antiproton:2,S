	Ha. That's a funny remark because I was just thinking that AP

	*And* willing to do it. See, two different things are
	getting mixed. 

	One thing is a market for hitmen who theoretically can kill any
	target (hollywood-like...). IF the hitmen exist, then in
	principle you can hire them and get the job done. 

	A rather different thing is the assumption that you can turn
	members of the official mafia into 'traitors' by offering them
	enough money.

	Evidence? Regardless, the issue is how many traitors you can
	buy. Even if 9 out of 10 do it for money, what matters is
	the absolute number of potential traitors, not the ratio.

	Right. And there isn't an AP system in place right now so I
	cant really compare. I take my mentioning him back.
