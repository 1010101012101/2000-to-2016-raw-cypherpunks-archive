I like this scenario: Adam places his copyrighted content on his web site. His friend, Eve, 
violates his copyright and places Adam's copyrighted content on her site. Hollywood downloads the 
copyright-infringing content from Eve's site. Eve confesses that Hollywood did so, in a good faith 
effort to repent from her copyright infringement. Now Adam hacks Hollywood, as authorized by the 
proposed law. Lawsuits all around.
