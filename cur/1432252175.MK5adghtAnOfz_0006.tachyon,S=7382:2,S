Yes, because people do not understand why it is important. And it is not 
limited to the (let's call it) "digital domain", look what's happening in 
retail. Just try *not* buying Unilever, for example...

We need more than that. We need to understand -- yes, us, the tech community 
-- that for people to use decentralised services, these services must, 
absolutely must!, be compatible and interoperable.

Case in point: you can talk till you're blue in the mouth about federated 
social web, but even once you get a person convinced to ditch Facebook for it, 
you get The Question -- "So, which one should I use? Diaspora? Friendica? 
StatusNet? Pump.io?"

The proper answer, the answer we *have to* be able to give, is:
"use any of these, they talk to each other".

This is, sadly, not the case. The Not Invented Here syndrome is killing us. 
Look at what moving identi.ca from StatusNet to pump.io did to the federated 
microblogging community...

Consider one idea for getting people to use decentralised social networks 
instead of failbook:
