While it's true the hole would have reduced the cushion impact of breaking
the glass it would not have eliminated it.

NATO says it takes a transfer of approx. 85 Joules to kill.

Figure out the velocity that takes for 15 lbs.. Compare to the velocity
possible in this incidence.

In addition the fact that a previous protestor had put a board through the
window only goes to demonstrate the high level of emotional disruption
these officers were exposed to. Panicking is not justification for making
a wrong decision.

Deadly force was not in any way justified.
