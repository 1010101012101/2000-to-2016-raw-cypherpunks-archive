It is difficult to describe what anarchism is. It is a kind of political 
philosophy. But it has no founder, no standard texts, no political party 
associated with it. And it is hardly ever discussed by philosophers 
themselves. As a political movement it is seen by historians as primarily a 
radical response to industrial capitalism, which developed in Europe 
towards the middle of the last century. Yet as a social perspective 
anarchism has a much longer history. Kenneth Rexroth, for example, in his 
book 'Communalism' traces the history and development of the many attempts 
that have been made throughout recorded history to establish an organic 
community based on non-coercive relationships. For that is what is meant by 
anarchy, not chaos or disorder. The aims and ideas behind these attempts - 
like that of the Digger movement - were always expressed through published 
writings - sermons, analects, dialogues, political tracts, mystical 
writings and the like. These writings of course have historical interest; 
but they are also important to us in helping us to formulate alternatives 
to the ideologies of contemporary capitalism - whether of the liberal or 
statist kind.
One of the earliest of such writings is the short mystical tract entitled 
'Tao Te Ching'. It was written by a Chinese sage called Lao Tzu (the 'old 
philosopher')
Etc.
