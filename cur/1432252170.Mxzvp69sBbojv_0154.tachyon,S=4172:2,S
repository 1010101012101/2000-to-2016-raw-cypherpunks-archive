Here's my theory: some time back in High School, or maybe Junior
High, your least favorite teacher dogmatically asserted that it is
impossible to be a journalist without writing comprehensibly,
and on that day you vowed that you would prove that motherfucker 
wrong if it took the rest of your life.

Dude, you've made your point, and the motherfucker is probably 
dead by now anyway.  Let it be.
