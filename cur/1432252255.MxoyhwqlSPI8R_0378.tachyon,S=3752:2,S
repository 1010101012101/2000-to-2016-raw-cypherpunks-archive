Yes, but our side was using these freedom-fighting tools because we 
were freedom-fighters, not terrorists.

When our side blew up the civilian Air Cubana airplane it was an act of 
freedom fighting, not terrorism.

When our side mined the harbor of Managua, Nicaragua it was an act of 
freedeom fighting, not terrorism. (The Nicaraguan citizens had held a 
democratic election and had elected Daniel Ortega, a socialist, not the 
right-wing drug industrialist we had favored. So we mined their harbor.)

When our side infiltrated Czechlos--whatever--vakia to burn hay lofts 
with the time delay system you describe, or to poison water supplies, 
or to sabotage factories, it was an act of freedom fighting to prove 
that the Czech system could not work. Sort of the CIA's version of 
"Unbearable Lightness of Being."

Remember, when we assassinate and mine and blow up airliners, it's all 
part of the freedom fighting techniques taught at the College of the 
Americas CIA campus.

(As a libertarian, and as one who read "1984" when I was 14 and "Atlas 
Shrugged" when I was 16, I am no friend of either socialism or 
communism, so don't misunderstand my comments above to mean that I 
support either Castro or the former USSR satellites, etc. But, 
befitting my exposure to "1984," I despise doublespeak and doublethink 
even more than I dislike Castro, for example. I favor freely trading 
with Cuba as the best way to implement "regime change" there. I believe 
locals need to change their regimes. If they won't, then they deserve 
what they get. There is great "moral hazard" involved in bailing out 
people or nations for their unwillingness to study, to learn, to defend 
themselves, etc. Apply this point to either American negroes and their 
degenerate status or to 1930s Eastern European Jews who were more 
intent on rocking and swaying and reading Torah scriptures than they 
were in preparing.)
