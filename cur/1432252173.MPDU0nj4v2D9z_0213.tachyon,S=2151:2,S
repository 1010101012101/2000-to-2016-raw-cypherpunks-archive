We know torture did not occur, because lots of people have been 
released who were and are extremely hostile to the US, and who 
do not claim torture.

Why do you assert that the US must be guilty unless it can be
proven innocent by extraordinary evidence, but the detainees
must be innocent unless they can be proven guilty by
extraordinary evidence?

Doubtless there are some innocents in Gautenamo - but the usual 
reason they are there is for being foreigners in Afghanistan in 
the middle of a war with no adequate explanation.
