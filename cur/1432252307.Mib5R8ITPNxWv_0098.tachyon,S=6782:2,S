Hi,

In some countries, I have a problem accessing Tor.
It initially seemed that they do not allow DNS lookups for Tor 
servers...I cannot see any servers in my network map (using Vidalia). 
This Network Map in Vidalia is a really nice feature/addition which 
helps me know the intermediary nodes and the bandwidth.

I then changed to use different DNS servers, this way the problem is 
sometimes resolved...but this solution seems dependent on the location 
from which I connect (net cafe, hotel or friend's home)
I'm not totally sure, but it seems that some Tor users are vulnerable to 
DNS based DOS attacks.

BTW, even Tibetan monks know about Tor (I talked to one recently)
