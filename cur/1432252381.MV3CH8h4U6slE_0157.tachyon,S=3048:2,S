I read Korzybski ("general semantics--the map is not the territory") 
around 1970. General systems theory, a la Bertanlanffy, I only read 
enough of to say "So?"

General semantics and general systems theory are not very profound.

Much more interesting to me today is epistemic logic in particular, and 
modal logic in general, and topos theory even more abstractly. However, 
these areas are a bit too abstract for most of the popularizations.

(Such as they are today, where people don't read. I thought things were 
pretty bad when "Analog" and "Scientific American" were the sources, 
now I find that SciAm is a thin, glossy, no content advertisement rag 
and "Analog" is virtually unread. But Eminem be saying "Keep da faith, 
baby!")
