That's not correct. There are lots of albums (aimed at DJ's for example)
that are -NEVER- available except on vinyl. Also, if you'll actually check
the 'yellow book' at your record store you'll find that over the last 4-5
years a growing number of albums are available on CD only; no LP, no
cassette. Start in the techno and related genre. Hint, they are -not- hit
records.

HDTV will come. That you can take to the bank. BUT, that doesn't equate to
the end of NTSC by about 10 to 15 years.
