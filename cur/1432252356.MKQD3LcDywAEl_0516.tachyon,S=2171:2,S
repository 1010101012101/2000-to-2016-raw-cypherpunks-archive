What you are asking about (at Tort in any event) is the legal doctrine of
respondeat superior ("let the master answer") making the "master" liable for
certain acts of the "servant."  An employer is therefore typically liable
for injury to person or property resulting from acts of an employee (See
Generally, Black's Law Dictionary).

There are lots of parallel ways to impose criminal liability in the same
fashion.  The government's favorite is generally the rather notorious
concept of "conspiracy."
