* PGP opens up complete encryption source code
September 7th, 2001

One of the first encryption products is made available to all.  PGP
Security -- a division of Network Associates that has been criticised in
the past for being too proprietary -- has made available the electronic
distribution of its complete source code for the PGPsdk, its cryptographic
toolkit. PGP, which was one of the world's first encryption products and a
de facto standard for encryption, is the foundation of all PGP Desktop,
Wireless and Server products.  The release of the source code will provide
academic researchers and cryptographers the ability to review every detail
of PGPsdk's cryptographic features. The move comes a short time after the
US government recently relaxed export regulations on cryptographic source
code, Santa Clara, California-based PGP Security said. All of article.

* Quantum Crypto to the Rescue
September 7th, 2001

This week has been big for cryptography.  It's seen both technical and
theoretical advances in next-generation quantum crypto systems and
technology.  It's seen a prototype enter its testing phase that could send
secret crypto keys through open air to a satellite or across town.
