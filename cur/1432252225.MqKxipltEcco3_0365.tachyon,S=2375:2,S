Let me think about it, and maybe ask some of the list members. The HTML 
that appears on the web page is sanitized a bit to prevent address 
harvesting. Not that c-punks' addresses are that hard to obtain other 
ways, but when I started the archive several people emphatically stated 
that they wanted the sanitizing.

Maybe I'll write a short script to sanitize the addresses in the mbox. 
That'll take a while to develop, to make sure I don't miss anything and 
because my spare time is limited for the next month and a half.

If I do make the mboxes available, they'll be available as .gz's off my 
top cypherpunks page. I'll post to the list if I do it.


List members: any preferences?
