Not good enough, I'm afraid. As Tim said, if the authorities in an
authoritarian regime _suspect_ secrets are being passed they have
"probable cause" to break out the jumper cables. Unless the holder of an
incomplete secret is willing to spill his guts literally rather than
figuratively, his group doesn't benefit from a secret which can be
detected but not read.
