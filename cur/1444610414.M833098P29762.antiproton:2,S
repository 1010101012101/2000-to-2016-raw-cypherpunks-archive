Cryptome is run by a crank who refuses to use HTTPS and thinks it's better to just let all the passive observers see completely what is being read by anyone who accesses Cryptome. If you ask him why, you'll get a deluge of crazy.
 
I think the role of Cryptome would be better served by someone who actually wants to use cryptography to secure content delivery. Call me crazy...
 
Cue claims i've been deluded by the CA cabal or don't understand SSL/TLS attacks. I don't care. Fuck your plaintext

Calling bullshit. Mirimirs right, explanation makes no sense. And JYA says netsol won't let him delete the logs but Netsol says logs are disabled by default[https://www.networksolutions.com/support/how-to-enable-download-the-web-logs/] and you have to turn them on.

So how the fuckd this really happen?

Mirimir <mirimir@riseup.net> 
Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?

I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.

But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?

I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.
