Reply-To: serval-project-developers@googlegroups.com

Greetings from Texas.  I am a ham radio operator and I have been 
experimenting with the Serval Mesh by using 2 inexpensive unactivated 
Android smartphones.  I am attempting to use the Serval Mesh through an 
existing HSMM MESH network.  HSMM MESH is an experimental ham radio 
mesh network that uses the first 6 wifi channels in the 2.4 Ghz band.  The 
radios used are older versions of the WRT54G router that have been flashed 
with a new firmware.  There are some awesome communication possibilities 
here, but I do not have the networking skills to do this.  Maybe my idea is 
not possible, but hopefully someone will comment. 
 
 Also as a ham, I can legally use much more power on the 2.4 Ghz band, and 
I have found the Serval Mesh to work very well through a bi directional RF 
amplifier installed between a router and an external antenna.  There is no 
internet connection here.  I am just using the router as a radio repeater.  
Has anyone else tried this?  This would not be using the HSMM MESH as I 
mentioned above, since only one router would be used.  This one router 
repeater could really be useful in emergencies.  Please give me some 
comments on both of these experimental ideas.  Perhaps I should consult 
with a ham operator who has more networking knowledge than I have.  Any 
help will be appreciated.
