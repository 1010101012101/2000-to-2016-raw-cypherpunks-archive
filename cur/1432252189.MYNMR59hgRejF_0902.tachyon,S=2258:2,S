Is there anything to fight?

The only instance of "digital cash" on google news (there's one
reference to "digital cash registers", which I'm not counting) is an
article about proffr's "x needs killing" comments.  The article doesn't
abuse the term "digital cash", though it does abuse the term "listserv".

The term doesn't appear in print often enough to matter, IMO.
