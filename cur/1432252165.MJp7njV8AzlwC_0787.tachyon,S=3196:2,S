This always boils down tho the single issue: since there is no positive proof
of randomness the only way to trust it is to observe it come from what you
believe is the good source (thermal noise, politician's statements) and turn
into bits. This is why lottery drawings are televised and all enclosures are
transparent ... who would trust "computer" displaying numbers ?

This is clear to anyone involved, and *any* obscurity *is* a positive proof
that you're looking into PRNG of some sort whose seed is weel known to at least
one TLA.
