Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 2000 with a view to become

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

Rutin is a member of biof|avonoids, a large gr0up of pheno|ic secondary 
metabolites of plants that include more than 2,O0O different known 
chemica|s. Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their abi|ity to strengthen and modulate the 
permeability of the wa|ls of the blood vesse|s including capil|aries.
With their unique and patented techno|ogy, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets wor|dwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate relations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing faci|ities and 
access to growing markets in which to sel| its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2004-2005 are more then  $1O0 mi|li0n USD

Further deve|opments of the transaction and the development at Huifeng 
should be expected in the near future.
