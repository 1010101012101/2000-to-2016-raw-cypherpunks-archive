Mainland China is already a capitalist giant. It's also arguably fascist, at 
least from an American's point of view. But if you don't f*ck with 
politicians, you can cut almost whatever deal you want. Start criticisizng 
Zhong Non Hai and your eyeballs will end up giving sight to some aging 
businessman or party bigshot (which basically means an aging businessman 
these days).

Well, there's a difference here. It's one thing to rebuild a country after 
we've gone to war with them, but messing with a country's internal politics 
and destabilising their local governments is a different story. And indeed, 
none of the countries where we've performed such duties (with our help from 
our friends in the SOAs) currently have a particularly stable economy, 
though Argentina is finally showing some dim hope.
