I used to read a _lot_ of science fiction. (Many reasons why I read 
much less now.)

What SF did for me was to "immerse me" in various 
possible-but-not-necessarily-probable alternative futures, a kind of 
way of allowing a person to think that computers might one day be 
ubiquitous, that national borders might be undermined by technology, 
that alternative social organizations might arise.

Heinlein and his editor, John Campbell, used to refer to this as "if 
those goes on..."

Take some trend and extrapolate it. "If this goes on..."

Highways, for example, in Heinlein's "The Roads Must Roll."

Vinge's "True Names," extrapolating trends already becoming apparent 
to some in the 1970s.

And so on.

The most important thing reading SF does for people, IMO, is to 
disabuse them of the notion that there is "a" future. "What will 
_the_ future look like?" seems silly when a sheaf of possible futures 
is "what really is." Those who read a lot of good SF are more likely 
to understand this point, that futures are made, not pre-ordained, 
and that futures may hinge on very subtle points. (Reading a lot of 
"what if" novels helps. A recent one I enjoyed a great deal is 
"Resurrection Day," where the Cuban Missile Crisis escalated on a 
single hinge point--attacking Cuban bases after the U-2 was shot down 
on Saturday--and a nuclear war followed. There's also a movie out in 
theaters now, "Thirteen Days," about these events.)

One reason I read very little SF these days is that much of it is 
repetitive, or is set so far in the future as to be non-interesting 
to me, etc. Plus, the usual effects of aging. SF novels are less 
interesting at age 30 than at age 15, even less so by age 40, etc.

Sometimes some gems still appear. Of course, each person has their 
own taste. For my taste, the best SF I have read in many years is by 
an obscure writer named David Zindell. "Neverness," "The Broken God," 
"The Wild," and "The War in Heaven." Each is a thick, dense novel. 
All set in the same distant future universe, much like "Dune," but 
better (IMO).

Unfortunately, all are out of print. I buy up copies of the 
paperbacks when they show up in my local used bookstore. (Amazon 
wants $18 plus some handling fee for used copies!)

Look for "Neverness" and/or "The Broken God." The latter builds on 
the developments of the former, but can be read on its own. The other 
two novels really need to have the foundations laid by the earlier 
novels.

Well, what do you expect from Salon? They might as well have Paulina 
Borsook writing about the decline of capitalism and the selfishness 
of corporations. Or have David Brin expound on the need for cameras 
everywhere.

Declan can comment on this, too, but it's clear that editors like 
"Hegelian" set-ups of conflict (thesis, antithesis, synthesis). So 
phrases like "Twilight of the ...." resonate in various ways, both 
Hegelian and Wagnerian. The phrases suggest "end of an era" when in 
fact there is no such end.

So Zimmerman is not a libertarian? We knew this in 1991. So Bruce 
Schneier thinks crypto is overrated? It is, in many ways. And so on.

"Twilight of the crypto-geeks" indeed.

BTW, "True Names" was just such a book. The participants were unknown 
to each other. (Vinge chose not to discuss the crypto in detail, 
wisely.)

These were some of the things I was putting into my Great American 
Unfinished Novel, between 1988 and 1991, when I finally abandoned it. 
(No, lest anyone ask, I _won't_ send copies or excerpts out. So don't 
even ask. :-) )

Indeed.
