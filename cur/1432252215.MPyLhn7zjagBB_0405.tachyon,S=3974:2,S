    Yes, and we're going to always have anti-pollution laws as a result, just as
we'll always have laws against rape, murder, burglary, etc. And men with guns to
enforce them.

    From 20 meters away is not much of a problem, 2 meters is. One meter even
more so -- and totally unaviodable at this point, unless you just don't go
out. When you are walking down a sidewalk, say, it's impossible to avoid, and at
close range. 
    So the public streets, parks, etc, will eventurally have the same smoking
bans as public buildings.

   I wouldn't be surprised to see NYC coming up with a license for special
"smoking parlors", which might also serve food and drink. Especially once they
ban smoking on the street.
