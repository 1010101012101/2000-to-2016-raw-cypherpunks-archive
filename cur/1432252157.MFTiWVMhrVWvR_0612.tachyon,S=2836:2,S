Your a quick study bill,only I dont see your operation soft drill 
dollar.ANTE UP.

"...the networkeffect, a conceptual corollary to Metcalfe's Law (Bob 
Metcalfe invented Ethernet) - the value of a network grows in proportion to 
the square of its number of users. This implies that if we double the Web's 
user base, we quadruple the overall usefulness of the system for all."

I did double the OSD  user base once with assistant secretary of mass 
murder and heroin smuggling,dick armitrage.
