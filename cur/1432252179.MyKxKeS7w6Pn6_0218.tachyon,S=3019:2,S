The USG has taken escalating measures against e-gold, and these
have certainly had a substantial effect, but e-gold could lose
all its US infrastructure without very bad effect.  It is also
somewhat protected by muslim-jewish tensions.  Some Muslim
governments might well see aggressive US measures against
e-gold operations in their territories as a part of a Jewish
plot to trap the world in the coils of compount interest.

E-gold transactions are traceable.  E-gold does cooperate with
the US government, and lots of other governments, but the trace
is apt to come to a dead end in gold or cash.  It is hard to
get a bank account or credit card with an alternate ID, it is
easy to get an e-gold account with no ID, like the old style
Swiss Bank accounts.   E-gold requests true names, but has no
enforcement of them or checking of them.   This lack of
enforcement is arguably illegal, but it continues.
