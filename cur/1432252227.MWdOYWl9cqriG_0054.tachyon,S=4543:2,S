Both.

I'll try this one last time and then give up on you.

Any algorithm which maps files onto files will be AT LEAST
as likely to increase the size of files as to decrease their size
if fed random data.  Further, the chance of being able to
significantly decrease the size of a file derived from a random 
source with any given algorithm is vanishingly small
(since there are 256 tomes as many 
N byte files as there are N - 1 byte files, the
odds of a random file being compressible by a single byte by a 
given algorithm can't be any better than 1 in 256.  The odds
of being able to compress it by two bytes ae even worse).

No.  Unlucky with virtually all of them.  There aren't words to 
describe how unlikely it is that a 1 megabyte file of random data
could be compressed by a factor of 100 by any given algorithm.
It's not like winning the lottery.  It's not even like
winning the lottery 100 times in a row.  We're talking
vastly improbable.
