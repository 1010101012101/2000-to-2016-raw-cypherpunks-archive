Can you please advise on the following:

We are considering moving back to England from Canada and have the following
pets:

2 cats approx 8 yrs old where their vacc are up to date

1 cat approx 4 yrs old who as above is up to date with vacc

Also 1 puppy who is now only 10 wks and doesn't have his rabies vac for a
few more weeks yet

Can you please advise what the procedure would be and if they would have to
be quarantined or not

Thanks for your help
