Bravo Eric! A classic of deconstruction!
James...
An au citizen goes to Kosovo and becomes a hero protecting helpless locals 
from serb tanks,he then travels to 'Ghan and is protecting local women 
there from rapists and murdering slave/opium traders in the North,when he 
is taken prisoner and kidnapped to Cuba.He is still there,no visitors 
except ASIO agents,no letters,no rights,no rules.Did I mention he is an 
AUSTRALIAN.An ALLY.The US ambassador,a crooked shrub crony from Arlington 
condemns and smears the au citizens name much as you did with similar 
sounding diabolical scaremongering that was old when tailgunner joe was 
alive.Actually it was old when they were burning witches at Salem.
Another au citizen was kidnapped from Pakistan,he was taken to X-ray as 
well and is suffering the same cruel,unusual punishment as the other for 
arguably even less 'reason.' No charges,no trials,no geneva convention 
rights.No human or civil rights at all.FUCK AMERIKKKA all to HELL! You 
deserve poison for all your crimes,who poisoned the indigenes? Take your 
'intelligence' and shove it up your ass.
In a genuine democracy, the rights of even a minority of one are sacred and 
cannot be violated with impunity.— V K Narasimhan.
