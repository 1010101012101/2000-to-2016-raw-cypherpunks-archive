This figures. And I doubt subscriptions will ever climb much higher.

We've heard similar clamorings for "chat" and "technical" and 
"announcement" sub-lists many times in the past. Nevermind that the 
main list is not terribly high-volume. Nevermind that sub-lists tends 
to wither away. (As when a relatively small city like Monterey gets 
monterey.config, monterey.events, monterey.forsale, monterey.general, 
and monterey.test, all of which are nearly empty or filled only with 
Usenet spam. But, hey, someone thought that what Monterey needed to 
boost traffic was a bunch of newsgroups. Didn't happen, the traffic, 
that is.)

As for Cypherpunks, this was done. Several Usenet newsgroups, which are 
perfectly fine for news announcements, were created by someone (no 
doubt long-since gone on to other projects). Here they are:

alt.cypherpunks
alt.cypherpunks.announce
alt.cypherpunks.social
alt.cypherpunks.technical

But, hey, I hope the subscribers to the new list send their dumpings 
there.

"I think the root of the problem is that we tend to organize ourselves 
into tribes.  Then people in the tribe are our friends, and people 
outside are our enemies.  I think it happens like this: Someone uses 
Perl, and likes it, and then they use it some more.  But then something 
strange happens.  They start to identify themselves with Perl, as if 
Perl were part of their body, or vice versa.  They're part of the Big 
Perl Tribe.  They want other people to join the Tribe.  If they meet 
someone who doesn't like Perl, it's an insult to the Tribe and a 
personal affront to them."
