The TCPA/Palladium folks have been working on this for apparently
around 5 years.  We don't yet have a complete definition of what
Palladium is, but anyway...

It may be that some interesting hardware, TOR and OS design changes
could be added which could change the balance.  Other aspects are as
John Denker said more to do with who will control keys and policies
and how much effective user control and choice remains over these
policies.


My initial thoughts were around hardware and TOR enforced in-flow and
out-flow control to trusted agents.

This idea was seeded by the smart-card setting of Stefan Brands
digital credentials.  (Read [1] if you are interested, it's a very
clever idea, related to observers in cryptogaphic protocols in
hardware settings).

Briefly the observer in Brands protocol (and observers have been
proposed in other cryptogaphic literature also) tackles an analogous
problem with cryptographic assurance in the special purpose case of
privacy preserving credentials, e-cash and other applications that can
be built from those techniques.

You have a tamper-resistant smart card.  However the user can't
reasonably audit the behavior of the smart-card processor because it
intentionally hides it's keys from the user.  Even if the source is
published, audited, and claims and endoresments about the hardware
made, the user still can't easily audit or reasonablly trust what is
actually in his smart-card.

The tamper-resistant smart card is somewhat related to the crypto
functions of the SCP in Palladium or the TPM in TCPA, but the observer
approach may offer lessons for TCPA/Palladium in general at higher
levels.

The tamper-resistant smart card is considered untrusted and hostile to
user privacy.  The tamper-resistant smart card processor and software
is acting in the interests of the credential issuer / ecash issuer to
prevent the user double-spending coins (*) / using credentials more
times than allowed.

The user has a general purpose computer running software he can
completely audit, control observe running and modify.  The smart-card
has to make all communications with ecash acccepting merchants,
certificate verifiers etc via the general purpose computer the
smart-card is connected to.  The general purpose computer implements
the observer protocols.

The smart-card setting variant of Brands protocol cryptographically
assures 2 things:

- the ecash issuer / credential CA can be assured that the user can
not double spend (or in general violate other properties mediated by
the tamper-resistant smart card)

- the user is cryptographically assured that the smart-card can not
invade his privacy.  

This works because the in-flows and out-flows to the smart card are
hardware assured to pass via the general purpose computer, auditable,
use published formats and are cryptographically blinded, to the extent
of optimally frustrating even subliminal channels, via steganography
and the like.


In the same way that TCPA/Palladium are a generalisation of the dongle
concept, this would be a generalisation of the cryptographic concept
of observers.

So for your convenience here's a cut and paste of that initial thought
on applying the observer principle to general purpose TCPA/Palladium
platform from the previous message with subject "Palladium: hardware
layering model":

I wrote in that message:

| One idea I think would be interest is as follows:
| 
| - the TOR (which lives in ring-0) _could_ be used together with the OS
| to force all trusted-agent in-flows and out-flows (network traffic) to
| go through code under supervisor mode control.
| 
| I don't think this is likely in the current design; but this change

|  
| - it would at least allow user audit and control of in-flows and

|  
| - the user could block suspicious phone-home information out-flows,  
| 
| - the user could read out-flows and demand un-encrypted documented
| formats, or if encrypted, encrypted with keys the supervisor mode gets
| copies of.
|

| trusted agent could be more liberally allowed to make out-flows (if it
| has no input knowledge, and is in a code compartment, and the user
| gave it no sensitive it doesn't know anything to leak.)

this is not a fully fleshed out idea as I only thought of it
yesterday, and can't fully analyse it's implications because we don't
yet know proper details of what Palladium hardware is, nor how
microsofts proposed Palladium enhanced windows would be implemented on
that hardware.

Adam

(*) Actually he will still be caught and identified with Brands ecash
protocols when the coins are deposited if he does double-spend coins
after breaking hardware tamper-resistance, but that is a level of
detailed not central to this discussion.
