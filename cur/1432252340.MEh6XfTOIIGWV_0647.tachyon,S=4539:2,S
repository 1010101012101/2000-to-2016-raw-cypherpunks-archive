Assuming we can evaluate accurately the magnitude of what goes on

Companies are wanting to keep records of genetic information and other
HUGE infringments on privacy.  Sure, right now, the bigger risk is the
government (what with Carnivore and all), but I'd say that in less

government.  Already, with WTO/NAFTA/etc. regulations, corporations
are often outside of the control of governments.
