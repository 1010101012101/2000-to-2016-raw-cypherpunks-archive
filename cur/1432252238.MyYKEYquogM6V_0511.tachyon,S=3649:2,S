Mr. Bear, sorry to hear your company is so fsck'ed.  Excellent
post, BTW; exemplar.  But you don't need bios-level encryption; Scramdisk
or PGPdisk
are free, reliable, and would completely solve your multizillion dollar
worries.  Simply use all the space on the laptop as an encrypted drive,
and put all the tools and work directories there, so there's no way
to get around it.  Make it (future) corporate policy ---previously I bet you
wouldn't have been able to convince them, but now you can.  The next 'mugger'
might be the one you fear.
