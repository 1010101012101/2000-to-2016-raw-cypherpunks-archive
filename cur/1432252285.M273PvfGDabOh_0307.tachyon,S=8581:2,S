I always think to myself that there are so many people on this planet
that noone will care about a random person on the internet

I mean, yeah, THE MAN probably has tons of data on me (some of which I
willfully uploaded on social networks), but it's not possible to watch
everyone. Not meaning it technically (technically it very much is),
but more... personally. There are so many people saying stupid shit
online that noone is really going to pay attention to some guy who
just happens to mention bitcoin and bittorrent in the same sentence
and that downloads some comics once in a while, since they are more
busy with people who mention bomb and islam in the same sentence.

But yeah, I know it's a really shitty hope.
