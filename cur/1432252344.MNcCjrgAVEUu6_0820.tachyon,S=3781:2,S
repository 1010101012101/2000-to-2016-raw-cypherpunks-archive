You are quite wrong.

What you describe is the same as the system used in the UK.

The system is now changing as the countries which make up the UK now
have their own parliaments (of currently limited power).

The stupidity of the current UK system is that Scottish MPs can vote
on issues that influence the English, but English MPs can't vote
on Scottish affairs.

And if the left get their way the English will end up being ruled
by the socialist super state that is the European Union.
