Hicks in for the long haul
By MICHAEL McKENNA
31aug02

AUSTRALIAN terror suspects David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib face a likely wait 
of more than a year for their legal battle against detention in a Cuban 
jail to be resolved
American lawyers for the two men yesterday said the appeal process, 
expected to be completed in the US Supreme Court, was facing extensive 
delays under the weight of the legal system.
The appeals, and counter appeals, follow the US District Court decision 
this month to detain the men without trial.
Hicks, captured in Afghanistan, and Habib in Pakistan by local authorities, 
are being held in a maximum security prison at the US Navy base at 
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
Both are accused, with the 596 other detainees at the navy base, of having 
links to al-Qaeda.
"The legal system here is very slow at the moment and the appeal to the 
District Court decision alone will take a few months," said their lawyer, 
Joseph Margulies.
Some good news though...
