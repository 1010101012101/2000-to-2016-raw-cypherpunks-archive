It is not deliberate on our part.
A number of complications are likely to be present when trying to do
multicast:

1. The phones may not have kernel support for it compiled in (or more
likely, some models will, while others wont).
2. I don't know if BATMAN does multicast (I suspect OLSR might, but I
really don't know).

I agree multicast is good here, but there are ways around this, even
if they aren't ideal.
In particular, if there is a mesh node at either end, then they can
(eventually) bridge traffic.
Some of this will become much simpler once we move to the overlay
mesh, at which point multicast will not be sensibly possible, anyway.

Actually, there are ways around this, and we are currently working on
exactly this kind of groups of people sharing information problem that
you mention.  We see no reason why our planned protocols shouldn't
work with multiple groups in the same physical area, even with
overlapping membership.

It is all in the clear at present.  We have plans to add voice, SMS
etc encryption and authentication in over coming months.
Mesh management traffic will remain en claire, but the overlay mesh
will increase the ability to authenticate even that.

Paul.
