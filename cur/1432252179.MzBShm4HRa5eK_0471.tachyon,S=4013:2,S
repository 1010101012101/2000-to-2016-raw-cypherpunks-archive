Sounds like somebody doesn't do their own washing/ironing :)

The steam in an iron doesn't get anywhere that hot, it'd ruin the clothes.
Also an iron will have steam escaping around the edges (when you hit the
steam button especially) and this has the potential to spread un-heated
spores into the atmosphere.
