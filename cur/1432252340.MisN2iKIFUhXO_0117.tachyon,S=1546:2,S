When I suggested a few weeks ago that someone would eventually argue for a 
constitutionally guaranteed right to be heard, members of the list both 
reminded me (quite correctly) that no such right does or can exist, and 
opined that because of the obvious fallacy of the claim, no one would make 
that argument.

It would seem that Mencken [1] was correct, as well as Costello [2].
