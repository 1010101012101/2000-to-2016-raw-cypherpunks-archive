No More Secrecy Bills

LAST YEAR President Clinton properly vetoed an intelligence =
authorization bill that would have criminalized virtually all leaks of =
classified information. Unfortunately, this year the idea has resurfaced =
and is due to be considered by the Senate intelligence committee in =
September. The leaks bill is still a bad idea and should again be =
rejected.

We don't pretend to be neutral on this subject. Newspapers publish =
leaked material; our reporters solicit leaks. And some of the leaked =
material we publish is classified. But it is a mistake to imagine that =
all leaks of classified information are bad. Some expose wrongdoing or =
allow the public to debate relatively nonsensitive matters that =
government would prefer to handle without scrutiny. The government =
massively overclassifies information, so a law banning all leaks of =
supposedly sensitive material would inevitably criminalize conversations =
between officials and citizens about subjects that are not genuinely =
sensitive and chill in dangerous ways the ability of officials and =
former officials to speak out on important policy questions.

Traditionally, the law has respected this fact and has made criminal =
only leaks of specific types of classified information -- the names of =
intelligence agents, for example, or material related to encoding =
systems used in intelligence work. Certain disclosures of defense =
information, if done with intent to harm national security, can be =
prosecuted under espionage laws. And no one is suggesting that every =
government employee should be free to decide what remains secret and =
what does not. Generally speaking, leaks are handled under =
administrative personnel rules; if you get caught, you can lose your =
job.

One trouble with creating a blanket criminalization of classified leaks =
is that it gives the executive branch almost unchecked authority to =
remove information from public discussion. Classification rules are =
generally not made under statutes but by executive orders, meaning that =
the president would have the authority both to decide what information =
is classified and to prosecute people for leaking it. Such unchecked =
power would be dangerous even if overclassification weren't rampant.

But there is hardly an area where government is more capricious than in =
its determination of what secrets it needs to keep. Several years ago, =
to cite one example, the Federation of American Scientists sought =
historical and contemporary data on the aggregate intelligence budget =
under the Freedom of Information Act. After some litigation, the =
government released the figure for fiscal year 1997 and then, =
voluntarily, for 1998. It has refused, however, to release data for =
subsequent years and claims that releasing the figures for the years =
1947-1970 could compromise "the interest of national defense or foreign =
policy" and "intelligence sources and methods." There have been times =
when the disclosure of irrationally or unjustifiably classified =
information has served the public. Certainly, in a system that depends =
on an informed and skeptical electorate, the government should not be =
moving in the direction of criminalizing public debate.=20
