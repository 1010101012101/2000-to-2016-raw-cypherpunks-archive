A friend of mine is expressing concern over the recently passed REAL ID act
which will supposedly require RFID-readable driver's licenses (which it doesn't
say in the text of the bill which just makes a vague reference to
"machine-readable technology".)

My questions are:

1. Have any states already implemented RFID-readable IDs/licenses?

2. If not, which states plan to?
