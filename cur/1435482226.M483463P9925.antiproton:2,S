i built omnom, a delicious like bookmarking engine, with a greasemonkey script
that made a snapshot of the rendered page as it was in your browser and
inlined all its css and images (as data urls), so it was one (quite huge)
html. unfortunately i think greasemonkey/userscripts have been neutered so
that the snapshotting does not work anymore.

the meat is still available:
https://gitorious.org/tagr/omnom/raw/419b512734021b71c01500514b5ae87d0b7f3ab7:templates/tagr.user.js

i know - ridiculous, someone posting code on the cypherpunks list, i hope
you're all not to offended by my contributions to your fine noise.
