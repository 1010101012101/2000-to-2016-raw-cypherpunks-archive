Agenda
"Our agenda is a widely-held secret."
As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited.
However, it's in an office building, so they'd appreciate if you
have a nom de plume to sign in with.
Any problems, call Bill Stewart at +1-415-307-7119.


Black Unicorn continues with Part II of his talk on the black market,
	the manner in which it has evolved over the last quarter century, and
	the lessons cypherpunks might be able to learn about networks,
	infastructures, security and black markets in general.

Len Sassaman will be talking about the Mixmaster email remailer tool -
	there's been a lot of development work recently on this
	tool for email anonymizing, including developer mailing list at the
	SourceForge Open Source Software repository.
	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mixmaster-devel

Dave Del Torto will be presenting current work for the CryptoRights Foundation,
	including a description of the upcoming meeting in with European developers.

San Francisco Foundation at 225 Bush Street (5th Floor) in SF,
