York Times, 8 Sep 02)
When Playing the Field, the Game Gets Rough
THE conventional wisdom about what is troubling American intelligence, 
particularly human intelligence — the stuff spies do — is that the system 
is broken; that on Sept. 11 the Central Intelligence Agency just did not 
have enough language-qualified spy handlers on the ground around the world 
to do the job.....( New York Times op-ed by Milt Bearden, 8 Sep 02)

Times, 8 Sep 02)
Getting the Intelligence Services a Vulnerable Nation Needs
If anything changed after Sept. 11, it was America's sense of 
invulnerability. Suddenly, this became a nation under threat, a nation 
without security. What needs to be done, what can be done — short and long 
term — by the intelligence services to protect the United States against 
future attack?.....( New York Times, 8 Sep 02)
Eyes in the Sky, Ears to the Wall, and Still Wanting ....For more than 50 
years, providing the country with early warning of a nuclear missile attack 
from Russia has been the first priority of the American intelligence 
community. The system has worked well, thanks largely to billions of 
dollars worth of technical intelligence.....( New York Times op-ed by James 
Bamford, 8 Sep 02)
Learning to Spy With Allies
What will Al Qaeda do next? One big problem in figuring it out has been 
that, in important ways, the terrorist network is more effectively 
globalized than the modern intelligence organizations that try to penetrate 
it....( New York Times, 8 Sep 02)
Bin Laden's Guys Have Cloaks and Daggers, Too
FOR all the resources American agents are devoting to watching the myriad 
tentacles of Al Qaeda, one of the things they have been forced to consider 
is that Al Qaeda may be watching them.....( New York Times, 8 Sep 02)
Pearl Harbor as Prologue
Why does intelligence fail? Remember Pearl Harbor....( New York Times, 8

In the last year, intelligence agents have been showing more interest in 
the work of the California psychologist Paul Ekman than ever before.....( 
New York Times, 8 Sep 02)
The Real Me: The Online Version
It is no secret that the Internet offers a wealth of information. It's even 
known that much of what we used to call "intelligence" is freely available 
online. I decided to find out what I could learn about myself just by 
consulting Internet-based resources....( New York Times, 8 Sep 02)
Book Contends Chief of A-Bomb Team Was Once a Communist
Adding a startling chapter to the long historical debate over the secret 
laboratory that developed the atom bomb in World War II, a new book 
concludes that its leader, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, belonged to the 
American Communist Party in the late 1930's and early 40's.....( New York 
Times, 8 Sep 02) [Read review of book by CI Centre Professor Nigel West]

They got her anyway.....( AP, 8 Sep 02)
