Just wondering ... in a life & death situation (say, blackmailing att.
general), what would be the choice of readers of this forum:


a) use mixmaster remailer from their home/business/friend.

b) use an internet cafe

c) use an open wireless AP


b and c assume, of course, one-time use of a throwaway e-mail acct.

c) makes most sense to me, provided that you fake your radio card's MAC and do
it while walking by, with folded laptop in a bag running a script.
