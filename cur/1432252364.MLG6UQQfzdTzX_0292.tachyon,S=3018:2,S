Declan's most provocative report confirms a point made
on October 8 by the leaker of the alleged RIAA secret 
meeting, which was not reported by The Register:

Quote: 

One particularly disturbing fact is that Codex Data System's 
DIRT software is supposed to be restricted to law enforcement 
agencies, yet the RIAA, MPAA, and IFPI have all purchased it, 
and use it routinely to monitor servers which are suspected of 
infringing content, yet are password protected such as servers 
which require one to sign up for a password account like 
hotline servers that have no guest download.
