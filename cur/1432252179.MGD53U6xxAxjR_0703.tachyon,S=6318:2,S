You were a creepy nitwit back around 1994 when you first showed up with
your ill-conceived ideas, you were a creepy nitwit when you came back a
few years later, and you are a creepy nitwit this time around.

Do you even read the crap you recommend? Or is it a case of "They
laughed at Tesla! They laughed at Choate! They laughed at Jeffers!"?

Consider some of what this URL talks about, the usual mumbo jumbo about
zero point energy of the universe, folded spacetime, unlimited energy,
cold fusion, and something called "inner infolded electromagnetics."

Submittted for the amusement of Cypherpunks (though with the profusion
of Yahoo, Hotmail, Hushmail, and other throwaway-account blissninnies, I
expect most of you to just go "Like, cool!"):

--begin excerpt--
  Specifically, they have very little knowledge of the capabilities of
higher symmetry electrodynamics, since they almost ubiquitously use
standard electrical engineers and engineering for analysis.  The problem
is that this standard type of analyst -- however capable in the orthodox
sense --  is totally incapable of even recognizing the indicators
pointing to a higher symmetry EM weapon or weapon test.
..... We also missed the fact that this internal LW EM dynamics
constitutes an infolded set of spacetime curvatures and their
dynamics -- spacetime curvature engines, e.g., or "vacuum engines" in
particle physics terms, or just "engines" for short.
...
  Not a single university in the United States even teaches what
actually powers an electrical circuit, even though that has been in
physics for more than 40 years,
....You will see a total failure to attack the energy crisis right where
it begins: by what actually powers the circuit.  You will see no
acceptance of cold fusion, now demonstrated in more than 600 successful
experiments worldwide, in several nations and many laboratories, by
perhaps 200 scientists from those countries, labs, or independently. 
For the electric circuit, any dipolarity, being opposite charges, a
priori extracts EM energy from the vacuum in unusable form ( the input
must be from the time-domain; it is easily demonstrated experimentally
that no observable EM energy is input in 3-space), transduces it into
usable form, and pours it out in all directions. 

....Consequently, billions of dollars are being spent in energy research
on everything except the real problem: how to master and correctly use
the broken symmetry of the ubiquitous dipole.

..... we had to turn to a friendly foreign country, to its National
Materials Science Laboratory (which is part of its National Academy of
Sciences), to find scientists already well-versed in higher symmetry
electrodynamics and its use, willing to perform the final year of
research needed to develop the unit for the commercial market and full
production. That is now ongoing.

.....Yet astounding breakthroughs -- including for the good of all human
beings on this planet -- readily come from such work, in energy,
healing, propulsion, you name it.  The mastery of the "inner infolded
electromagnetics" inside all the normal EM potentials, fields and waves
is actually a unified field theory, but one directly engineerable on the
lab bench. 
.....to show that a small, portable higher group symmetry electrodynamic
medical treatment device can be rapidly developed in a crash program of
from $60-100 million.  The device could treat (radiate in very special
fashion) a casualty in about 2 minutes flat, and another, and another,
etc. community, not to mention the scientific community
