Okay. The inverse, maybe.

Or CMO tranches, which decline variously in interest income as the
underlying mortgage principal is paid off -- or pre-paid, in a
falling interest environment.

Maybe you're talking about a derivative then. In that case, what
you're doing is making a contingent claim on an asset based on an
authenticated data stream. The first crypto protocol I ever saw that
does this is Jeuls and Jakobssen's fairly misnamed "X-Cash".
Essentially you want to decrypt some code at the right time and run
it, executing a transaction.
