          News/Assignment Editors & Sports Writers

IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2001--Grand Prix Sports Inc.
(OTC BB:GPRX) announced that it has won both the FIA Formula 3000
International Team Championship and Drivers' Championship for the
2001 season. Coca-Cola Nordic Racing secured the Team Championship
with two races remaining in the 2001 season and has set new team
records for the most podium appearances and team points of any team
since 1985. Appropriately, Coca-Cola Europe Ltd. has extended its
title sponsorship for Nordic Racing for an additional two years.

Coca-Cola Nordic Racing driver Justin Wilson also won the prestigious
Drivers' Championship while teammate Tomas Enge finished in a tie
for second place. Wilson became the first-ever British driver to win
the Drivers' Title and with a 71 point total, eclipsed the all time
single season points record previously held by Formula 1 driver Juan
Pablo Montoya. Enge missed the last F3000 race at Monza, Italy after
being chosen by the Prost Formula 1 team to replace the injured
Luciano Burti for the last three Formula 1 races. Enge successfully
competed in the Italian, American and Japanese Grand Prixes to
finish the Formula 1 season with Prost.

"Obviously, this is the utmost achievement in Formula 3000," stated
Team Principal, Derek Mower. "To win both of these titles is a
testament to the strength of our race team and the support of
sponsors like Coca-Cola and Conoco. Together, we're effectively
tapping into the enormous popularity of global motor sports."
Grand Prix Sports owns 40% of Coca-Cola Nordic Racing and is the
first publicly traded race team in the Formula world, allowing
fans of Formula racing, by and large the world's most popular sport,
the unique opportunity to "own" part of a race team.
