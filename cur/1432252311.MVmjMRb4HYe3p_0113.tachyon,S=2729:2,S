I'm not in favor of compulsory voting, but you wont have to pay the small fine 
unless you're too lazy to think of an excuse. Last time I got off by claiming 
my foot was too sore to walk to the polling station. In practice it's only 
compulsory to either apply for an absentee vote or attend a polling station 
on election day and get your name crossed off a list. You can bin the pieces 
of paper the official gives you.

The effect is that about 70% of voters just turn up and vote the way "their" 
party tells them to vote. This number is in secular decline.

I think what's needed is a "None of the above" option on the ballot. If "None 
of the above" won a majority then the office would be left vacant. (We 
actually had this system for student elections at my alma mater) Non-voters 
obviously aren't sufficiently attracted to any of the candidates to bother 
voting, so they should be counted as votes for "None of the above" (but not 
this part -- they were doing well to get a 10% turn-out for a student 
election). Pretty soon we'd have no government.

cheers,
Tim
