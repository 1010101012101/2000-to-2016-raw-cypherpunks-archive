As we recently saw in the money laundering treaties, different 
nations have rather different interpretations of international treaties.

Some time back the US government, in flagrant defiance of the first 
amendment, but in accord with international treaties, prohibited the 
internet publication of drug manufacture information.   Sites were 
closed down, only to pop up again in different jurisdictions.  The 
sites were simply zipped up, the zip files floated around a while, 
then found new homes.

If they cannot stop sites that give information on manufacture of 
drugs, they have lost and we have won.   Similarly, as I pointed out 
to some nutty nyms who claim to be lawyers, if they cannot shut 
down child pornography on usenet, they cannot shut down 
alt.anonymous.messages.
