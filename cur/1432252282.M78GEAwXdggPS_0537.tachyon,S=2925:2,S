Why are you not addressing the more direct attack, the one I described 
yesterday?

"The contributions you receive for $87.93 came from our members."

Unless the amounts are consolidated by a third party or dithered (so 
much for digital money being what it claims to be), this covert channel 
bypasses the nominal name-stripping.

"According to the FBI, there's a new wrinkle in prostitution: suburban 
teenage girls are now selling their white asses at the mall to make 
money to spend at the mall.
...
Now, you see, the joke here, of course, is on White America, which 
always felt superior to blacks, and showed that with their feet, moving 
out of urban areas. "White flight," they called it. Whites feared 
blacks. They feared if they raised their kids around blacks, the blacks 
would turn their daughters and prostitutes. And now, through the 
miracle of MTV, damned if it didn't work out that way! "
