Simple. We'll tell the police to be nice when playing with their new
toys, and look the other way then they roll out the tanks, sound
cannons, pain beams, nausea lights, and camo-suited snatch squads. And
we'll forgive them when they execute people, Vietnam-style, on subways
because "they thought they were reaching for their pain ray".

These sorts of sort-of-non-lethal-kinda weapons^Wdeterrents are
essential if we want to win the War on Terror, which is a prerequisite
for winning the War on General Discontent of the Rich.
