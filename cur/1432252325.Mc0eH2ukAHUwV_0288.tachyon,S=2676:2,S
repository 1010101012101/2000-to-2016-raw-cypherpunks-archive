"Just what did the FBI mean by inserting the word "skyfall" into a
description of a press release? Was it a reference to the 1970s-era
disaster novel entitled Skyfall, or a hint that the bureau was
remembering the children's tale in which Chicken Little warned of
calamity -- but was not believed? "


It could also be a code word they inserted to as a clandestine
communication.  You know, WWII "if you're really with the Brits, 
have the BBC newlady say 'foosball' on tonight's show"

Anyway, 'skyfall' will be replaced with 'sheepdip' soon...
