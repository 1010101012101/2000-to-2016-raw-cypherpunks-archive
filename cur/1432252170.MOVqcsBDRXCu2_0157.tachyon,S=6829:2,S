my name is christy.
i am allright.  just a single woman getting by bothering no one.
someone has been doing some serious stuff to me via my PC.  I have all =
the evidence compiled via using security softward and also tracing =
things myself to determine that the ip of this Cindy soulia, and Raymond =
D. Mereniuk is where my problem is originating.  Ok here's my sticky =
problem.  I need someone who cares and has technical background (major) =
to assist me in getting the entire stack together. If I am going to make =
it stop and hopefully force them to tell me why they break in or attempt =
to so often, I need a good case to present. I am only fortunate to have =
gotten as far as I did, not  at all versed in what I am doing.  But.... =
I do think that I may know the true identity of this person.  If it is =
who I think it is I have a need (one of the honorbound needs) to not =
only let him know in no uncertain terms that I am aware of his/her =
attacks but I want to know why they always have a heavy duty DOD link =
amongst the IPs on the route.  I don't know if there is a way to express =
how important it is to stand my ground at this person but if you catch =
the drift of his personality from the messages he writes you might =
understand somewhat.  i will await your reply and I guess you might say =
I beg you to help me.  i will pay money for help and I won't ask you to =
do anything to compromise your own safety.
Also I am not talking about going to the cops here, I would take the =
info and someone else who knows the attacker with me and do it face to =
face.  if i am correct
Please,
Christy
