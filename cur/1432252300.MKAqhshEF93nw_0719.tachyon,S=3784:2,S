Keep an eye out for anarchists with uzi's,niggaz with attitude and 
Catherine Trammel.shooter.

""They knew I wasn't planning to kill federal agents", Bell said this 
month. "They were scared because I had written something that shows a way 
to eliminate government. They were afraid I could convince the public that 
I could replace existing government for no more than a 10th or 20th of its 
current cost."
"Imagine for a moment that, as ordinary citizens were watching the evening 
news, they see an act by a government employee or officeholder that they 
feel violates their rights, abuses the public's trust or misuses the powers 
that they feel should be limited. What if they could go to their computers, 
type in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount. If 0.1 percent of 
the population, or one person in a thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see 
some government slimeball dead,(or some ordinary anarcho-capitalist 
slimeball) that would be in effect, a $250,000 bounty on his head."
I think that one last (temporary) hope for government is to delay APster. 
Chances are good that the "think tank" decided that the best way to delay 
APster is to discredit me, its author. It was a desperate gamble, 
particularly because the act of harassing me automatically gives APster 
more publicity. That's the reason they will fail; the more they try to 
"get" me, the worse it will be for them." Your gps is in the mail May.
