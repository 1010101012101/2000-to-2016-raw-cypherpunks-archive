There are consumer protection laws that may be used to open this up.
Manufacturers are required to provide for repair parts for a minimum 
amount of time.  Being able to take your car to an independent repair
services has in the past been defined as an owner's right.

Data pertaining to the specific car will probablly be required to be
available.   Data only used to build aggregate fleet data might still
be protected.  

Being able to modify the parameters might impair the manufacturers "Fleet"
air quality/fuel efficiency averages, without a exeption which may be
part of the final law.
 
An owner could of course replace the entire control system with a retrofit.

This practice of encryption might also be to protect the market for 
computerized tools sold to repair shops.  At $5000 apiece per car make per
repair shop that's a lot of money.

If safety is really the issue then tamper evident seals on the systems
might be able to absolve the manufacturers, unless the ability to hack
the systems is considered an "Attractive Nusiance".  Consumer Protection
laws are pretty harsh in the country, remember computers don't usually kill
people when they fail,  cars certainly can.

And all this is just the complexity that I can think of.  Imagine a team
of lobbyists and their presenations.
