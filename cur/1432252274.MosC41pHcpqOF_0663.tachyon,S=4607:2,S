Everyone's been saying this, but what's your source? How do you know there 
haven't been any pulmonary cases?

Agreed, strange coincidence.

> (BTW, the incubation period for anthrax is up to 60 days...)

But it's as low as 6 days. By the classic pattern, there should be a few new 
cases at the bottom end of the incubation period, with new cases appearing at 
an accelerating rate. Since anthrax is supposedly not human-communicable (one 
human is not contagious to other humans) and if there was a single "infection 
point" in the timeline (meaning there could have been any number of infection 
*sites*, provided they all were released at the same time) then we should be 
able to look back after the fact and see a bell curve of anthrax cases - a 
few at six days after the infection point, a few more at ten, more at 20, a 
maximum somewhere around 35, then tailing off with the number of new cases 
decreasing until we hit one or two final cases at 60 days. If this is the 
start of the Bell curve, then the infection point should have been about 10 
days ago - which means it would probably have to be a different team, rather 
than something set up by Atta and company.

The other possibility, of course, is that there was a poor, limited-dispersal 
attempt at infection, in which case there might only be a total of one or two 
successful infections - in which case, with the maximum at 35 days and using 
September 11 as our infection point, we might be at the maximum and these few 
cases (assume one or two mis- or un-diagnosed) are all we will see. That 
would be at odds with the apparent level of training and planning by the 9/11 
terrorists, but doesn't rule the possibility out.

I do agree two cases, in close proximity, among (apparently) non-farmers is a 
strange coincidence so close on the heels of a terrorist attack.
