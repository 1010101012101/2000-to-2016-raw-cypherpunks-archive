blacknets don't solve the hard problems related to large scale
anonymous digital cash, mainly identity management and strong
reputation metrics. (s/digital cash/non trivial resource exchange/g)

darknets, as the abused term appears to be currently employed, place
an emphasis on friendship as a trust/reputation metric and associate
that trusted channel with copyrighted content distribution. (even
though, as zooko pointed out, the original microsoft paper describing
darknets put more emphasis on the opaque nature of the overlay /
private traffic and gave little attention to the friend to friend
aspect of introduction / networking)

agreed. i'm even more convinced these terms are essentially worthless
as anything more descriptive than "a private network of some type".

embrace and extend the namespace!
