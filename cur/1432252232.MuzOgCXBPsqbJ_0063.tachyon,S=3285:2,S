It's nice that there's a forum available to you 
where you are free to assert and assume whatever 
you wish, without the inconvenience of any 
substantiation.

You are free to believe whatever you wish.  But that's not a
standard of proof that means anything.

Personal belief, supposition, unsubstantiated assertion.  
I'm glad we're not talking about anything like you'd
see in a star chamber or brutal prison regime.  Glad
you exhibit a pristine standard of evidence in
contrast to those you revile.  Hypocrite.
