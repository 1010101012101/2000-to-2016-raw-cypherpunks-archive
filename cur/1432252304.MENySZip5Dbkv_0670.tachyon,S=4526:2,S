Ah, here is the double standard in your argument.

And what about the businesses that were used to support those British
soldiers. Would they have been legitimate targets (which they were to
the colonials)? In a parallel way the WTC is the business that supports
the oppressive forces, or at least that's the way they see it. Then of
course we can discuss the entire concept of 'property ownership',
'breaking contract' and 'repress colonials'.

This brings up the aspect of 'self determination' that folks like yourself
seem to be missing. Go read the first two para's of the DoI. Then reflect
on this;

The legitimate use of self-defence with respect to self-determination is
from the view of the oppressed. No consideration is made for those who one
fights against to end the oppression. Freedom is about the individual and
what they are justified in doing if provoked.

Now look at world politics since the 1850's...then consider certain
rejoinders by the founding fathers about getting involved in other peoples
business...then consider rampant globalization w/ centralized political
and military authority...

Further, you wish to us to view the WTC as a isolated senseless event,
when in fact it is not. It is only one more act in a 140 year refutation
of American Democracy.

We reap what we sow.
