The recent mailing from Dallas-Maxim included their "microcontroller
engineering review" volume 2.  There's an article inside called
"SRAM-based microcontroller optimizes security" with some nice pictures of
a chip that's been burned open by acid.  Their note 3 is really cute too.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
