Excellent report, Bob, shows how to do business in the free market.
Kiss up to gov, kick down customers, while claiming to do the opposite, 
and apologizing, nay, crying, upon being outed, promising greater 
ratting in the future to save ass. 

Cowardly SOB, Dr. Jackson, a poster child for WSJ, Fortune, Business 
Week -- the latter really didn't go into what makes e-gold so different 
from its financial co-conspirators and ancestors. 

But then WSJ and Fortune never go that far either, merely exhibit periodic
excess as teasing crowd pleasers for what is not reported about
the criminal enterprise of, what's it called nowadays if not greed?

Ah, yes, Dr. Jackson says its trustworthy customer service, up to
a point of shit britches.
