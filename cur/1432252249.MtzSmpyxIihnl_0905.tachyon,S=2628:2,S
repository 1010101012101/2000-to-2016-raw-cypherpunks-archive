Carl Ellison tells the story about how, with the advent of the longbow, all
these peasants had to get absolution from their local priests for killing
knights. Kill a noble on Wednesday, confess on Sunday, lather, rinse,
repeat.

Needless to say, the impedance mismatch between reality and dogma resolved
itself.

The economics of networks outweighs the economics of intellectual property
law. That, too, will resolve itself, just like Clipper did.


As for finance itself, there's a reason that I say that financial
cryptography is the only cryptography that matters. Since the time of
Mesopotamian bullae and grain banks, cryptography has been essential to
finance. You can't do one without the other. The more cryptography you do,
the more finance you can do, the better off everyone is. It's a virtuous
circle.

The internet and Moore's law accelerates cryptographic, and thus financial,
progress. More stuff cheaper.

Cheers,
RAH
