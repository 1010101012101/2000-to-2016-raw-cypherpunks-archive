Subject: Re: [liberationtech] Kill the Messenger: What Russia taught Syria

I have to respecfully disagree. If our only concern is to properly scare
people about the implications of targeting based on RF transmissions, then
yes, the article does a good job of that.

My concern is to ensure that journalists, activists, and their enablers
have access to the best information and the most likely/accurate review of
events about which we may never have "facts."

I guess I should specify the elements of the article that I consider to be
sensational, speculative, and/or downright misleading/scare-mongering.

First of all, Mr. Pelton is well known for being a glory-hound, his book
"The World's Most Dangerous Places" should be enough to make that clear.

So firstly, he starts with his own "glory days" covering Chechnya, and the
first issue I would raise is this quote:

"As we walked briskly back to the safe house, it was exactly 10 minutes
before the cascade of double *wa-whumps* announced the Grad rocket
batteries pounding the vacant neighborhood we had just left."

Mr. Pelton has mentioned previously in a forum of journalists, human rights
reporters, and their colleagues(fixers, translators etc), known as the
Vulture Club, that the Russians have equipment that can lock onto an RF
signal and fire Grad rockets at the location within a matter of minutes,
taking merely 10 minutes from starting a phone call to hitting the
location. I asked him repeatedly if he would clarify which targeting
system, specifically, Unfortunately none of the details he provided
suggested such a capacity, therefore while it's certainly possible this
capacity exists, to just state it as fact, to my mind, qualifies as
scaremongering, and does not serve to improve our general understanding of
the risks of satellite communications.

There follows three paragraphs serving only to establish that yes indeed
journalists have been directly targeted in Russia's war in Chechnya. This
is then used to suggest it is self-evident that:

" journalists were specifically targeted to prevent sympathetic or
embarrassing reports from escaping the killing zone."

This is just outright unsubstantiated. There was one account in the
Telegraph paper that sourced Lebanese intelligence stating that the Syrian
regime has claimed it would target journalists directly. If it is prime
facie fact, isn't it strange that there is only one source and no other
papers directly carried this allegation?

Next Mr. Pelton asserts that satellite phone uplinks:

"could well have cost Colvin her life." and "Multiple reports have
suggested<http://cpj.org/blog/2012/02/caveat-utilitor-satellite-phones-can-always-be-tra.php>
that
Syrian forces used phone signals to pinpoint her location"

Now then, if Mr. Pelton were simply another ignorant journalist printing
what he understood as potential threats, that would be one thing, however
he has been privy to extended discussions about the relative improbability
that satellite phones were targeted, vs the much more likely case that the
VSAT and/or BGAN on the roof of the "makeshift media centre" or, equally
likely, old-fashioned human intelligence targeting resulted in the deaths
of the individuals noted. Further these "multiple reports" are essentially
rehashings of the same initial report, of which Mr. Pelton should be well
aware.

It is very sad that Colvin and Ochlik were killed, and other journalists
grievously wounded. It's even more sad that so many Syrians lost their
lives evacuating the survivors. Given these facts and the importance of
honoring their loss, I would prefer to see less hyperbole and
sensationalism and more soul-searching and review of just how these events
happened.

As I stated last week on this list, Marie Colvin herself was quoted as
saying that she would not use her satellite phone because of her fear that
it could be intercepted/targeted. Instead she opted to depend on Skype
which, though variously secure, relies on a much higher bandwidth
connection which is vastly easier to target. Rather than continuing the
magical thinking that may well have led to Colvin's death, we should take a
hard look at what we know about the facts and review the lack of
approachable, available documentation about communications security,
particularly satellite-based communications.
