It restricts one critical component: the iPhone cannot keep a secret.  I
don't mean that your data isn't safe---I'm sure Apple's put significant
effort into keeping secrets in their native apps, and that the SSL/TLS
code is well done.  I mean that the web apps I can write for an iPhone
cannot behave as principals in cryptographic protocols.  I can't write
an SSH client, for example, or a protocol for any instant messaging
system whatsoever.  The only way to do such is to run the interesting
protocol client remotely, and provide a web interface to access from the
iPhone.  That unnecessarily involves a third party.

As you say, the iPhone is a mobile network terminal---but its
capabilities as a peer on that network have been crippled.

I also cannot write an editor or viewer for locally stored data---that's
a problem related to secret keeping and to the origin-only restrictions
on JavaScript.
