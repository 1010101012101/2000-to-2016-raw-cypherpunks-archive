Anyone else checked out the footage that surfaced of the Apollo 11
astronauts pretending to be far away when they are really in low Earth
orbit?
https://youtu.be/Rikfsw835RA
The effect they are going for can be seen at 53:14 to make it seem
like the camera is up against the window and Earth is small. How they
did it is revealed much earlier in the film. You see someone between
the camera and the Earth and realize what you thought was the
blackness of space is really the inside of the craft and what you
though was the entire Earth is just a small window showing part of a
huge Earth right outside the window. (This is covered in a doc you can
also find on youtube called A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Moon.) There is other funny business in the rest of this "behind the
scenes footage." Not sure what to make of it if the moon landing
wasn't faked.
