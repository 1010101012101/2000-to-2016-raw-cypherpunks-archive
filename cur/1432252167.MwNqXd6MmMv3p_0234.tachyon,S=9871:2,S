Not what I'd like to see; what the US will encourage.  The US
(or its puppets) will use .iq's oil money to pay for .iq reconstruction
jobs,
and then steady-state jobs.  To think otherwise is to ignore the
motivations and means of the USG.

So use oil money to create agricultural projects which use lots
of labor.  Iraq has water.  (When we take Saudi Arabia we
can build desalination plants..)

I'm saying that if the problems you describe arise, the USG
will try to reduce them, for the USG's benefit.  I don't see
how you can ignore the 800 lb gorilla with the A-10 backup.
I don't see how observing this makes me socialist.  Analyst,
maybe, socialist, no.

So am I.  But I recognize the existance of non-libertarian agents
like the USG and their ability to use resources (oil) for social
placation.  Social placation which favors USG interests.

Shit, a lot of Americans will admit (if pressed) that USG domestic
welfare
is to prevent the South Centrals from rioting.  And Iraq is not even
burdened with those US pathologies or the US constitution.

You grossly misunderstand.  The US now owns Iraq.  The US can
physically keep Iraqis poor if it wishes ---put them all in internment
camps, feed them a meal at a time.  (How is this statism?  Its a
statement
of brutal fact, a consequence of who has the biggest guns.)

The US can also give them all satellite TVs & trust funds if it wishes,
using either your taxes or Iraq's oil sales money.

Now my claim is that 1. the USG interest is in Americizing Iraq, and
that
2. (having the guns) they will do so, whether the Iraqis want it or not.

My claim is also that the oil is easier to spend than US tax dollars
in the long run.  I have yet to see you refute any of these.  I also
fail
to see how this makes me statist.  *Recognizing* state actions doesn't
mean I endorse them.

I suppose I'm also making a claim that the entire population there isn't

permenantly, chronically South Central LA, i.e., that the US
manipulation
will work to some extent.

Yep.  But you realize that the high-youth populations of various arab
nations are succeptible to Americanization, and that the USG
knows this, right?  And will exploit this for the USG's ends.

You are also aware of how, after a population gets Americanized, they
start using birth control?  Chicks wanting college, more money per
family
member the fewer there are, no need for agricultural labor.  [Alas
world-Americanization is happening too slowly and the population bomb is

slowly detonating]

Ok.  Perhaps I am wrong about the number of pipe-polishers and
folks employed in satellite industries (incl. the Iraqis who repair
Halliburton Mercedez).
Then the USG will create labor-consuming 'reconstruction' projects then.

Using your or Iraqi resources,  it doesn't much matter if its not an
election year.

I'm stating future history, not what I personally want, Tim.  I think
I've stated clearly enough that this the USG acting (without serious
opposition)
in pure USG interest.

Ok, then only a few Texans will be over there.  Smaller exposure.
Fewer targets.  Still, the USG will create native jobs out of USG
interests.

Every arabian kingdom with oil has little but oil money.  That the
monarchs of the region use it for welfare (and thus their own
security) is no different from the USGs plan.

Only folks it doesn't work on are the Fundies, as the Shah (et al)
found out.

Of course, a company is rational, xor extinct.  What I mean is,
the new USIRAQ will "own" the oil, much like the Saudi
kings do.  They may let others pump it, refine it, move it
(all those parties making a profit), but USIRAQ will
use its take for Americanization.

Not optimism, mere modelling of agents and their means
and motivations.

But it won't be *free*, the Iraqis will have to work for
the dinars with George's face on them.
A sinecure counts as work, geopolitically, as long as
the oil is there to pay for it.  (And the bricklayers and
fibre-laying crews will be busy with real work at first.)
For psyops-dignity control the jobs can't be *too* fake.
Do not import street-sweeping machines if you need
to employ lots of street-sweepers.

A doubling takes more than a decade.  You can do a lot
of social manipulation in that time.  Free birth control at
the oil-paid-for clinics.  TV time for agreeable clerics,
jail for disagreeable ones.

Odd to see you underestimate the capabililties of a
blood & oil crazed US unencumbered by even shreds
of a bill of rights.
