1. Get large jelly jar with lid that can be closed tightly
2. Fill the jelly jar with water to the tippy top.
3. Close the lid to the jelly jar very, very tight.
4. Wait until mommy and daddy are in a really bad mood.
5. Put the jelly jar in the freezer compartment of the 
   refrigerator at about 6 am, just before breakfast
6. Listen for jelly jar to 'pop' with the expanding water
   and ice.
7. Giggle.
8. Watch and feel mommy and daddy explode over you when they
   discover the mess inside the freezer.

Love and Peace
