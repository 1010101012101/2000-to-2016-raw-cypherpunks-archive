It's an excellent ruling, even though it is only allowing the
doctor to recover damages for the parts of the kidnapping that
happened in Mexico and not the time he spent in jail in the US
before he was acquitted.  The Justice Department said they'll appeal,
and given the impending campaign to capture Osama bin Laden,
which this could interfere with, they'll probably win.
But it's the Right Thing to do.
