    Methamphetamine Bill Resurfaces on Capitol Hill
    posted by cicero on Saturday September 23, @04:43AM
    from the accelerating-speed-bill dept.

    Everyone thought the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act
    had died this summer, but a source close to the issue tells us the
    Senate has resurrected this nasty bit of legislation. Among other
    things, the bill would ban links to drug-related websites. It didn't
    quite get enough momentum on its own, so some of our more censorhappy
    congresscritters attached it to the entirely unrelated Bankruptcy
    Reform Act, part of which could allow police to conduct secret
    searches of your home. That bill is currently before a conference
    committee, which has only about a week left to finish it before
    Congress adjourns for the year. You may want to contact your
    legislators before it's too late.
