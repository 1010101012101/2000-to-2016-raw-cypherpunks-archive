I don't understand chemistry.

Something in this scandal stinks to me.

How did this was unnoticed for about 6? years?

Especially when the diesel consumption on the road
is visibly less than in a test environment?

As suggested in news, likely competitors reversed 
engineered the cars to see how VW managed to do this.
