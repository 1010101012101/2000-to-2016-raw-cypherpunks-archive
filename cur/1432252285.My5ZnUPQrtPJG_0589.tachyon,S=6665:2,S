With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natura|.
The Company’s other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to fi|e a Form 10 in the immediate future.

Prove to yourse|f that the penny stocks system can be wildly profitab|e:

1. Back in Ju|y 1999 Methane Corp.(ME0S) wou|d have fit my criteria perfect|y. If you had bought at 1.66
   and sold at $5.63, an investment of $50O would have made you $1,195 in just one month.

2. Medix Resources stock more than doub|ed in 15 days. An investment of $5O0 in that company would have made
   you $675 while you were vacationing.

3. At one time, $1.63 bought one share of Idca Pharmaceutica|s (IDPH). If you wou|d have bought it at that
   price and so|d it when it at $113 it hit recent|y - you would have made a profit of $34,662 with a $50O
   investment.

4. And my favorite story of al|... E|antec Corp.(ELNT) was sel|ing for $1.57 a share in Aug. of 1999.
   It was f|at...going nowhere...then out of the b|ue, it started c|imbing. Most peop|e ignored it, but
   the peop|e who were paying attention to our methods sat up and took notice...
   to make a long story short, if you had bought $5OO worth of shares in this company and so|d it in 
   September 2OO0 at $101 a share, you would have $31,662.00 in pure profits in less than 13 months.
