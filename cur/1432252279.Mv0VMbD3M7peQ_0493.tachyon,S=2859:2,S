An never mind... the 555MH and 12.4TH its 23,000 AMD 7970 GPU equivalents,
that back in the land of plausible.

Or 158 petflops if you accept bitcoinwatch.com's sha256 to "flop" conversion
ratio.  A human brain by comparison is generally considered to be about
10-100x less than the current bitcoin network (10^15 - 10^16 ops/sec).

So maybe the bitcoin network has just enough power to simulate a single
human brain.  Except a human brain consumes 25watts and even with 23,000
7970s the bitcoin network must be using more than 5 MW.

Moore's law still has a lot of work to do to catchup with biologial
computers in efficiency and horsepower.
