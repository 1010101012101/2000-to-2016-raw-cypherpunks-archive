A figure of speech meaning what than? Shouldn't communication make thing 
clear?

This list is a rather active one. It's in English so it's fair to assume 
even if they are not Americans, a good part of the subscribed members 
are from the States. As many people in the States live in New York, one 
might go ahead and ask for a good pizza place or for the average rent 
for one room appartments. Weird. I don't think that is appropiate. But I 
will not continue on this thread.

Please do not apologise. But notice that most unprofessional spammers 
also follow the same reasoning. «I thought someone might be interested» 
some say.
