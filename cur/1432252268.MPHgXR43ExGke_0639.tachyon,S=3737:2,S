I just heard Karen Hughes of the Bush Campaign express concern about 
the status of absentee ballots being mailed AFTER the outcome of the 
election was shown to be so close. In particular, after the legal 
cut-off date.

This fits with what I just posted about concerns that Florida 
dual-citizenship residents of Israel, or tourists in Israel, sending 
in absentee ballots they had neglected to send in by the cut-off 
date. (Or, more ominously, ZOG conveniently postmarking them to match 
the law in Florida.)

[By the way, I think in my ZOG piece I mentioned Palm Beach County. 
This is not the point, as the closeness of the vote is Florida-wide. 
This is what I meant to say.]

The thing to look for is a _surge_ in ballots arriving in Florida 
absentee ballots as compared to other states. While other states may 
also have some degree of "after the fact absentee ballots," the 
incentives are higher in a razor-thin state like Florida. A surge of 
absentee ballots arriving two or three days after the controversy 
became obvious would be compelling evidence to justify further 
investigation.
