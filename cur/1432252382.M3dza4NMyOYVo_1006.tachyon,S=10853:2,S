U.S. SILENTLY TORTURES AMERICANS WITH CELL TOWER ELECTROMAGNETIC

[quote]  Each day, a nationwide scalar electromagnetic radiation
"multifunctional" radio frequency directed energy weapon attack system
employing phased array cell tower antenna transmitter/receivers and GPS
satellites, under the administration of U.S. Cyber Command and military
contractor Lockheed Martin, is used to silently and invisibly torture,
impair, subjugate, and degrade the physical and neurological health of
untold thousands of American citizens who have been extrajudicially
"targeted" by a hate- and ideology-driven domestic "disposition matrix" as
"dissidents" or "undesirables." [unquote]
