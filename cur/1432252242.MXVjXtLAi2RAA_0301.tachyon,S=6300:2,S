It's possible that the attack in the paper isn't perfectly effective.
It's also possible that the government isn't aware of the paper, or at
least hasn't organized enough yet to mount an attacked based off of this
paper. (some beauracrat in power is spending money on this piece of
malware, wants all resources behind it, or maybe other political bullshit,
and so as always the government is slowing itself down)

And finally, it's possible that TSR uses additional layers of protection,
like VPN through countries outside of US jurisdiction, so that even when
you unwrap tor TSR remains hidden.
