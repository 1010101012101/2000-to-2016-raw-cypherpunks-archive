Sorry to report Indymedias UK page is now censoring articles calling for 
the introduction of accountability technology to
deal with the stasi like situation there.Fear and loathing on the internet 
when the US,UK and AU join countries like...
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Libya, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, 
Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam as countries 
that totally or mostly control Internet access.
Also the victorian police seem to be still trying to entrap me with various 
posts calling for illegal acts posted in my name.
I only mention that in case something odd crops up here purporting to be 
from me advocating lawlessness.
PS.As the jeff gordon pool seems sadly inadequate to these dark times,I 
would like to take my money and throw it on a burning bush.
