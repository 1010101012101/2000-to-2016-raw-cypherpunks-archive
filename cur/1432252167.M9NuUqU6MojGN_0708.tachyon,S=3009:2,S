I read a piece recently titled "Assasination Politics" and although I find 
the implications quite frightening, I must say that it seems to fit well 
within the whole Anarcho-Capitalist framework. The paper outlines an 
internet based system that would allow users to anonymously contribute 
money to a fund that would be used to place a pricetag on the head of a 
tyrannical despot. Collection of the bounty would also be done anonymously 
and electronically, due to the wonders of crypto. In theory, it would keep 
politicians on the straight and narrow. Interesting idea. I'm probably on 
an FBI list for posting a link to the paper on my 
site          http://www.pjdoland.com/revolution/politics.html
