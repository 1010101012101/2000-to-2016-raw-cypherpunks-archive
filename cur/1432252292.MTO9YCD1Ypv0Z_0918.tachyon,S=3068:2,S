Well, this is what you get for not reading--or at least not 
remembering--list traffic. The forthcoming "True Names" re-issue has 
been discussed several times, including mentions in the last few 
months by both myself and, IIRC, Bill Stewart.

Here's what I wrote the last time the "The Ungoverned" was discussed"

"Vinge just won a second Hugo Best Novel for "A Deepness in the Sky,"
so maybe this means the long-delayed re-issue of "True Names" will
finally happen. (Alas, my essay for it was written several years ago,
so is even more out of date. From the instant publishing on the Net
to several years' delay in publishing in pulpspace.)"


Also, a simple query of Amazon turns up the re-issue of "True Names."
