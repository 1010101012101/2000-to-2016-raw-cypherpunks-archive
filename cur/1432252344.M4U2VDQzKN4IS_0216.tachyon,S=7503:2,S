decentralization is (imho) a very poor characterization - what is wanted is target diffusion.  in California-speak,
“It’s all about me!”  

I could care less if my access to AT&T, Twitter, etc. are broken, I DON’T use them - I do have some folks hanging off
AT&T that I do care about so access to them is important.  

To borrow from the subject line - there are -millions- of Captains
