Padilla is still in the naval brig in SC, I suppose.  The media seems to
think he's still there, or at least thought so as of mid-September.

They might be trying to do to him what they did to Hamdi, who's in Saudi
Arabia as of a month ago.

(search for Hamdi, there are 8-10 messages about it)

I don't know if Padilla has dual citizenship, so there may not be
another country that would take him.  Apparent citizen-less individuals
(mostly citizens of other countries who won't re-accept them when the
U.S. tries to deport them) end up being incarcerated indefinitely by the
INS.
