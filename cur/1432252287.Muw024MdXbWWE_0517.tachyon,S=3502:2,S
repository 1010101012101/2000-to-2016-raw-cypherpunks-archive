That's what sniper rifles with low light scopes are for: kill one or  
both or all of the cops who arrested you in this way. Cops who abuse  
the criminal system and violate constitutional rights blatantly have  
earned killing.

(A Remington 700 or Winchester 70 in .308 or .300 Savage, with  
something like a Leupold or Swarovski 7 x 40 scope, is very good for  
this kind of work. Safe shots from 200 meters away. (Yes, much longer  
shots are possible, but may miss. Do some practice at the range at 200  
m to see what I mean.) The Beltway sniper took his shots at this range  
or closer.)

Even easier in redneck, i.e., rural, regions, where most houses are  
near wooded areas.
