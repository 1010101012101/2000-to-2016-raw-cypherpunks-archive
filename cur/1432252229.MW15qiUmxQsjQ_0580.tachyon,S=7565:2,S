Mexican police hunt lynch mob


Hundreds of police and federal agents raided a Mexico City suburb on
Wednesday night after two officers were killed by an angry crowd.

More than 30 people were reportedly held after police with pictures taken in
the attack went from house to house.

They are also investigating why the two men were not rescued - despite live
TV coverage of Tuesday's events.

The two plain-clothes officers were burned alive after locals apparently
mistook them for child kidnappers.

A third policeman who was finally rescued by colleagues - three and a half
hours after the attack began - suffered serious injuries and is said to be in a
critical condition.

The attack in the southern suburb of San Juan Ixtayopan was the latest
example of mob justice by Mexicans frustrated by state corruption and
soaring crime,
correspondents say.

The men who were attacked were working on a covert drugs operation at the
time, officials said.

'Unbridled hate'

A long convoy of government vehicles sped into San Juan Ixtayopan just before
night fell on Wednesday, an official spokeswoman told the Associated Press
news agency.

The agency said 600 federal agents and hundreds of city police were involved
in the operation.

They sealed off streets and carried out house-to-house searches.


I've never seen such insanity, so much unbridled hate... It was so extreme
that you couldn't recognise them when they were set alight
TV cameraman

Mexico's Procurator General, Rafael Macedo, told Mexican television that 33
people had been detained, among them people suspected of actually carrying out
or instigating the attack, along with others who witnessed it, Efe news agency
reported.

The agents were taking photos of pupils at a primary school on Tuesday -
where two children had recently gone missing - when the attack began.

Some in the crowd thought they were kidnappers, while others were simply
angry that the alleged kidnappings had not been properly investigated.

The crowd cheered, chanted and shouted obscenities as they attacked.

Reporters reached the scene before police reinforcements, and live cameras
caught a mob beating Victor Moreles Barrera and Cristobal Martinez Martin
before
setting them alight.

"I've never seen such insanity, so much unbridled hate. They beat them with
pipes, they kicked them... It was so extreme that you couldn't recognise them
when they were set alight," an unnamed Televisa cameraman who filmed the
incident told the French news agency AFP.

At one point, the victims, blood streaming down their faces, spoke into the
cameras, confirming they were anti-terrorism agents. The gruesome footage was
given wide coverage.

Mexico City's public safety chief, Marcelo Ebrard, said back-up units were
unable to get through for more than three and a half hours because of heavy
traffic.
