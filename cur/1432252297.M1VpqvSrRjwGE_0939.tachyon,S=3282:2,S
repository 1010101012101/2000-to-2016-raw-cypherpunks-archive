Ann Coulter's solution as suggested in her column of September 14, 
2001 "This is war"  Located at: 
<http://www.townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/printac20010914.shtml>

>Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport 
>harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is 
>preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed 
>homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are 
>the ones cheering and dancing right now.
>
>
>We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert 
>them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and 
>punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German 
>cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.
