The ones absorbed by the mirror are turned into low-frequency (ie heat)
photons. There will always be a 'bell curve' effect. Most won't be
effected, some small few will. As the beam intensity goes up so does the
total number of 'interactions' betwix the mirror atoms and the beam
photons going in and exciting them little babies. At some point they fall
in a variety of cascades (again statistically determinable at least) which
again convert that intially mono-tonic photon into a variety of poly-tonic
ones.
