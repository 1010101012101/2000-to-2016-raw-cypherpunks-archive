I wonder if you can trace DNA in sewers back to the source,
esp. in an inbred locale?   (Peter?  PCR with Saddam specific
primers?)

Or did he just dig a cat-hole instead of using the infrastructure?

You can trace industrial contamination up sewer lines back to the
source.
How about the cells we shed?

Just theoretically.  Papers fnord says someone used to the good life
narced, couldn't
handle a jail cell.
