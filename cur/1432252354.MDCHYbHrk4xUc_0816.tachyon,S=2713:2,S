I think you will find that an increasing number of professional workers
and some companies are moving underground.  This has not been uncommon
in some trades in which compensation was traditionally cash-based, but
the addition of professionals is, I think, something of note.  This article
discusses the trend of decreasing voluntary tax compliance within the
U.S.  "Tax Inquiries Fall as Cheating Increases," David Cay Johnston,
 New York Times, April 14, 2003 http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/launder/regions/2003/0414inquiries.htm

In fact, many taxes individuals face are indeed mobility taxes.
