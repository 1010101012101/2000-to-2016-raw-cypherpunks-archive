+ I'll re-iterate the need for non-dynamic/safe JavaScript (e.g. Caja) & a
form of 'web asset versioning and integrity'.

    <blockquote>TLS Certificate Optimization: The Technical Details
      behind &quot;No Browser Left Behind&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Overview<br>
      <br>
      Back in early December we announced our &quot;no browser left behind&=
quot;
      initiative to the world. Since then, we have served well over 500
      billion SHA-1 certificates to visitors that otherwise would not
      have been able to communicate securely with our customers=E2=80=99 si=
tes
      using HTTPS. All the while, we=E2=80=99ve continued to present newer =
SHA-2
      certificates to modern browsers using the latest in elliptic curve
      cryptography, demonstrating that one does not have to sacrifice
      security to accommodate all the world=E2=80=99s Internet users. (If y=
ou
      weren=E2=80=99t able to acquire a SHA-1 certificate before CAs ceased
      issuing them on 2015/12/31, you can still sign up for a paid plan
      and we will immediately generate one to serve to your legacy
      visitors.)<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after we announced these new benefits for our paid
      Universal SSL customers, we started hearing from other technology
      leaders who were implementing (or already had implemented) similar
      functionality. At first glance, the logic to identify incoming
      connections that only support SHA-1 seems straightforward, but as
      we spoke with our friends at Facebook, Twitter, and Mozilla, I
      realized that everyone was taking a slightly different approach.
      Complicating the matter even further was the fact that at
      CloudFlare we not only wanted to optimize between SHA-1 and SHA-2,
      but also between RSA and the newer, but less universally supported
      ECDSA certificates. Solve the &quot;optimal certificate&quot; questio=
n
      incorrectly, and the TLS handshake will fail =E2=80=94 or get explici=
tly
      aborted by browsers that have deprecated SHA-1 entirely; solve it
      correctly, and the client and server will establish the most
      performant, secure connection available between the two endpoints.<br=
>
      <br>
      Certificate Optimization Logic<br>
      <br>
      After several trillion requests, we=E2=80=99re confident that our app=
roach
      works quite well for CloudFlare=E2=80=99s customers and their visitor=
s. If
      you have taken an alternative approach to implementation, or have
      found any exceptions/potential refinements to our logic, please
      chime in below. We remain committed to withdrawing SHA-1 support
      if, as our CEO said, &quot;a vulnerability is discovered [in our
      certificate optimization logic] which allows some form of
      downgrade attack=E2=80=94where a modern browser can be tricked into
      receiving a certificate signed with an insecure protocol=E2=80=94and =
the
      vulnerability cannot be patched&quot;.<br>
      TLS Handshake<br>
      <br>
      Before your web browser can securely exchange &quot;application data&=
quot;
      such as HTTP GET or POST requests and responses with a web server,
      it must first establish the cryptographic parameters of the secure
      session. This well-choreographed dance, known as the SSL/TLS
      handshake, commences as soon as you click, type, or get redirected
      to a URL containing the <a>&quot;https://&quot;</a> scheme. (The proc=
ess described
      below also applies to connections from any user agent =E2=80=94 not j=
ust
      browsers=E2=80=94so substitute &quot;mobile app&quot;, &quot;command-=
line utility&quot;, or
      anything else that can communicate via HTTPS.)<br>
