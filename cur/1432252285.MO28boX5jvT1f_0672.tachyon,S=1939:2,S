The only ones allowed to buy votes are the ones running for office.
And they are required to do it on credit.

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only

exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from

the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for
the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with
the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy
always followed by dictatorship." --Alexander Fraser Tyler
