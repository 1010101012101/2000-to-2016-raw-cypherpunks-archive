Stress fracture. Three weeks from graduation. The colonel said his
recommendation was that I not reapply because of my age waiver status, but
apparently his recommendation is not completely binding, so I still might
have a chance to go back in the summer, if I can demonstrate serious PT
improvement. We will see. The last seven weeks really made me even more
committed to being a Marine and seriously cemented my love for the Corps.
