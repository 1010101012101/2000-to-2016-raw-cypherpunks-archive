I don't know about OpenBSD, but supposedly Linux is getting better at
handling Winmodems, at least for the most common chipsets.
You might want to check with Perry Metzger, one of the founders of 
Wasabisystems.com,
which is a company that ports NetBSD to things; perhaps they've got
better driver sets than the OpenBSD folks.

Also, in addition to looking at openh323.org,
you should probably check out Speak Freely.
http://speakfreely.org/ has the 7.2 version,
and John Walker recently prereleased some 7.6 versions at
http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/windows/download/
and maybe http://web.tiscali.it/vitez/picophone.html

Too late for that, and some of them have reproduced already so
you won't even be keeping them out of the gene pool...
