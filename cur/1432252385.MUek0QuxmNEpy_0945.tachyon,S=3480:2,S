Actually, St. Patrick is mostly a mythical creature constructed
from the actual Roman ruling family Patricias.  The whole St. Patrick
chasing out the snakes is clearly a metaphor for the Roman church
killing off the pagans.

As is typical amonst the Roman church, the peasants, once suitably
under control are made to believe the destruction of the old way of
life was actually a blessing.  The Romans pushed this on them until
the old ways faded into the memory hole.
