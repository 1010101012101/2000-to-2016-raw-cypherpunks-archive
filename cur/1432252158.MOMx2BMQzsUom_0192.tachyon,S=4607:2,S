CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- White supremacist leader William Pierce, whose book

Timothy McVeigh, died Tuesday. He was 68.
Pierce died at his compound near Hillsboro, about 140 miles northeast of 
Charleston, said his business manager, Bob DeMarias. He became ill about 
three weeks ago from cancer, though he was never diagnosed, DeMarias said.
