#    LOS ANGELES - Attorneys Johnnie Cochran and Cameron Steward Monday 
#    announced the filing of a wrongful death complaint against the 
#    city of Los Angeles and the LAPD arising out of the shooting 
#    death of an actor at a Halloween party last year.
#    
#    The 39-year-old actor from Van Nuys was shot several times while 
#    attending a Halloween party at a mansion in Benedict Canyon. 
#    The police had been summoned by someone who complained of 
#    excessive noise.
#    
#    "As the officers were walking along an exterior walkway, Officer 
#    Hopper looked through a glass door and observed three individuals 
#    inside a small room," according to a Los Angeles Police Department 
#    statement.
#    
#    "When one of the individuals observed the officers, he suddenly 
#    produced what appeared to be a handgun and pointed it directly 
#    at Officer Hopper," the statement continued. "Officer Hopper, 
#    in fear for his life, fired several rounds from his service 
#    pistol, wounding the suspect."
#    
#    The coroner's report, obtained by the Los Angeles Times, found 
#    Anthony Dwain Lee had been shot once in the back of the head 
#    and three times in the back.
#    
#    The findings appeared to contradict the police department's quick 
#    and confident defense of officer Tarriel Hopper, who was 
#    dispatched to the late- night mansion party in Benedict Canyon 
#    based on neighbors' noise complaints.
#    
#    LAPD Lt. Horace Frank told The Times the four shots to the back 
#    "can be explained." But he said the explaining would be done 
#    after the department has time to read the coroner's report.
