 Eight House Dems Back Impeachment Probe

 Eight House Democrats have announced their support for legislation that
 would establish an impeachment inquiry into whether President Bush for
 committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the U.S. in connection with
 the Iraq war.

 HR 635 calls for "Creating a select committee to investigate the
 administration's intent to go to war before congressional authorization,
 manipulation of pre-war intelligence, encouraging and countenancing torture
 [and] retaliating against critics."

 The legislation says that the select committee should "make recommendations
 regarding grounds for possible impeachment."

 The bill, first proposed by Rep. John Conyers last month, claims that there
 is "at least a prima facie case that these actions" violated federal law.

 According to the Atlanta Progressive News, HR635 has attracted the support
 of seven co-sponsors so far, including Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA), Rep. Sheila
 Jackson-Lee (D-TX), Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Rep. Donald Payne (D-NJ), Rep.
 Charles Rangel (D-NY), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), and Rep. Lynn Woolsey
 (D-CA).
