In iceland, some portion of mortgage debts were forgiven also:
"Reports from 2012 (many of which were written by U.S. media outlets)
noted that while Iceland forgave a large amount of mortgage debt in
order to boost the economy's recovery from a financial crisis, this
action did not entail entirely wiping out all home mortgages held by
all citizens of Iceland. Rather, it involved forgiving a portion of
some mortgage debt that was tied to inflation:"

Sad thing is, a great story got bullshitted by sensationalist crap
news, and so Snopes has a field day saying how false it all is,
although they do provide the above quoted paragraph to their credit.
