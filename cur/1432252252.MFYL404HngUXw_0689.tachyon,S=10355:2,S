Nice little lick there.

I also think that some cypherpunks mistake the Corporate State for what has 
been described as Crypto-Anarchy. If large corporations in the US and the 
wealthy happen to ultimately drive the current roundup of civil rights, then 
they've effectively become the state that some Cypherpunks some vehemently 
despise. Pointing this out (or at least making the case that this is the 
state of affairs) should not by any means be equated with socialism (unless 
of course you actually believe the socialists who maintain this is an 
inherent byproduct of capitalism). In fact, it's easy to argue that the 
current Oil Crusade in Iraq is precisely for the purpose of protecting a set 
of dinosaur industries in the US. That's not the kind of capitalism I think 
most Cypherpunks espouse.
