(Another Internet centred lawyer wannabe speaks up.)

But is it worth it if you do? I like musty books. And I'm sufficiently 
antisocial
to find libraries quite pleasant. I suppose the problem is that like many 
on this
list (and in life in general), I'm not exactly fascinated by some parts of 
the law
that lawyers would realistically spend their time working on, such as wills.
Hold me back - I just can't stop reading them - if only I could write them.

What about those who manage to get into a group specializing in something like
the Internet & law? There are a few such groups, I think. I'm pretty sure 
Harvard has
one. Do things like that only make a difference if you manage to publish 
papers
while studying? (Something which, given the workload, is probably all but 
impossible.)

You mean it wasn't like in "The Firm" where all the firms chase after you, 
offering you
wads of cash? That's a bit disappointing.

Hmm. I guess I'll continue with the question from above - if you make a 
point in
specializing in something like International law and jurisdiction (while 
possibly being
active in a specialized group like the Harvard Internet Law group, or a 
similar group
in a school that would actually accept me), and have a good technical 
background to
back it up, what are your chances of doing something interesting? Any call 
for criminal
lawyers who actually understand how hacks and cracks work?

I was thinking about law because it interests me, and because I really just 
sort of fell
into programming and security as a result of not knowing what else to do. I 
never
meant for it to become some sort of "career."

Screw 9th - who was first?
