Nope.  They care that the Fritz chip is enabled whenever
their content is played.  There's no need to make it a legal
requirement if the market makes it a practical requirement.
The Linux folks just won't be able to watch the latest
Maria Lopez or Jennifer Carey DVDs.  But who cares about a few
geeks?  Only weirdos install alternative OSs anyhow, they can be
ignored.  Most of them will probably have second systems
with the Fritz chip enabled anyhow.
