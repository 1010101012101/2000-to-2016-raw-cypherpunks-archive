Doing What it Takes

By Bob Ferchat and Tony Carlson

Monday morning in the bowels of the local football shrine.

Fifty-eight-plus hulking millionaires sit licking their collective wounds, =
watching a flickering image at the front of the room while one man with a l=
aser pointer picks apart their performance of the previous day.

=93You missed that block, Johnson.  Have you never seen a stunt before?  An=
d Bellikowski, look here . . . what were you thinking?=94

It=92s a scene played out in 31 NFL cities after every game, win or lose.  =
The coaching staff have spent much of the previous 12 hours poring over the=
 film record of every player=92s on-field performance.  And now it=92s time=
 for the reckoning.

The objective is not punitive, although clearly some careers live and die i=
n the unforgiving light of the video-camera.  Rather, it is improvement.  C=
onstant, unrelenting improvement, in execution and in knowledge of the comp=
etition=92s ability.  The goal? Positive results next Sunday.
Football teams are not the only ones to dissect their efforts. Baseball=92s=
 gazillionaires, too, are infamous for finding minute hitches in their swin=
gs or faulty pitch release points after they study tape.

Now that business executives are being showered with enormous compensation =
packages =96 in the same stratosphere as star athletes =96 shouldn=92t we e=
xpect similar post mortem examinations of their performance as a matter of =
course?  After all, what=92s at stake is a bit more than a friendly wager o=
r bragging rights.  It could be people=92s pension nest eggs . . . or livel=
ihoods.


Does the public allow sports figures to retreat or make excuses for losing =
or to utter =91no comment=92? Can an athlete who has lost or performed belo=
w his personal best escape the camera to explain not just what happened but=
 why and what he or she is planning to avoid a recurrence? Not a chance.=20


Should business executives expect any less than to be required to analyze t=
heir failures admit errors and provide plans to avoid repetition?  Can=92t =
see why they should.

Is the baseball or football game more important? Are business people untouc=
hable, their egos too fragile, to allow their actions to be examined under =
a microscope?  Are they above asking coaches and other experts to give them=
 an objective view on what can be done to improve the odds of success? It t=
akes some kind of chutzpah to suggest a negative answer to any of those que=
stions.

If there were a rigorous process of examining the impact of decisions after=
 the fact, the CEO would clearly be better equipped to explain the results =
to outside critics rather than relying on his memory or oversimplified trui=
sms.  Engineers constantly examine designs that work and endure the rigors =
of use. Lawyers use precedent as their basis of action. Neither profession =
would dream of leaning on long-ago learning and current intuition as the ke=
y sources for decision-making. Who would choose a doctor who does not consu=
lt on the diagnosis, or who does not keep up to date on developments? Peer =
reviews are standard procedure in most professions. Why not for business ca=
ses?

Imagine this:  The CEO of XYZ Ltd. calls a meeting of his senior executives=
 shortly after they announce a decision to close a plant, abandon a busines=
s segment or lay off thousands of employees.=20

Taking the floor at the front of the boardroom, the CEO opens the discussio=
n by saying: =93Ladies and gentlemen, we have just announced a decision tha=
t deals a body blow to our shareholders and our fellow employees. What went=
 wrong? When did it go wrong? How could we have been more sensitive, read t=
he signs earlier? The meeting will be over when we get the answers. Any que=
stions?=94

Think that happens?  Not so=92s you=92d notice.  But what if the CEO then s=
aid this:  =93I have asked Joe and Susan from Garfinkel and Hudson to help =
us with this examination.=94

Athletes of all kinds are constantly seeking outside opinions from proven e=
xperts, looking for often minute adjustments that will enable them to impro=
ve. These coaches and experts may not be able to perform at the level of th=
e people they advise, but they do provide invaluable input, the dispassiona=
te outside perspective, the softer focus on events that may be happening at=
 the periphery of the company=92s vision. =20


Or consider this.  Suppose, before opening up the floor for discussion, our=
 CEO said one more thing:  =93And Joe and Susan have tapes.=94


Imagine the silence.  Imagine the message that would send: we expect people=
 who are compensated at an elite level to perform at that level . . . or do=
 their damnedest to get there. And you can=92t hide.


Video recording is not as cheap as a paper copying machine, but in the big =
picture it=92s close enough. Why do we not use it more in business to recor=
d the decision process for future reference?  And do it both for the hits a=
nd the misses.=20

When sports teams review performance on tape, they do not cut players for s=
ingle mistakes or imperfect executions, although clearly they will for fail=
ure to learn, for not trying to improve or for not accepting coaching. Is t=
hat a bad thing? Surely that process can cut through the clutter of organiz=
ational politics in favor of real meritocracy.


Now, obviously, putting video cameras in board and meeting rooms would be a=
n enormous shock to most organizations.  But clearly, as misjudgments and m=
iscalculations continue to manifest themselves in job losses, profit squeez=
es and share price erosion, executives and directors need better tools to e=
xamine their decision making.  Maybe not video, but then again, why not?


Business people, like athletes, cannot expect to hit a home run on every pl=
ay, but they are fully capable of studying performance -- using, accumulati=
ng statistics and profiting from improved execution. This analysis would gi=
ve business schools better empirical tools, whether they use the case metho=
d or not. And ultimately, it would improve business performance which not o=
nly helps executives and boards, but also translates into better times for =
customers and employees.

In the end, whether the game is business or sports, the devil is in the det=
ails. Improving a golf swing, a slider or a balance sheet is a detailed and=
 subtle business. All need critical analysis, perhaps even slow-motion, fra=
me-by-frame examination and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics.=
=20

It all begins with the recognition that performance excellence is the imper=
ative.  And getting there requires help.

            <p>Think that happens? Not so's you'd notice. But what if the CEO 
              then said this: &quot;I have asked Joe and Susan from Garfinkel 
              and Hudson to help us with this examination.&quot;</p>

              Where did we go wrong?</i></font></p>
            <p>Athletes of all kinds are constantly seeking outside opinions from 
              proven experts, looking for often minute adjustments that will enable 
              them to improve. These coaches and experts may not be able to perform 
              at the level of the people they advise, but they do provide invaluable 
              input, the dispassionate outside perspective, the softer focus on 
              events that may be happening at the periphery of the company's vision.

            <p> Or consider this. Suppose, before opening up the floor for discussion, 
              our CEO said one more thing: &quot;And Joe and Susan have tapes.&quot;</p>
            <p> Imagine the silence. Imagine the message that would send: we expect 
              people who are compensated at an elite level to perform at that 
              level . . . or do their damnedest to get there. And you can't hide.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Video recording is not as cheap as a paper copying machine, but 
              in the big picture it's close enough. Why do we not use it more 
              in business to record the decision process for future reference? 
              And do it both for the hits and the misses. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When sports teams review performance on tape, theydo not cut players 
              for single mistakes or imperfect executions, although clearly they 
              will for failure to learn, for not trying to improve or for not 
              accepting coaching. Is that a bad thing? Surely that process can 
              cut through the clutter of organizational politics in favor of real 
              meritocracy.</p>
            <p>Now, obviously, putting video cameras in board and meeting rooms 
              would be an enormous shock to most organizations. But clearly, as 
              misjudgments and miscalculations continue to manifest themselves 
              in job losses, profit squeezes and share price erosion, executives 
              and directors need better tools to examine their decision making. 
              Maybe not video, but then again, why not?</p>

            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">Business people, like athletes, cannot expect to hit 
              a home run on every play, but they are fully capable of studying 
              performance -- using, accumulating statistics and profiting from 
              improved execution. This analysis would give business schools better 
              empirical tools, whether they use the case method or not. And ultimately, 
              it would improve business performance which not only helps executives 
              and boards, but also translates into better times for customers 
              and employees.</p>
            <p> <br>
              In the end, whether the game is business or sports, the devil is 
              in the details. Improving a golf swing, a slider or a balance sheet 
              is a detailed and subtle business. All need critical analysis, perhaps 
              even slow-motion, frame-by-frame examination and a comprehensive 
              understanding of the mechanics. </p>
            <p>It all begins with the recognition that performance excellence 
              is the imperative. And getting there requires help. </p>
