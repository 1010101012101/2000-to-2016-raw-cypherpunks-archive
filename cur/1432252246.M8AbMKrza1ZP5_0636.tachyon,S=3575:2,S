Dear Sir:

FL polling stations -- at least in my county -- have two boxes with
locks.  When voting is over, up to a dozen voluntary poll workers lock
the used and unused ballots in a small box.  They lock it up and two of
them must drive the box to a central collection office.

Other polling station equipment is left at the polling site -- the vote
machines, office supplies, and such are left in the polling place -- be
it a school room, the American Legion Hall, or a church site.  The office
supplies are to be put in a large locked box -- left at the polling place
for subsequent pickup by reps of the County Supervisor of Elections.

Finding a large, locked box in the polling place is quite natural.  It
contains no ballots -- only pens, staple machines, posters and such.
