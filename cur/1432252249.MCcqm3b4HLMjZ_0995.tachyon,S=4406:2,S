Has an NSA "analyst" cum "Center" for "Democracy" and Technology
"analyst" saying, yes, Virginia, Commercial Software has, indeed, NSA
Backdoors In It.


Lions and Tigers and Backdoors, Oh, My.

Frankly, I expect that NSA would be remiss in their grope-age indeed if
they *didn't* try to get a backdoor into anything it could, and, of
course, I would expect that the um, spuke version of the Misian
calculation problem itself would take care of those efforts; WTMI, fall
of totalitarian hierarchy, routing around surveillance as damage, and all
that. If not simple counter-sniffage, for that matter, as the average
31337 hacker-dude, if not cypherpunk, would see fairly clearly, and has
been going on as long as said sniffage was possible.


However, it amuses me more -- as long as I don't think too hard about it
- -- that any such ostensible "privacy advocacy organization" would use the
same old Randian Legislation-threat fund-raising-FUD game (or, maybe it's
the same old Randian Legislation-promise fund-raising-FUD game,
whatever), on something as demonstrably *testable* as the old NSA
back-door-FUD gag.

I mean, can't they be a little more *creative*, fer chrissakes? How
stupid do they think the public really is?

Oh. Right. I forgot...

Cheers,
RAH
