MS recruits for Palladium microkernel and/or DRM platform
By John Lettice
Posted: 13/08/2002 at 10:23 GMT
Microsoft's efforts to disassociate Palladium from DRM seem to have hit=20
their first speed bump. Some voices within the company (and we currently=20
believe these voices to be right and sensible) hold the view that Palladium=
=20
has to be about users' security if it's to stand any chance of winning=20
hearts and minds, and that associating it with protecting the music=20
business' IP will be the kiss of death. So they'll probably not be best=20
pleased by the Microsoft job ad that seeks a group program manager=20
"interested in being part of Microsoft's effort to build the Digital Rights=
=20
Management (DRM) and trusted platforms of the future (Palladium)."

Oh dear. It's one of a clutch of Palladium job ads currently up on the=20
site, and is the most blatantly off-message one. While the authors of=20
Microsoft's discussion white paper on Palladium say, "Palladium will not=20
require Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology, and DRM will not=20
require Palladium... They are separate technologies," the author of this ad=
=20
continues: "Our technology allows content providers, enterprises and=20
consumers to control what others can do with their digital information,=20
such as documents, music, video, ebooks, and software. Become a key leader,=
=20
providing vision and industry leadership in developing DRM, Palladium and=20
Software Licensing products and Trust Infrastructure Services. If you are=20
looking for an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a critical new=
=20
area for MS and a position with autonomy and growth, then this is an ideal=
=20
position."

Content providers controlling their documents, music, video, ebooks, a=20
critical new area for MS, oh dear oh dear. And we quite liked: "Additional=
=20
responsibilities include defining the industry..." Gosh, the whole=20
industry? That's a responsible job, but we thought Microsoft was supposed=20
to have given this sort of thing up. The post will also "include=20
collaboration and technology sharing across CSBU [Content Security Business=
=20
Unit, whose bag Palladium is] and with other MS teams, such as Office, STS,=
=20
Avalon, CLR, Windows Media Foundation, eHome, Pocket PC, Mira, MSXML, GXA,=
=20
and .Net Framework."

There's a handy list of current MS teams for you, people. So Windows Media=
=20
is a Foundation now, and what's an Avalon when it's at home, anyone?

Job two, SDE lead, is much more on message and quite interesting, as it=20
provides some clues about the way Palladium will be built. "What is=20
Palladium? We are a windows team working on new, trust-oriented Windows=20
features, re-architecting and re-developing the Windows PC platform from=20
the hardware up. We will dramatically enhance the level of Security=20
available to any customer who wishes to enhance the Privacy, Security, and=
=20
Data/Content Protection aspects of their applications. We will offer=20
customers a very high level of data protection, no matter where they live,=
=20
who they are, or what they are trying to protect." Aside from that=20
Data/Content Protection, it's almost unworrying. Here's the techie bit:

"Own lean and mean team of 4 senior developers building the very guts of=20
this new security software. This is one of the very few opportunities to=20
build a micro-kernel from scratch. We=92re keeping everything that=92s cool=
=20
about a micro-kernel and nothing that=92s not. Responsibilities include:=20
abstraction of hardware from the security modes of the new CPUs to=20
cryptographic input devices, process control, from laying out the image in=
=20
memory, to providing system services, from providing memory management to=20
interrupt handling, from a debugger to the fundamentals of structured=20
exception handling. No file system, no networking, nothing complicated,=20
only elegant. This is a dream job."

Indeed it is. The approach sounds similar to the one the early NT=20
development team took, before marketing started maiming the thing.

Also wanted is a secure application architect, who "will be responsible for=
=20
application strategy and design. The Secure Application Architect will work=
=20
with development, marketing and internal and external customers to identify=
=20
trusted application scenarios that will be supported. He/she will then be=20
responsible for executing the strategy: providing support and guidance for=
=20
application developers, and working with the internal Palladium team to=20
ensure that the necessary system services and infrastructure are in place."=
=20
So this one could be the nark. Apply here, here or here. =AE

Great reversed engineered intelligence from the carrion eaters."I wanna=20
bite that hand so badly..."Especially after a night and a day at the Opera.
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26645.html
If your using free Opera,you can get rid of the ads with a little=20
hacking...just don't get caught now its a class A felony.
