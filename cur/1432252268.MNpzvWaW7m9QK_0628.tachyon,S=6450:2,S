Sure. I also get invited to speak to the US and UK government. If they
*didn't* check me out, they would be rather remiss. You wouldn't want
one of the Bad Guys to visit the MoD or NSC shindig, right?

In fact, one intriguing issue is government self-surveillance. When
the Army invites me to a meeting, no doubt the NSA has to check out
the people attending - they are dealing with somebody in the network
of "interesting" people! Ah, yes, obvious Swedish military and crazy
libertarian connections, hey - double second-order links to Assange!
...wait, a third order link to *Saddam*?! And vice versa, by going to
that meeting I am now by definition an "interesting" person and my
government contacts are worth checking out a bit more... The problem
is of course to rein in the spread of who to keep tabs on - and big
data is providing its own apparent solution: "all of them". Plus that
large scale trawling will tend to pick up lots of things just by
default. Which actually means that various agencies are gathering data
other agencies would rather not have gathered. Just ask David
Petraeus. At least humans know better than to spy on the boss, but the
software can't tell the president apart from another suspiciously
well-connected person who is meeting with shady people.

Add to this the normal craziness of intelligence ( http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/spook-century.html
) and there is plenty of potential for tragicomedy.

But the upshot of this is not that I should keep silent: *it doesn't
matter*. I am in this mess whatever I do, even if I follow the best
opsec and sigint practice. The risk of me being targeted is less
affected by my actual activities and more affected by arbitrary group
memberships.

The most worrisome effect is that a certain kind of people take those
putative flags very seriously, and deliberately live amazingly bland
lives. You can see the young politicians who have nearly no net shadow
except party activities, and plan on being electable because they have
no scandals. You can see it among the admin people who aim at
conforming maximally, thinking this is a clever career move. The
problem is that this can lead to a feedback loop: if the officers
vetting you have a perspective of what a proper life is based on their
own conformist lives, they will gather people like themselves in the
institutions of power. Most bureaucracies love bureaucrats, because
they make sense to bureaucrats.

But this is specific problem that is more narrow than the general
problem of *badly founded* fear of omnipresent and omnicompetent
Powers making people conform.
