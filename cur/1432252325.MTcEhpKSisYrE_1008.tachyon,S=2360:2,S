There may be a viable opportunity for an off-shore private medical 
insurance carrier which does not use your social security number as your 
identifier to the medical service provider.  Due to excessive U.S. fed and 
state insurance regulations many/most doctors might refuse to accept it (at 
least initially) it may be necessary for this insurance to operate "off 
network" so that subscribers would have to pay the care giver and be 
reimbursed.
