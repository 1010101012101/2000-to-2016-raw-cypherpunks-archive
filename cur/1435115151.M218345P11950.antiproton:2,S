	I disagree. "Ted Smith" is explicitly whining about me 

	"But now there are 2-3 posters who continually post random
	conspiracy crap" 

	and given the 'context' of the thread, Cathal is also commenting
	on those '2 or 3' posters. Zeenan - and me.

	So, did you look me up in the NSA database or not? That was the
	exercise.

	Your first conjecture is unwarranted. People from all over the
	world rightly despise the US government and its supporters. 

	Now, if my 'rhetoric' drew inspiration from che guevara you
	might deduce that I'm from south america. However my
	'rhetoric' (political philosophy actualy) can be traced to the
	likes of Lysander Spooner and other private property anarchists,
	who, I assure you, aren't popular authors in south america. Or
	anywhere else for that matter.

	Okay. So now we've descended into psychobable. 'identity
	crisis'? Mildly amusing. 

	You did a couple of searches and correctly found out that I
	come from argentina - the info is in the public domain. And
	based on that, you are making up a story.

	Now that's interesting. How do you go from "good english"* to
	"not european"? If anything, europeans from germanic countries
	are likely to speak (way) better english than me. 

	*and my english is so so at any rate.

	Nominally, yes. I was born here and that's it. 

	Now find out what government (terrorist organization) I work
	for. Take into account that the argentine government isn't
	going to pay me or anybody else to discuss libertarian
	principles on an obscure mailing list. 


	Anyway, this is getting too boring. I suggest you ask "Ted
	Smith" to post some real cypherpunk stuff. Like, how great the
	pentagon's anonimity network is and how it spreads cancer, I
	mean democracy in china. Or something.
