They always were. The 'commercial' distinction about 'press' is a false
and unconstitutional distinction.

The Constitution speaks of 'the press', not as a bunch of fame and profit
seeking opportunists, but as a free and available mechanism for
individuals to discuss their views and desires (this mailing list is a
perfect example as is a private mailbox. What todays modern press does is
a bastardization of intent and a whoring for fame and profit; as opposed
to fostering real discussion and change in our society.

Some Jefferson quotes to demonstrate the distinction:

No government ought to be without censors; and when the press is free, no
one ever will. Nature has given to man no other means of sifting out the
truth either in religion, law or politics. I think it as honorable to the
government neither to know or notice its sycophants or censors as it would
be undignified and criminal to pamper the former and persecute the latter.

At a very early period in my life I determined never to put a sentence
into any newspaper. I have religiously adhered to the resolution through
my life and have great reason to be contented with it. Were I to undertake
to answer the calumnies of the newspapers it would be more than all my
time and twenty aids could effect. For, while I should be answering one,
twenty new ones would be invented. I have thought it better to trust to
the justice of my countrymen that they would judge me by what they see of
my conduct on the stage they have placed me.

You lump the majority into a fraction. A prime example of the self-serving
dellusion of cash and fame on the truth.
