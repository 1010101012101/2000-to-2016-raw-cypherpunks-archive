Subject: Cold War-era FBI memos show how close the US came to
declaring Martial Law | Private Prisons "cherry pick" their populace

** The top secret Cold War plan to bring the United States under martial law
------------------------------------------------------------


** 12,949 individuals would immediately be detained as a likely threat
to national security for their ties to "subversive organizations."
------------------------------------------------------------

Starting on April 19, 1956, the federal government practiced and
planned for a near-doomsday scenario known as Plan C. When activated,
Plan C would have brought the United States under martial law, rounded
up over ten thousand individuals connected to "subversive"
organizations, implemented a censorship board, and prepared the
country for life after nuclear attack.

There was no Plan A or B.



** In Florida, clear guidelines give private prisons priority
------------------------------------------------------------
Those with serious medical or psychological issues are left to the state

Do private prisons “cherry pick” inmates, leaving state Corrections
departments saddled with offenders in need of more expensive care?
While it’s not quite selecting from a line up, they do set the
guidelines for who’s in or out.


** North Carolina’s 1033 program data is clearly public, says state
Attorney General
------------------------------------------------------------


** "Air Force Cyber Vision 2025" includes quantum processors,
self-healing code, and next-gen "cyber-warriors"
------------------------------------------------------------
