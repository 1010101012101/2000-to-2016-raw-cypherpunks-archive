Right.

My own personal opinion is that the more *money* is controlled with
cryptography and moved/stored on the internet, the stronger those
technologies will become, and, unfortunately, not for any other reason.
Like Whit Diffie has said, "cyberwar" will be "fought" by businesses, and
not nation-states.

Government black-bag jobs are just one of many kinds of theft...
