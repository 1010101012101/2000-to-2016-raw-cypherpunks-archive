1. You never contribute anything that indicates you have actually 
learned.

2. Your questions, such as the ones I gave as examples of your recent

number theory books.

The conclusions are obvious. You are either a bot or a noob.

Yep, a noob, whatever that is.

Start contributing or leave. You've been posting textbook paragraphs 
and asking us to fill in the next line for way too many months.
