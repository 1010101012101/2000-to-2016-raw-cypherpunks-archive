THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

The Republican and Democratic members of the card examiners
have agreed on objective standards.

    o if any corner of the "chad" is broken, then it is a choice.
    o merely indented or even "pregnant" (sunshine) are not a choice

As far as I know, two opposing choices is still an invalidated ballot

Hey, Tim, put your wife on the list so we can talk
to the rational one.

If I ever find out your real name and where you live,
I'm going to come over and deal with you.

I'm going to lick you.
Lick, Lick, Lick, Slobber, Lickity-lick-lick-lick.
Yum, stupid white trash.
