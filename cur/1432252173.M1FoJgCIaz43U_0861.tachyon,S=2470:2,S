   well, I don't know about those two, but I've found Road Runner sometimes
blocking mail from ameritech, or at least from part of ameritech. When I asked
why my mail to their user was being bounced, their reply was that someone on my
subnet was spamming. So then I just had to disconnect my dsl line and reconnect
to get on a different subnet and then my mail would go thru, but what sheer
idiocy.
