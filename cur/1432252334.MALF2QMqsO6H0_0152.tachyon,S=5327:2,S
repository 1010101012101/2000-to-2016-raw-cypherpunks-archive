ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

RE:TRANSFER OF U$21,500.000{TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY.

I AM A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION(NNPC) SOMETIME AGO, A
CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A FOREIGN FIRM IN THE PTF BY
MY COMMITTEE. THIS CONTRACT WAS OVER INVOICED TO THE
TUNE OF US$21.5M US DOLLARS. THIS WAS DONE
DELIBRATELY. THE OVER- INVOICING WAS A DEAL BY MY
COMMITTEE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT. WE NOW WANT TO
TRANSFER THIS MONEY WHICH IS IN A SUSPENSE ACCOUNT
WITH PTF INTO ANY OVERSEA ACCOUNT WHICH WE EXPECT YOU
TO PROVIDE FOR US.

SHARE:

60% WILL BE FOR MY PARTNERS AND ME.
30% OF THE MONEY WILL BE YOURS FOR PROVIDING THE
ACCOUNT WHERE WE SHALL REMIT THE MONEY.
10%  HAS BEEN MAPPED OUT FROM THE TOTAL  SUM TO COVER
ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY US DURING THE
COURSE  OF THIS TRANSFER, BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL
EXPENSES.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT SIMILAR TRANSACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT WITH ONE MR. PATRICE MILLER, PRESIDENT
OF CRANE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORP. OF 153 EAST 57TH
ST; 28TH FLOOR, NY10022, TELEPHONE: 212-3087788 AND
TELEX:6731689. THE DEAL WAS CONCLUDED AND ALL COVERING
DOCUMENTS WERE FOWARDED TO MR. MILLER TO AUTHENTICATE
THE CLAIM. ONCE THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED, MR. MILLER
PRESENTED HIS BANK WITH ALL THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND
REMITTED THE WHOLE FUNDS TO ANOTHER BANK  ACCOUNT AND
DISAPPEARED  COMPLETELY. MY COLLEAGUES WERE SHATTERED,
SINCE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY.
AT THIS JUNCTURE, I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING US IN THIS DEAL, WE
WOULD REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM YOU,
WHICH WOULD ENABLE US MAKE FORMAL APPLICATION TO THE
VARIOUS MINISTRIES\PARASTATAL FOR THE RELEASE AND
ONWARD TRANSFER OF THE MONEY  TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THE
INFORMATION WE REQUIRE ARE:

YOUR  NAME, COMPANY`S NAME, ADDRESS , TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK NAME ,ADDRESS, TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND BENEFICIARY NAME.

WE HAVE STRONG RELIABLE CONNECTIONS AT THE CENTRAL
BANK OF NIGERIA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS TO
ASSIST US IN THE DEAL, AND WHEN IT IS FINALLY
CONCLUDED WE SHALL USE SAME CONTACTS TO WITHDRAW ALL
DOCUMENTS USED TO AVOID ANY TRACE TO YOU OR US.
IT MIGHT ALSO INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE
ORDINARY CIVIL SERVANTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS
OPPORTUNITY, SINCE WE WANT THIS MONEY TRANSFERRED
BEFORE THE NEWLY DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT
STARTS PROBING THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL PREVIOUS MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS.
PLEASE CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ABOVE TEL\FAX NUMBER
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INTRESTED IN THIS DEAL. IF YOU
ARE NOT IT WILL ENABLE ME SCOUT FOR ANOTHER FOREIGN
PARTNER TO ASSIST US. BUT IF YOU ARE INTRESTED PLEASE
SEND THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY SO THAT WE
CAN SWING INTO ACTION, SINCE TIME IS NOT ON OUR PART.
I WAIT IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR FULLEST CO-COPERATION.
YOURS FAITHFULLY,

DR.UBA JEGA.
