Hmm. So has anyone managed to get the signature to verify? Doesn't work 
for me! But perhaps things got mangled in the mail? Or I chose the wrong 
subset of the email to verify (I tried all the obvious ones)? Sending 
this stuff as attachments instead of inline would work better, of course.

Cheers,

Ben.
