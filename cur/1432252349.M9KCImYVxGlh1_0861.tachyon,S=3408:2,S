'Anarchy Express' to G8 Summit Canceled by French Railway Company

Wednesday, July 18, 2001

by Helen Studd and Richard Owen

GENOA, Italy — A special train chartered by British anti-capitalist 
activists to transport them to the G8 summit of leading industrial nations 
in Italy has been cancelled, it emerged Tuesday night.

The Globalize Resistance express, which was set to carry 450 protesters to 
the summit in Genoa, was cancelled by the French national railway, SNCF, 
protesters said.

******************

I guess they should have stuck with private transportation.
