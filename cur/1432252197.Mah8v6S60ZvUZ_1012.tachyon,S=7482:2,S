If it's a fake, it's a damn subtle one. I've read the transcript, but not
seen
the tape. The contents do not unequivocally prove UBL to be behind the
9/11 attacks, but it's a very reasonable inference. It does clearly show 
that UBL claiming to have foreknowledge of the attacks. If you want to go 
beyond what I consider reasonable, you could argue that UBL is taking
credit for someone else's work.

I find it difficult to believe that someone would go to the trouble of 
producing a fake,  and not use it to show UBL categorically taking
responsibility for the crime.

I'm inclined to believe the tapes reality.

Facial geometry would be an interesting test. The folks claiming to be
able to spot baddies by facial recognition systems could do an interesting
demo - feeding known pictures of UBL into their system to build a profile,
then seeing the the UBL on the tape matches. I gather the sound is pretty
poor, so voiceprints may not be doable.

Near-undetectable? I don't think so. Convincing human faces are just 
about the hardest thing to do in CGI animation. Humans are 
hardwired to recognize and differentiate between faces, and we're 
very sensitive to fakes. Look at Pixar's efforts, or the recent video 
game based movie (Final Fantasy???) No one is going to watch 
the humans in either of those for more than a few seconds without 
realizing that they are not real. CGI humans are still like dancing
bears - which are applauded not because they dance well, but
because the dance at all.

Perhaps, but I'll take the position it's real until more evidence appears
to the contrary.
