 E-Gold Under Scrutiny

 January 9th edition of Business Week contains a lengthy investigative
 report by Brian Grow on online money transfer systems like e-gold Ltd. The
 article focuses on the potential use of the e-gold payment service by those
 wanting to move money while skirting the reporting obligations associated
 with US money laundering regulations.

 Technorati Tags: E-gold, Money Transfer


 E-gold is a "digital currency." Opening an account at www.e-gold.com takes
 only a few clicks of a mouse. Customers can use a false name if they like
 because no one checks. With a credit card or wire transfer, a user buys
 units of e-gold. Those units can then be transferred with a few more clicks
 to anyone else with an e-gold account. For the recipient, cashing out --
 changing e-gold back to regular money -- is just as convenient and often
 just as anonymous.

 In an online extra, Business Week also looks at Russian-based WebMoney and
 its customers as well as at Dr. Douglas Jackson, the founder of e-gold.
