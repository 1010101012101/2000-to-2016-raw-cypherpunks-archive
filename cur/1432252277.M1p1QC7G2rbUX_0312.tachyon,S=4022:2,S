Eh?

array zero-origin  error!

"Remember, remember the fifth of *November* " as the old rhyme goes.
Last night was the fifth of December.

And that "bonefire" site killed my browser.

Here's a full version as used at Lewes in Sussex (the only county where
Bonfire is properly celebrated!).  I guess when they bring in all their
silly new laws such verses will be illegal.


Remember,Remember
The Fifth of November,
Gunpowder treason and plot;
I see no reason
Why Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.

Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes,
'Twas his intent
To blow up the King and the Parliament;
Three score barrels of powder below
Poor old England to overthrow;
By God's providence he was catch'd
With a dark lantern and burning match.

Holler boys, holler, make the bells ring,
Holler boys holler, God Save the King! 

A penny loaf to feed the Pope,
A farthing O' cheese to choke him,
A pint of beer to rinse it down,
A faggot of sticks to burn him!

Burn him in a tub of tar,
Burn him like a blazing star.
Burn his body from his head.
Then we'll say old Pope is dead!
Hip, hip, Hooray!
