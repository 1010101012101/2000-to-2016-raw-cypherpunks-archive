I know I've passed on cites more than a couple of times to try to 
educate you about things you keep missing.

You apparently don't bother to read what people suggest you read.

Security through obscurity is what you are talking about above. It is 
NOT what many of us here are talking about. Read up on remailers, 
Blacknet approaches, Gnutella/Morpheus/Freenet approaches, Pipenet, 
and even Freedom (ZKS).

Unlinkability has bandwidth costs. There are practical reasons why in 
a world of connectivity at DSL speeds some things (like large 
file-swapping) will not be practically unlinkable. But small files, 
such as text files, political tracts, digital cash, etc. is easily 
made unlinkable in a world of DSL-speed connections. Do the math.

You say you have "a nice protocol for running a fully-encrypted 
mailing list stegoized in images," but in your time on this list I 
have not seen you contribute any interesting technical ideas. 
Distributing stegoized images to a list of recipients is so banal and 
hackneyed that it barely deserves comment: of COURSE it is just 
security through obscurity...what else could it be?

(Dig up my article from 1989 on stegoizing in images to see a 
treatment of this point.)

We knew in 1992 that running the CP list as an encrypted list or 
stegoized list was pointless, given the absence of unlinkability.

You need to do some reading and some deeper thinking than you have so far done.

All well known.

You apparently don't even understand how even simple remailer chains work.

I could give examples, but this is well-trod ground. Look it up yourself.
