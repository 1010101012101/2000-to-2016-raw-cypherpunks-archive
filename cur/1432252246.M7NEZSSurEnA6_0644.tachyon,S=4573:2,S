Agreed.

Right. And a shortage of anything, cash making no exception, is solved
automatically (if the market is left alone). The value of a monetary unit
will rise until its price will be considered (by the cash holders) high
enough - that is, until they will value something else more than the cash.
Shortages are NEVER a problem if the market is left alone to clear it - they
simply indicate an undervaluation of the commodity.

Once you put the gov't into the equation, all bets are off :)
