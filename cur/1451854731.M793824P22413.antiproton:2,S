This is the **cypherpunks** mail list. Isn't the point of of being 
a punk to *question* authority, and the cypherpunk to question the 
narrative of weak authentication systems?

It seems important not to confuse the man Ian with a device and
cryptographic key that was once known to be in posession of the man,
who is now deceased.

Now if there is some reliable human witness that Ian actually keyed
that text into a device in his physical posession then I think we'd
all like to hear about it.

The only digital witness to the alleged tweets is not a particularly
credible one, in my opinion.
