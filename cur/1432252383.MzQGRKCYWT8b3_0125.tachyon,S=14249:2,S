 Dear p2p-hackers,

  After thinking about the similarities between the commons issues 
  faced by the PaulGardner-Stephen's Serval project & Zooko's Tahoe 
  LAFS, I was motivated try (yet again!) to refine my understanding 
  of currency systems, barter and money. 

  I'd like some help!
 
  These concepts seem to have direct bearing on problems that arise 
  when bootstrapping new users into a p2p/mesh system, trust, credit, 
  fairness protocols & so on, yet I lack a standard terminology for 
  talking about them in a precise way.

  First, I'd like to share a speculation:

      My guess is that it would be best if Tahoe LAFS computed all
      credits and debits in terms of its native "commodity currencies" 
      (this term is defined below) like storage, availability, bandwidth,
      latency, and priority, and then possibly mapped these things
      to other currencies via forward contracts in a fairly pluggable
      manner.
      
      While Bitcoins might be interesting as one of several possible 
      side-channels to establish "credit" for the system's own native 
      currencies when dealing with non-boostrapped strangers, or for 
      those who would otherwise hit their "debt ceiling", I'm hoping 
      that friends could still offer credits for "native" commodities
      denominated as such *directly*, without needing to think about 
      a fluctuating 3rd-party / non-native currency abstraction.


  That said, here's my first shot at defining a few terms, along with 
  a note to the Serval project that may be of more general interest:


  o  Benefit
        That which produces a net increase 
        in some desired state of being. 

  o  Intrinsic value
        Non-bartered perceived benefit.

  o  Value
        Optimally bartered perceived benefit. 

  o  Money 
        The mathematical abstraction of value 
        Note: this can be a positive or negative quantity.

  o  Currency
        The concrete manifestation of money.
        Note: currency always has a non-negative value.  

        Example: physical dollars & coins.

  o  Pure liability
        Something of negative value that isn't the result
        of owing anybody something.  
        
        Example: an inadequate reputation

  o  Debt 
        A liability resulting from owing something of 
        positive value to another party.

  o  Pure asset
        Positive value that isn't the result of someone owing you. 

        Example: good health.

  o  Credit
        A liability that another party owes to you and recognizes.
        
  o  Commodity currency
        Some fungible good or service that is easy measurable 
        and comparable, transferable and transportable, 
        sufficiently divisible and durable, widely bartered 
        with known rates of exchange, and derives its value 
        from its intrinsic usefulness rather than its role 
        as a currency or as an item of speculation predicated 
        on the existence of a greater fool.  
        
        Example: cigarettes in a POW camp.


  o  Native commodity currency
        A commodity currency whose production and consumption
        are intrinsic to the economy itself.
        
        Example:  Carpool rides in a ride-sharing network.
        

  o  Collectible currency
        Like a commodity currency, except that its value comes 
        from the mutual speculation of those who create demand 
        for it, rather than its intrinsic worth to any end user.
  
        Example 1:
           Bitcoin is a perfect example of a collectible currency 
           because its intrinsic worth is exactly zero (you can't 
           even use them to line the bottom of a bird cage). 


        Example 2: 
           Gold and silver are best thought of as being somewhere 
           between commodity and collectible currencies; however, 
           the volatility of silver prices relative to its supply 
           and industrial demand shows it's more on the speculation-
           driven "collectible" side if things.  


  o  Fiat obligation currency
        Like a collectible currency, except that every unit created 
        represents the transfer of value from someone who has actually
        produced a good or service of non-zero intrinsic worth to a 
        person or institution that has offered nothing in exchange 
        for it but the currency itself.  Crucially, the production 
        of fiat obligation currency is restricted by law, and demand 
        for it is created by requiring its use.  Hence, every unit 
        represents a claim by its producer to simply extract things 
        of actual value from those who cannot create the currency 
        themselves, and yet are bound to use it by law or necessity.

        Example:  
           The deceptively named "Fed", a group of privately owned
           for-profit banks, create legal tender (US dollars) out 
           of thin air, then "exchange" them for US Treasury for 
           T-bills. The T-bills have real value in that they represent
           fractional ownership of the US government's ability to 
           extract goods and services from its own citizens, and from
           the citizens of foreign countries.  To do this at home, it 
           puses the IRS, federal marshals, and the legal system. 
           Abroad,  it uses military and/or political power to enforce 
           its will directly, or it can use intermediaries in its thrall,
           such as the IMF, The World Bank, various resource-rich or 
           strategic client governments, and so-called "Coalitions of 
           the Willing".  Hence, every dollar represents the assertion 
           of a one-sided obligation; they aren't coupons for anything 
           of intrinsic value that the Fed used to barter with the 
           US Treasury in exchange for a fraction of the tribute our
           government is able to demand.  Instead, they are more like
           souvenirs commemorating an outright confiscation of it that 
           has already taken place. The obscene material wealth and 
           power held by those happy few who are on the receiving end 
           of this arrangement is the direct result of the compulsory 
           exchange of intrinsically valuable goods and services for 
           inherently valueless slips of paper decorated with stars, 
           eagles, and the faces of dead presidents. 


  o Fiat commonwealth currency 
        Like a fiat obligation currency, except that the value 
        extracted in the process of its creation goes to the community's 
        own public fund, rather than being siphoned off by a private 
        aristocracy.  
        
        Example (I think):  
            Treasury-issued "United States Notes".


 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Here are some comments I made to the Serval project recently.
  I'd love to get some feedback on them.  
  
  Hopefully, the ideas I'm tossing around are of wide enough 
  applicability to merit general interest and/or or an 
  informed & corrective critique
 -----------------------------------------------------------------


    Serval already has at least three commodities with universal value,
    and native non-speculative demand: bandwidth, latency, and priority.  
    Using these in combination with a system of reputation and credit as 
    a "commodity currency" makes a lot more sense than dragging in a 
    collectible currency.

    Assuming nodes in a Serval mesh are free to associate in different
    virtual communities of reputation (as humans do in real life), 
    all a community needs to do is restrict mesh access ("the commons")
    in ways it sees fit to discourage behavior it dislikes, or grant 
    special credit for positive actions (eg: donating bandwidth, 
    particularly in times of shortage).  It seems as though you could
    even model the policies of Serval "community" as an autonomous
    System (AS) on the Internet, and then go on to think about 
    communities honoring each other's credits with bandwidth, latency, 
    and priority as parameters like a AS-AS forex.  This would keep every 
    community free from central domination by other groups, yet open to 
    engage in mutually beneficial data transfers. It seems likely that 
    a few huge communities would naturally arise, along with lots of 
    little ones. Users might like to have different policies for each 
    of them, as different levels of generosity (or blind trust) might be 
    appropriate; one might have reputations in personal groups, affinity, 
    regional/global, etc.  It seems like the core requirement is the 
    ability to assign a policy profile to a group ID, and the ability 
    to have more than one.  

    If someone with a sufficiently large balance and community reputation 
    never gets bumped by somebody who might be free-riding or has no 
    reputation, it makes sense to build a positive and credible 
    "accounts receivable" bandwidth balance.  Someone could always cheat 
    you with a series of bogus IDs, if doing so entails them being 
    second-class citizens the entire time, there isn't much incentive.
  
    I think it's good to place the main focus on first degree contacts, 
    as has been done with great success in hawala networks.  The hawala 
    system is well known for its efficiency and real-world security, even 
    over wide geographical areas lacking any common authority sanctioned
    to use powers of state (such as garnishment) in order to enforce 
    contracts. Reputation-based access to the commons can go a long way 
    to regulate behavior.   Diamond traders that operate via handshake
    agreements are another nice example of regulation by community 
    restriction.  More generally, the principles and practices of 
    Islamic banking look like they're worthy of serious study.  
    I've only begun to explore this topic, but the prohibition against 
    outright interest seems to have generated a fascinating array of 
    partnership-oriented contracts and non-leveraged financial 
    relationships -- all with a bare minimum of bookkeeping. 

    If an adversary's goal is to hunt down all copies of a message and 
    destroy it, another consideration emerges:  perservering ignorance.

    Example: Julian Assange has no idea how to reclaim all
             copies of insurance.aes256; therefore, he cannot 
             be forced to help anybody else do so either, even
             under the threat of torture.

             Had a recording been made of every person who 
             downloaded the file, then thugs could go after
             these people too, even if they number in the
             tens of thousands.  However, what if these 
             folks placed the same data on the net in a
             way that couldn't be detected, and was then
             downloaded by yet another set of people 
             that's unknown to the first group.  
             
             The same logic applies to the release of the 
             key to unlock the encrypted data.  You probably 
             want some sort of anonymous quorum where the
             various members don't actually know all the 
             other members, but share an ability to look
             at a common "outer envelope" wrapping a sig
             and an inner blob.  The disconnected cliques 
             have these blob-bearing coconuts floating 
             between them, yet the inner blob part within
             the coconut cannot be cracked solo by any 
             one clique;  however portions of the key 
             to crack it can be posted publicly by them 
             (in any form: wrapped by the group envelope
             or not, steganographically or not, signed 
             or not, and so on).




                        Cheers,
                        -Jon
