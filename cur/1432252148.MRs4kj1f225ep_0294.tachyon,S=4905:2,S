Feh.  Voting for the occasional crazy may be worthwhile
(like Ross Perot, who may have been a scary guy but was
no worse than Bush; Clinton may have been scary before the fact
but in practice turned out surprisingly good, in large part because
his personal ethics problems kept him tied up all the time.)
Causing more evil mainly gets more sheeple in the mood for evil -
Germany's hundred-plus years of militarism and National and 
International Socialism wasn't worth the cost.

Yeah - but you do that by drinking ipecac, not by drinking Everclear.
Like, gag me with a spoon....

Let's see - the generation that brought us the Income Tax, Prohibition,
"Separate but Equal" Supreme Court support for mandatory segregation, 
The War To End All Wars, Teddy Roosevelt/Hearst Newspapers invading Cuba,
Schenck busted for speaking against the draft before the US joined WW1
and the Supreme Court voting that his conviction was just fine,
the destructive reparations against Germany that led to the
rise of fascism, pro-inflation Populists, monopolies and trust-busters...
Most people from that day would feel right at home,
except for little details like cars and MTV and lack of decent trains,
and the government bribing sheeple wholesale instead of Tammany retail.
There are a few differences - the union movement has wimped out,
with the AFLCIO as a conservative establishment-joining bargaining group, 
compared with the Wobblies and other real strikers,
and by now more people believe that Communism is bad,
and they've got mixed feelings about working for big companies instead 
of running small businesses themselves after most of a century.
But mostly it's the same old same old.


				Thanks!
