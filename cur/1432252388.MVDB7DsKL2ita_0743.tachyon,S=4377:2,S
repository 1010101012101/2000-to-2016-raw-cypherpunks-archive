Actually, if they can do so with reasonable accommodation, I think it
does.  (Note that its not writers, but publishers, who I think may
have the "reasonable accommodation" requirement.)  Of course, the ADA
http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/42/chapters/126/toc.html
is not clear about this--it clearly covers transportation, hotels, and
the like, and services operated by private entities is not at all
clearly defined.

I'm not saying that thats a good thing, but given that the ABA
is a nest of those rent-seekers, having them on the receiving side
carries a certain poetry that I'm suprised you don't see.
