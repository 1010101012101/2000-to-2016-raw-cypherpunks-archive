procmail thingie, our former resident book author, bill arnold loved it,
As well as the other version which outed all of his postings directly
to his supervisors in the school system. havent seen old Bill for about a
couple of years now.:) <<

Ive filtered out some redundant mail lately,Who's bill arnold?

 >>with malice aforthought anonymous tentacle #69
