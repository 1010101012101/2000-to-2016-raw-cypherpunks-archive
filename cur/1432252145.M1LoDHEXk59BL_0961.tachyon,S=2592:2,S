If I'm happy to pervert the electoral
process, then I'm quite happy to do it
in busloads.  In fact, this is a common
approach, busses are paid for by a party
candidate, the 1st stop is the polling
booth, the 2nd stop is the party booth.

In the west, this is done with old people's
homes, so I hear.

Now, one could say that we'd distribute
the verifiability over a random set of
pollees, but that would make the verification
impractically expensive.
