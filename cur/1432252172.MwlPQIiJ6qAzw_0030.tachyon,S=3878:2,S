Sure it does Declan, because you don't get the catch doesn't mean it
doesn't exist.

Bottem line if a 'technology' standard is found wanting with respect to
the 4th then extension to the 1st isn't a big jump. If you can't equate
speech-crypto with search-ir oh well.

But you're a journalist so it's not surprising you don't get it, you have
a hard enough time getting quotes correct.

This statement makes no sense.
