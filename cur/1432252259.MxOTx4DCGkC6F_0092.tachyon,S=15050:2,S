Yes, you are on the same track I am on.

Just as there is no real difference between a "buyer" and a "seller" 
(think barter, think trading songs, think swap meet), so, too, MONEY IS 
JUST ANOTHER GOOD BEING TRADED.

While we think of the crisp $20 bill we got at the swap meet as being 
more "real" (guaranteed value) than something we get in trade (a radio, 
for example, which might turn out to be defective...), this is just a 
matter of degree. Counterfeit bills exist, and swap meets, by the way, 
happen to be where a lot of them turn up.

But I risk digressing...

The point is that even Chaumian "coins" (the unblinded numbers, 
presumptively unlinkable in the usual Chaumian ways) are essentially 
just goods. A recipient of such a coin has worries: has it already been 
spent (double-spending issue), will the issuer simply say "No good" (for 
whatever reason, including a deliberate "take the real money then renege 
on all redemption attempts" strategy.

All money, all currency, all goods, are just "things" with various 
beliefs about them.

And note that many of the "attacks" or "weaknesses" in digital cash 
schemes are actually present all around us. Examples abound, and could 
be put into a long list of potential frauds, scams, defaults, etc. 
Confidence gamers have been using these scams for centuries, longer. 
Banks have been failing, refusing to honor their notes, their "coins," 
for just as long. And governments have been looting banks, freezing 
assets, devaluing currencies. The list of "failure modes" is long. And 
yet it doesn't stop banks, money, and commerce. All crypto is economics. 
It's the ecology that matters, not just the absolute perfection of each 
sub-component.


Your questions below need longer answers, but here are a few notes (take 
them as comments) on each of them:

If Alice and Bob are "already" in possession of unspent (*) coins (I 
will use this term to refer to unblinded numbers, dispensing with talk 
about modular exponentiation, raising things to the one third power, 
blah blah), then Alice can give Bob 100 of her coins and "get back" 99 
of Bob's coins. (His commission for moneychanging, for example.)

(* Double spending will be an issue. I claim solutions exist, 
probabalistically.)

Some don't like the mention of "coins." I mean it as shorthand to 
replace the often-confusing rewrite rules about what the transactions 
unfold into. Better to think in terms of atomic Chaumian protocols, 
unless the detailed rewrites matter in a particular case. Or for 
implementation, of course.


> 2) provides strong defences against fraud to both parties, and

This is best solved probabalistically, which we use for zero knowledge 
proofs.

For example, I wish to know whether a bank (Bob) is "honest" about 
redeeming its digital money. I can "ping" the bank by withdrawing 
digital coins (again, same as "giving them a blinded number, getting 
back their version, unblinding the number," etc.) and then seeing 
whether they redeem the coin. As their coins are untraceable to me, I 
can have someone I trust test them. This is how people test their banks 
with ordinary cash. (Most don't, because enough others _have_. Banking 
regulations have very little to do with bank trustworthiness....ask the 
hawalla banks and their customers.)


> 3) works well if one partner has much more to lose than the other (&
> therefore for arbitrarily large amounts) and

Best done by splitting into lots of smaller pieces, pieces which can be 
used to ping. (Not just to test, but to buy the advantages of being part 
of an ecology. An issuer who decides to "burn" customers cannot do it 
for just one particular customer. Your "size" or "more to lose" issue 
has some interesting mathematical issues connected to with it. "Streams" 
offer one outlook...no time here to explain. In some of my articles from 
several years ago.)

> godfather, whatever), and

I think third parties play a very important role. They don't have to be 
police or courts, etc., and it's better that they are not.

A courier is a good example. An employee who moves packages, or even 
does banking. (Couriers are often bonded, the "more to lose on a burn 
than he makes" point you made. But couriers are also given incomplete 
knowledge. It helps that a courier doesn't know whether he's 
transporting $2000 or $200,000. Usual principles. Application to crypto 
protocols is not obvious, but there's something _there_.)

This is always problematic. Even in the real world of real money and 
real drugs. Drug deals often go bad for this reason. So physical 
security, snipers in high places, all the usual movie and t.v. drama.

Can a system work without deadlock, where Alice makes a good (a song, 
for example) and Bob does the same (another song)? Sending partial bits 
out is only a crude engineering solution...both get their songs more or 
less simultaneously.

Note that any system where Alice unlocks her song with a key is no 
solution at all. (This is often _seen_ as a solution, but bits are bits, 
and so this solution misses the point.)

Note that no digital money scheme solves this problem, either. (Which is 
why I put in terms of straight barter, with no issues of translation 
into money even necessary to consider.)

I believe, and have believed since 1988 when Dave Ross first suggested 
it in a discussion a bunch of us were having, that third party escrow 
services, untraceable to each but having a digital nym, is the optimum 
solution to this "delivery deadlock" problem. Much has been written, by 
me and by others, on escrow services.

Well, "reputation" is a form of persistent state. The reputation 
(belief) that a piece of metal is actually gold, the belief that a gold 
market will exit in 2 hours, the belief in a bank, and so on.

I believe the notion that persistent states are not desirable, that only 
a kind of "purely functional (in the sense of Scheme or ML) protocol is 
desirable is the ROOT CAUSE of much of the failures talked about here.

And this matches how things work in the real world, in all cultures and 
over nearly all periods in history. Kids learn that money has value by a 
Bayesian expectation that dollar bills will continue to buy candy. Those 
with checking accounts establish a Bayesian belief that their checks 
will continue to be honored so long as they meet expected deposit 
requirements. Etc. for a dozen other good examples.

Why do we expect digital money to be different?

(Yes, there are fascinating aspects to one _part_ of the blinding 
process...but isn't this akin to only focussing on the "untraceable" 
part of a gold coin and saying that's the only reason money works?)

We have been taking a couple of elegant protocols and expecting this to 
be the monetary system. And when they fail, or fail to get implemented 
(the real reason), we say "untraceability is not possible."

(Given certain flaws in non-digital money systems, would we say that 
"traceability must be added"? Government thinks so, with money 
laundering and currency transport laws, and with likely outlawing of 
cash within out lifetimes. But these are for political reasons.)

Not if anyone is a potential bank, a mint. If coins are just another 
form of bartered "things," and if traceability to a physical true name 
is not essential for barter (my basic thesis), then look what happens...

First, it is by no means pointless to talk in terms of these smaller 
sub-trades. It solves many problems.

Second, even very high-value transactions can be done with 
mutually-trusted third parties, even untraceable.

(Physical identity is just another credential. Sometimes offered, 
sometimes not.)

Thanks for the interesting comments, yours and Adam Shostack's. It's 
helping me to dredge up out of my memory some of the good discussions 
from the early list years and from the 1995-97 years when "everyone a 
mint" was being discussed a lot.

I feel more than ever that the ecology approach, the agoric approach, is 
the key.
