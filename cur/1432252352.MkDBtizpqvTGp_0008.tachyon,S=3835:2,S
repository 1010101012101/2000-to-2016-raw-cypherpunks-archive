 >>something similar to 'innocent until proven innocent'. > That's the only 
defence against 'conspiracy'.

 >> Typical Choate, missing the point. A remailer simply gets sent a 
message, applies it's decryption key, and sends the contents on to the next 
address (yes, this type of remailer does not include nice features such as 
cover traffic). It has no idea if the address it received the message from 
is a remailer. It has no idea if the address it forwarded the message to is 
a remailer. It doesn't need to. Chaining is the sender's problem. The point 
here is that the remailer treats other remailers exactly as it treats 
source and destination nodes. There is no file on the remailer which says 
"I'll treat hosts from this list specially". This prevents the remop from 
having to worry about being sucked into a conspiracy charge for a crime 
commited by a different remop. He doesn't know, need to know, or want to 
know what other sites are remailers. He doesn't need to know the other 
remops, or communicate with them, except to inform the world (not just 
remops) that 'there is a remailer here." Peter Trei

Oh ye of little faith ,jimmy,jimmy,jimmy.What of the old soft drill attack 
as the BEST defence?
Peter knows all about section 25,paragraph 18.-"need to know." Thats the 
beauty of open conspiracy ,operation soft drill,as well and all.
One other thing choaty,please dont drag that nasty creep matt drudge in 
here,he's stinkin up the page more than Tim on a bad day.
Thanks mate,see ya.yr cobra professor rat. "It's an idiot, not a metaphor."
