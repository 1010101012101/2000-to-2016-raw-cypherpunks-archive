The parent company of DirecTV, the home satellite service, has promised
several federal agencies that it can address concerns about foreign
ownership of sensitive U.S. communications systems if it wins approval
of its proposed merger with Australian-controlled News Corp.

...
But the merger also has drawn the scrutiny of the Department of Homeland
Security, the FBI and Justice Department divisions in addition to the
antitrust department. The deal would bring DirecTV's five satellites and
sophisticated communications system under the control of a company based
outside the United States.

Chief among the U.S. concerns is that a foreign-owned satellite system
and communications system could be used for illegal surveillance on U.S.
citizens and facilities, according to documents passed this week among
Hughes, News Corp. and the federal government.

"As the [FCC] is aware, the DOJ, FBI and DHS have taken the position
that their ability to satisfy their obligations to protect the national
security, to enforce the laws, and to preserve the safety of the public
could be significantly impaired by transactions in which foreign
entities will own or operate a part of the U.S. communications system,
or in which foreign-located facilities will be used to provide domestic
communications services to U.S. customers," read a letter filed at the
FCC by the three law enforcement agencies last week.

The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, a group made
up of executive departments and representatives from the State, Defense,
Treasury and Commerce departments, typically reviews transactions
involving foreign ownership of businesses that serve the United States.
In September, for instance, the committee approved the reorganization
plan for Global Crossing, a telecommunications company being acquired
out of bankruptcy by a Singapore-based firm. .
