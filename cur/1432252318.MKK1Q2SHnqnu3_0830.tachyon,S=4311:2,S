The threat model is not a current one.  If you are actively breaking the 
law _right now_, then all of this (including Tor, IMO) is out the window - 
you move to the realm of throwaway mobile phones and prepaid visa cards 
and open wifi networks.

No, the threat model I am concerned with is future correlation attacks and 
data mining.  I am concerned with a set of digital footprints that can be 
stored indefinitely and can be used to frame all possible motives.

So yes, Tor would work, but Tor is slow, and even with a large number of 
additional nodes and much more bandwidth, Tor will still have _very_ high 
latency.  If you read back in the Tor mailing list, you can see the devs 
state that while the bandwidth will get better over time, the latency 
issues are here to stay.  This is in contrast to a hop from CONUS over to 
Amsterdam and back to check nfl.com ... that's pretty snappy, I am happy 
to report.

So that's the threat model, and that's why I have declined to use Tor (I'm 
well versed in Tor usage and admin).

Payment is prepaid visa or postal money order, etc.  Most asian ISPs I 
have dealt with don't accept credit cards for service anyway.

As to cost, if $80 or $100 per month is too much, I guess you use Tor. 
I'm of the mind that this is extremely cheap for 3-5 nodes spread across 
the world, especially considering that this barely got you a single colo'd 
server 8 years ago.

Comments ?  Where does this break down, given the modest requirements 
described ?
