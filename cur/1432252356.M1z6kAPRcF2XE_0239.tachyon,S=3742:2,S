ANNOUNCE: ssldump: an SSL protocol analyzer
Version 0.9b2

http://www.rtfm.com/ssldump/

RTFM, Inc. is pleased to announce the availability of ssldump 0.9b2.
ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If
linked with OpenSSL and provided with the appropriate keying material,
it will also decrypt the connections and display the application data
traffic.

ssldump is completely passive and thus allows you to analyze systems
without interfering with them. You can also use it to read stored
traffic collected with tcpdump. 

This release is version 0.9b2. The code quality is considered to be
late Beta. It has seen extensive testing on a number of Unix
platforms including FreeBSD, Solaris, HP/UX and Linux. It uses
autoconf and should be portable to most Unix-based systems.
0.9b2 introduces a port to Windows, courtesy of Greg Stark. This
port has seen rather less testing and so is corresponding less
stable.

CHANGES
Since 0.9b1, a number of things have changed:
	Support for Windows, courtesy of Greg Stark
	Fixed a core dump under certain RST conditions.
	Support for decrypting resumed sessions.
	Support for an arbitrary number of connections (previous
	versions had a hard limit).
	Better error reporting when you provide a bad password.
	Some performance fixes.
	Other bug fixes.
