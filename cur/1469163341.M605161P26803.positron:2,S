Say what you will about Tor, a global drug marketplace is very cool :)

But yes, assumptions are dangerous.

Yes, that about sums it up.

Because that radical conclusion would leave me nothing to work with.

Indeed, we could have the same argument about the machine that I'm
typing this message on. The CPU is a total black box. It could be pwned
as badly as Tor. Firmware could have been pwned.

So I work with what I have, being as careful as I know how.

I don't. But lots of other folks do. Russia could still destroy the US,
and perhaps end civilization as we know it.

Well, you do seem willing to use the Internet ;)
