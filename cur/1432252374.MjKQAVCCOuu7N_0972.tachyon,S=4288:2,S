I've never understood why this is not recognized by the courts as an 
ipso facto violation of the First Amendment.

Letters are speech, and e-mail is a letter. (There is no confusing stuff 
about "use of the public airwaves" as there is with radio and 
television, the putative reason for FCC regulation of radio and 
television.)

Requiring that a letter be in a certain form, or written in a particular 
language, would be a violation of the First Amendment.

Why is electronic communication any different?

It isn't.

It may be that Carnivore just has not been challenged properly in the 
courts. Sad that it may take such an expensive challenge, with years and 
years of watiing, and with an uncertain outcome (due to the ignoring of 
the C. by the Supremes).

Kapor is just another Cathy Young, just another fellow traveller 
supporting the total state.
