http://michaelmoore.com/2001_0922.html :

... He passed on to me a confidential memo from the radio conglomerate
that
owns his station: Clear Channel, the company that has bought up 1,200
stations altogether -- 247 of them in the nation's 250 largest radio
markets -- and that not only dominates the Top 40 format, but controls
60% of all rock-radio listening.

The company has ordered its stations not to play a list of 150 songs
during this "national emergency." The list, incredibly, includes "Bridge

Over Troubled Water," "Peace Train," and John Lennon's "Imagine."


[ Ed note: they should have included Brian Eno's BURNING AIRLINES GIVE
YOU SO MUCH MORE.  They got Talking Head's BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE
but not LIFE DURING WARTIME.]

Songs banned on corporate radio Tuesday 18 Sep 2001

Another Gathering of Judgment Calls in the Wake of Disaster September
14, 2001

Source



In response to Tuesday's terrorist attacks, Clear Channel, the
world's largest radio network, has sent out a list of some 150
"lyrically questionable" songs by everyone from the Animals to the
Zombies to its radio stations, recommending that the songs not be
aired. Some songs are overtly violent in their intent, but the
majority simply contain metaphorical language or narrative aspects
that connect uncomfortably with the tragedy.

Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
                         They won't help me survive
                   My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
                         the burning keeps me alive
                    Try to stay healthy, physical fitness
                       don't want to catch no disease
                  Try to be careful, don't take no chances
                       you better watch what you say
