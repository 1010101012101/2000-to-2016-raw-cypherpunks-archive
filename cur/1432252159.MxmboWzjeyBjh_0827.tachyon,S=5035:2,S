I've only caugfht the tail end of this, but from what I can understand some 
of this might be overkill.

Let's imagine you're an ISP that "sells" privacy in your customers' surfing. 
So you make your server regularly go get random webpages so that your 
customers have a cloak of privacy, and this is what you tell the court. 
(Provided, of course, they have some way to 'prove' that the traffic into 
and out of your server is fake traffic!) In these kinds of scenarios, 
'realistic' web traffic might be unneccessary. (Or maybe there's some other 
'cover' story such as the need to update weblinks or whatever...)

Or do I misunderstand here?
