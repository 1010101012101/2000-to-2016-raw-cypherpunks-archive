West Nile virus reaches California
12:40 09 September 02 NewScientist.com news service
A Californian woman has been infected with West Nile virus, preliminary 
tests suggest. If confirmed, the case will mark the virus's spread right 
across the US just three years after the first human case in New York.
"We have been anticipating the arrival of West Nile virus in California as 
reports of the disease have progressed steadily westward across the United 
States," California's State Health Director said.
The woman was treated for meningitis, a symptom of West Nile infection, in 
early August and had not travelled outside the Los Angeles region shortly 
before falling ill, health officials confirmed. The results of final West 
Nile tests are expected by the end of this week.
On Friday, Canada also reported its first West Nile case, in Ontario. Four 
other "probable" cases are also being investigated, health officials said.
