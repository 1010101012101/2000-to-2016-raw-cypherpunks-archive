Actually, the press article describes the message as an "SMS",
which is a GSM Short Message Service cell-phone text message,
rather than an email.  This implies that the Belgian police
are either routinely eavesdropping on GSM text messages,
or else some intelligence service is doing so and asked them
to do the local legwork.
