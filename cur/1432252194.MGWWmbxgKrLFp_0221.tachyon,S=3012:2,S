Scientists build polio virus from scratch

Scientists have built the virus that causes polio from scratch in 
the lab, using nothing more than genetic sequence information from 
public databases and readily available technology. 

The feat proves that even if all the polio virus in the world were 
destroyed, it would be easily possible to resurrect the crippling 
disease. It also raises the worrying possibility that bioterrorists 
could use a similar approach to create devastating diseases such as 
ebola and smallpox without having to gain access to protected viral 
stocks.
