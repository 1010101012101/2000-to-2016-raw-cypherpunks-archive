During the grand jury questioning I was asked about only
one person besides Jim Bell and the CIA-fictional "Mueller" 
and this was someone whose name I did not know. The
name could have been as fictional as the other two.

Do not send me private email or snail mail or telephone 
or visit. Consider me a target for indictment, hanging in
the wind, a warning to others, a Kafka character, PR
for L&O.

Do not bite "John Young" bait.
