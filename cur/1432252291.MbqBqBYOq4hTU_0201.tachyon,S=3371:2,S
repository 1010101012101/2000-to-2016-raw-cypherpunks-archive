Because the causes of war are suffeciently diverse and unpredicatable 
that including war in the pool muddies the waters enough to make 
things unclear.  However I'll bite by asking the inverse of the 
question- name one large scale famine that occurred in any country 
not under some form of "forcible rule" (forcible rule being defined 
as some sort of communist, socialism, or dictatorship, for the 
purpose of this question).  A less precise way of putting this is 
present one example of a country in which free election are/were 
taking place for a reasonable period of time, during which that 
country experienced mass starvation of a significant portion of it's 
population.
