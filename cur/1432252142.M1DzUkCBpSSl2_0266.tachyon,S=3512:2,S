AOL TW secures Secret Service vet

By Georg Szalai

NEW YORK (The Hollywood Reporter) --- In the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, AOL Time Warner Inc. is breaking new ground
in the media industry, saying Monday that it has named the deputy
director of the U.S. Secret Service to the new position of chief
security
officer and senior vp.

Larry Cockell, a 20-year Secret Service veteran, will start his new
assignment at the world's largest entertainment and online conglomerate
Jan. 14. Reporting to AOL TW executive vp administration Patricia
Fili-Krushel, Cockell will be responsible for security on a global
basis,
coordinating and overseeing all security policies and operations, the
company said.

Analysts said Monday that they were not aware of similar positions at
other media giants but that big corporations in other fields have
started
shoring up their security operations following Sept. 11. "I don't know
of such a chief security officer position at any of AOL's media peers,"
Kaufman Bros. analyst Paul Kim said. "But this is definitely a growing
trend at S&P 500 companies."
