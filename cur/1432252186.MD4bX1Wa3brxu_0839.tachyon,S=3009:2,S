Eugene,

Perhaps as a result of my lifting blocks at your request
Cryptome is nearly shutdown by people sucking contents 
for mirroring. My intention was to encourage mirroring not 
of Cryptome but of important crypto tools listed at:

  http://jya.com/crypto-free.htm

Most of Cryptome is non-essential stuff and doesn't
deserve much mirroring. The crypto-free programs are 
much more important.

We'll make available compressed versions of Cryptome
for putting at a few other sites but there's no need for
more than that, and our modest service is choking on the
overload. Once the archive is available elsewhere URLs 
will be publicized.

Hope you'll spread this word to other forums, and pass along
the URL for crypto-free.htm instead.

Unintended consequences give birth to freedom-deniers.
