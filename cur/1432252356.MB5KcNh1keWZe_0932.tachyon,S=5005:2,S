That's exactly what I insisted to the NAI rep.  I suggested that he 
talk to their corporate attorneys, pointing out that there was 
nothing in the EARs that prevented reception of such encrypted email 
by anyone in the US; that the EARs specifically prohibited *export* 
of encrypting *software*--not encrypted messages--to the black-listed 
countries.  He, however, kept falling back on the Nuremburg defense 
("I'm just following orders.").  No indication that he would make any 
attempt to ask in spite of several suggestions.  (Employment must 
still be pretty good in Silicon Valley, I suppose, if such people can 
hold a job.)

It's very disheartening to see what NAI is doing/has done to PGP.  
It's especially disgusting in light of the pride that Phil Zimmerman 
and PGP, Inc., once took in enabling communications for human-rights 
activists in such "black-listed" countries.  Now such activists, 
according to the NAI rep, can no longer be heard in the US if they 
communicate by encrypted email--which, of course, may be the only 
means by which they can communicate safely.

Back to the original question:  It's obvious that NAI is operating 
under the belief that some ISPs are complying with some unspoken BXA 
idea/wannabe-law and blocking encrypted messages from "no-no" 
originating domains.  Is this really the case, or is NAI also full of 
it on this one?
