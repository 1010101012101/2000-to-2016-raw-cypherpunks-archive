We - The People.
They - Anybody that has expressed a sincere desire to blow "the people" up
and has warranted a threat-rating.

I am speaking in the context of U.S. domestic organizations with terrorist
inclinations, not OBL and his like, of course.

> You seem to have some conclusive evidence ... care to share with "us" ?

Some proposals fit into the apocalyptic visions of some groups. Shades of
PROJECT MEGIDDO and so forth.

In MANY respects, I agree with you.

"Propaganda" can serve legitimate purposes and need not be deceitful. In a
like vein, COINTELPRO need not involve infiltration, lying, black bag jobs,
or the stifling of legitimate political dissent.

Speaking of such things....private groups have been highly successful in
criminalizing the ideology of opposing dissident groups that they deem
contrary to their interests. They use the media to make repetitive
unsubstantiated allegations until the public actually begins to associate a
criminal mindset with the group or idea.

My understanding is that the word "cypherpunk" made recent congressional
testimony -???

Their strategy is psychology. And, yes, we can. You "attack their strategy"
when there is somebody assigned to respond to inaccurate reporting, hoaxes,
etc. You "attack their strategy" by encouraging dialogue. You "attack their
strategy" by encouraging moderation (as opposed to inciting action). In many
cases, it could be as simple as communication, and involve some ETHICAL Cold
War skillsets.

> And I can not see a single reason that would compell USG to do so.

Yes, common sense has historically been a poor argument to Congress.
