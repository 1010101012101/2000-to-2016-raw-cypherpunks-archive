This just in from US House Majority Leader Dick Armey:

- Final Carnivore Report Offers No New Answers
A newly released, final version of the report on the Carnivore
cybersnooping system offers no assurance that online transactions
will be kept confidential.

http://freedom.gov/library/technology/carn-review3.asp

US House Majority Leader Dick Armey made the following comments about 
the newly released, final report on the Carnivore cybersnooping 
system: This superficial review doesn't get to the heart of the 
matter. It does nothing to restore the confidence that Americans 
should have in the confidentiality of their online transactions.

Why should average Internet users have to wonder whether a rogue 
agent could snoop through their emails and other online transactions?

If this Administration were actually interested in an honest 
evaluation of Carnivore, it would have shut the system down until the 
serious privacy concerns had been adequately addressed. Instead, this 
review by a team with clear ties to this Administration raises more 
concerns than it answers.

Regards,  Matt-
