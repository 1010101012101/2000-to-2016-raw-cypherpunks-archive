N$
get you a discrete military tribunal, after detention incommunicado,
sans

The next time Ashcroft [1] gets a hard-on for gambling | drugs |  porn |

arabs, e-gold systems will see major hasslement ranging from frozen
or confiscated subscribers assets to the latest in Raytheon's precision
versions
of the V-2 delivered to their doorstep.  No extra charge for nighttime
delivery.

given his addiction, not that such innumeracy redeems the slow painful
death he earned.
