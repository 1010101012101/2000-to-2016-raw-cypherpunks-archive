The problem here is there isn't any issue of 'private property' so there
can't be any 'private transactions' in a socialism. This description is
more applicable to fascism.

It's important to note that 'regulation' is different than 'management'.
The first is setting of operational boundaries while the second is active
and immediate activity in the low-level decisions. They are not! the same
thing. This distinction is what keeps all 'states' from being fascist.

A state strictly speaking is a area and population that 'enjoy' the same
basic rules and authorities. Whether it's fascist or not is another
question entirely.
