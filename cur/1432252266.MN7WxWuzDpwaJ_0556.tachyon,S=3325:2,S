 >>Being schooled in the cognitive sciences, we are most amused by the 
requirement that you can rotate (and presumably scale, stretch, bend, etc.) 
objects in your head. Makes sense though. Mental abilities (e.g., reading, 
writing, speaking, visual observation, mental rotation)<<

Did I tell you my mom was warned at little rock airport,"Dont joke in the 
airport! Joking in the airport is a federal offense!"
I think all she said was they didn't find a bomb after being frisked.
"Stop or my mom will shoot!"
