I've already had my turn at bat with Brin.  He was upset several years ago 
when I made a few comments about his essay "The Cheerful libertarian", he asked 
that I send him the subscriber list to Freematt's Alerts so he could contact 
them directly- He thought that my commentary would adversely effect his ability 
to sell books-  Anyway I told him to shove his request up his ass, at which 
point he said he'd get my subscriber list by other means.  He's a good writer, 
but IMHO a total nutcase asshole.

Regards,  Matt-
