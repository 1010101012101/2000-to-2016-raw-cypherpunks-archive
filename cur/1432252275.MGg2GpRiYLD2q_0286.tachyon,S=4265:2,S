Physics, chaos, the growth of initial uncertainty as systems evolve,
energy/time required to make measurements to arbitrary precision.

The rules of physics are those that don't change from time to time, or
place to place.
Certainly the e.g., wind speed does.

No, since 'anything through a whitener passes' these tests.
The integers (0, 1, 2..) fed into DES will pass.
(Equivalently) A low-entropy source fed into a hash will pass.

[Historical note: this is why Intel should make its raw RNG
data available in chips with whitened-output RNG functions]

To have a true RNG, You *must* have a physical understanding of the
source
of entropy whence you distill the pure bits (whether or not
you feed it into a whitener after distillation).  Precisely
because a 'black box' may be a deterministic (if you know
the secret) PRNG.  By 'distill' I mean reduce N bits to M,
N > M, in such a way as to increase the entropy of the
resultant M bits.

'Random' should be taken to mean 'ignorant of'.  It suffices
that we (and our adversary) are ignorant of the detailed conditions
inside a noise diode, unstable atomic nucleus, atmospheric
(or FM radio) noise receiver, etc.  Philosophical discussions about
'true
randomness' ("Is there a deeper/smaller level of description in
which apparently-random events are based or emerge from?")
are beyond the scope of this rant.
