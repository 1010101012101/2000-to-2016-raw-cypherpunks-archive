Yeah, and Paul Revere rode to Lexington to promote his silversmithing
business.  "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and
the value of nothing."  Mr. Moore speaks eloquently for the Left, the
Center, and even former right-wing folks like me to join forces to get
rid of the most cynical, opportunistic, divisive, and un-American
administration since Richard Nixon's.  Don't whine next year about the
terrible Administration if you don't take your chance this year to
replace it with a much more reasonable one.
