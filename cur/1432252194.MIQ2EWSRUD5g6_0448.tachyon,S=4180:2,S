That is the theoretical question that I am asking. What you say 
appears to be the conventional wisdom, and I am claiming that it is 
wrong.  As long as there is some way to make sure that none of the 
ciphers in a chain are inverses of the others, or close to an 
inverse, in some sense, then I claim as long as one of the ciphers is 
strong, there is no way to get any information out about the keys 
from the other ciphers, even if they are all designed to reveal that 
information.

As a practical matter, you may as well derive the sub keys from the 
master key using a one-way hash, but I am questioning the theoretical 
justification for doing that.  Massey and Maurer base their paper on 
oracles that give you the key for all component ciphers but one. I am 
saying such oracles cannot exist if one of the ciphers is strong and 
"inverses" of the strong cipher are excluded.
