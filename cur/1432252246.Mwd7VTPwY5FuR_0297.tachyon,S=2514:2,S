Some of us still use it, but we tend not to recommend it to 
anyone - it has become fairly obscure and, to be honest, lots 
of webpages suck pretty hard when viewed through lynx.  I 
find it particularly handy though as a route around some 
firewalls.  If I find myself on a machine where HTTP requests 
are filtered or published, I can ssh to a machine where they're 
not and use lynx from there.
