Just about anything is possible.

Message-ID is generated by the originating MTA (that's the ISP's
sendmail or whatever program they're using to send mail).

It's supposed to be unique-- it's often something like

200109012124.f81LObL18955@slack.lne.com

where there's a date component (200109012124) and the sending
machine's name, so that it's unique in a global namespace.
Of course there's nothing keeping someone from sending
mail with whatever message-id they want, assuming that they
can control their sending MTA.

The reason that it's used for identifying already posted messages
is that procmail, which the CDR system is based on, has a nice
built-in hook for keeping a message-id database and identifying
duplicates.
