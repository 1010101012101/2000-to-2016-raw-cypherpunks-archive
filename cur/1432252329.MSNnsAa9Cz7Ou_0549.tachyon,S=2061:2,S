Well, I think even this is rather optimistic.
This morning I took the LIRR into Penn Station, where random searches were 
being performed (I didn't actually see one). The silly damn thing is that 
the searches are done -there-, in Penn Station, rather than at the outlying 
stations. "Is that a b-o-m-b, sir?" "Sure is"...KABOOM. And down comes 
Madison Square Garden and a major transportation hub.

And for this silly shit we sacrificed our civil rights?
