OHAI,

So, I assessed it vis-a-vis stef's rules already, otherwise I would not=
 dive=20
into it at all. ;)

But yeah, let's have a look.

So, that's not going to change, IMHO. There are several developers and =

so changin a license *from* GPL is not entirely straightforward.

AOK.

https://wiki.tox.im/Antox

Still, you don't have to use it. As in, I use a desktop client, not goi=
ng to=20
be using it on my mobile anyway. It doesn't *require* smartphone use, j=
ust=20
like e-mail does not *require* a smartphone e-mail app (if you use one,=
 well,=20
that's your choice).

inb4 "e-mail is not safe" -- puh-lease, that was just a way to illustra=
te a=20
point.

"AOK" for here too.

ACK. So, the PDF I linked to goes a *bit* further (just a wee bit). Go =
have a=20
look at the "Crypto" section:
https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/Technical_Report/lastSuccessfulBuild/=
artifact/tox.pdf/

So, at least not a "we hold your keys -- FOR SAFETY!!1!" kind of snakeo=

Half of an "AOK" from me here.

True. One has to consider their own threat model and assess if Tox is t=
he=20
answer. Tox does *not* provide anonymity, it at least *tries* to provid=
e OTR-

Indeed. So again, half an "AOK".

I like the logo. "AOK" from me, especially taken into account they're n=
ot=20
reimplementing the wheel but using NaCL instead.

Well, yes, and my beef with Tox is also that the private keys do not re=
quire a=20
passpharse to unlock. So that's a no-no in my book.

Still, this doesn't look like snakeoil; rather like a good idea with no=
t-so-
stellar execution, which *might* get better.

Am I missing anything?

Could we have a *separate* thread for it? I'm really interested in havi=

thread. Much obliged.
