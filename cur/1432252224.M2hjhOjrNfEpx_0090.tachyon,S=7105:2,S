     An even simpler answer is that, for the most part, biometric devices
look cool and get investors and potential customers all moist, but really
aren't very good security solutions at all. But yes, I have implemented or
seen implemented a few different biometric devices that verify animation of
the identifying anatomy. However, as I'm sure you can imagine, that doesn't
really make things any better. And after standing in a chilly mantrap for a
while with one needle in your arm, another in your hand, and a band around
your wrist, you start to think that passwords are pretty neat technology.

The simple answer is that most decent fingerprint readers require a living
thumb, either through simple body-heat or, if I remember correctly,
bioelectrical measurement.
