Certicom and Beep Science Partner to Provide Advanced Security for Digital
Rights Management
Monday February 14, 7:00 am ET

Device manufacturers can implement DRM as part of overall Certicom Security
Architecture

MISSISSAUGA, ON and OSLO, Norway, Feb. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Certicom
Corp. (TSX: CIC - News), the authority for strong, efficient cryptography,
and Beep Science, a leading provider of Open Standard DRM technology, today
announced a partnership agreement to enable Certicom to integrate and
resell Beep Science's digital rights management (DRM) software solution.
The move supports Certicom's objective to provide a comprehensive,
integrated security platform that addresses the evolving needs of device
manufacturers.

The robust and secure OMA DRM v2 Agent from Beep Science will become part
of the Certicom Security Architecture, which consists of a modular set of
security protocol toolkits and software cryptographic providers that are
unified by a single, intuitive application programming interface. The Beep
Science DRM solution (client- and server-side) is fully compliant with the
digital rights management standard from the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and
supports the distribution of high value content to a wide spectrum of
devices, including multimedia capable mobile phones, handheld devices,
consumer electronic devices, and set-top boxes.

"Certicom is uniquely positioned to address the evolving security needs of
device manufacturers. Our focus on strong security, our experience with
resource-constrained devices, and now our partnership with Beep Science,
the DRM expert, combine to make a powerful offering," said Jim Alfred,
director of product management at Certicom. "As devices become more
complex, coordinated efforts, such as our partnership with Beep Science,
become critical to helping device manufacturers meet the evolving needs of
their customers."

"For device manufacturers to succeed, they need to consider security at the
design stage. It's for this reason that we have chosen to partner with
Certicom, a leader and experienced player in embedded security. By working
with Certicom, our DRM technology becomes part of comprehensive security
architecture," said Markku Mehtala, VP business development at Beep
Science. "This agreement represents new opportunities for both companies
and a complete solution for device manufacturers."
