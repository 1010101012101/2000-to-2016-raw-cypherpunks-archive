Due to the christmas ceasefire and the fact that we are not yet formally at 
war,OSD international has authorized me to categorically deny that any 
attempts will be made on the life of young joshua Gordon in the next few days.
The victorian police are closely monitoring the situation and continue to 
receive all mail addressed to proffr@fuckmicrosoft.com Taylors shoes have 
been confiscated and he continues to receive the finest psychiatric 
treatment at enormous expense to the State.The small support group for 
disturbed cyberstalkers and unaffiliated terrorists is coming together 
nicely and should have their own anonymous chat room soon.Catherine Trammel 
has kindly volunteered to be moderator.We wish you a merry syphilis and a 
happy gonorrhea.
