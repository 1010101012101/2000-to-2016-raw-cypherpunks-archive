Yes. Some types of things can get into your clothes and transport 
across the skin barrier every time you put on a particular shirt 
There was a famous case involving PCP where this guy kept freaking 
out, for months, every time he put on a particular shirt.  The stuff 
doesn't wash out apparently.

Then, of course, there are intentional methods -- ever eaten a 
brownie when you hadn't been there to see it baked?  Ever had 
lunch with someone who was wearing a ring? Etc.
