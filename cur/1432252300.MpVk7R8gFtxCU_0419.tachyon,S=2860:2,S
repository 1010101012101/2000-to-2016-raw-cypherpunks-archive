Wherein it says:

For example, in 1997 the book's publisher became aware that individuals
purporting to be BATF agents had
threatened vendors of the book in at least three different states with
"problems" if they did not cease their
sales of the book. A full-page ad in Shotgun News offering a $10,000
reward for the identity of these
individuals put a stop to that particular business.

Wouldn't this be evidence supporting AP?
