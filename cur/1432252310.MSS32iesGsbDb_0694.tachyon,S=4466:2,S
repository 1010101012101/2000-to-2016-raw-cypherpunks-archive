Mongo is not your friend? As enroaching senility leads him to wander off 
more often,Mong may soon need one of these...

Digital angels on one shoulder,devlish Cpunks on the other,Lear wanders the 
wilderness.Would it be such a shock to learn that like Philby and 
Hannsen,Mongo's loyalties lie elsewhere? First Ronnie,then Charlton,its all 
too tragic.He wont remember.They are shown as the gutless, mean-spirited, 
utterly self-centred and cruel characters that they really are.
