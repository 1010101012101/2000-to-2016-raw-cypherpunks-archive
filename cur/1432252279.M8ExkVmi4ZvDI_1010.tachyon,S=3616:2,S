Oh no, I fully understood those arguments and conceeded that in certain 
scenarios such ethnic groups might experience disproportionate amounts of 
impact.

However, when we start talking about actively putting them up the chimneys, 
then we've moved into making such ethnic groups targets.

Hey...there's nothing saying a smart person can't end up a racist. However, 
it is to be expected that a smart racist will have particularly clever 
arguments to justify such racism.

In addition, I suspect that some of our more robust inner-city dwellers 
might actually adapt quite quickly to such scenarios. As for trailer trash, 
however...
