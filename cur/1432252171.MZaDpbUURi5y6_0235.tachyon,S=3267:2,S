However, methods used for watermarking et cetera are not optimized for
strict non-detection. What I mean is, they are of course meant to be
difficult to predict down to the sample level (since that would make them
easy to remove), but the presence of this sort of stego is often quite
easily verified. Especially if the algorithms are well known. This is
unacceptable in a non-watermark stego apps.
