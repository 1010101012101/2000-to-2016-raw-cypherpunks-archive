But's they won't. I've tried to open a discussion with them on several
occassions and their attitude is 'do it our way'. The only(!) way I'd
support their activity is if they had a 'opt out' to their database. I
have no desire to participate in their 'project' in any way. Yet I don't
have that choice. So, no, I don't support his activity when it involved me
against my wishes.

There is something particularly slimey about that.
