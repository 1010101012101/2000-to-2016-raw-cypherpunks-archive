The press is not biased when it fails to report an issue as
much as you would desire.  The press is biased when their
political desires get in the way of reality, as in their
reporting of "unexpectedly strong Iraqi resistance" and the
inability of large sections of the press to notice that the
Iraqis were losing in the cities, as well as the desert.

On MSNBC there were a huge number of stories predicting a
Stalingrad like battle for Baghdad, and then when the US
started taking cities with very low casualties, a viewer of NBC
would have had great difficulty in discovering the fact.  NBC
did not fail to give some stories the emphasis that some people
thought they should have. Instead their stories were wrong.
