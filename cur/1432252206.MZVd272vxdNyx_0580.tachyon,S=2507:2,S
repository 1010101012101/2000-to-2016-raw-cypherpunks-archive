Well, political controversy seems like the least interesting thing
about the list--to the extent we're all babbling about who needs
killing and who's not a sufficiently pure
libertarian/anarchocapitalist and which companies are selling out to
the Man, the list is nothing special.  The cool thing is the
understanding of crypto and computer security techology as applied to
these concerns that are political.  And the coolest thing is getting
smart people who do real crypto/security work, and write working code,
to solve problems.  The ratio of political wanking to technical posts
and of talkers to thinkers to coders needs to be right for the list to
be interesting.
