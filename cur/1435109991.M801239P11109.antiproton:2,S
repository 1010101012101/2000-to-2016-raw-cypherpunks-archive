I think Cathal's comment was a general remark. It did not necessarily 
concern you.

I think you're South American. Your rhetoric squarely puts you there. 
Overly defensive on the subject of projecting power. Blatantly 
anti-American (rhetoric only, if you'd ever find yourself living here 
you'd find yourself a lot less radical and carry yourself a bit more 
respectful)

You are very sensitive on the subject of being run over by a foreign 
power indicates a permanent identity crisis (Argentine) as to where you 
fit in the world of things.

Your over-sized ego i.e. taking things personally that are actually a 
general remark is quite a cultural trait. So is calling people by name 
instead of addressing the issue.

Everything North of Chile  sans Bolivia has common sensibilities towards 
the Government. Brazilians are not that outspoken, better at diverting 
and quite introverted. Bolivian culture is more refined and does not 
call out people like it's taking a piss. That makes you Chilean, 
Argentinian or Spanish.

You're not European. Your English is too good.

And my guess is Argentinian.
