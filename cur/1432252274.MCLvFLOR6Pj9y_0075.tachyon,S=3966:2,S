Mojo ultimatively failed because MojoNation failed. MNet is very alive,
though, and it will get a new mint eventually.

What I didn't like about Mojo is that the developers didn't treat
it like a currency which it was. If your client doesn't care about
Mojo, why should you? If you treat currency like toilet paper, it's
not worth very much.
