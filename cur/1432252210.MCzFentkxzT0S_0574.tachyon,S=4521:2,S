I was reading along until shortly after this point.  Then it started 
talking about truth or ignorance of the two dominant candidates.

I did the math.  ((3.2*5)+(3.9*3))/8~=3.5 (3.4625)
3.5 !=3.2

I don't have but two years documented here to figure the spending increase 
for Bush Sr. but I imagine it too will not add up.

If I got my math severly wrong, be sure to let me know.

At this point, based on the above math, I stopped reading.

Good luck,
