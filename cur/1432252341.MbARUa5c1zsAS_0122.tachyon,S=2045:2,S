Indeed.  The dude shows that
1. ability to inherit $$$ doesn't imply brains
2. he should take a structural engineering class
3. he might appreciate the hubris of Architects (tm) but that requires
#2

If he really gave a shat he'd investigate the RDX stored in the
Murrah building, next to daycare, but that was just a (.mil trained)
'Merican,
not a bunch of specops Ay-rabs.

JYA may be Architects (snicker) but methinks he groks structures,
and even if not, his cryptome penance absolves him from the sins
of the artsy.

PS: heard some fedscum mention 'militia and other terrorists' the other
day, what would Gen George W think?
