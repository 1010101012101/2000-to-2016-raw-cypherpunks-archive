	I have read reports of people running WiFi links of up to 20
miles.   Given a clear path (clear line of sight) and relatively modest
sized directional antennas (not huge suspicious looking dishes) which
can be concealed under rf transparent radomes (hidden in an attic for
example with appropriate (fiberglass) roofing or siding, or behind a
glass picture window with curtains drawn) getting 10 to 20 mile ranges
is pretty easy with gain antennas on either end... not rocket science
either... and quite hard to spot visually (though of course a spectrum
analyzer with good preamps and antennas will find and locate any hidden
802.11 link in no time flat - one cannot radiate rf from a fixed
location and not be easily found using common TSCM tools).
