Japan's starting to add RFIDs to their 10000-yen (~$100) bills.
Notes will come with Hitachi's 0.3mm "mew-chip" which
responds to radio signals by sending out a 128-bit number.
Each chip costs about 50 yen.
The article says that each number _could_ be a serial number,
but doesn't say that they know it is; the alternative would be
something that indicated the production batch or whatever.

The Reg's report sounds like it's based on
what someone saw on a TV show,
but also indicates they're starting production.
