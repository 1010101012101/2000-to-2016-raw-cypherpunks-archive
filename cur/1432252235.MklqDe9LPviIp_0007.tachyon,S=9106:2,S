I should probably not read Thomas Piketty's Capital and then post on the 
internet in the same week timespan. But it's been quite an amusing digression.

Don't copy that floppy?

I'd argue the Soyuz was and is the pinnacle of human manned flight, because
it (as far as I know) was not a copy, and it's still flying.

Marx was worried about endless accumulation of capital by industrialists. I
find it rather hilariously amusing that for Marx's commons to work, it has to
be in the capitalist framework of intellectual property ownership.

The brilliance of the GPL(v2) is the 'compulsory communal' aspect only kicks
in when you sell something. No sale, no compulsion to share with your customers.
It will be interesting to see how the AGPLv3 plays out long-term. I see a lot 
of code getting released under that license, and I expect at some point it 
will start eating the market share of closed-source cloud 'service' providers,
because no capital owner can afford to pay engineers when the competition is
doing the work for free.

I guess Marx got trolled by Richard Stallman.
