Diffie should stick to cryto, outside of that he's an idiot and doesn't
know of what he speaks. Hell, all those socialists at Sun seem to be idiot
savants.

If it was only a thermal imaging device involved it might fly (like a bird
can cross your property line with impunity). However, all the thermal
image device does is frequency shift the radiation to a range that IS
VISIBLE BY HUMAN EYES. It's still a human being looking at the image and
making evaluations of it.

Further, I'd like to see the definition of 'search' that is dependent upon
the mechanism, there is no such definition. 'Search' is about intent, not
method. 'Mechanism' is certainly NEVER mentioned in the 4th. Where did
this extra stricture come from? Where is it's justification?

"Why" and "How" are irrelevent in respect to a search. That one WANTS is
sufficient.

And, no. I'm no 'leftie'.
