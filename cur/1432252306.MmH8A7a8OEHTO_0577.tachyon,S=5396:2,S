Why vilification?  Isn't simple shitcanning the worst possible fate (by
extension, the direct personal suppression of his/her ideas)?  As for any
attempt, direct or indirect, at censorship of mattd's unmedicated
outbursts: by trying to silence his communication to others, we start that
inevitable slide.

As mattd is at least _supposedly_ a resident of another continent, Gordon &
Company probably don't consider him worth the effort - remember, they are
not interested in having to actually *work* for a living: if it's not hanging
low enough to practically touch the ground, it's not fruit that they care to
sample.

Hey, I don't know about *your* tax dollars, but *mine* have been hard at work
suppressing free speech and killing innocents for over twenty five years!


Has anyone here considered that mattd may be a form of DOS attack?  That
he/she/it may in fact be a paid (or otherwise compensated) proxy of
Gordon's?  Surely I can't be the only one who has seriously considered
this...

See what I mean?  The inclination of that slope is rising already :-(

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
