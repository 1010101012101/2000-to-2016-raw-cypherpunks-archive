What it takes to have reasonable living standards and sufficient resources
to help ones children do better than themselves. The reality is that these
sweatshops do exist, that they do exploit the workers, and that they are
specifically managed to keep the workers from exploiting economic, social,
and educational resources. Why? Because if the producers allow this
behaviour they put themselves out of business.

It isn't the wages, it's the human condition that is comparable. The
econimics are only a single measure of a multi-variant situation.

Very(!) few people get $300/hr. However, the vast majority of peoples in
N. America and Europe manage to have a substantialy higher quality of life
style than in S. America, Africa, and the Middle/Far East. Why? Because
they lack a fundamental belief, let alone respect for, human beings. They
are seen as nothing more than another resource to be used for ones own
advancement (and this implies that those used are denied their
opportunities).

If the market were open, it isn't. The reality is that the market is
controlled in such a way as to keep the status quo. This ensures the
political, social, and economics supremacy of a small minority at the
expense of the many.

This bozo can't tell the difference between a 'socialism' (which is what
he's describing) and a 'dictatorship'. Sounds more like he's begging the
question.
