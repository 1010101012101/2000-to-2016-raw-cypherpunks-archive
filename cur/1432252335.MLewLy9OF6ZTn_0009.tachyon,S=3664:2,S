And truthful.

I've been telling people this at parties for many years: since most 
smokers are productive up until the time they develop lung cancer 
(maybe more so, due to the nicotine high), and because they typically 
develop lung cancer after their most productive years but before 
their declining years, smoking should be REQUIRED.

The fact that lung cancer typically is not expensive to treat is a plus.

Press reports of the above story are, as usual, missing the essential 
truth of the point and are focusing on the "callousness" of the Giant 
Corporations.
