I think we're talking about two different things here.  What I meant
to say is every piece of information I've been able to find states
that US citizens residing outside the US have to file tax returns and
are subject to US tax laws for the rest of their lives.  Whereas you
stated that US citizens residing outside the US only have to file tax
returns for 10 years after leaving the US, and I haven't seen that
anywhere, despite extensive research on the issue since I'm a US
citizen residing outside the US.

My choice of the word 'expatriate' in my previous post was incorrect
and for that I apologize.
