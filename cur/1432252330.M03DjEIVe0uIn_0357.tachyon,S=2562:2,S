Freedom Websecure is a different protocol set from Freedom.net.

Websecure runs on linux, see http://websecure4linux.sourceforge.net/

The Freedom.net code is available for non-commercial use, see
http://slashdot.org/articles/02/02/16/0320238.shtml?tid=158 or the
shmoo group cvs server,
http://cvs.shmoo.com/view/projects/freedom-server/

The problem with running Napster over Freedom was bandwidth costs.
Users may be more willing to pay today, given the clear risk of paying
$10,000 or more in fines.  I'm sure that ZKS would be happy to sell
someone a commercial use license.
