Commie liars, except for Thomas, who does not say what you
claim he does.

Ahwell! Still if you want to lump stalinists,trots and anarchs together 
thats OK.Its a free country. Mind you don't get shot for being a 
crypto-anarchist though and if your red triangle fades to pink,don't come 
crying to me.Id still luv to keep this thread going, I get a picture of Tim 
May as Amon Goethe whenever I see the heading.)Ill also be sure and ask all 
my anarchist mates if we cant do better next time at 
http://www.infoshop.org/ and http://www.ainfos.ca/A-Infos/
