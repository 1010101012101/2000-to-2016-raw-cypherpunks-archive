Gentlemen,

It was recently mentioned on this list that there were additional
restrictions placed on the use of ciphers by private citizens during World
War II. I'm curious if anyone knows of a good resource for further
information on this topic.

(Now, inevitably, Choate is going to sent me a Google URL. This is fine,
since I wasn't able to get Google to give me anything but information on
documents discussing recent export restrictions, happening to mention
WWII.)

Thank you.
