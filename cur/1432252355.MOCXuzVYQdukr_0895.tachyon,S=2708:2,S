   [1]Armadni General writes "CNN is reporting that a new Italian law
   requires that all businesses offering public internet access, such as
   web cafes, to [2]identify and record all customers. While supporters
   of this law trumpet its anti-terrorism potential, still others see no
   such advantage and bemoan this invasion of personal privacy. 'They
   must be able, if necessary, to track the sites visited by their
   clients. [...] Contents of people's e-mail is, however, supposed to
   remain private and can only be made available to law enforcement
   through a court order. Italy also obliges telecommunications companies
   to keep traffic data and European ministers agreed last week to
   require the carriers to retain records of calls and e-mails for a
   maximum of two years. The European Parliament's two largest groups
   endorsed the data retention initiative on Wednesday despite complaints
   from privacy advocates and telecoms, and the full body is expected to
   adopt a bill next week.'"
