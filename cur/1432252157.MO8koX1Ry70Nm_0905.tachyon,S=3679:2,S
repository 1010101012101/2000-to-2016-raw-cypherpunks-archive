Well, I think that's certainly a reasonable argument.

On the other hand, note that Cryptome has done largely the same thing for,
what, well over 10 years now. But Young has kept a far lower profile, with the
emphasis on the material, as opposed to generating a lot of publicity. Would
Manning have sent his materials to Cryptome in the absence of Wikileaks? I
don't think so. Call that bullshit but that's the way most people actually
function.

Sometimes, you need an obvious figure in order to garner sufficient
attention.

You could also argue that Assange isn't really in this for much other than his
own glory, but I don't care much.

Indeed, when the furor over Wikileaks dies down, one can easily see a flotilla
of similar though truly anonymous sites operating. But Wikileaks will have
been the site that brought such ideas into common thinking.
