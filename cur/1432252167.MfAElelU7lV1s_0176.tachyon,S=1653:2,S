Look at everything Grobbage says at below URL. I honestly don't
know into which cathegory to place him. If he's genuine, the state
of the art is quite a bit more advance than I've thought (active
MITM for system compromise instead of just passive taps).

Somebody should just save everything he says, just in case it
gets deleted, somehow.
