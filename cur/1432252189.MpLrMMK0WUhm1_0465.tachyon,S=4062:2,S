CIA poised for unprecedented involvement in domestic investigations 

By ABRAHAM McLAUGHLIN, Christian Science Monitor 


WASHINGTON (December 17, 2001 12:09 p.m. EST) - The Central Intelligence Agency
has been given new freedom to get involved in domestic surveillance and
investigations in ways that are unprecedented in its history.

The CIA's intelligence gathering has long been kept as separate as possible
from domestic law enforcement, which is bound by strict evidence-gathering
rules and legal safeguards protecting the rights of those investigated.

But as the nation girds itself against global terrorism carried out on American
soil, the barriers between covert, stealthy intelligence and by-the-book
domestic law enforcement investigations are beginning to melt.

Suddenly, for instance, the CIA will now have access to testimony collected by
federal grand juries.

And the CIA, FBI, and other federal agencies are, for the first time, being
allowed to share vast amounts of information ranging from phone records and
credit cards statements to profiles of suspected terrorists.
