There was a payware (but disclosed source) update for NT/2K, and of course
E4M (on which the NT driver for scramdisk was based) was always NT
compatable and very similar to Scramdisk. I don't think either works on XP
though (and of course DriveCrypt by the authors of both scramdisk and E4M
is both closed source and product activation - a dark path to walk)
E4M can still be downloaded from
http://www.samsimpson.co.uk/cryptography/scramdisk/

IIRC E4M could also mount existing scramdisks, but had trouble dismounting
them cleanly on W2K.
