I haven't seen this confirmed elsewhere, so take it FWIW. Then again maybe the
big trades don't know who Mitnick is, or care. Hey, maybe Evil Bert will cameo
the following week, when ABC produces an episode on sending messages to sleeper
agents through DIY Bangladeshi Photoshop collages.

<Notorious computer hacker Kevin Mitnick will guest star on ABCs spy drama
Alias on Sunday, Oct. 28. The hacker who once filled one of the top spots on
the FBIs most-wanted list and who spent five years in prison for several
computer fraud crimes will ironically play a CIA agent. >
