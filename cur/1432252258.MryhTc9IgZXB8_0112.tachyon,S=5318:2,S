Using SS7 one can redefine routes, gather number translation info via
Signalling Control Points (SCPs), etc. Rather than repeat boring details,
check out:

http://support.dialogic.com/ss7/SS7tutorial/tutorial.html

The link is a brief tutorial on SS7; it'll make possibilities more obvious.
What's the danger of SS7 over IP?  Lack of security features at gateways and
at the protocol level.

How does this improve eavesdropping?  SS7 is only signaling.  There is no

around.  Perhaps the knowledge of calling and called party since those
digits are passed via SS7 but the converstation is entirely distinct.

There are already carriers doing SS7 over IP via gateways.  Over the public
Internet is not a stretch from a technical standpoint but, in practice,
I'd find it hard to believe too many LECs or IXCs going this route.  Private
IP networks, yes already in production even.  The public IP network, nobody
serious is doing it.  Wait, well, if you just mean VoIP there are VoIP
companies that are attempting things like this by partnering with regional
and local ISPs to place voice gateways.  If you're talking governmental
moves, there are easier ways.  The SS7 network isn't exactly encrypted..
