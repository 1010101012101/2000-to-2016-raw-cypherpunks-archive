CFP is still worth attending, but more as a social event nowadays.
It's started to become a corporate-privacy-officer conference. I was
chatting two weeks ago with a friend who's a CPO at one of the
valley's largest firms and my friend was talking about suggesting a
panel on "how firms can comply with european data directive stuff."
Not unimportant in a practical sense, but hardly interesting, or
cypherpunkish.
