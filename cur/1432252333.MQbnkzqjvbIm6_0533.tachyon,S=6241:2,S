This is a perfect example of "It's hard to understand something your salary
(or campaign finances) depend on not understanding", cause I never saw this
until you pointed it out. Fortunately I still have a few braincells that fired.

This is brilliant... Get more money in politics, but in a way the politicians
can never touch it. Oh sure, some will, but they will quickly be strung up 
by the 'clean campaigns' lynch mob.

Except I get to play the "Farmers need open-source drones to keep those anti-GMO
terr'ists out" police state card, and watch the competing interests tie themselves
up in knots while activists download the code I use to "Protect America's Food"

I think I need to have a conversation with my local sheriff and FAA folks on if
'Stand your Airspace' applies, or if they want to have fun with target practice
if I start seeing undocumented drones.

I also need a little advance warning to let the rednecks know when drone season
starts, and distribute IFF scopes so they don't shoot down the ones with 1watt
orange warning LEDs that are videotaping the amusement.

It might be better to have the IFF scope send off a warning laser pulse first and
all drones running released standards-compliant firmware drop out of the sky and 
the shooter gets a 'win', and save the kinetics for the drones that don't drop
on request. Points for marked drones, cash for 'illegals', but only if you can
find the flash memory chips. The NSA should probably figure out how to work with
the FBI to make sure they are the highest bidder, in public, on the darknets,
and most importantly, at the local gun/drone shop.

Drone Registration should consist of posting your make, model, firmware image,
and radio 'handle' on a public website.

Geez, someone needs to make a game, cartoon, and video game out of this. The
above concept is released to anyone under public domain. Have at it reality TV,
you can call it "Drone Dynasty". Just give me a chance to test the software.

I just want to send out the drones to check if my crop came up, or if I need 
to hook up the cultivator. The rest of this stuff is just a means to get an
industry started to defend my ability to hack the code on my drones.
