     Looks like the city of Oshberg would like to shut down
my website -- http://www.oshkoshbygosh.org.  Notice when you
read the city attorney's email to me that he's trying to
enjoin me with a little prior restraint re publishing his
email to me. Of course, I immediately put it up on the
site.  Note the email from the mayor to him that he
included, wonderful stuff.
