If Microsoft gets busted for "spoilation" I'll buy James a new house.  But
if they get busted for spoliation I don't want to be taken off your loon
list (and, I'm sure neither would Black Unicorn), it's too much of a good
recommendation.

By the by, who else is on your "loon list"?  If Inchoate is there, I might
want to rethink wanting to be there.  :'D
