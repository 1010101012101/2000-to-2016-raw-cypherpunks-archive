For Hettinga's nose coke blowing about the virtues of coding:

New York Times reports today:

"James H. Simons, a mathematician and former Defense Department 
code breaker who uses complex computer models to trade, earned 
$2.8 billion. His flagship Medallion fund returned 73 percent."

What could NSA do in the market with its acres of computers
and thousands of cryptologists?

To be sure, Simons might just be stealing data in the NSA
way and covering it up with the tall tale.

Financial cryptography is not be trusted.
