Tony Soprano's international waste recycling arm has authorized me to offer 
you several toxic waste disposal licences for a brief time 
only.Specializing in glowing radioactive waste is the safest level since 
emile had that accident with the liquid acid.Dont forget you can 
sub-contract,just keep a few gold dump trucks handy.Leave encrypted bids at 
NJ IMC or deli me.

Theres a piece on ideological toxic waste disposal at
