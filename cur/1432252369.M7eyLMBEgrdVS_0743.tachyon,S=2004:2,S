> Title: Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices
> Speaker: Craig Gentry, Stanford University
> Time/Place: 11 am, 18 March, Wozniak Lounge
> [Ed. note: 4th floor, Soda Hall, UC Berkeley]
>
> Abstract:
> We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme  
> that
> allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without access to
> the decryption function. First, we provide a general preliminary
> result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits
> evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an
> encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of)
> its own decryption circuit; we call such a scheme bootstrappable.
> Next, we provide a bootstrappable public key
> encryption scheme using ideal lattices.
