i am more interested in the redacted details of this little snippet:

    "Our pricing schedules reveal (for just two examples) that upon
the lawful request of law enforcement we are able to [XXX two examples
redacted by USMS XXX]. In cooperation with law enforcement, we do not
release that information to the general public out of concern that a
criminal may become aware of our capabilities, see a change in his
service, correctly assume that the change was made at the lawful
request of law enforcement and alter his behavior to thwart a law
enforcement investigation."

what two examples of lawful intercept on Verizon lines would introduce
a subtle "change in service" detectable by someone paying attention?
