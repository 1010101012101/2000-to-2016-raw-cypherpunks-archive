Uhm, no. The SS is very pro. And that is THE DETAIL. (As for me, I figure
somebody can read my communication attributes. On second thought... *ponder*
I think a keystroke logger would be a good thing for me.) Realize the
cultural differences. A bunch of highly-educated, clean-cut professional
agents breaking into a female's house around here... it could be that some
women around here don't want to issue warrants -- they want to issue
invitations.

I have an interest in VIP privacy problems, so I'm appalled by the circus
and fanfare. I imagine they wanted some solitude -- what little they can
steal. I had a cabin in CLOSE proximity, and I didn't gawk once. All I know:
I now have take-out prime rib down the road.
