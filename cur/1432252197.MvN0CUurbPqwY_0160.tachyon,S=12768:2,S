TODAY'S NEWSLETTER LOOKS AT LEADING PLAYERS IN THE RED-HOT SERVER 
APPLIANCE MARKET

Sun Microsystems (SUNW) thinks so highly of the server appliance 
market that it plans to spend about $2 billion to buy Cobalt 
Networks (COBT). Sales of scaled-down servers, which help manage 
how desktop machines communicate and work together, are expected 
to reach more than $12 billion by 2004. That's up from around $1 
billion this year, according to IDC. The market continues to 
attract some major players hoping to target small business and Web 
site hosting firms looking to buy server appliances to help manage 
networks. In today's newsletter, we look at the companies leading 
the migration toward server appliances.

Leaving on a Jet Plane (Maybe)
Did you know that if you are involuntarily bumped from a flight 
and the airline arranges substitute transportation scheduled to 
arrive at your destination between one and two hours after your 
original arrival time (between one and four hours on international 
flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to your one-way 
fare, with a $200 maximum? Find more tips and "Strategies for
