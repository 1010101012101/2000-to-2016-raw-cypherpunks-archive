"Who should your computer take its orders from? Most people think their 
computers should obey them, not obey someone else. With a plan they 
call "trusted computing", large media corporations (including the movie 
companies and record companies), together with computer companies such 
as Microsoft and Intel, are planning to make your computer obey them 
instead of you. Proprietary programs have included malicious features 
before, but this plan would make it universal."
