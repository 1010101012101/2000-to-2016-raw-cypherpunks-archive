Partially agreed - a user doesn't have to know *how* it works, but must
have to take a positive step (eg, type in a password, answer "yes" to a
"are you really sure you want to do this" message, that sort of thing)
for it to be binding under most e-sig legislation. However, the law of
contract assumes every dotted i and crossed t is read and fully
understood to the full measure of the law. Enough people get caught out
this way each year (they find the contract they signed isn't what they
negotiated but (eg) binds them to a full term of service (say, two
years) when they wanted a three month trial...
There is a balance to be had here. it should be impossible for a random
user to walk up to their powered off pc, power it on, then sign a
document. It should be extremely difficult for a random user to walk up
to a pc that has been left logged on (but which hasn't been used to sign
documents for five minutes or so) and sign a document; it should be easy
for the user to sign a large number of documents in rapid succession,
without having to type in a complex password every single time. If this
involves remembering the password for a specified "idle" time, or using
a smartcard to auth (rather than a manual password or in addition) that
the user can remove when he takes a coffee break then fine - but
whatever you do must almost certainly use no other hardware than is
already fitted to the machine, so a usb dongle could be ok for a home
user but a credit-card style smartcard almost certainly won't be
(although if anyone knows a decent floppy-adaptor for smartcards, I
would love to know about it)
