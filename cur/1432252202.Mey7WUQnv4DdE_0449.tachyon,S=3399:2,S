You're right - now that I look at it in more depth, I'm not at all sure
that it's a PHD in philosophy. As opposed to just an ordinary doctorate in
some other field. Thanks for pointing this out...

This makes me even more interested to find material which discusses
zero-knowledge proofs from, say, a philosophy of math standpoint. or
anything "interesting" yet outside the usual technical standpoint.

As for your question, I don't know of any e-mail software which offers
plausible deniability. Maybe something to add to gpg?
