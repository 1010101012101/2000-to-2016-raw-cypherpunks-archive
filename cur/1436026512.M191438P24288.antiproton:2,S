It's been a while since code was announced on cypherpunks...

RepBin: https://github.com/repbin/repbin/tree/v0.0.1

Repbin is an encrypted pastebin for the command line that runs over Tor!
Repbin servers form a distributed network where nodes sync posts with
each other (like in Usenet or BBS/Fido systems). This makes Repbin
resilient and scalable. Repbin focuses on privacy (encrypted messages)
and anonymity (padding and repost chains).


Features
--------
- Forward secure encryption of posts using DHE-curve25519. Even a
   compromised long-term key does not allow to decrypt old posts.
- Integrity protection of posts using HMAC-SHA256. You can be sure that
   posts have not been tampered with.
- Confidentiality of posts using AES256-CTR. Without the recipient key,
   nobody can read the post.
- All posts are padded to a common size. That means that posts are not
   distinguishable by their size when looking ``on the wire''.
- Post are replicated between all servers in the Repbin network.
- Optional constant receiver keys for post-box functionality.
- Receiver key attributes for synchronization and post-box
   authentication.
- Resource control via hashcash (sha256) and ed25519.
- Some privacy protection by using Tor for all communication and
   ephemeral keys.
- undocumented goodies.


Post a file
-----------
$ cat FILE | repclient

As a response you will receive output like this:

Pastebin Address: 
http://bvuk3xmvslx3idcj.onion/3x77hJtt42MkGbs18e1ZvBw9oAftAUrr9K9x4E8rQzed_2PGBikD5hEcXh7kT4vtKPsZuwymWMeBNeGiRpQ24upB3

Simply give the Pastebin Address to whoever should gain access to the
file. Fetch:

$ repclient 
http://bvuk3xmvslx3idcj.onion/3x77hJtt42MkGbs18e1ZvBw9oAftAUrr9K9x4E8rQzed_2PGBikD5hEcXh7kT4vtKPsZuwymWMeBNeGiRpQ24upB3

Installation
------------
Client software to send and receive file:

$ go get -u github.com/repbin/repbin/cmd/repclient

Peering
-------
If you are an experienced UNIX sysadmin, please consider running your
own Repbin server to help the Repbin network.

While running a server requires hardly any interaction, setting up a
server in the Repbin network requires at least one manual peering
agreement with another server in the network. This is a time-tested
architecture which is used successfully to run the Internet, the Usenet,
and BBS networks like FidoNet. To set up a peering you have to exchange
public peering keys with another server and configure your server
accordingly.

To get in touch with us for peering send a message to
7VW3oPLzQc7VS2anLyDtrdARDdSwa7QTF7h3N2t6J2VN_AjWZQfHoqK3yNqvXPkcswLNXSzFrCzJuRRKZKvY71UWT
and don't forget to put your own key into the message.

The server installation and the peering process is described in detail
in the documentation.

Here be dragons...

Dive deeper into the documentation and the code, if you want to figure
out how to send repost messages (remailer style) and how to run your own
reposter service!
