If morality is merely relative, then what is wrong with murdering a few 
million jews, kulaks, or people as irritating as James A. Donald?  All a 
matter of perspective, isn't it?

 > "evil" could, I believe, be *defined* as "the term pretty much
 > everyone uses to describe his or her enemies".

People who use this definition have a disturbing tendency to define entire 
social groups, races, classes, as their enemies.

The reason we define certain killings as murder is not because "the bible 
tells us so",  but because we want to know if a killing indicates that the 
killer is apt to kill murderously.

In practice we notice that one piece of metal is like another, and other 
kinds of metal unlike, and we call one such group of pieces of metal 
"iron", "iron" being our word for that commonality that makes them 
alike.  The naming does not make it iron, but the character of the metal 
itself.

Similarly we observe that one deed, and one man, is like another, and 
another unlike, and we call one such group of men and deeds "evil", "evil" 
being our word for that commonality that makes them alike.

Let us look at how real people in real life use the word "evil":

Immediately after the bombing of Serbia, lots of US government officials 
went out on TV to argue that the bombing of Serbia was necessary and 
advisable because the ruler of Serbia was
"evil".  I do not have a transcript, but it seemed clear to me that they 
did not argue that he was evil, therefore deserved to have his soldiers 
blown up, but instead argued that he was evil, therefore his soldiers were 
likely to cause harm, therefore it was a wise precaution to blow his 
soldiers up.

They unhesitatingly drew an empirical conclusion from a normative fact, and 
they reasonably expected that everyone listening would find the alleged 
normative fact compelling evidence for the empirical conclusion.

They crossed the "is ought gap" without the slightest difficulty, and so 
does everyone else except for monsters and philosophers.  I find it 
striking that many of the philosophers who have such great difficulty with 
this alleged gap have some connection to monstrous regimes.  Not all of 
them by any means, but most of them.
