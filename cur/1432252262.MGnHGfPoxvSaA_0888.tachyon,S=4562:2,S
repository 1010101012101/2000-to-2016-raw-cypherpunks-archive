  Subject: MIT CONFERENCE ON REAL ID ACT IS POSTPONED AND AUGMENTED BY ONLINE
   DISCUSSION

  Please be advised that the public forum originally scheduled for
  Wednesday, September 14, 2005 to address the REAL ID Act of 2005 has
  been postponed. This has become necessary because many of the people
  interested in the forum are from the homeland security and first
  responder communities, and their focus is now squarely on the ongoing
  efforts to recover from Hurricane Katrina.

  In place of the September 14th public forum, the MIT Media Lab and the
  MIT E-Commerce Architecture Program will be organizing an online forum
  to start a conversation about the REAL ID Act of 2005. This online forum
  will be an ongoing, asynchronous event lasting from Monday, September
  19, 2005 through Friday, September 23, 2005.  This online discussion
  will include presentation by leaders in the field, policy experts and
  governmental officials who will give deeper background on the status and
  issues related to REAL ID.  There will also be an opportunity for all
  registrants to participate in a dialog with the speakers and each
  other.  Additional details about the online forum will be available
  shortly at http://ecitizen.mit.edu/realid.html.  Please register at that
  web site between now and September 19th in order to participate in this
  web-based discussion.

  Finally, there will be a physical meeting at MIT to discuss the REAL ID
  Act of 2005 on Thursday, November 17, 2005. The upcoming online forum
  will provide an excellent opportunity to design this event so as to
  provide the maximum benefit for the people who will be attending this
  gathering.

  In the meantime, please continue to use the registration feature on the
  website to let us know if you are interested in participating in the
  online forum or attending the November meeting. Also be sure to check
  the website periodically for additional details.

  Regards,

  Daniel J. Greenwood,
