	...but I do have some inside information about the 'legal

	Yes, all of that is true. I am aware of the fact that there are
	different factions inside a government. I did explicitly
	mention that. It doesn't affect my argument(s) though.

	Sorry, but that's circular. 

	You *assume* tor isn't designed as a tool to further imperial
	american policies and you arrive at the conclusion that there
	are some 'good guys' in the US government. 

	Too bad your assumption is what you actually need to prove. 
	
	The argument here is that tor is a small network that can be
	more or less easily 'traffic analyzed'  by the US government -
	the same government that created it. This is not 'rocket
	science'...
