I rather doubt that anyone outside of the CIA could really 
say what they would or would not do in such a situation.  Recall
that people in that world view deceit as much more than a 
skill.  It's more of a way of life to them, and as a result
of so many years of rounds of layerd deceit colouring their 
operations, the analysis of their actions is bound to fail
when approached with that kind of simplicity.

Oh, by the way.  The last post I made in reply to you went
unanswered just when I was starting to make some difficult
points.  Surely that was an oversight?


Regards,

Steve
