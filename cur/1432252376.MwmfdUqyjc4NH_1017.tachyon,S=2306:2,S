Arguing "intent" in business matters comes very close to being pure 
"thoughtcrime."

I was a participant in Intel Corporation's famous "CRUSH" program, a 
program to try to drive competitors, including AMD, out of business.

If you think businesses are not trying to drive other businesses into 
bankruptcy, you need to wake up and look around. Nothing illegal about 
this, nothing unconstitutional.

As with so-called "hate crimes" like burning effigies or crosses,  
existing laws about vandalism, trespassing, theft, etc., are more than 
enough. No additional laws about trying to drive a competitor out of 
business or burning a cross to protest the Holocaust Myth are needed.
