The overall message isn't all that bad, 
but the body of the document is so replete
with errors, misrepresentations and 
misconveyance as to be unreadable.

I almost gave up on it at the line, 
"More than 75 per cent of Americans 
would boycott stores selling goods 
produced in sweatshops."

This isn't even remotely based in reality.
Who ever came up with this number, assuming
it was sincere, is seriously deluded.

There are plenty of other inaccuracies that
would have better been left unstated.
