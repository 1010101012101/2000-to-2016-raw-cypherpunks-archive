Yes, the Democrats pushed for this.

In other states, the unions gave their members the day off. At least 
this is the established way to buy votes.

Having the courts extend the hours so that more inner city mutants 
can stagger down to the polls is inexcusable.

And it would serve the Democretins right if an appeals court 
ultimately reverses the decision to extend the polling hours and 
throws out _all_ of the tainted votes.

I expect "The polling hours are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m." to be upheld. 
People arrange their schedules accordingly. If they work hours such 
that they cannot be at the polling places during these hours, they 
obtain absentee ballots. Or they take personal time off of work. Or 
they go in an hour later. Etc.

No, my objection is a change in the rules at the 11th hour, 
instigated by one party.

I would be just as incensed if Palm Springs and West Palm Beach had 
changes made to their voting situations as a result of Republican 
legal actions a few hours before the polls were to close.

As to your insults lobbed at me, _you're_ the one hiding behind a nym.
