The basic attack pattern is extensible to a relay and any service which 
can be correlated with each other, through any sufficiently selective 
metadata divulged by both services. It ain't a new one, either; I seem 
to remember this sort of stuff being done from at least 2008, which 
prolly makes the idea older since I'm not exactly a pro in the field.

The general statistical attack pattern is correlate, accumulate and 
intersect. The research behind Tor talks about this stuff already, and 
notes it cannot be stopped if we presume the relay operator leaks such 
correlated information. So yes, you ought to be worried -- as the 
operator of a hidden service.
