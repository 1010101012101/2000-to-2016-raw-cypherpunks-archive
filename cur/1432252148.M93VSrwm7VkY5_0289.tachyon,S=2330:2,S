The problem you're seeing arises because your mailer and others like
it (Outlook, etc.) do not follow the PGP/MIME standard (RFC 2015,
Oct. 1996), which calls for the support of the content-types
application/pgp-encrypted, application/pgp-signature, and
application/pgp-keys.  Unfortunately, many of us use mailers that make
some attempt at supporting standards, and in the end you just can't
read our mail.

There is at least some blame to be placed with the people who came up
with these standards.  A lack of backwards-compatibility is almost
always a recipie for disaster, especially because of the sheer number
of mail programs available.  Fortunately, I'm using an open-source
mail client, so I'm not stuck with unsupported standards. :-)
