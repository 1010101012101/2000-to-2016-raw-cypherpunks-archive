I am working on a linux distribution that is using the hardware RNG for
seeding/rng in number of things (IPSEC, ssh, ssl, gpg, etc) and this is
definitely the angle I am excited about.

A 1Ghz proc goes a long way, but in a media intensive system (video,
audio, streaming over wireless) you want to keep CPU load as light as
possible so that latency is minimal.

With the C5P you can now do VPN with AES, rng via the hardware entropy,
and video offload via the CLE266.  This leaves the CPU free to handle
various interrupts for the wireless network, disk i/o, etc.

Very nice move, I think.

I have written some poor code and info regarding the C5XL (nehemiah)
and linux:

[ I'll be cleaning code up and releasing new patches/srcs soon ]

A lot of peer networking applications use SHA digests for securely
identifying resources in a network.  The overhead of this for large
volumes of content will make this a welcome addition :-)

Also, Centaur indicated that with the SHA on die, they can produce
statistically perfect RNG output.  The von neumann whitener does let
a small bias through for very large data sets IIRC (i.e. a
statistical bias is detectable in 1G or more data)

If you are using the hardware rng via a user space daemon feeding
/dev/random then this is no longer an issue.

I am also curious about crypto-loop file system acceleration / CPU offload.
There are a number of uses I am anxious to try with this hardware.

Best regards,
