members of Japan, image of their swastika:

The original name of the mafia in the
US was "Black Hand".

#    EASTERN SWASTIKA CAUSES RAGE IN GERMANY
[snip]    
#    Ironically, the swastika is now a sensitive issue in China, too, 
#    as it is also the symbol of the banned Falun Gong meditation 
#    cult. Recently, when Falun Gong protesters in New York carried 
#    banners bearing Buddhist swastikas, outraged New Yorkers mistook 
#    them for Nazis.
