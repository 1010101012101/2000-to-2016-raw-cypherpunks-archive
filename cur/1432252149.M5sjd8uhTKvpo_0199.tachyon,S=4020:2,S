I know trying to educate you to the ways of the world is a futile
effort, but I can't resist sometimes. How does my great wonderful
reputation reduce the cost of doing business with me? It may well
give me more business, but certainly not chaper business. I don't
care how reliable you are, if you start skimping on security your
reliability goes down in my book. --Gabe

to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to 
perish than to live as slaves.
