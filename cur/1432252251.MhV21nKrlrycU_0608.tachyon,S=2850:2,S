I didn't invent the definition. The 'socialist' did.

Not really. The Solidaros movement was a democratic movement where they
wanted to impliment a government that had representation and guaranteed
civil rights (I don't know exactly how far along they've come). But at no
point was their goal the continued management of speech, work, income,
etc. through a central government mechanism.

BAD comparison. The Fortune 500's can't kill me and they can't throw me in
jail for not buying their products or participating in their programs. I
further have the right to tell them to fuck off (equivalent to secession).
