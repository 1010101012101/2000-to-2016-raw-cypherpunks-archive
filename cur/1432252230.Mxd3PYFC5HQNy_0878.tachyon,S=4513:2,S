ya know this does sound like an april fools joke (esp. the part about
encouraging the photographer to enter into counseling.) but while working
for aol i remember companies trying to sell me on the concept of 'anti-porn'
pic filtering software.  it worked by looking for a high percentage of flesh
tones in a pic.  if the pic hit the min. level of flesh tone we could block
it from proxy servers, or filter it from kid view, etc.  worked essentially
like the satellite image processing software used to locate certain types of
flora or pollution, etc.  none of it was quick enough or reliable enough to
work properly (not sure about the current state of the art though).

This is an April Fool, right?  Even if the tech existed, it would
require substantial processing power and there's no way they could
get it into cameras by... um, by April First ...
