If VOIP gets no protection, then you'll see a lot of "digital" bugs in
various spy shops again - and they'll all of a sudden be legal.  I thought
the Feds busted lots of people for selling bugging equipment, etc. because
they're an invasion of privacy, etc.

Ditto for devices that intercept digital cellular phone conversations, 
spyware software that turns on the microphone in your computer and sends 
the bits out over the internet, ditto for tempest'ing equipment ("But 
your honor, it's stored for 1/60th of a second in the phosphor! It's a 
storage medium!"), etc.


Hey, they can't have their cake and eat it too.  It's either protected or
it isn't.
