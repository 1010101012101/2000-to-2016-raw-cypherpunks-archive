Because they're two different threats, one that's within the users' purview
and the other is the service operator's.

1) Cloudflare is active MITM & payload delivery platform.
Use a throw-away to browse, you can't be sure of the integrity. Oops.


2) I hope IA and other parties don't know I was drooling over TS dox.
Use an anonymizing platform. If you're relying on the operator to 'not keep
logs' *you're doing it wrong*, not JY.
