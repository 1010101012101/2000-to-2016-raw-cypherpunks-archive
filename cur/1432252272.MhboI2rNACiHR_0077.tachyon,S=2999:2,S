Sandia National Laboratories Test Exonerates Ivins

While government apologists are still trying to pretend there is a case that
Bruce Ivins was the anthrax killer, tests by Sandia National Laboratories
have exonerated him.

As the publisher of the prestigious scientific journal Nature writes:

    At a biodefence meeting on 24 February, Joseph Michael, a materials
scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
presented analyses of three letters sent to the New York Post and to the
offices of Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Spores from two of those
show a distinct chemical signature that includes silicon, oxygen, iron, and
tin; the third letter had silicon, oxygen, iron and possibly also tin, says
Michael. Bacteria from Ivins' RMR-1029 flask did not contain any of those
four elements.

    Two cultures of the same anthrax strain grown using similar processes b
one from Ivins' lab, the other from a US Army facility in Utah b showed the
silicon-oxygen signature but did not contain tin or iron. Michael presented
the analyses at the American Society for Microbiology's Biodefense and
Emerging Diseases Research Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland.

It had previously been known that the killer anthrax contained silicon - an
agent for weaponizing anthrax. But I have never previously read that the
killer samples also contained iron and tin.

As the world's top anthrax experts have pointed out, Ivins did not possess
either the know-how or the equipment to weaponize the anthrax. See this and
this.

In addition, as Nature points out:

    Ravel also sequenced the genome of a Bacillus subtilis strain that was
found in one of the letters. That sample did not match a B. subtilis strain
found in Ivins' lab, says Bannan, but the bacterial contamination still could
have come from somewhere else in Ivins' institution.

There is simply no credible evidence incriminating Ivins.
