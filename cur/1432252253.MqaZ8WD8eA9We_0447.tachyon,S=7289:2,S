This is an informational mailing regarding NBC Internet, Inc.  You 
have received this e-mail because our records indicate that you are 
a registered user of www.nbci.com.

NBCi is in the process of making certain changes to our portal 
offering that may affect the way you use the site.  We are making 
these modifications in light of recent changes in the Internet 
advertising and financial markets.  The following questions and 
answers will provide you with information about the upcoming changes.

A. What will happen now?

1. Initially, most of NBCi's current features and services will 
   remain operational with certain exceptions, including the 
   following:
     - New files will not be able to be uploaded to 
       http://sharehouse.nbci.com;
     - New pictures will not be able to be uploaded to some NBCi 
       clubs; 
     - The Pogo game section of NBCi has recently been transitioned  
       to http://www.pogo.com/. We anticipate that NBCi members may 
       login to the http://www.pogo.com/ url using an existing 
       account, retaining current ranking and earned points.
     - On July 6th, Fusion One will discontinue their sync service 
       with the NBCi calendar application.  (You will still be 
       able to use Fusion One to synchronize with non-NBCi 
       applications.)

2. The www.nbc.com url will continue to take you directly to 
   programming information about the NBC Television Network.

Note:  In the coming months, you may see additional changes to the 
www.nbci.com site.  It is our intention to provide you with advance 
notice of any significant changes to our portal offering.  Notice 
will be sent to the alternate e-mail address currently listed in 
your NBCi membership information.  

B. What does this mean to you?

1. Make sure you have a backup of all data stored on www.nbci.com 
  (such as your web site and shared files), as well as on Xoom.com 
   and SNAP.com.  Such a backup should be stored on your hard drive, 
   on floppy disks or other web site hosting providers, but not on 
   NBCi.

2. Begin evaluating alternative web site hosting providers.  We 
   recommend that you plan to have your site and shared files hosted 
   by a different provider as soon as possible and before July 15th.  
   NBCi has made arrangements with Homestead.com for web page hosting
   and XDrive.com for file storage to help make the transition a  
   smooth one.
     - For more information about Homestead.com for your web page 
       hosting needs, visit: 
       http://homesteadannouncements.homestead.com/NBCI.html
     - For more information about Xdrive.com for your file storage 
       needs, visit: 
       http://plus.xdrive.com/target.html?path=signup.html,aff=nbci061301

3. Copy the contents of your address books (used in Calendar and 
   e-mail applications) onto your hard drive so that you have access 
   to that information when you are not on NBCi.  (Again, we expect 
   that your e-mail address will continue to work, but you should 
   make a copy of data such as e-mail addresses and the contents of 
   important e-mails for your records.)

4. Copy the contents of your portfolios, such as the stock names and 
   symbols, purchase dates, amounts, etc., so that you have access to 
   that information when you are not on NBCi.

Instructions for copying and printing the contents of your address 
book and portfolio are published at:
http://www.nbci.com/LMOID/resource/0,566,-5687,00.html.

C. How can you stay informed?

     - The contents of this e-mail as well as answers to frequently 
       asked questions will be located at: 
       http://www.nbci.com/LMOID/resource/0,566,-5605,00.html
     - If you have specific questions about your e-mail account, 
       contact mail.com (a separate company) directly using this 
       form: 
       http://www2.email.com/snap/supportform.jhtml.  

Note:  If you use NBCi through one of our ISP distributors, such as  
PacBell, Verizon or Prodigy, please contact your ISP directly for
additional information.
