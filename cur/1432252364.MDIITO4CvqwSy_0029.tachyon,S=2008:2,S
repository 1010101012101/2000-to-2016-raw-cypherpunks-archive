A few more Tor questions..

Are there yet commercial Tor web hosters? How much would this cost vs 
hosting one's own node? Since I assume the website actually resides on a 
single node, there is the slight problem of the node owner knowing, at 
least, that he had been paid to host X sites, on such-and-such dates...not 
optimal of course but not everyone in the world is going to want to run a 
Tor node just to put a site up (like me).

Also, there -is- a one-to-one mapping between Tor nodes and Tor-hosted 
sites, no? It's not like a site is cryptographically split into 
quasi-redundant pieces, placed on random servers, and then assembled on the 
fly when there's a request, right? Can Tor support such a thing in the 
future? (eg, Website file A is split into N partially redudant pieces and 
sent to N servers...the website can still be retrieved from any M pieces, 
where N<=M.)

-TD
