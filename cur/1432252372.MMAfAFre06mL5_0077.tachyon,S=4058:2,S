Having been to MIT is evidence that someone is a threat? Knowing about
science is reason to suspect someone of crime?  All over the world geeks
& nerds and stereotyped sad men in short-sleeved shirts with pens in
their top pockets are trembling with glee. Hey, we're *dangerous* !
Someone takes us seriously! Federal agents are scared of us!  All those
long evenings of staying up late playing D&D and listening to "Bat out
of Hell" and watching Arnie videos and finally someone realises that we
are seriously scary! 

Hey, I was at the Durham University Botany department in the mid-1970s.
*And* I'm doing a course in microbiology right now.  Look on my lab
reports ye mighty, and despair!  Oh, and Mr. Agent, you wouldn't believe
what I know about degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis that you
don't. I've got an Eppendorf and I know how to use it!

Is this normal in US courts? Is it as biased and unfair as it sounds on
the face of it?
