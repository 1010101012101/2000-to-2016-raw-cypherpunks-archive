I have had one case where taking the train was a big win over driving.  I
was consulting in San Francisco, about 60 miles from my home.  I found that
if I rode the train, I could work as I rode, and turn my travel time into
billable hours. I also avoided the ruinous parking charges in downtown.
Given those facts, I would have taken the train even if the ticket price
hadn't been subsidized.

Cheers - Bill
