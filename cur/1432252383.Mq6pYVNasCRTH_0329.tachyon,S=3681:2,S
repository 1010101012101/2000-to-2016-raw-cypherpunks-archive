"How about a pseudo random "conversation" generator appliance for the person 
trying to mask their speech.  If it closely models the vocal tract, language 
and language characteristics of the speaker it might be extremely difficult 
to remove as background noise."

There are plenty of CDs of conversations out there. Moreover, it would be 
easy to simply record a fairly banal conversation oneself was having. Then 
put it on a CD player that has repeat mode.

Of course, I'm willing to believe this can still be chopped through with the 
appropriate eavesdropping gear. But the point is that with about $10 bucks 
of investment, you now force eavesdroppers to deploy $1000s (or more) of 
gear and people. Adds a kind of reverse DC-bias to the situation, no? Now, 
only the determined will be going after you, not someone merely fishing for 
levers to be used against you. Now, they have to send a truck....'
