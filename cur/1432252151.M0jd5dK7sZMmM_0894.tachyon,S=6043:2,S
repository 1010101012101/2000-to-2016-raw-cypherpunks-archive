We are all independant spies and intel agencies, complete
with various responsibility, ethic and philosophy.

Cyber like a career?, it usually constrains to follow good or bad path.
But the spy can be selective in its use. And the more self aware it
becomes, the more that use tends toward what non spies would
consider bad.

Now that we're becoming, are able to, and have built some
of the systems early cpunks could previously only think of
and warn about, we'll get to see if tech continues to be
sprayed about as a liberal be-all cure-all, or develops
some conscious genuine brakes.
