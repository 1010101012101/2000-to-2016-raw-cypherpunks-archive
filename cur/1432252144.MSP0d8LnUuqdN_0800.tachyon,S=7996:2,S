I'm mostly a lurker, too, but I'll remark that Firechat can't be bogus:
its use caught on in a massive way, and the ease of use and the P2P
connection feature is playing an active part in a community's SUCCESSFUL
self-organization in the face of real repression. While you're
absolutely right that an app can't call itself anonymous if it collects
Google Play information on its users, the question about whether the app
allows perfect anonymity isn't as important as: does the app allow
perfect anonymity from Beijing? Is there a danger that Google Co. Inc.
will help the government of China identify Firechat users in the case of
a retroactive crackdown? This is a political problem North Americans
could indeed work on, if it came down to that. This conversation reminds
me of Quinn Norton's "assess your adversary" talk at HOPE
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkjrbK3DyRM).

I'd also point out that I believe Firechat is open source. And on
Github: https://github.com/firebase/firechat They're working on adding
encryption:
