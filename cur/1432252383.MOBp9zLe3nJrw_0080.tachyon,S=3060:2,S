Terror Statement May Hold Secret Msg.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State Colin Powell cautioned on Wednesday
that the statements
made by Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization and broadcast on
televisions around the world may
contain ``some kind of message.'' 

Powell said analysts were looking at the statements, including the one
made Tuesday by al-Qaida
spokesman Abu Ghaith praising the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United
States and warning there would
be more. 

The secretary of state, appearing on CNN, also thanked the network for
limiting its broadcast of the
statements. 

``I think it's responsible on the part of CNN to shade that a little bit
so that we don`t have it coming full
force at us and with the potential of perhaps conveying some kind of
message,'' he said. 

CNN did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment about what
exactly they will air in the
future.
