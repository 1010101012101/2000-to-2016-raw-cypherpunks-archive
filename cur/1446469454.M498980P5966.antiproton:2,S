Are you able to provide something more for the curious please?

I agree with this. We can hypothesize how 'natural monopolies/
utilities' would work - how do we manage a transition? And given that
most people in a "democracy" almost always acquiesce to an evil
dominating imposition by the state (eg parking fine), how could
political anarchy be better? Does power not tend to coalesce/
centralise? J Paul Getty - distribute the worlds wealth (he meant
money I think) equally to everyone, and in 90 days most of it will be
back where it was before you started the exercise (I'm paraphrasing of
course).

It's the "mouth open drooling" part that I have always maintained is
our greatest problem, and why I believe that our education system has
been intentionally deteriorated to a schooling and baby sitting (baby
creating) system. Just another aspect that needs fixing/ redesigning/
reworking/ major change.


> this is being taught now in primary schools
