>     According to the report accompanying a spending bill that's awaiting a
>     floor vote in the Senate:
>
>       * The FBI will receive an extra $7 million for technology to thwart
>         encryption. The appropriations committee intends for it to be
>         spent on: "(1) analysis/exploitation of systems to allow access to
>         data pre-encryption, (2) recognition/decryption of data hidden in
>         plain sight, and (3) decryption of encrypted data."
>       * Another $7 million goes to a plan to improve "intercept
>         capabilities." The fed-speak for this is "developing broadband
>         capabilities, and procuring prototypes capable of intercepting
>         transmissions outside of the FBI's technical reach." Translation:
>         Create better ways to eavesdrop on cable modems and DSL
>         connections.
>       * Antitrust enforcement gets a boost. The division, best known
>         recently for its dogged pursuit of Microsoft, receives $3.6
>         million extra, but $10 million less than the Bush administration
>         requested. The committee predicts a slew of mergers because of
>         "the collapse of high technology stocks, and the resultant
>         downward pressure on all stock prices."
>       * Las Vegas, St. Louis, Charleston and Kansas City will split $6
>         million earmarked for gun surveillance technology. The plan is to
>         spend it on acoustic sensors scattered around downtown areas so
>         the location of a gunshot can be triangulated and located.
