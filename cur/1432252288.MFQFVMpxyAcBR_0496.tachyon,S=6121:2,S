Baloney.  That is the "everyone else is doing it" excuse.  Not everyone 
else is doing it.  Those that were doing it, were monsters, and decent 
people had no hesitation in saying so, centuries ago as much as 
today.   See, for example Saint Thomas Aquinas on the persecution of jews.

Sure.  When  the US fled, the killing escalated and spread, rather than 
diminished, showing that the cause of the war was communist aggression, 
something that had not been altogether clear before the US was defeated.

We know well the reasons why commies murdered commies and nazis murdered nazis.

I have answered them repeatedly, and I will answer them yet again, but I 
expect you will keep on asking them anyway.

Evil people are likely to do hurtful things (bad things) to me unless I get 
them first.  Normal people will not do hurtful things to me unless I do bad 
things to them first.  Hence my use of nazis, commies, and murder as 
illustrations and examples of evil.  As I would point to the a particular 
piece of iron to define all iron, to define the category iron, in the same 
way I point to murder, nazis, and commies to define all evil, to define the 
category evil.

See above.
