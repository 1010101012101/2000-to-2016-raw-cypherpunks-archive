Wow. Nice ego there.

Nor the obligation for any other party to provide you with a soapbox.
Operate your own wiki if you don't like their decisions.

What Roy said. This Wikiwhiner might want to read up on the OSI model.

True enough, but to make it clear, an anonymizing network is not

hidden field couldn't provide session continuity for an anonymous web
surfer.)
