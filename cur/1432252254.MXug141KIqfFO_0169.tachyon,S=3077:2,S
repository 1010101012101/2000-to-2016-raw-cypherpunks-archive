One of the curious aspects of the whole Sklyarov
affair is the silence of the Russians. I've not heard
of any comment from the Russian government on
the US news, the Novosti press agency has 
said nothing today or Tuesday (all I can check),
and TASS has a couple of headlines, but (as far
as I can tell) no editiorial material going either
way (I can't read the TASS articles without
a subscription).

Most odd....
