I'm going to trust you when you say you are an advocate for all the right reasons.

I also like to trust, but verify. I cannot verify without invading your privacy,
and since that's important to you, I won't.

The vested interests absolutely would love us all to believe privacy is dead,
but will not themselves give it up, making for an extreme imbalance of power.

I, on the other hand, am a person. I am not, however, particularly private, because
it costs me too fucking much in terms of money, time, and paranoia to actually test
and verify that shit I think is supposed to be private actually is.

What I want is for private cypherpunks and transparent cypherpunks to respect each
other's values and spill the secrets of the fuckers who say privacy is dead but will
only themselves give it up in the cold grip of the grave.
