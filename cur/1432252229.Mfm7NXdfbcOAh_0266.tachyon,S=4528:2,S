And my meta-Schelling point was actually that the concept of a Schelling 
point is itself a Schelling point: many people, even animals, come to 
the independent conclusion that figuring out where the Schelling points 
are is a good survival strategy. (Or something like this....you get the 
drift.)

Free societies operate mainly on the basis of local, mutually 
agreed-upon transactions. Organized crime usually pops up when some 
bunch of distant thugs sets up rules which distort these mutually 
agreed-upon transactions. The rise of the Mob during Prohibititon is a 
perfect example, oft-discussed. The rise of many crime units, including 
government crime operations, during the War on Some Drugs in the past 35 
years is another perfect example.

Even the Gulf War is a good example of this. There is no reason to 
believe Saddam Hussein would have "cut off the oil." Just the opposite, 
in fact. There is every reason to believe that a mostly modern society 
like Iraq (as of 1990) would have had far more pressures to pump oil 
than a small clique of Bedouin thieves would have to do so.

Evidence is strong that Iraq would have flooded the markets with oil.

I'm not defending Saddam as a Good Guy, just saying vital national 
interests were not involved. By getting into these "foreign 
entanglements," things have gotten much worse.
