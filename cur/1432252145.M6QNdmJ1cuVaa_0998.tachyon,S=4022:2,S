There was some talk on the Cypherpunks list some years back. May be 
findable in the archives with Google.

The political scumdroids will of course write liability exemptions 
into the laws. (Don't think they can do that? It's done a lot, 
especially when "it's for the children!!" gets invoked.)

As for what should be done with such scumdroids and the legal pieces 
of shit who support their actions, I'm not afraid to say what should 
be done with them: more freedom fighters like McVeigh need to park 
trucks filled with ANFO in front of their dens. That, or biological 
and nerve agents. Wiping out several hundred in one legislative 
session would send a message.
