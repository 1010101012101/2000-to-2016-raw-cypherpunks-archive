Still, you're in the minority.  If one could kill all the blood-biting
mosquitoes
without killing other bugs, birds, 'gators, etc it would be a good
thing.
Even if you eliminated malaria its not a good vector to have around.

And I bet most people would accept losing a very few species, or
reducing
the productivity of mosquito areas (probably temporarily), to get rid
of the mosquito.  Throw in poison ivy/oak extinction to convince most of
the greens
who hike and you've got a winner :-)
