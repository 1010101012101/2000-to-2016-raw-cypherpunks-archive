"This summer, federal scientists plan to release benign gases in
Manhattan and use the sensors to track them."

Reminds me of the good ole days when they released viruses in the subway for 
a similar purpose. I'm guessing that in this case "benign" depends on your 
definition of benign.

Want to scuttle a fed program? Broadcast this on the Villiage Voice boards 
and on as many gay sites as you can find.
