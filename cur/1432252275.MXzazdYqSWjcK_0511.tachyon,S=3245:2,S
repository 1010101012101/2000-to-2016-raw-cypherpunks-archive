I  had a Symbolics 3600 Lisp Machine on my desk--well, the monitor for 
it, at least. A few megs of RAM, a MIPS or so of processing power, and a 
1024 x 768 (IIRC) monochrome display. And an "awesome" (by the standards 
of 1985) 512 x 512 x 24 bits "Color System."

Did I have a camera attached? Yeah, in the lab next door.

Which explains why I skipped getting another IBM PC or Compaq when I 
left and instead got a Mac Plus. A lot less powerful than a Symbolics, 
but a lot more like a Symbolics than an IBM PC or PC AT was.

( I expect 98% of the readers here have no idea what a "Symbolics" is or 
was.)
