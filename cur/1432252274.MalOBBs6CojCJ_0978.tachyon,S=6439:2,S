Oh, no...don't try to cram me into that category (or practically any other 
you can think of, for that matter).

I'm a trained, degreed, published, and multi-patented physicsist. I regard 
as "Primary Sources" anything published in a fairly accepted journal or 
conference proceedings (though the latter can be hard to find, depending on 
the conference)....I might read a good review paper once in a while, but in 
the journals these are normally invited papers, and written by known people 
in the field they are summarizing.

My admission of ignorance of that end of Von Neumann is precisely that: 
admission of ignorance due to not having read much ABOUT him, and having 
only read his more famous papers.

As for a universal nano generator, that notion has seemed a little too 
science-fictiony for my tastes, though in the optical world some of my 
colleagues were developing some fairly amazing optical lab-benches on a 
chip, but these are more at the micron scale.

You'll pardon my scepticism about a universal generator being a useful 
notion any time in the near future...the recently defunct Optical Micro 
Machines (OMM) couldn't even get a micron-scale 3-D optical cross connect to 
work reliably (nor could anyone else, including Lucent, MEMS-R-US, or hosts 
of others), so that nano-scale generator is at least decades away, if it 
will ever be possible.
