Thus spake James A. Donald (jamesd@echeque.com) [17/09/05 03:56]:
: So when I buy coffee, that is political?

Is it organic, fair-trade, shade-grown coffee?  Locally grown?  Locally
roasted?  Purchased through StarBucks or a local coffee shop?  Do the
growers use their profits to help the growth of coca plants?  Or perhaps to
fund research into genetically modifying said coca plants to make them
resistant to pesticides?

You're damn right it's political.
