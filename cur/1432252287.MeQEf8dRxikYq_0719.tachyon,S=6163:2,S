A modestly high dimensional grid of some billion nodes doesn't look like
this:

It should look a lot like a Golgi stain of your neocortex, though, the
horizontal
component being dominating (until we've get several million birds zooming
over our heads in the starry sky).

The neocortex and the human CNS in general is also laid out in a specific
way, because it's also been/is subject to massive optimisation, both
evolutionary and in course of operation.

You're proving my point. The network started as a bureacratic, static,
tiny, suboptimal configuration. As it grew bigger, and started participating
in economy it started minimizing itself. This isn't just connectivity, but
goes down to the protocol level. We know IPv6 isn't the answer, mostly
because it is largely geography agnostic, can't handle nodes moving with
orbital speeds (or even a speeding car), doesn't handle interplanetary
latencies and isn't
local-knowledge routed/switched in general. It also can't handle relativistic
speed cut-through, which is the killer requirement.

You're correct, currently.

Things will become better as network ages, and especially if we get cellular
radio architectures in densely populated areas (there's about a GBit/s worth
of wireless bandwidth within a small cell, when we ignore THz and optical
wavelengths).

Human societies optimize. Geodesic is a shortest path on Earth surface.
Look at Christaller and followup (Christaller and geodesics is good first
start).

I'm not going to dive into city architecture, but compare these two adjacent
cities: http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/18393.aspx

A road is a place channeling traffic from A to B. Roman roads which are still
used (I use one quite frequently) were created between areas of major human
activity, requiring traffic frequent enough to warrant an expediture (in
terms of wealth fraction, roman roads were just as expensive as autobahns).

1) today, EU

today, elsewhere, looks different.

future, everywhere, looks even more different.
We're at the beginning of the optimization process. You can't cheat physics
in a relativistic universe, in an economic/evolutionary context.
