Total bullshit again. Yes, but the reason it's bullshit is that shooting 
messengers does no good. It leaves intact the originators of the message, 
all hundred- million of them. Tomorrow, the hundred million will be 
stumbling over each other trying to empower new messengers to replace those 
fallen. Who else but the messengers (politicians, bureaucrats, etc.) is 
going to collect the >money to pay the Social Security, after all? Who else 
is going to halt the drug trade?

Assassination Politics
Convicted tax evader Jim Bell proposes a system of anonymous ecash awards 
for the murder of "aggressors", such as IRS agents. See also Crypto-Convict 
Won't Recant. What he misses is that his system, if tolerated, would merely 
force government to operate secretly rather than openly

Jim says in the essay,It doesnt have to be,"wild in the streets"He doesn't 
miss a trick.He talks of the possibility of minarchy.Does anyone actually 
read the fucking essay? I part with him on offing forest grunts,btw.Its not 
about shooting 'messengers'.Its about making very credible threats to limit 
violence.Paradoxical but effective.
Halting the drug trades as imbecilic an idea as a "war on terror"
