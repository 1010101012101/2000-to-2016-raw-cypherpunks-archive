Shirley Jackson, The Lottery, sacrificing  a victim purges guilt
of the guilty.

Does anyone really believe RSA is alone in this "betrayal?"

And that making an example of RSA will stop the industry practice
of forked-tonguedness about working both sides of the imaginary
fence of dual-use, dual-hat, duplicity of comsec?

"Industry standards" were invented and are sustained for this
purpose. No matter NSA, RSA, IETF, NIST, this breast-beating
list of the guilty cryptographers pretending they did not know
what their best customers and employers are doing.

Boing Boing is being played like the crypto promotional wargame
is played.
