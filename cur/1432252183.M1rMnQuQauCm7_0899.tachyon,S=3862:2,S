Clearly putting the word 'tor' in your article generates
pageviews. There's the extreme position for the pageviews and then
there's reality. 

If Tor was marketed as a way to explicitly defeat the SOPA provisions,
if SOPA is passed as is, and if the US Attorney General's office comes
after Tor for specifically marketing Tor as a way to defeat the DNS
censorship of a blocked url in the US, then perhaps Declan is correct.

Even Wendy's blog post mentioned in Declan's blog post is full of 'could'
and 'if' statements. I take Declan's post with a huge grain of salt.

In some bizarre world where the First Amendment of the US Constitution
is gutted, then Tor falling under SOPA is the least of our concerns.
