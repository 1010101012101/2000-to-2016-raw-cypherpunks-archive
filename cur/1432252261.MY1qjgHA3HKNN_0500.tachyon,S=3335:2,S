There is a line, that line is harm, not discomfort. My argument is that
there are many things that cause discomfort, that's life, tough shit.
If smoking actually caused harm to people near a smoker, I wouldn't
protest any of these bans. But nobody has been able to prove it does.
I know exactly what consent is. I don't consent to the kid next to me in
my OS class who doesn't know what deodorant is stinking the room up, but
it doesn't cause me any harm so the law has no right to impose speed
stick on him.

People aren't permitted to blast music in the middle of the night
because it prevents other people from sleeping, which causes harm.
When smoking is banned in places, it removes the RIGHT of the owner of
that place to permit or prohibit a legal activity within their domain.
Without those laws the owner could permit smoking, and patrons could
then CONSENT to go to that place, or go somewhere else, where the owner
has prohibited smoking. So yeah, I know what consent is, do you know
what private property is?
