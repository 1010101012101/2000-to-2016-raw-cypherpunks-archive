Court rules up-skirt peep cams legal

In a ruling that could change fashions in Washington state, the supreme 
court there has ruled that "up-skirt cams" do not violate voyeurism laws. 
The Washington Supreme Court judges said that two men who took 
surreptitious photos and video of women and girls using tiny cameras 
"engaged in disgusting and reprehensible behavior." However, the judges 
said they did not infringe on any reasonable expectations of privacy 
because the images were captured in public places.

[Using almost identical logic cities around the country have passed 
ordinances prohibiting the wearing of masks.  So, by extension, might a 
city pass an ordinance that prohibits a woman from wearing underwear with a 
skirt?  Enquiring legal minds want to know ;-)  steve]
