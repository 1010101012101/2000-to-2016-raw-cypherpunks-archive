John Ross's novel _Unintended Consequences_ covers this. The book is
mainly about gun control in the US, but is easily extended to crypto and
civil rights issues. More to the point, in the latter third of the book,
some fed-up citizens start killing feds.

Decent book. A bit long, but fast reading. Recommended.
