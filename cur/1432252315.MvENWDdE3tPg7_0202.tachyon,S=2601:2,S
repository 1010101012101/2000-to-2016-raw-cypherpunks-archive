I don't understand the necessity of this. if the amount of traffic is a
constant anyway, a delay would vanish at the first node.

e.g. my upstreams provider sends out x bytes every time unit, no matter
whether or not he gets anything from me. when I stop sending, nothing in
his traffic pattern changes.
