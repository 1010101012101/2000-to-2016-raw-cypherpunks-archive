Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Hearing
To Be Closed To Public
Washington, D.C. - The Thursday afternoon hearing by the U.S. House 
Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation regarding the 
United States' drug interdiction strategy is expected to be closed to the 
public.
The Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ), is expected 
to vote to close the hearing to the public because sensitive law 
enforcement information will be discussed. Only Committee members, 
Committee staff, and essential personal staff will be allowed to remain in 
the hearing room after the hearing is closed.
