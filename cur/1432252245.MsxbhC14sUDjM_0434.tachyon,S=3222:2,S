Clearly. Obvious to *any* moron. Or at least active readers of the New

Times, which, I suppose, is redundant these days...


After all, John, markets can't exist without the state, right?

So, what should "we" do? Pass *more* laws? Should "we" abolish hedge  
funds
so the NSA and the USG doesn't take over the world? Obviously, your
analysis, and that of other poli-punks, is that there's this giant  
lump of
wealth in the world that never changes in size, that new wealth isn't  
made,
and lost, all the time, and, moreover, that wealth itself is evil and
should be evenly distributed so it's not so dangerous anymore...


Notice Soros made as much as the Feared NSA-oid, and I'm sure Red  
George is
a hedgie you would find, um, "Common Cause" with...

In the meantime, physics causes finance, which, in turn, causes  
politics.
Change that order, and you end up sounding like (with apologies to Howie
Carr) one of those silly old men with a grey ponytails who wear winter
clothes in summer --the one, like Madame deFarge, takes his knitting  
to all
public meetings...


John, I do believe your Official Weatherman "Columbia '68!" Souvenir
Tin-Foil Hat is cocked a little too far to the left this evening. Those
"capitalist" mind-rays could leak through if you're not careful.


Cheers,
RAH
