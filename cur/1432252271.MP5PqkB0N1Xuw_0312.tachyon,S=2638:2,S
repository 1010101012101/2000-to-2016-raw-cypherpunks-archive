Uhm. Good point. But I think that the Luxemborg wrinkle was interesting...

The more interesting idea is peer-to-peer VoIP. That plus crypto and I don't 
think prying ears could do a whole hell of a lot. In fact, the game may be 
over on some levels...certainly, CALEA seems to have at best a slippery 
legal hold on VoIP at all, and that's when the VoIP calls are hubbed or 
"switched" somehow (you packet heads can remove the quote-marks from 
'switched'). Peered VoIP seems to push any eavesdropping all the way out to 
the edges of the network.

In fact, I'm wondering if there may be a popular 'giving up' underway on the 
greater crypto issue, with greater starting to encompass voice traffic. 
Actually, while we're fighting Satan's Minions(TM) (ie, the evil 
dark-skinned ragheads), nobody seems to care as much about some hydroponic 
pot growers and whatnot, and Al Qaeda seems to think that word of mouth 
works just fine for disseminating mission-critical information.
