ANOTHER ANTI-HUNTING "SAAB"-STORY

In 1999, we reported that Saab Cars USA had entered into a relationship
with the largest anti-hunting extremist organization in America the
Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). Two years ago, Saab was
promoting an HSUS anti-fur campaign, and the latest issue of Saab
Magazine indicates the relationship is still strong, as it includes an
ad promoting HSUS. But does Saab also support anti-gun extremism? In the
same issue of the magazine is a story about Carl Frederick Reuterswdrd,
the Swedish artist who designed Saab's new symbol. Reuterswdrd is
probably best known for his sculpture of a revolver with its barrel tied
into a knot (a photo of the artist with this sculpture is included in
the magazine), a sculpture that
is displayed in front of the UN headquarters. If you wish to contact
Saab to express your objection to its working with anti-hunting
extremists (especially if you are a hunter who owns a Saab), please
write:
