Well technically you begin by granting trust to someone, the easiest being
yourself. Then you build trust in something else, use trust in one thing to
build trust in another. Regardless you have to establish trust in a single
location, before you can build trust in multiple.

I'm only worrying about future behavior, the past being something that will
never matter again in the behavior of the system, especially since we can't
plan on testing "in the past." In this particular case we are only concerned
with whether or not it will forward every message sent to it within some
very tight bounds so it is unlikely that a non-malicious entity would change
the configuration, if the configuration is changed in that respect then it
will be detected later on during the testing phase. The issue being that it
will represent other remailers as undependable, possibly while making itself
look flawless. This is a very difficult problem to solve.

But we can build trust in it's ability to forward messages in a way that is
for some definition anonymous, in particular the project is to eliminate
it's dropping of messages either at random or maliciously, or at least
determine which remailers perform the dropping and with what rate.

Which won't matter because the particular behavior we are trying to detect
will be reported on if they change, simply by the fact that the messages
will be dropped. All we're trying to do is build trust in the ability of a
single location to begin an anonymous analysis of the abilities of the
others to forward messages without dropping any (save a small ratio).
