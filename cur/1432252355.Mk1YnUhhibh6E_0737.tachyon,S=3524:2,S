30 release of cabinet documents in OZ reminded me of 1971 when I was 16.I 
went with some friends to an all white south effrikkkaan springbok match in 
melb.I was wearing a wrangler shirt that turned out to be lucky as the cop 
at the entrance ripped it open,popping all the press studs open.The P.I.Gs 
were looking for firecrackers.(remember those 2penny bungers I told you 
about.)Inside the match began amidst an allmighty din that affected the 
play,almost straight away.As did periodic pitch invasions.At one stage a 
mounted porker rode down a running man almost the entire length of the 
field.Spectacle to rival the coloseum!
Besides the circling hippie hordes banging,whistling and probing the 
defences of the thin blue line stretched thin around the oval,there was a 
situation developing down one end where a build up of protestors enabled 
some traditional demo argy-bargy push and shove with the odd bunger thrown 
for good measure.One exploded next to a young constables ear and he was 
carried off.The riots were even bigger in NZ and the nazi of the north,Joe 
bananas peterson,declared a state of emergency and anti-hippie 
krisstallnacht in Queensland that remained in place for years.138 arrests 
and 5 cops taken to hospital.It was a very good year.
