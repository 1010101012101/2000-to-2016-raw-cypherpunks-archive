If an ordinary person engages in physical intrusion to hack someone 
else's network, he is going to get in trouble.  Why is anyone shocked 
that Swartz got in trouble?

Why was Swartz shocked that he got in trouble?

This was not civil disobedience, it was the arrogance of ruling class 
mentality.  Swartz did not expect that his actions would have the 
consequences that they would have for an ordinary person.

Snowden, on the other hand, did.

As I am fond of remarking, Bill Ayers can bomb the Pentagon, but you 
cannot.  Swartz thought he was Bill Ayers.
