Okay, so the effective SHA-1 length is 138 bits instead of full
160 - so what's the big deal? It is still way more than, say, MD5
length. And MD5 is still widely used for stuff like content id'ing
in various systems, because even 128 bits is quite a lot, never
mind 138 bits.

# The research team of Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu
# (mostly from Shandong University in China) have been quietly
# circulating a paper announcing their results:
#
#   * collisions in the the full SHA-1 in 2**69 hash operations,
#     much less than the brute-force attack of 2**80 operations
#     based on the hash length.
#
#   * collisions in SHA-0 in 2**39 operations.
#
#   * collisions in 58-round SHA-1 in 2**33 operations.

# This attack builds on previous attacks on SHA-0 and SHA-1, and
# is a major, major cryptanalytic result. It pretty much puts a
# bullet into SHA-1 as a hash function for digital signatures
# (although it doesn't affect applications such as HMAC where
# collisions aren't important).
#
# The paper isn't generally available yet. At this point I can't
