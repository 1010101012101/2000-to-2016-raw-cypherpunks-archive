Good points. I've thought a lot about the possibility of such devices (I
suppose they are kind of obvious/inevitable to crypto-minded people).

One comment:

One the of the primary uses for such a device would be in protocols requiring
digital signatures. If the device is to be used for this, it would seem
necessary to also include a small display on it so the user can view what the
untrusted computer wants signed and authorize the signature. Of course, with
a screen, it's going to be more like a PDA and less like a key-chain sized
device.

One of these days, I might build a little device that stores a private key
and does on-board encryption using a microcontroller. I would do it just for
fun, since it is pretty useless if the infrastructure to support it is not out
there.
