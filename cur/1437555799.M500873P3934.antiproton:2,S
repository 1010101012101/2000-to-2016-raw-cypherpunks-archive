I will have to dig to find my archives of that era to be positive, but I'm pretty sure I joined by 1994 at the latest, probably 
1993. I installed the first firewall at Bank of America in late 1994, so it may have been much earlier since I'd already been into 
security for a while at that point.  I was part of the whole rise and fall of Detweiller.  I'm always puzzled that most people 
haven't heard of him.
