If you're talking,

http://einstein.ssz.com/cdr/index.html#subinst

then you can't read for shit. Let me quote (as I am looking at it real
time),

"Currently the only listproc based CDR nodes is openpgp.ent, however the
deprecated cypherpunks@toad.com also uses this. If you know that a
particular CDR node is using listproc for their remailer then send to:

cypherpunks-request@appropriate_domain_name"

cypherpunks-request@toad.com

Not rocket science.

Have a nice day.
