				</b>To start with, <b>if Streamedia were valued at the average 
				of its peers, it would be trading in the $3 to $4 range</b>, triple 
				or quadruple its recent price. That's a statistic that traders

				BANCORP PIPER JAFFRAY INDUSTRY RESEARCH REPORT</b><br>
				<b><img src="http://www.valuediscoveries.com/images/sp.gif" width="320" height="8"></b><br>
				A big help in differentiating Streamedia and its small group of 
				revenues-producing peers is an astounding <b>new research report 
				by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray</b>, whose analysts concluded that 
				"streaming media is the next macro growth driver on the Internet 
				... the Internet of tomorrow (two to five years) will resemble 
				television of today in terms of audio and video quality, while 
				enabling users to control the media viewing experience." This 
				powerful research report, which actually references Streamedia 
				as a select grouping of key players for tomorrow is located <a href="http://www.gotoanalysts.com/piperpublic/goto/feature_streamingmedia.asp">here</a>.</font></p>
			  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3). NEW 
				MANAGEMENT <br>
				<img src="http://www.valuediscoveries.com/images/sp.gif" width="320" height="8"><br>
                </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>New
                Vice Chairman, Robert Wussler, former president of CBS
Television</b>
                and co-founder with Ted Turner of CNN, TBS and TNN, calls
streaming
                media "The Third Broadcast Revolution". Wussler is
obviously a
                legend in the broadcast industry and continues in private
partnerships
                with Turner, as well as sitting on the boards of numerous
companies.
                He is a former president of the Atlanta Braves and like a
recent
                addition to the Board, Gary Feuerman, who was instrumental
in
                the development of CBS Sportsline (NASDAQ: SPLN), provides
the
                company with connections in the world of sports as well as
the
                corporate community. Wussler was also, for ten years,
president
                of the Emmys, so to suggest he is "connected" is an
understatement.
                <br>
				<br>
				<b>The company's new President/CEO is Henry Siegel</b>, like Wussler,
				one of the true legends in broadcast. Recognized by Advertising 
				Age as one of the "Pioneers of the First 50 Years of Broadcast", 
				Siegel has been canonized as the inventor of "barter syndication", 
				which is the lifeblood of the Cable industry as we know it. His 
				Baywatch series became the "most watched" television series in 
				history. He is also known to and connected to a huge swath of 
				potential clients of the company in the entertainment industry 
				on a global basis.</font></p>
			  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(4). November

				<b><img src="http://www.valuediscoveries.com/images/sp.gif" width="320" height="8"></b><br>
				Streamedia.Net today announced that its revenues for the third 
				quarter of 2000 were $370,459, up significantly from $24,430 for 
				the third quarter in 1999.</font></p>
			  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(5) NEW 
				FINANCING </b><br>
				<b><img src="http://www.valuediscoveries.com/images/sp.gif" width="320" height="8"></b><br>
				SMIL has arranged future financing, over $1m of which has already 
				been banked. This comes at a time when "dotcoms" are noisily and 
				publicly closing doors right and left for lack of capital. Indications
				are that fresh capital, if needed, is clearly there. And the company 
				already hinted in one of its releases, if you read carefully between 
				the lines, that there is no shortage of inquiries about business 
				combinations, mergers and acquisitions.</font></p>
