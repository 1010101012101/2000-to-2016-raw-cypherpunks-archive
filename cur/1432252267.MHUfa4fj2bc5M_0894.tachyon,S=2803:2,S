   from the if-you're-innocent-you-have-nothing-to-fear dept.
   [1]Richard M. Smith writes "Tukwila, Washington firefighter, Philip
   Scott Lyons found out the hard way that supermarket loyalty cards come
   with a huge price. Lyons was arrested last August and charged with
   attempted arson. Police alleged at the time that Lyons tried to set
   fire to his own house while his wife and children were inside.
   According to [2]KOMO-TV and the Seattle Times, a major piece of
   evidence used against Lyons in his arrest [3]was the record of his
   supermarket purchases that he made with his Safeway Club Card. Police
   investigators had discovered that his Club Card was used to buy fire
   starters of the same type used in the arson attempt. For Lyons, the
   story did have a [4]happy ending. All charges were dropped against him
   in January 2005 because another person stepped forward saying he or
   she set the fire and not Lyons."
