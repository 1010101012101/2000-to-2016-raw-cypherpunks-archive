Then don't give it to them. You can refuse to supply the number, they 
can refuse to sell you a policy, and you can both walk away.

This would be contract fraud. When they ultimately detect it, they 
will have grounds for extreme actions.

Those who are not U.S. citizens but who work in the U.S. are still 
required to have taxpayer identification numbers. If you claim you 
are a tourist just visiting the U.S. with no intention of working or 
investing, they may assign you a number IF they decide to take your 
business. If they determine you lied to them, see above about the 
extreme actions.

Indeed, their selling you a policy is not required.

Then deal with an insurance company which doesn't require SSNs. If 
you cannot find one, too bad.
