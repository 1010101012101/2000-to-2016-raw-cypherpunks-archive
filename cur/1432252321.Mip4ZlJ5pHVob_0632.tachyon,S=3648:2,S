Neither is Tim.  He's an author.  Not every one with an 
opinion has the disorder that makes them crave the role of leader.

In addition to the intrinsic irony of 'cp leader' ---a concept
favored by the legal types who think in terms of the subservient 
hierarchies that they live in, but largely their *projection*.

Dogs can't conceive of a group of cats without an alpha cat.



Even the folks at eg. lne.com who spam-filter are not moderating,
and even moderated lists are not 'led' but edited.
