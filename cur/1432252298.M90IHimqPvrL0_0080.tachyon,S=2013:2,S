Amazingly, when the censorship of the Berry article was discussed on 
"WikiProject Wikipedians against censorship", the entire Wikipedians 
Against Censorship project was nominated for deletion from Wikipedia by 
Nicholas Turnbull, one of the admins who has been banning people trying to 
edit the Berry article.
