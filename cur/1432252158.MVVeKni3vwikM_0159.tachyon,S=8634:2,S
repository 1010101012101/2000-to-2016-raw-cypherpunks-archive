**     PRODUCTION OF [DELETED] WEAPONS, 1981
**     SURVEILLANCE OF JOURNALISTS: A LOOK BACK
**     POVERTY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MORE FROM CRS


PRODUCTION OF [DELETED] WEAPONS, 1981

For decades, President Reagan's 1981 National Security Decision Directive
(NSDD) 7 remained entirely classified.  According to a 1999 listing of
Reagan NSDDs issued by the National Security Council, even the title of
NSDD 7 was classified.

In 2008, the document was partially declassified, bearing the title
"[deleted] Weapons."  It stated:  "The production and stockpiling of
[deleted] weapons is authorized with stockpiling being restricted to the
United States [deleted]."

	http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsdd/nsdd-7.pdf

What is this all about?  What mysterious weapons were to be produced and
stockpiled that could not be acknowledged three decades later?

In all likelihood, said Hans Kristensen of FAS, the deleted term
describing the weapons is "enhanced radiation."  Two enhanced radiation
weapons started production in August/September 1981, he noted: the W70
(Lance warhead) and the W79 (artillery shell).

That likelihood is actually a certainty, said our colleague Allen Thomson,
who pointed to the 1991 Bush directive NSD 59.  The Bush directive,
declassified in 1996, listed the title of NSDD 7 with no redactions:  
Enhanced Radiation Weapons.

SURVEILLANCE OF JOURNALISTS: A LOOK BACK

"The Department of Defense does not conduct electronic or physical
surveillance of journalists," Pentagon press spokesman George E. Little
wrote in a September 6 response to reporters who had questioned the scope
of official monitoring of their work.

	http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2012/09/press_surveillance.html

The DoD disavowal of active surveillance is almost certainly true, as far
as it goes.  Even if there were surveillance to be done, it would probably
not be performed by DoD.  But the reporters' question was not a frivolous
one.  There is an historical basis for their concern.

The celebrated CIA "family jewels" report on illegal Agency activities
prior to the mid-1970s that was finally released in full in 2007 included
descriptions of CIA operations to surveil reporters in order to identify
their confidential sources.

	http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/

The operation known as CELOTEX I was summarized as follows:  "At the
direction of the DCI, a surveillance was conducted of Michael Getler of the
Washington Post during the periods 6-9 October, 27 October - 10 December
1971 and on 3 January 1972. In addition to physical surveillance, an
observation post was maintained in the Statler Hilton Hotel where
observation could be maintained of the building housing his office. The
surveillance was designed to determine Getler's sources of classified
information of interest to the Agency which had appeared in a number of his
columns."

CELOTEX II was described this way:  "At the direction of the DCI,
surveillance was conducted of Jack Anderson and at various times his 'leg
men,' Britt Hume, Leslie Whitten, and Joseph Spear, from 15 February to 12
April 1972. In addition to the physical surveillance, an observation post
was maintained in the Statler Hilton Hotel directly opposite Anderson's
office. The purpose of this surveillance was to attempt to determine
Anderson's sources for highly classified Agency information appearing in
his syndicated columns."

The results of these surveillance activities were not reported in the CIA
document.

Government attorneys this week reiterated their argument that New York
Times reporter James Risen "does not have a 'reporter's privilege' to
refuse to identify his source" in the prosecution of former CIA officer
Jeffrey Sterling, who is accused of disclosing classified information to
Risen.  The attorneys cited a new ruling in another Circuit that rejected a
similar claim of privilege, and they urged the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals to affirm their position.

POVERTY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MORE FROM CRS

"In 2011, 46.2 million people were counted as poor in the United States,
the same number as in 2010 and the largest number of persons counted as
poor in the measure's 53-year recorded history," according to a timely new
report from the Congressional Research Service.  See Poverty in the United
States: 2011, September 13, 2012:
