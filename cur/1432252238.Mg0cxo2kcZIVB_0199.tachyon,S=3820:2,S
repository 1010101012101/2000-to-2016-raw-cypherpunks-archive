MS to intro product key check in WinXP SP1 WPA
By John Lettice
Posted: 26/08/2002 at 16:38 GMT
Microsoft has released details of the changes being made in Windows Product 
Activation (WPA) with WinXP Service Pack 1. As expected, SP1 will fail to 
install if either of "two well-known pirated product keys" has previously 
been used to activate the system, and such systems will also be denied 
access to Windows Update. But the changes will have a far wider impact than 
this, as Microsoft appears to be trying to cover all currently known holes 
in WPA security.
