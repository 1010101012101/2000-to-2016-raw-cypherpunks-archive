I have, for a year or so now, been wondering about all the odd character
strings I am finding in the subjects and body of my spam, and I too
thought about keying on these for detection.

However, I immediately abandoned the idea, as a quick glance over the
content of my legitimate email - to and from developers, technical mailing
lists, etc., revealed that almost all of my legitimate email also contains
seemingly random bits of gibberish and pseudowords.

Try to write the logic that distinguishes this:

if_gre in the tree passes the mbuf to netisr_dispatch(), which in turn
calls if_handoff(), which does something similar.

(hackers@freebsd.org)

from this:

dyeiluykxoer dyeiluykcqkutknig dyeiluykkrpmhrku dyeiluykngeqx
dyeiluykoybim dyeiluykbihlyrelg dyeiluyktwucinmdyeiluykwenmttwvm

(actual spam)

I must reiterate that, given the relentless efficiency of spam-spiders,
merely publishing a shadow email address on all web documents that your
real email address reside on, and deleting all email sent to both accounts
is my current favorite anti-spam mechanism.  Simple to DIY, and requires
no centralization.
