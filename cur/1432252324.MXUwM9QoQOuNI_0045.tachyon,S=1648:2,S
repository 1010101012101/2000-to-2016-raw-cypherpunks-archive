Some effort should be made to communicate the danger of e-ballots to the 
various grassroots, political organizations interested in voting issues. We really 
have to get a wider audience made aware of the tremendous danger.

And somebody should work on producing an alternative hybrid voting machine 
that is hard copy paper verifiable. I think we have to give these local 
governments a viable alternative, a machine that can't be used for Machiavellian 
machinations.
