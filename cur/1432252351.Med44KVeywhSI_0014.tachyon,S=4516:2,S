hi,

Quarterniting people with SARS is logical to the
people who has no SARA and illogical by those who have
SARS.Since most people don't suffer from
sars,quarteniting the infected is justifiable to
them.If theree fourth of congressmen in US smoked
-smoking will be encouraged :-)Its the majority and
their power that defines justification,they can always
justify almost any thing.

Regards Sarath.
