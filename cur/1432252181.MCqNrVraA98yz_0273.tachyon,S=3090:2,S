Hehe.  I was going to do the tiresome emoticon thingy after 'verboten',
but I rightly assumed that someone would enjoy the irony in it without
having to hammer it home.  I was not dissapointed. The twist was actually 
unintentional.  

I usually use 'verboten' to mean, not just forbidden, but forbidden
by the thought police.  The irony is delicious.  I mean, who would have
thought that the usage drummed into me by all those Hollywood war
movies would eventually be used to describe....oh never mind...
