By the way, my insurance companies, financial advisors, and real estate 
agents will NOT take e-mail orders or instructions. Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, for example, will NOT take orders or instructions in e-mail.

Reasons for this are obvious. Now someday there may be a more robust 
_technology_ for ensuring receipt of e-mail (return receipts and digital 
signatures go a long way, of course, toward this end). This may then 
change the _customs_ of users of e-mail. And then the _law_ may evolve 
to fit these changes in technology and custom.

But this is now.
