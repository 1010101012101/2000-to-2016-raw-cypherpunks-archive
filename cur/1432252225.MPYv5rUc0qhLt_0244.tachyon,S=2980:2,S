I know this suggestion has been made before, probably by myself, but it 
seems the remailer programmers may be missing a good opportunity in not 
pursuing the inclusion of remailer code in the popular Gnutella cleints 
(e.g., LimeWire).  They advertise they are looking for new "content 
communities."  http://www.limewire.com/index.jsp/formgroup I don't see any 
reason why email can't be added as a new form of content.
