It's completely legal to manufacture certain classes of weapons
for personal or other use. Doesn't mean it's constitutional, and
it sure isn't freedom. Read the docs.

What?! You mean restore the US and lots of rights and
lack of govt / corp tax, restriction and control over people
to the way it was before the 1920's and all the bullshit
lawmaking since then? People wouldn't know what to do
with the self responsibility, those old ways are forgotten
in favor of their minders and teats.

to be left alone over stupid paper violations.
