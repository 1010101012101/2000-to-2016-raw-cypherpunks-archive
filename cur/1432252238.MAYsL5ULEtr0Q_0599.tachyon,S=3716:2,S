For my daily-for-profit-job i made in past stuff for secure telephony
over GPRS that:
- can have variable latencies on CS1 between 800ms-2200ms
- is a reliable transport (the low level of the OS does retransmissions
at GSM RLP level)

To work over high latency (and tipically also low-bandwidth) with
reliable transport (like TCP/Tor) you need to use those multimedia strategy:
- setup a large static jitter buffer (you define the added artificial
latency of the call to compensate variable latency)
- reduce transport protocol overhead by setting a large "packetization time"
- detect retransmission behaviours, in that case apply small TX cutting
(transmission)

With such approach you can avoid "PTT" and even if the communication
will sounds like an old analog satellite connection, it works.
