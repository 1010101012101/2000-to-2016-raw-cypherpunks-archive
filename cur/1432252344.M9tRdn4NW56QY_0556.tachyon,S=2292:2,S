Total novelty is a fiction.
If its not familiar, you wouldnt recognize it
We all work with the same handicaps
but some of us have agenda's
and others have excuses.

I am a collection of projects,
mine is the semantic path,
if anything of significance is missed,
I'll send back reports from the other side

maker of absurtities
no tangle too complex
to fit through the I of  my needle
