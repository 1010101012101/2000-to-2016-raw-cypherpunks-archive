Either Bush's ignorance or hubris is showing again.  You decide.


In the CNBC interview, Mr. Bush also criticized China for manipulating its 
currency in order to boost sales of Chinese exports.

The president told CNBC's Ron Insana that Treasury Secretary John W. Snow 
had failed during recent talks in Beijing to persuade China to tie its 
currency value to the market. "We don't think we're being treated fairly 
when a currency is controlled by the government," Mr. Bush said. "We 
believe the currency ought to be controlled by the market and ought to 
reflect the true values of the respective economies."

expense of everyone else." --Frederic Bastiat
