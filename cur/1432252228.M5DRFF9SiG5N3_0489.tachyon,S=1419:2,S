I'm trying to find/predict the next  stock to pop.  What do you 
guys think about DMHN? 

I just bought a little bit on Friday and it is up   +0.10 (100.00%) Monday Oct 22nd. I wish I 
would have gotten more.  Oh well, I was lucky 
enough to getDMHN at .10 

I've been looking at DMHN quite a bit and think I will still jump in because I think its going to .50

Good luck to you all. 


Company: DYNAMIC MEDIA HOLDIN 
Symbol:(Other OTC:DMHN.PK) 
Price at Noon est; .20 up 100%
