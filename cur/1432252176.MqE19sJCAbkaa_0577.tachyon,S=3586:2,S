Dear Consumer,

CompuRx, Inc., an independent healthcare market research organization, 
is currently recruiting consumers to join a panel to participate in 
selected healthcare related market research studies.  These studies 
are presented in either a traditional paper format or an online 
web-based format.

Typically, when we are conducting a study that we feel may be of 
interest to a particular subset of panel members, we will send an 
email invitation to participate.  The email will include a brief 
outline of the study specifications.  After reviewing the study 
information, members may opt to participate or members may decline 
participation.  Remember, study participation is ALWAYS OPTIONAL 
and, importantly, declination of any one study does not impact the 
solicitation of member support for future research efforts.

To enroll in this very important market research panel, please visit:

Please note that the results of our studies are used for market 
research purposes only and all responses will be kept in strictest 
confidence.  Please be assured that member participation is STRICTLY 
CONFIDENTIAL and will NOT result in any sales calls!
