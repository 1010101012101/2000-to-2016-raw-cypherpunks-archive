I am sorry, but as you can see this email is very extensive. I have been =
trying to remove my address from these spammer lists. Please have a look =
at all the messages below to see what the problem is. Could you help to =
stop these spammers before they even get to my mailbox. I don't want to =
receive them at all. (Surely after all this effort someone will listen =
(read) and do something about this. If I wanted this stuff, no problem, =
but I don't and can't get rid of it.)

I have also sent an online contact email to netvisionsenterprises.com =
with:  "Please help to stop this spamming to anton@email.ky: I have =
included some of the mail received from one of your clients. I have also =
included the email I sent to the abuse@ address for some of the domains =

These emails are harassment and unsolicited. They are deliberately =
programmed to not be able to opt out or unsubscribe. They also =
constantly use different email addresses. I want this to stop. Please =
help me."

I also got the following of the MARC site ie: =
