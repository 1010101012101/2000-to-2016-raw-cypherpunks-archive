Perhaps you were using the UK definition of 'cunt', although that usage i=
s, I think, often as an endearment, much like 'bastard' or
'dude' in the US.  In some locales, it's almost always used in a sexist s=
ense.  Anyway, your stooping to ad hominem attacks means
you've already lost the argument.

I was on BBSs in 1982, Compuserve in 1984, UUCP/Usenet in 1987 (a couple =
hops from uvax), running a server on the Internet
continuously since 1992, setting up a couple ISPs including a satellite l=
ink in the early 90's, on AOL in 1995 (I wrote BuddyList
for AOL.), and various other things.  Calling me names on the Internet is=
 not going to phase me.

Well, no wonder.  So, if you were President of the US, what would you do =

Define 'anarchist' and 'crypto-anarchist', think a little, and you may fi=
nd some answers.

Let's go with the Wikipedia definition:

ryptography>software to evade prosecution and harassment

=46rom that, you can derive a number of reasons to support and/or be awar=
e of and/or use the techniques from cypherpunks.  For
instance, you could look at the US as being largely based on free-speech-=
anarchism, as per the First Amendment.  Based on that, and
perhaps borrowing from the Second, Fourth Amendments and other sources, y=
ou could easily justify an effort like cypherpunks.  In the
90's, Cypherpunks, individually and as a whole, were super important to a=
void things going the wrong way in the US.  It was
important for clear-headed arguments to be made, legal and other challeng=
es mounted in just the right way, and education and code
spread widely and evolved quickly.  Paranoid babble would not have helped=
, and is still not helping.

Understanding the "establishment" doesn't mean being "their" bot.  Your l=
ack of understanding and/or irrational distrust doesn't
make you an anarchist; it shows your ignorance.

"You don't know your own argument unless you know your opponent's." - ano=
n (I think.)  You can't even understand who your opponent
is unless you understand all sides as much as possible.

> 	I can counter your sick garbage/propaganda, but I'm

Quite a weak and lazy response; you obviously have nothing but bluster.  =
If you can't back up your statements with evidence, you
aren't really saying anything useful.  Plonk.

I think I've probably been "here" much longer than you have.  I was learn=
ing and participating since fairly early, and continuously
for quite a few years.  For instance:
