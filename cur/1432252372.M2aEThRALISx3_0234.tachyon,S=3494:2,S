This interpretation is certainly not supported by libertarian 
principles.

I outlined the reasons in my previoius, longer, post.

I agree that things are not like this in the U.K., but they "should" be.

If the state has the authority to classify words as "marketing" or 
"new" or "propaganda," all is basically lost.

And "freedom of the press" is indeed limited to those with presses, 
except presses have long been a nonbarrier to speech, given the 
incredible low cost of mimeograph machines, offset printing, laser 
printing, and so on. And now we have the Net.
