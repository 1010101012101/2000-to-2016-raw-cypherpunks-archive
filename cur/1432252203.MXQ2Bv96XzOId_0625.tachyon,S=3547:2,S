OK, this isn't funny anymore. Netscape Communicator 4.51 for FreeBSD or
Linux or whatever seems to have a repeatable flaw.

That paragraph was supposed to be (breaking lines differently to see
what that changes)

the sum of (the expected cost of

coverage for a given malady times the expected likelihood of that
malady) had better be lower than the sum of the premiums paid, or they
won't stay in business long. Forcing an insurer to accept an
expected-high-cost customer at an "affordable" premium either drives up
the premiums for everyone, causes a reduction in services for everyone
(or a particular subgroup, but that would probably cause more trouble in
the long run), or eats into insurer's bottom line. One
expected-high-cost customer wouldn't break the insurer, but there's
never just one.
