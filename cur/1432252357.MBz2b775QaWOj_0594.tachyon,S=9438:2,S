  You'd be surprised how few "high government officials" have
Secret-service-type protection.  President, obviously, vice president,
Speaker of house, majority and  minority leader of Senate, etc. "Ordinary"
members of House and senate don't.  A few department heads probably do, but
that is the exception, rather than the rule. BTW, for the record, just a 
couple of days ago Clinton probably passed
within a mile of my house, "Slant range", in a helicopter, with a day's
warning.  (The term, "slant range", is a "term of art," for those not in the
know.)
 >I also believe that Jim and I disagree about the significance of Salmon

Well, then what _IS_ "repelling possible assassins"?  Hint:  If I or you
killed Rushdie, do you really believe you would be able to collect the
reward?  I don't.  Unless you get people to really BELIEVE they can collect,
then it is irrelevant what the value of that reward is! Hint:  If the 
mullahs really wanted to see Rushdie dead, they would have
implemented some sort of "Assassination Politics"-type system to ensure than
anyone who wanted to collect the reward could do so from the comfort and
safety of his own home. >A

  Which is a valid goal.  Actually, it is unclear why Britain is spending the
money to protect Rushdie.  Despite the fact that he's done nothing to
deserve his targeting, governments are remarkably reticent about protecting
individual citizens.  >Jim Bell said:

you're asked to engage in a Waco-like operation, what do you think you'll
say to  your manager?   "Is this trip necessary?" This is called, "deterrence."

disagree.  In practice, if you discovered that  each year
there  was a 1% chance of you dying as a consequence of your job, you'd
probably strongly consider changing your place of employment. Now, I think 
statistics show that each year, about 800 billion dollars in
individual income taxes are collected.  If we assume that the equivalent of
only 1% of that  value  was donated to solve the "IRS problem," that's 8
BILLION dollars, which at $10,000 per person would buy 800,000 deaths.
THat's 7 times the current employment of the IRS. You tell me:  What would 
the average person pay THIS YEAR to avoid paying,
say, a $100,000 tax bill NEXT YEAR?  (Hint:  How much do rich people pay
their accountants, TODAY, to avoid taxes?) Another Hint:  Consider Bill 
Gates.  His wealth is variously estimated at
over 10 BILLION dollars, probably almost all of which is in long-term
capital gains (Microsoft stock), for which he will have to pay somewhere
around 30% in Federal income taxes if he should choose to cash out.  He
would be 1.5 Billion dollars ahead if he donated $1.5 billion dollars to an
organization which would eliminate his  requirement to pay the total 3
billion dollar tax bill to the IRS.  That alone is the equivalent of about
$14,000 for each IRS employee.

That depends entirely on the identity of the target.  Besides, suppose for a
moment that all these people are turned into "targets."  It's pretty easy to
protect ONE INDIVIDUAL; it's far harder to protect thousands.

Your estimate is way too high.   Remember, most of the cost of hiring a
hitman is based on the risk (to him) of actually contacting and TRUSTING his
contractor. (and vice versa:  The contractor has to trust the hitman.)
While I have no firm statistics, I would  imagine that the vast
majority of "contract killings" are  solved (if they are solved at  all, by
the police) by something other   than evidence collected at the site where
the killing actually occurred.  If you completely eliminate this risk, (by
encryption and digital cash, etc.) by free-market principles the cost should
drop drastically. More generally, most murders are solved either by 
researching the prior
relationships (and motives) of acquaintances of the "victim," or witnesses
to an incident that the killer didn't expect to occur, etc.   "Assassination
Politics" would result in a situation in which literally everybody in the
world had an IDENTICAL motivation to kill the target.  Imagine explaining
this away to a jury, who themselves might have had an equivalent motivation
to collect the reward! Jim Bell
