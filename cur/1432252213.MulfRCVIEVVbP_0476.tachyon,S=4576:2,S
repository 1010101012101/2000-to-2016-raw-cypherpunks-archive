As others have remarked, Choate simply has no clue how even the 
Cypherpunks remailers of 1992 work(ed).

That he thinks "having to know all the steps" is a bad idea tells me he 
is just too clueless to have ever been taken seriously, even for a few 
months, here on this list.

An old girlfriend of mine grasped the idea of envelopes-within-envelopes 
and how the security of the remailer chain depended on the sender 
deciding on a list of intermediate steps and then encrypting each nested 
envelope appropriately.

"The sender should at most be able to set the number of remailers, not 
which ones. " is one of the stupidest comments I have ever seen on this 
list.

This has been Cypherpunks kindergarten material for a decade (and many 
of us knew it years earlier).
