Subject: [EMED-L] Should we ER/Healthcare workers get smallpox vaccine?

The military is set to have 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine by the end of
this year.  Should we be vaccinated?  I was vaccinated as a child, but most
of us who have been vaccinated are no longer immune.  In the event that a
terrorist decides to covertly unleash smallpox, we would all be at risk, as
we would be the front line of defense.  Any thoughts from the list?  The
first wave of ill people from a smallpox attack could also take out the
healthcare system, as we are not immune, and may not recognize the early
cases.  Just thinking "out loud" here.

Willie
