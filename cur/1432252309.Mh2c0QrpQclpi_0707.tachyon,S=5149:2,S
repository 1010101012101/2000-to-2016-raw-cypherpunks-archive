keep it simple: NO FILTERING

if you can read this you are tall enough to filter/tag/label your own self.

node operators who suspect filtering should post to the other
remailers and cryptome. John likes spam.

if the filter is due to absurd and extreme levels of zero information
DoS[0] then notify the other remailers and cryptome with the filter
you used so they can follow suit.

this is not simple, and not recommended.

another benefit of simple: your limited efforts more likely to reach utility :)



0.  please note the intentional use of absurd, and extreme, and zero
information with respect to specifically DoS.
if someone is sending noise at 50/sec that should promptly and always
generate a null route.

"spam" is nebulous and too easy to filter. forget about it; not a
problem.  and of course if you've been compelled through legal
pressure in your jurisdiction to cull from archives, if you publish
them, notify the other remailers and cryptome so they can mirror and
publicize.



best regards,
