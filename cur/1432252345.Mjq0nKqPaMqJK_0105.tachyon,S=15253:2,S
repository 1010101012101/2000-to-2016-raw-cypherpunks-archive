	Not sure what you mean? Actually I think your sentence doesn't make any

	What governments propose is to define 'right' and 'wrong' (an absurd 
proposal, of course)

	Governments do not have the monopoly on violence. They  *pretend* to have 
the monopoly of what they call 'legitimate' violence, according to their 
own baseless  definition of 'legitimate'

	OK.

	Again, I don't understand what you say. "coercion can be communicated"? 
What does that mean?

	What? People in the US (or in any other country) do not 'fully comply' 
with the dictates of 'their' governments at all. It's actually impossible 
to do so (there are virtually tens of thousands of 'laws' and regulations 
in the books).

	Furthermore, lots of people don't agree with, or explicitly disobey lots 
of state 'laws'. And some end up in jail because of doing so.

	Hand waving. Like I said, (and you ignored) the US was founded as a slave 
society. Tell me about the constitutional right of slaves to revolt?

	SLAVERY. That was the original value. And it still is.

	It is obviously unrelated to cryptography. It is obviously related to 
anarchist political theory. Considering that 'cypherpunkism' is kinda 
related  to anarchy, I see how the discussion might be relevant.

	Ah yes. And that is so, because...you asserted it?

	Here's news for you. "Crime" is defined by common moral sense. Government 
has nothing to do with the origin of concepts like "natural law" "rights to 
life, liberty and property" and the like.

	This is of course the core of the disagreement here. You're assuming that 
legal positivism is a valid doctrine. Too bad it isn't.


> If you intend
> to use it any other way you should define it. You're trying to transfer

	Only for legal positivists.

	Government is the biggest violator of natural rights, thus the biggest 
criminal. That's a fact. Of course, if you don't care about justice, you 
may not feel anything about that fact, but your lack of feelings is not 
really the point here...

	 And no, 'natural rights' are not the creation of government.

	"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" 
<--- natural rights, regardless of the 'god' nonsense.

	
	"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,"

	See? Governments do NOT create any right. And, they are supposed to 
protect them, and FURTHERMORE, governments are supposed to be 'consensual'.

	I would propose that you are completely out of touch with reality?

	Plus,  notice that you are thoroughly confusing 'government' with 
'society'...

	I suggest you research the topic yourself. Are you criticizing a system 
which you seem pretty ignorant of?

	Note that I'm talking about voluntary cooperation and respect for the 
natural rights of third parties.

	But feel free to come up with a caricature of what you think libertarian 
anarchy is, and 'debunk' it...

	Okay. Now you're quoting a bit of meaningless garbage from one of the 
worst fascists of the 20th century. That's too much for me =P


	I suggest you research all the subjects that you are clearly ignorant of 
(like the nature of government and rights). Them you'll realize that all 
your criticisms so far are baseless.

	
	If you feel like re-stating your position in a short and clear paragraph 
or two, go ahead and I might reply. Otherwise, I see no point in further 
communication.
