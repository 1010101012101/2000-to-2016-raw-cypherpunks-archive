Genes exist to copy genes; genes cooperate to this end.  Growing
metazoans such as ourselves is a means to that end.

You mention Darwin but not Richard Dawkins author
of _Selfish Gene_ and later meme theories.  Memes
are basically ideas.  They can replicate, compete,
cooperate, etc.  Brains are the medium in which they
grow.

Memes like "believe me or believers kill you" are
particularly cancerous.

If you haven't read Dawkins, you should, and he's
quite an enjoyable read.
