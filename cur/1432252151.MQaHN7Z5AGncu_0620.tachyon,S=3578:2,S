That was a software keylogger (actually two software keyloggers), not
hardware. 

(IMO Scarfo's lawyers should never have dealt, assuming the evidence was
necessary for a conviction, but the FBI statement about the techniques used
was probably too obfuscated for them - it took me a good week to understand
it. I emailed them, but got no reply.

Incidently, Nicky Scarfo used his father's prison number for the password,
so a well researched directed dictionary attack would have worked anyway.)


The FBI reputedly can (usually, on Windows boxen) now install similar
software keyloggers remotely, without needing to break in.
