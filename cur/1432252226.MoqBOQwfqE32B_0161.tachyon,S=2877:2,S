	You are an optimist.  Us pessimists see use of
Palladium/TCPA/NGSCB as all too tempting a means of regulation of the
net.   Initially one will not be able to get high speed Internet service
at affordable rates without the big brother inside, but as this
"voluntary" commercial regulatory measure proves not to curb behavior
that certain powerful lobbies want controlled, there will be mandatory
requirements imposed by law as per the Fritz chip.

	Perhaps courts will not allow such to be used for explicit
censorship of otherwise legal free speech, but I'd not bet that an ISP
would be required to allow "objectionable content" to pass over its
wires under such a scheme.

	And once one must register to obtain certificates for Palladium/NGSCB
attestation, one really does have a form of net drivers license.
