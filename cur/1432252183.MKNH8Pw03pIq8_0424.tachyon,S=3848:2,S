This is the third such "ubsubscribe" message tonight! It must be 
catching. Sort of like the "unsuscrive" and "unscribe" viruses of a 
few years ago. "Unimbibe me" is more like it.

Fortunately, their fate is to remain "suscrived" to the toad list. 
Please, don't anyone remind them that their welcome message gave them 
instructions on how to ubsuscrive.
