The governing party in Germany is called the Christian Democrats. If 
Religion is some sort of nasty contagion that needs to be stamped out, 
Germany's got bigger problems than some desperate immigrants.

Religion isn't a nasty contagion, btw. Assholes are, and they're all 
over the place, religion or no. Just look at the bullshit racism in this 
thread; anyone see religious inspiration to that? Not so far from me, 
just regular ole' secular race/religion hate. Nothing new there.

Maybe, just maybe, "National Identity"/"Racial and Cultural Strength" is 
a load of bullshit, and far more of a threat to human flourishing than 
believing in usually-benevolent Sky Gods.
