Meshnets (everyone's a router) is cool, admittedly.  But are you going
to spend *your* battery life routing someone else's message?

Fixed P2P energy costs are trivial.  Not so for mobile P2P.

And if your meshnodes are mains-powered, you have wires going there,
so wireless is less useful.  Solar nodes might be useful.
