Your definition of "useful" is different from mine. I believe lists 
like ours should primarily be about discussions and points of view, 
not a third-hand CNET or Register or Slashdot. There are many Web 
sources of breaking news (not that a lot of the "functional quantum 
computer" sorts of stories are usually breaking news...).

Personally, I like it when someone finds a news item, provides a 
detailed URL, even quotes (in ASCII, not MIME!) a paragraph or two, 
and then comments on it and connects it to Cypherpunks issues.

Merely dumping out "general science" items, with general URLs, is 
just plain abusing the list.
