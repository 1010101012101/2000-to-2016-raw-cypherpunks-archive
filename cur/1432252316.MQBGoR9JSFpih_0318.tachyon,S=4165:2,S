Sure, and it's fairly easy too. Choose some random data, encrypt with the
public key, decrypt with the private key, if the data isn't corrupted, then
they match. Of course this isn't a perfect way of telling, but with any
given potential key pair it's steep odds. If you want to really be sure,
pass it through a few times.
