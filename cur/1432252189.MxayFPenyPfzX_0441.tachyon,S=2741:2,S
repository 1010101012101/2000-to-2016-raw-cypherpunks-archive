Too bad this wasn't California.  According to that states laws, if a
survey shows that average driver speeds are substantially higher than
the posted speed limit, the speed limit must be raised.  It would have
been a sweet irony if these busybodies had ended up with 60 MPH posted
speed limits on their residential streets.
