We already have de facto national ID in the form of our state driver's
licenses. They are accepted at face value at all 50 states as well as
by the federal government. Real ID would rationalize the issuing
procedures and require a certain minimum of verification. Without it
we have security that is only as strong as the weakest state's
policies.
