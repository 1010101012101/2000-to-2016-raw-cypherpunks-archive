I was struggling with spamassassin and attemping to implement reject-
-at-smtp time filtering, and reading about this 'hashcash' idea, several
years ago and thinking maybe it would be nice if someone would *pay* me
to read their email.

We have lots of privacyscam hash-cash code running around these days,
so what are the chances of just advertising you only accept mail that
includes a *coin payment to the recipient?

(Granted, it's low because most *coiners don't seem to understand what
mail is given they can't even figure out how to install mailman, but
the hope remains)
