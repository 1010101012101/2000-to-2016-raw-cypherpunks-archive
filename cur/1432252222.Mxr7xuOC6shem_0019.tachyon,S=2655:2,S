Or a few-dollar fermentation tanks with suitable bacteria, once its genome
is tweaked in required way. Who ever said that the nanoparticles we need
can't be proteins or organic molecules with required shape/properties? If
viral particles can self-assemble from host-cell-synthetized proteins, if
complicated structures like bacterial propulsion systems - or even whole
plants - can be formed, why not nanomechanical systems? Why bother with
assembling machines when they could be grown?

I hope I didn't screw up my understanding of "nanosynthesis". If it is
"build anything you want by telling the general assembler", then this
won't work and would need a lab; but for mass-producing nnoparticles, eg.
surface coatings or elements for camera or memory arrays, biotech should
be good enough.
