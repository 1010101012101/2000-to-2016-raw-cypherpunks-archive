Yup, check out this dvd unit:
http://www.220-electronics.com/dvd/daewoo5800.htm
where it says: "Custom modification with code free automatic and manual
selection of regions and macrovision disabled. Excellent quality dvd
player with all the features."

and
"Price just reduced by over $100.  Was 249.00
Now only $129.00

The Daewoo 5800 custom modification  has been designed to make life a lot
less complicated.  It has superb Audio and video components outperforming
major brands such as Sony, Panasonic and Pioneer. "

So it won't be long before bypass systems will be commercially available.
At least in some parts of the _free_ world.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
