	We had--until the middle of december--a linux box running 
mysql that served as the solitary authentication DB for our (the 
company I work for) website. Approximately 500k users in the 
database. About 200k active in a given week.

	The *mysql* instance had been running for 246 days. The 
machine under it for a little longer. It had run for several months 
before that, but it was moved from one building to another.

	For space and saftey reasons we moved it to a Sun 420 with a 
big disk cluster with Veratas.

	It crashed and burned within a month.

	Never fuck with a working box.
