TPM != TCPA.  TCPA with *user* control is good.

It's bad only if the *user* does not have control over their own machines.
If each enterprise can control their own machines, completely
independently of all other external organizations, then TCPA could be
really useful.  If only Bill Gates controls all machines, it's bad for the
rest of us (but pretty damn good for Bill!!)
