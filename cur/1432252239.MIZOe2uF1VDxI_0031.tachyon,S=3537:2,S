Murray Rothbard's law number 17: all economists specialize in the field they
suck most. Friedman is good in many areas, but he sucks in monetary stuff,
so obviously he specialized in it. There is NOTHING libertarian in
Friedman's ideas about money.

Oh, a socialist... ok, that's why you like Friedman when he speaks about
money.

> Confiscating gold was clearly the lesser of the evils.

ROTFL...
