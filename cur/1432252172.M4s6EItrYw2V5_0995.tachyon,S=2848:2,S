It seems pretty clear that this is in fact not why the Navy funded Tor.

Virtually all science in the US is funded by the military in some form.
The stuff that isn't funded by the military is funded by the NSA, and
the stuff that isn't funded by either is funded by the NSF (which is
probably just a front group for the military; or at least functionally
is, as is most of the American government).

Saying "look, this thing was funded by the military" is just not useful.
By that metric, virtually all computer science is a hidden backdoor. You
have to be more specific.
