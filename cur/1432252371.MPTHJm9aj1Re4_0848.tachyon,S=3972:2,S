Gosh, you just described Seti@home... massive, distributed, fine-toothed
combing the spectra received from a very very specific direction.

My reference to antenna design meant that you can filter out all the
other emitters by using very high gain (ergo very directional) scoops.

Look at the milky way ---a glowing cloud.  But point a high gain receiver
(ie, telescope) and you can pick out individual emitters, and resolve
their spectra, which leaks info about their composition.
