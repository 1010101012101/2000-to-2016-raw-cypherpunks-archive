Hair samples, dandruff, etc. A bunch of reports over the past several 
months that the houses and villas of Hussein and his family had been 
gone over carefully for traces of hair, old shaving razors, skin 
particles, etc.

blood samples, lots of ways to track DNA. All a matter of economics, as 
usual.
