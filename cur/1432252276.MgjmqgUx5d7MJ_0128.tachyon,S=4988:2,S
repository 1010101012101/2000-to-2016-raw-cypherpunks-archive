It seems to me that anywhere anybody colonized it is royaly fucked up,
unless they bought their indepence with blood (and then a case can be
made it is only marginally better there/here).

A counter point is the amount of business in those regions. If one follows
the standard free market or CACL responce then as business moves in you
would expect to see a general increase across the board. There's even a
comment about 'middle class' in the article. A more 'cynical/real world'
view would be that the plight of these people won't improve until those
outside begin to hold the economic and political authorities to task for
their actions and the consequences to the general population.

After all, the rational strategy with respect to increase profit and
decrease cost is to 'defect' (in the same sense if not for the same
reasons as a PD) with respect to pay and benefits. It also holds itself out 
as a good example of why the 'information' requisite for 'free market'
dynamics isn't a natural of human business enterprise, business puts great
stock on knowning something the competition doesn't (in this case
competition for the profit margin between the managers/share holders of
the company and the employees).
