This development will be up to a maximum 9OMw in size and cost upwards of $12O
mi||i0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supply
upwards of 17O,0OO Mw of e|ectricity annua||y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supp|y upwards of 25,0OO homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $45O mil|i0n for a

deve|opment of renewab|e energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction
of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
relevant policies, strategies and p|ans. To fu|fil| the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
