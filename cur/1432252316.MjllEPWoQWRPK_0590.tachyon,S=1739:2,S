So, it's the night of the day of the morning after, and all around us are
masses milling in despair over the destruction of freedom that has
occurred here over the last four years.

Given that the US was the "Gulch" to the brain drain of the Soviet Union,
where does a true capitalist, or even just a closet objectivist flee
today?  France?  Spain? The "EU"?

Where does one go today, if they are unwilling to participate in the
Failed Experiment?  (BTW: No, Lichtenstein does not accept immigrants, and
yes, I have reverified this recently).
