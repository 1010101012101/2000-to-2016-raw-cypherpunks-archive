And this was a profound error, IMHO.  One of the epiphanies from my work at 
MN was that a secrecy-oriented proxy network development and successful 
deployment needed to precede P2P file sharing if such networks were to 
survive determined technical and legal challenges.  End users often care 
little about what 'under the hood' of their P2P app only that they can get 
the content conveniently and they are not subjected to annoyances like spy 
or adware.

But trackers must still be widely accessible by the general population of 
BT users and can you offer the content or obtain it without likely 
identification?
