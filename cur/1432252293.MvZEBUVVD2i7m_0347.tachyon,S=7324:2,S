Some think that removing the battery, or even turning the phone off or
putting it in "airplane mode", is enough. Maybe I'm too paranoid, but I
don't trust either of those approaches.

However, I do agree that taking one of those steps before putting the
phone in the Faraday bag will prevent rapid battery discharge through
high-power attempts to reach towers.
