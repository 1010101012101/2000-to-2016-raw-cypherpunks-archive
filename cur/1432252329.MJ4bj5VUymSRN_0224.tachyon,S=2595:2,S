So is this Uncle Sam's way of getting good workers for no pay?  You could 
expect the same kinds of skills to bring in several hundred dollars per 
hour in the .mil consulting sphere...

Huh... So working from January to April/May to pay one's tax burden isn't 
enough service to the republic anymore? (where tax burden = billions wasted 
on the Iraq/Afghanistani wars, overthrowing elections in Argentina, causing 
riots in Haiti and Africa, etc.)

Now they're resorting to what pretty much amounts to slavery?  How soon 
before .gov just absorbs Exxon, IBM, Sun, HP, Haliburton, Bechtel and all 
of interest directly? How soon before .gov comes out of the fascism closet 
already and announces itself for what it really is?

Bah! I may as well learn to flip burgers and ask if fries will be part of 
the order today...  being a sysadmin isn't getting me employed anymore 
anyway.  :(
