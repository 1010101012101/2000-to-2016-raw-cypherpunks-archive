Well here is another moron.  From Jerry Fallwell's statements, and Pat 
Robertsons concurrence, I think it is pretty safe to say that we are in 
just as much danger from christain fundamentalist terrorists as from 
muslim fundamentalist terrorists.  I fail to see what a conversion would 
accomplish.  Let alone a forced conversion.  Blech.  Just when I'm 
feeling proud to be an American, watching the wonderful response of the 
people in New York, these scum come along and make me ashamed to be an 
American.
