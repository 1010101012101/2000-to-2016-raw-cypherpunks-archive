>From Syracuse's invaluable Transactional Records Clearing House site:

      The SSA in Peace and War
      The federal agency with the most international terrorism
      referrals in April was a surprisethe Social Security
      Administration. It recommended 78 individuals be indicted for
      such crimes, compared with only 39 referrals during the month
      from the FBI. The Department of Transportation was third with
      23 new referrals, followed by the INS and Customs. The FBI
      was the source of most referrals for domestic terrorism. See
      table.


We warned you that the Social Security Administration would become an
instrument of totalitarian control back in 1935 when it was created. But
you didn't listen
