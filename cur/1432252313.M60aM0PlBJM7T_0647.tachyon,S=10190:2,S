I'd like to hear how children who werent old enough to pronounce the colour
were 'reds' who were rightly tortured (apparently) in your view, as well as
the many women raped and tortured at the hands of SOA graduates.

I'd also be keen to see evidence of this free-market success of which you
talk, because it isn't in central america for the countless millions in
poverty. Before, a person encourages free-markets elsewhere, how about
encouraging them in the United States in order to really test the theory
and give these nations a chance of economic development. The three most
successful industries in the united states (steel, agriculture and
techonology/military) are all state funded and protected in a exceedinly
'socialist' manner. There is no evidence in Europe of development occuring
in industry any other way either.

The defence of America and by proxy Reagan's crime in Central America is
alarmingly close to Hitler's defence of his Genocide and also Stalin's
killing of counter-revolutionarys (if we hadnt done it they wou;d have
killed more, theyre the threat not us etc).

Exactly at which point does a war (any war) stop being defensive because
according to the history books the US has never fought an aggressive war.
I'm not sure that it is defensive to defend a country against its own
people, when europe did so it was called colonisation.
