Possibly.

All votes are about "cost/benefit" issues. The cost of voting, the 
benefits of voting, and further subdivided into the benefits of 
voting for various candidates.

In most cases, the costs of voting exceed any expected benefits. 
Merely travelling to a polling place and spending half an hour or so 
voting is a cost greater than the benefits.

Spending tens of hours watching news coverage of the election process 
is in a different league of wasted effort altogether.
