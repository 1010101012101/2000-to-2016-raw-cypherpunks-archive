Assuming you define TBB as semi-good crypto, the block AIUI to Mozilla
incorporating Tor plugins/ mods into Firefox by default is simply that
the Tor network cannot scale Internet wide. Yet. Because of course you
know then we'd all be secure.

But what do you define as semi-good crypto?

Agreed. But they might give some dollars for shiny new handset.

You think you think? Bah! Thinking's overrated.

Because there's no such thing as "truly secure" and marketing to the
"I want it truly secure" crowd would likely result in deception, which
due to the overly paranoid nature of such crowd, would quickly
deconstruct the bullshit anywya.

Making a lot of assumptions there - such as "there are few enough
politicians who are compromised (with sex or money), that the rest can
stand strong in the face of the few".  Although the very recent French
and Italian delegations to Crimea suggest at least some are capable of
on the ground analysis in the face of the rest of their respective
parliaments. Who knows, next we might see Greece running a referendum
so the people can decide what their government should be doi... oh,
hang on...

And a way to get rid of those compromising images held by their
respective national governments...

<slaps forehead>
Of course! We've all missed that obvious for so long - put JVM in a
secure open source hypervisor and the world will be safe. That would
even encourage me to be less sarcastic.

Perhaps Google could kick this project off - they already own Android
and they must have the dollars. In fact Intel could produce the CPU,
Foxconn can build the handsets, Google can install the software and
the NSA can deliver them to us^B^B^B sorry, the Postal Service can
deliver them to us.

We have a plan for a better world. It starts with money. Money and
trust. Trust. But not without money. More money. And technology.
Technology and money. I'll leave you to contact Goog to start this
ball rolling.
