Plenty of distributed computing efforts out there... BOINC, SetiAtHome, etc.

Back when mining was done with GPU's, maybe, utilizing the newly
installed base of GPGPU computing therein.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units

Today all relavant mining is done with ASIC's, and all the installed
base of them
can do is SHA-256, so no.

Maybe I just saw some news about a distributed repo.
Too much distributed noise lately, so maybe not.
Central here, signing off...
