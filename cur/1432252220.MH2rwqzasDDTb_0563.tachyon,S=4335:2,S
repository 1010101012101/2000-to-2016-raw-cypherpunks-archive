How money works is a political matter. If one can get a bigger
share of monetary creation than other people, one gets power.

It's also an "economic" matter, because badly designed systems cause
crises.

People eventually figure out when a system isn't fair, and it falls,
because money is nothing without a community to use it. So yes, being
fair is an important quality for the long term.

Sure, anybody who doesn't agree with you has to be influenced by the
evil central bankers, rightb/?

As the name suggests, temporal symmetry is about the long term. Of
course asymmetry gives a short term boost, the first users are getting
money almost for free and can use it later to gain wealth.

In addition, Bitcoin benefits from the fact that making a symmetrical
currency is much harder and therefore hasn't been done yet. Spatial
symmetry requires a Web of Trust while anyone can start using Bitcoin
immediately.
