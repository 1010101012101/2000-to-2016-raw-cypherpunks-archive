* Stage 4.5 of the FUD Campaign, Saturday afternoon: "It's the chads, 
the little pieces of paper punched out but hanging by a thread." (How 
appropriate: "hanging by a thread") The Democrats are demanding that 
ballots marked as spoiled be checked to see if they have 
"indentations" or "chads."

Of course, how these indentations or chads have anything to do with 
Democrats vs. Republicans is unclear...

Except that the Democrat Party is requesting the recounts in heavily 
Democrat precincts!

They understand that by recounting, and recounting, and then 
switching to manual analysis of ballots IN DEMOCRAT-LEANING PRECINCTS 
they can probably pick up some additional votes for Gore. Simple 
statistics.

The obvious point is that such additional vacuum-cleaning should not 
be allowed. And if it is allowed in a single precinct, absent some 
strong evidence that that precinct had precinct-specific "chad 
problems" with its machines, then ALL precincts should be counted in 
an identical fashion.

A daunting, and expensive, and time-consuming process. A manual 
inspection of six million ballots will take several weeks.

Which may be the Gore strategy, ironically. Get the process in 
Florida so bogged-down that Florida is left out of the Electoral 
College process on December 18th. According to many legal scholars, 
the election would then hinge on a majority of those who were at the 
EC meeting, even if Florida were to be absent. Advantage: Gore.

Fucked up, yes.
