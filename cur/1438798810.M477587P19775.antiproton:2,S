Yes, just get a new DHCP lease - rock solid.

This is actually pretty easy; First read the protocol spec then read the
code.

If there is a backdoor or vulnerability, please let everyone know.

If you can do away with evils like centralized directory servers while
retaining sybill resistance please publish your ideas.

If your arguments are that the project is intrinsically evil, by virtue of
the authors being tainted with 'reptilian money' - that's not really a
technically robust.
