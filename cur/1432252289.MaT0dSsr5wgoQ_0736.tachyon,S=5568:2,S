I think the combo is used regularly  : e.g. version control logfiles
that are not directly accessible to a user but the user can have ci/co
access via applications that run with the correct permissions. A user
may fuck up a version of the file but may not make things unrecoverable.

We could get into a long discussion of the details of data source and
sink types ( sockets, disk files, other devices ) but the basic
principle is the id/permissions one.

I just don't think the concept is particularly novel but I have no doubt
it will be implemented and protected viciously. I use the word viciously
because that is the only way to make DRM work and there is a great deal
of money at stake.
