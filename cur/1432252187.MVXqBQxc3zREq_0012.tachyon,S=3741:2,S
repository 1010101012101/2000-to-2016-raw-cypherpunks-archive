Peter Trei  sent  >>mattd is still a newbie to this list. He will 
eventually learn that the title of the list: 'cypherpunks' tells nothing 
about the views of list subscribers, which range widely. In particular, he 
will learn that participation in the list does not imply acceptance of any 
particular stance, attitude, or agenda towards crypto, stego, or government 
or lack thereof. The only thing which can really be said about subscribers 
in general is that they think crypto is worth discussing.

  > Your fellow PUNK for ANARCHY,mattd. >

  You are not my fellow. I am not a punk. Since no one here even agrees 
what anarchy is, it's incorrect for you to assume that anyone agrees on 
that, either. Peter Trei <<

Im a newbie to a list titled cypherpunks,not 
cyphershills,cypherprats,cyphergoons,cyphersucks,cypherfeds,etc,etc.
Punk does imply something whatever you say.To accept lies,propaganda and 
self delusional CALC,would be fatal for this list.The natural selection of 
good ideas will sort this all out,let the rivers flow red.
You are not my fellow now;So?.Not that I want you for my fellow or asked 
you,I was talking to declan,there still may be hope for him.I also dont 
just write for those 
neutral,balanced,objective,scientific,cleareyed,lucid,rational pragmatists 
such as
your good self.I have to account for the foul,creepy vermin of so called 
law enforcement and possible data miners from the year 2010.ie.Posterity. 
If crypto-anarchy is as big as I think its going to be this list will be 
hirstorically significant.
