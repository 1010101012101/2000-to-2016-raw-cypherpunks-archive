Blair criticised over deal days after promoting peace.
60 Hawk jets in package promoted by ministers.

The Guardian
The government is mounting an intensive campaign to boost arms sales to 
India, including 60 Hawk jets worth #1bn, in spite of the danger of the 
India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir spilling into war and destabilising the 
entire region.
The arms push comes only a week after Tony Blair visited India and 
Pakistan. He expressed the hope that "we can have a calming influence" and 
warned of the "enormous problems the whole of the world would face if 
things went wrong".
