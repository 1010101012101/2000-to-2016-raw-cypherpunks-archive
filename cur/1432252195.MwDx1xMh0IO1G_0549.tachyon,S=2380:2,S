This description is remarkably like the description of Jewel Cave (National
Monument) when Herb and Jan Conn start exploring in the 1960s.  The park
wanted them to find a connection between two passages that separated close
to the entrance so they could run tour groups that didn't have to pass each
other in the narrow passages.

In 1969, there were 54 miles of passage mapped, and still no connection.
It is now over 127 miles, and still no connection.

Cheers - Bill
