Des Moines, IA
New technology will allow better response to 911 cell callers
08/09/04 10:35 AM
DES MOINES, IOWA (AP) -- Cell phone users in Iowa are getting a 911 upgrade.
The state is among the first in the nation to use the new technology that 
will help dispatchers pinpoint the emergency caller.
Iowa 911 Program Manager John Benson says it's already being tested in Des 
Moines, and the end of the year, about half of the state's 125 dispatch 
centers will have the upgrade.
About half of Iowa's 911 calls are placed by cell phones. That's about 
50,000 a month.
Current technology allows dispatchers to locate a cell phone 911 caller by 
the nearest cell tower, often miles away. The new global-positioning 
technology provides the latitude and longitude of the caller, which can be 
electronically displayed on a map.
