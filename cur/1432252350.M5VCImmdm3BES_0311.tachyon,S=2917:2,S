I'm currently looking for a way to get encrypted data via stego to
people who live in countries where crypto is illegal, and who may be
watched. so just sending them a large graphic would likely arouse
suspicion.

the 2 best solutions I've come up with so far are porn and spam. both
are readily believable, even in large quantities.
the problem with porn is that it may be illegal in itself in the same
countries. the problem with spam is that ascii text just doesn't offer
much to hide stego in (whitespacing, etc. is both easy to find and can
store very little data).
