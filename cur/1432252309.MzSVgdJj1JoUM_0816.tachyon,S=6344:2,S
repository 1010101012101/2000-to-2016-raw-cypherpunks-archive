In a free society, nothing stops an employee from seeking a lower 
stress, less demanding, lower profit margin employer, lower-paying job. 
In America, these low-paid employees are called "public teachers."

And our teachers in public schools are similarly free to not operate at 
their full potential, or even close to it, and yet be paid a moderate 
salary. They can even steal stuff the way your father did.

(But they'd better not do it in corporations such as the one I worked 
for: we fired their asses. No severance pay, and a blacklist from 
working in other companies. We told prospective employers of their 
thefts.)

Probably because they were either pirated or were rehashes/copies of 
Western books.

Not in all cases. I have a few Soviet physics and math texts written by 
some of the greats of Soviet physics and math. Printed on cheap paper, 
with the authors barely compensated, they were certainly cheap. And, of 
course, often prone to having ideology inserted by the commisars.

My first roommate in college was from Hong Kong. He had the Feynman 
Lectures printed on rice paper editions with the print bleeding 
through. Very inexpensive. Feynman, of course, saw no royalties. Which 
is OK, but understand that your country was operating as a Napster 
country.

Do you think American schools do not have such clubs? I was in a dozen 
of them, and President of several.

You seem to be pining for central control, for state subsidies, for 
communism.

I doubt you'll like what we have to offer on this list.

A pity. You seem like a reasonable, even nice, person. We've had some 
good exchanges in e-mail about language.

But your rant above says you would probably be happier under state 
socialism, which makes this list your absolute worse enemy.

Take care of yourself in whichever socialist paradise you can find. 
Albania is out, as of a few years ago....Vietnam is rapidly going free 
market...China is an industrial giant with a Politburo...perhaps you 
could try Myanmar?

Free markets are often rough. They mean there is no one to provide food 
for those who have no skills to offer.

Think of it as evolution in action. The burnoff of useless eaters will 
be glorious.
