Hello,

I was wondering what are your opinions on an open source project i am
developing decentralbank.com, i began building it as a colored coins
bitcoin wallet complementary to open transactions audit servers,which act
as multisignature wallets among other things,if colored coins were used
people would exchange the rights to the bitcoin stored in the audit server
and skip transaction fees, i thought this would be very useful for low
income countries where the transaction fee may seem exorbitant.

I will be using open transactions technology and will be expanding audit
servers which allow multi signature deposits to support colored coin
definitions as a way to create a decentralized asset definition storage for
colored coins. I was wondering if you guys think there is demand for this
or am i just wasting my efforts?

The repo is open source and located here https://github.com/DecentralBank
Open transactions audit servers are part of the voting pools scheme for
those of you who don't know here is the link
http://opentransactions.org/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Voting_Pools

Thanks,
Uwe Cerron

SAN FRANCISCO, July 14 Mon Jul 14, 2014 8:58pm EDT<br>
<br>
(Reuters) - U.S. government standards for software may enable spying by the=
<br>
National Security Agency through widely used coding formulas that should be=
<br>
jettisoned, some of the country&#39;s top independent experts concluded in =
papers<br>
released on Monday.<br>
<br>
Such mathematical formulas, or curves, are an arcane but essential part of<=

<br>
But NIST&#39;s relationship with the spy agency came under fire in Septembe=
r<br>
after reports based on documents from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden<=
br>
pointed to one formula in particular as a Trojan horse for the NSA.<br>
<br>
NIST discontinued that formula, called Dual Elliptic Curve, and asked its<b=

recommendations that were published on Monday alongside more stinging<br>
conclusions by the individual experts.<br>
<br>
Noting the partially obscured hand of the NSA in creating Dual Elliptic Cur=

<br>
As a whole, the panels recommended that NIST review its obligation to confe=

<br>
&quot;It is possible that the specified curves contain a back door somehow,=
&quot; said<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Ron Rivest, a co-founder of=
<br>
RSA and the source of the letter R in its name. Though the curves could be<=
br>
fine, he wrote, &quot;it seems prudent to assume the worst and transition a=
way.&quot;<br>
<br>
More broadly, Rivest wrote, &quot;NIST should ask the NSA for full disclosu=
re<br>
regarding all existing standards... If NSA refuses to answer such an inquir=
y,<br>
then any standard developed with significant NSA input should be assumed to=
<br>
be `tainted,&#39;&quot; absent proof of security acceptable to outsiders.<b=
r>
<br>
In an email exchange, Rivest told Reuters that &quot;NIST needs to have a p=
rocess<br>
whereby evidence is publicly presented&quot; about how the curves were chos=
en.<br>
<br>
The curves faulted on Monday had been questioned by outsiders after media<b=
r>
reports in September said the NSA could break much widely used security<br>
software, without detailing which ones or how. &quot;These curves are ubiqu=
itous<br>
in commercial cryptography,&quot; Johns Hopkins University professor Matthe=
w Green<br>
said in an interview. &quot;If you connected to Google or Facebook today, y=

<br>
Rivest&#39;s long association with RSA, now part of electronic storage make=
r EMC<br>
Corp, made his remarks more poignant. But prominent task force colleagues<b=
r>
including Internet co-creator Vint Cerf and Ed Felten, former chief<br>
technologist at Federal Trade Commission, also gave strongly worded verdict=
s<br>
on the Department of Commerce unit.<br>
<br>
&quot;It cannot be accepted that NIST&#39;s responsibilities should be co-o=
pted by the<br>
NSA&#39;s intelligence mission,&quot; wrote Cerf, who now works at Google I=
nc.<br>
<br>
While Rivest called the internal history of Dual Elliptic Curve a &quot;smo=
king<br>
gun&quot; with an &quot;almost certain&quot; NSA back door, Felten wrote th=
at NSA might not<br>
remain alone in its ability to use it and other possible NIST-approved hole=
s<br>
for spying.<br>
<br>
In each of three cases, including Dual Elliptic Curve and the more common<b=
r>
curves faulted by Rivest, Felten said the suspected back door access &quot;=
reduces<br>
the security of users against attack by other adversaries, including<br>
organized crime groups or foreign intelligence services.&quot;<br>
<br>
The NSA might have been able to generate curves that pass cursory security<=
