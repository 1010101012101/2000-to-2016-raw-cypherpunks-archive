RSA still have cutting edge technology though,right?
http://www.idquantique.com/
Q)How did their recent SEC audit go?
Not sure yet but the SEC is a bushit pussycat and their accountant wasn't 
Arthur Anderson.(pheuw!)
Q)When does their patent run out?
2004,I think,but they get to keep the 'name'.By then it should be like a 
company that traded with the old South Africa.
Q)So what are they lying about "The most trusted name in e-security"?
"Its not a lie if you believe in it." P.Trei.no,wait,sorry...that was 
George Castanza.
Dead tree Nature might be worth a look this 18-july edition.
