Also, users won't immediately know about the new remailers or have any
idea of their reliability. And while the Feds may be generally
sluggish, when it comes to law enforcement (that is, remailer raids on
anti-terrorism pretexts), I suspect they can be quite efficient.  They
don't have to succeed entirely, just enough to terrorize remailer
operators and/or their Internet providers.
