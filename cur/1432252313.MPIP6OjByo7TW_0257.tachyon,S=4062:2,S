Have you actually spoken with him, or are you just working from press reports?

Lots of things are "well known" and wrong, too.

I don't know what Kapor has been smoking, but getting focused on Stewart 
Baker as the enemy is a distraction. He's articulate, and sympathetic to 
law enforcement/intelligence arguments in favor of surveillance and against 
privacy, but I'd sure rather hear him make those arguments in public than 
have him make them in private where the rest of us can't respond or prepare 
for what's coming.

Maybe Kapor just now noticed that lives really are at stake - crypto and 
security aren't just about spying on porn downloads and credit cards. His 
reaction is typical of leftist privacy activists the first time they need 
to really grapple with violence and its implications - they want to get as 
far from it as possible, and defer to the right-wing "experts" they 
previously opposed.

If the FBI really is preparing for a domestic surveillance initiative, 
hearing about that months in advance is a lot more helpful than yet another 
incompatible peer-to-peer content distribution system.
