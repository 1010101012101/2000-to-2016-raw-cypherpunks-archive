	It's obvious from looking at the whole conversation.

	Clearly irrelevant. And your irrelevant comments don't change
	the nature of the slides.

	 1 + 1 = 2

	the sky is blue (depending on time and other conditions)

	cows give milk
	
	any more irrelevant bullshit you'd like to state?

	It doesn't makes sense. Only retards can believe that such a
	bunch of 'slides' really reflects what the nsa and co. know
	about tor. 

	More than likely those slides were made as some kind of exercise
	by some of the lowest ranking gov't parasite. The slides are
	nothing but a useless draft.

	Did I mention codermand dear that the author doesn't even know
	how tor dns resolution works? 'currently' he was
	'still investigating'...

	So, can I translate your usual twisted language into "OK I
	finally admit the slides are bullshit" ?

	bla bla bla 

	yes, it's another order of magnitude and so is the magnitude of
	the payoff. I can keep repeating any point you ignore.

	But did I mention that technical details are not really the
	point anyway?

	"FISA court would have to approve?"
