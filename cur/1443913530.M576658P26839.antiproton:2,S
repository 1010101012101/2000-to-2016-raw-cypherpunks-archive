	Problem is, even a sensible statist 'constitution' or
	legal system is managed by the state. Things can look good on
	paper, but who's going to enforce the sensible laws? 

	"all men are created equal" - except slaves.

	The problem remains, in general terms. People can cooperate for
	good or bad puroposes. 

	But at least anarchists aren't naive enough to believe that
	different factions within the mafia 'check' each other. Sure,
	there may be some internal quarreling in a mafia organization
	or in a government (they are the same thing), but the internal
	quarreling is not going to significantly prevent the government
	from doing all the bad things governments do. 

	Anyway, anarchists handle the problem of criminal cooperation
	inside a government by getting rid of the government.

	True, but some systems are...absurd, even when judged by
	their own flawed standards. 

	Democracy : people are not smart enough to govern themselves at
	the individual level, but, they are smart enough to
	elect...dumb 'representatives'? Something doesn't add up...

	I've read stuff from Gatto. He's pretty good. What's really
	amazing about him is that he worked for tens of years for the
	US public indoctrin I mean US public education system to finally
	realize how fucked up the system is.
