Indeed. Lynch mobs are a rational extension of the basic principle.

Yes it does, doesn't it. But the sense I use the word in mostly operates wrt
intangible things - physically removing someone from a venue isn't covered.

Huh? Obviously you have never been confronted with expert discrimination
yourself.

I'm a person, not a country. Were I to decide, I'd have no problem with the
'darkies'. In fact the extreme ethnic homogeneity here is pretty boring.

Rather.

Actually you do not need 70% taxes to get this effect. It already exists, as
you so nicely pointed out. But... This particular point has very little to
do with removing the lesbians from a venue (ballpark, was it?) - in fact,
the financial incentive of your example could be used to argue for inviting
the poor gals back in. Paying customers, see...

As for financial support to illiterate thieving peasants, the concept of
tolerance hardly subsumes something like that. Regardless of nationality,
skin color or whatever, no sane government poor indiscriminate amounts of 
money on under-achieving idiots. It's just a matter of setting the limits of
welfare rationally.
