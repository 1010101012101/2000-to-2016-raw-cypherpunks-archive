  Total bullshit there crock dog. TCDD is also a breakdown product 
of both poly-chlorinated phenols like 2,4,D and 2,4,5-T and poly-chlorinated
bi-phenols (PCBs). It really doesn't matter what level tcdd (dioxin) is at 
time of manufacture, even boiling coffee watere with 245T in it can give
you a load of dioxin. 
   The agit/prop that we *need* herbicides to produce enough food is
patently absurd. They didn't even exiest 50 years ago, and most farmers
in the world still don't use them. Only the chemically dependant 
brainwashed, braindead amerikan farmer does, which is why he's quickly
becoming extinct.
