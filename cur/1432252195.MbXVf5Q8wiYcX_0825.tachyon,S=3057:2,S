It was discussed during the IPng days.  My view at the time -- and my view today -- is that there's an inherent conflict between that and multiple competitive ISPs.  Suppose there's an IP address corresponding to 40.75013351 west longitude, 73.99700928 north latitude (my building, according to Google maps).  To which ISP should it be handed for delivery?  Must all ISPs in a given area peer with each other?
