Interesting.
Contrary to what I thought (or what has been discussed here), only a 
'scalar' of detected light is needed, not a vector. In other words, merely 
measuring overall radiated intensity over time seems to be sufficient to 
recover the message. This means that certain types of diffusive materials 
will not necessarily mitigate against this kind of eavesdropping.

However, his discussion would indicate that the various practical concerns 
and limitations probably limit this to very niche-type applications...I'd 
bet that it's very rare when such a trechnique is both needed as well as 
useful, given the time, the subject and the place.
