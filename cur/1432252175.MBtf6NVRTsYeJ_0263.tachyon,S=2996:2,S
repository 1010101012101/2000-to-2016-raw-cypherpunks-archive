   And this is why socialism in any form is a bad idea.  It prevents
   evolution in action from culling the morons.  In the olden days these
   guys would have been sabertoothed tiger fodder.

   Let's face it, shit like hotmail, AOL, MSN, and their cousins are really
   socialism in disguise.

You have some strange ideas about what 'socialism' is. Used by you in sentences
such as the above, it seems to be a catch-all for 'things-I-don't-like'. If
by socialism you mean Stalinist state-capitalism, you might think about
using 'Stalinist state-capitalism'. I know it doesn't have the wonderful
generality of 'socialism', but accuracy is important too.

   Let's face it, shit like hotmail, AOL, MSN, and their cousins are really
   socialism in disguise.

Hmm: all of the above are products of corporatism, which was a feature of 
Soviet-controlled socialist countries (everything was owned by the state) and USA-sponsered
'free countries' (everything was owned by the family or friends of
the tinpot dictator). Ideological differences aside, the net result was
the same.

Socialism and statism are not homologous. Refer to Rosa Luxembourg.

   They allow the morons access to what they 
   shouldn't have. 

Spoken like a true commissar.
