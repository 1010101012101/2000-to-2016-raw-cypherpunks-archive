Inasmuch as I think the Feds are trying to put together a RICO case 
for Cypherpunks being some kind of "continuing criminal conspiracy," 
it would seem that _any_ testimony before a GJ, whether about past 
membership, current membership, contacts with others, authorship of 
articles, etc. could constitute "self incrimination" for the 
impending Federal case.

"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the notorious and 
infamous organization known as "the Cypherpunks"?"

Unless given use immunity (as I understand the legal jargon, given 
that IANAL), anything admitted to is fodder for the Main Case, yet to 
come.
