Counting derivatives as debt is definitely 100% misguided. They're also
used to amplify market swings - make or lose more with less motion,
therefore the oversizedness is not surprising. It makes markets more
accurate, liquid and reliable (except f-ups get amplified too sometimes).

Why not just read about this online? It's very public info.
