Hello,


We are so overwhelmed with emails at this

time, I would appreciate you calling me

at:


              1-800-527-8980



I am afraid that our service will not be up

to standard unless we talk on the phone..



There are some great cruise values at this

time, including Europe, Alaska, Mexico and Caribbean.



Please call so we may discuss some of these

cruise values with you.



Thank you very much and once again the 

number is: 


              1-800-527-8980.



Thank you and happy cruising.



Tami   :)
