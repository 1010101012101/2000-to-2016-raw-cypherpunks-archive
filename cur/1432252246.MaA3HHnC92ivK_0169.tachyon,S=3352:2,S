This has nothing to do with the definition of public versus private goods,
which was quoted in the message to which you replied.  Public goods are
non-rival and non-excludable, terms which were defined there.  Do you
understand what these words mean?  Can you use them in a sentence that
begins, "Digitally signed information is not a public good because..."?

Right, I'll do that as soon as you learn to spell dirigistes.  There's
nothing like using French incorrectly to show someone up as a pretentious
jackass.
