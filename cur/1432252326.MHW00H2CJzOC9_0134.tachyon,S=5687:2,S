Heh.  That's the fun thing about Internet scale when
trying to keep information secret - even with a mass boycott by the
open-souce community against a request for cracking
or massive obedience to license restrictions on reverse-engineering,
it only takes one skilled person (or in this case several)
to totally shred the secrecy of a technically bad design.

Copy protection is a fundamentally hard problem - 
if you've got a secure processor, with a built-in private key
that can execute commands sent to it public-key encrypted,
or that has a public key built in and only executes commands
signed by the public key, that outputs directly in analog
(or directly to a D/A converter if your threat model
doesn't include people snarfing each tune from hardware)
you can probably make it work.  That's similar to what
we'd need to do really secure voice communications.

Or if you've got sound cards with different secret keys on 
each card that only play tunes individualized for that card
(so you send your serial number, credit card, and tune request
to PayRIAA.com and it gives you an E-MP3 for your player,
not usable with any other player you've got.
