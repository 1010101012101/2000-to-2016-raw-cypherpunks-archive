     That's for sure. In fact, the FBI (and all other TLA's) are just as
much terrorists as the people who did up the WTC, and for all I know,
they *were* the ones who did up the WTC. At any rate, the USG is by
far the greatest threat to the peace and freedom of Americans in the
world today. Fuck them and all other LEO. If I saw a cop being kicked
to death by some dirt balls on the side of the road, I sure wouldn't
interfere or ever testify against them. 
   Get real Aimee -- death to all pigs, judges, prosecutors, and all
their ilk.
