Tell you what: why don't you learn assembler, rip it open with whatever 
the "purist" equivalent of IDAPro is
(http://www.datarescue.be/downloadfreeware.htm) and and have yourself a 
ball. Seriously.

Because the technology behind it is interesting and it addresses a problem 
associated with detecting keyloggers in a unique way.

For all anybody knows, you're a federal feeb behind a remailer trying to 
suss out exactly what I know and don't know about keystroke loggers. But 
how likely is that.

That's arguable. But don't forget that a lot of people have to use Windows 
at work. I think HookProtect is better than nothing.

Have fun!
