The USA has some serious chickens coming home to roost...

http://russia-insider.com/en/politics/short-history-us-bombing-civilian-facilities/ri10340

Just one of many examples, and all of the examples only since 1991:

"Red Cross complex, Kabul, Afghanistan (October 16 and October 26, 2001)

At the beginning of the U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S.
attacked the complex housing the International Committee of the Red
Cross in Kabul. In an attempt to prevent such incidents in the future,
the U.S. conducted detailed discussions with the Red Cross about the
location of all of its installations in the country. Then the U.S.
bombed the same complex again. The second attack destroyed warehouses
containing tons of food and supplies for refugees. “Whoever is
responsible will have to come to Geneva for a formal explanation,”
said a Red Cross spokesperson. “Firing, shooting, bombing, a warehouse
clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem is a very serious incident. …
Now we’ve got 55,000 people without that food or blankets, with
nothing at all.”
