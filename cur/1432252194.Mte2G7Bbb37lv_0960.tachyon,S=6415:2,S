> determine a.which investments will provide the best protection?
>  How will
> we know when we've reached our goals?  Can market forces ensure that

>    While security technologies have benefited from decades of study,
> there has been a dearth of research into decision making
> tools required
> to choose among these technologies and employ them properly.  The
> growing importance of information security and the failings of
> technology-centric approaches have made security economics an

> existing economic tools to today's security questions and in
> pioneering
> new economic approaches to address problems unique to the study of
> security.

>    The Third Annual Workshop on Economics and Information
> Security (WEIS04)
> is a successor to the two pioneering workshops on this

>    We encourage economists, computer scientists, security specialists,
> business school faculty, and industry experts to submit

> encourage collaborative
> research from authors in multiple fields.  Among past and
> suggested topics are:
>
>    Game theoretic security models      Analysis of security
> solutions market
>    Security investment optimization    Threat modeling
>    Information sharing                 Risk management
>    Algorithmic mechanism design        Security metrics
>    DRM and customer lock-in            Security loss estimation

>    There will be no printed proceedings of this workshop, but
> as with the

> There may later be
