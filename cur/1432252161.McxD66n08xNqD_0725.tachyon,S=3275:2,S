What happened to the new feeling of unity in America since the Late 
Unpleasantness?

Note that a number of lives were saved by smoking at the WTC when people 
popped down or tarried for a cigarette (whereas *none* were saved by not 
smoking) .  Of course they were outside because of anti-smoking rules so in 
this case, perhaps smokers and anti-smokers sort of worked together to save 
lives.
