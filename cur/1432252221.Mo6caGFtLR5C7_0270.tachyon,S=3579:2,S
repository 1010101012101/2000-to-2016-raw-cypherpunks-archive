Here's an interesting idea for a service... since most folks are 
agreed that spammers won't do encryption, does it not make sense 
to have spam-free email accounts on some server somewhere? 

You can do this pretty simply -- all non-encrypted messages are 
forwarded to dev/null.  If the user wants to, she could use a 
procmail script that sends a bounce message -- or a procmail 
script that doesn't. 

If you're worried about spammers using the service to send mail, 
you can just adopt the same policy for outgoing messages. 

So you could have an address where it was enforced that nobody 
could contact you there without encrypting the message, and then 
you wouldn't have to worry about carnivores sniffing something 
sensitive, or about server logs giving snoops your mail, or etc. 
And as a side benefit, you'd get zero spam -- at least until the 
spammers ran out of people they could spam more easily.

I think I like this idea, because it would elevate encrypted 
email from an abberation to be tracked to the universal 
condition, at least for that system -- and introduce a reason 
for people out there to *learn* to use crypto software, if they 
wanted to talk to people on the system.
