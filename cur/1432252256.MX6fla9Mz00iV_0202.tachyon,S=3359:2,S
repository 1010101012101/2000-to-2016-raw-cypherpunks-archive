Dude, we're not launching missiles here, it's just Wikipedia.

First, how do you add client certificates in modern browsers? Oh,
actually I've just found it in Firefox, but what about
IE/Opera/whatever else? Can you do it easily?

The blinded signature is just a long bit string and it might well be
better from a user's point of view for them to 'login' by pasting the
base64 encoded blob into a box.

Just a thought (motivated in no small part by my dislike for all things
x509ish)

The lack of forward secrecy is pretty fundamental in a reputation
based system. The more you turn up the forward secrecy, the less
effective any reputation system is going to be.

And I'm also going to say well done to Jason for actually coding
something. There do seem to be a lot couch-geeks on or-talk - just
look at the S/N ratio on the recent wikipedia threads. It might not
work, but it's *something*. No amount of talk is going to suddenly
become a solution.
