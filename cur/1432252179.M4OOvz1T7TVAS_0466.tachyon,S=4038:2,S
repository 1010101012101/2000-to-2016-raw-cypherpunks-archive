Actually all you have to prove is it existed, say you find a body with a
big hole that was caused by a gun. Hiding/destroying the gun down would be
a crime at that point. If they could prove that you did the crime through
other means, and that the crime was commited with a gun (which follows you
had the gun at one time) then they could nail your slimey ass to the wall
without ever laying hands on the gun.

Similarly, grinding off s/n's, wiping disks (which your statement above
would qualify as evidence), etc. to modify or otherwise alter the evidence
would also be criminal.

It's even a crime to destroy evidence in a civil (ie non-criminal) case.
