Which is why I asked for you some actual cases. I pointed out that--so 
far as I have heard--there have been _no_ prosecutions for "paramilitary 
training." (There may have been some paramilitary types busted for 
firing AK-47s, for trespassing, whatever. This is why I listed these as 
exceptions.)

Bell's AP was not one of the charges in his case.

No point in going round and round. I don't think even the U.S.G. has 
this power that you think it does, and I cite the non-prosecution of 
many right-wing groups as evidence. When busts have occurred, other 
alleged crimes were involved, like trespassing, violations of gun laws, 
etc.

Well, the ADL is made up mostly of Jews, and Jews have extraordinarily 
anti-liberty views. If the Jews ran our country...wait a minute, they do.


Never mind.


(P.S. Just kidding. The ADL and B'nai Brith and Jews for the 
Confiscation of Firearms have not succeeded in getting thoughtcrimes 
banned the way they had hoped. And Jews for the Preservation of Firearms 
Rights are actively campaigning on the other side.)
