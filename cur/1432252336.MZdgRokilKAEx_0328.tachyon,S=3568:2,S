I agree with Measl. I sent "Karsten M. Self" (if that's his real name) 
to the cornfield for his worthless contributions and willful ignorance.

I got the "Anthrax protocol issued" post just fine. Maybe it's because I 
have "Show MIME" disabled. Maybe "Karsten M. Self" is complaining 
because he has MIME enabled.

(Which is presumably why we keep getting his MIME signatures attached to 
his mail, and which lne.com thoughtfully removes.)

Fact is, straight ASCII text is the lingua franca of the Net (note that 
"lingua franca" was NOT italicized in some non-ASCII 128 font). What is 
lost in not having accent agraves and umlauts and Farsi language fonts 
is more than made up for by having the "straight 128" ASCII character 
set.
