An update:

Moxie Marlinspike and David Hulton have improved the attack from 2^57 to  
2^56.

Two days ago at Defcon 20 they released open source software for parsing  
network captures for any MS-CHAPv2 handshakes and an online service using a 
Pico Computing FPGA cluster to reverse the NT hash. This allows decrypting 
a captured PPTP session or logging in as the user in about half a day on 
average.

On Monday, Jacob Applebaum and I will be presenting our "vpwns: Virtual  
Pwned Networks" paper at Usenix FOCI '12. It discusses the limitations of 
off-the-shelf VPN systems when used for user anonymity and censorship  
resistance. PPTP is a common choice for these systems, so we'll take the  
opportunity to reiterate the inherent weakness in MS-CHAPv2.

https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci12/vpwns-virtual-pwned-networks

This is a good opportunity for everyone to make a contribution to  
practical crypto. Anyone that can pitch in, let's do a full-court press on 
lobbying for the wholesale replacement for MS-CHAPv2 and to raise  
awareness of the decryptability of PPTP. We could use blog posts, press  
articles, tweets, etc.

Let's make this the week that the whole industry realizes that vendors  
shipping these protocols are continuing to sell crummy sub-standard  
single-DES crypto products which don't conform to modern security  
requirements.
