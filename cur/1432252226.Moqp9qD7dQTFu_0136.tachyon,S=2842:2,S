It used to be quite common for big companies to do that,
before the advent of politically-motivated drug testing.
You do want to know if your employees are healthy,
especially if they're doing physical labor or driving or
you're spending a lot of money training them or if 
you're self-funding your medical insurance program.
Also, the military gives people physicals for similar reasons,
and the CIA's sort of related.
Polygraphs, of course, are bogus.

If they're looking for an Architect Stud, we've got John Young here,
