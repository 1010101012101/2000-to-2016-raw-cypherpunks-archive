If I'd find a way to make money off your antics I would.  Sadly, I believe
that I'm part of that minority which find your - shall I say, "alternate
view point of reality" really entertaining, and tweaking you to produce
more of it funny.  Most people that I'm aware of find it somewhat boring
and unentertaining, so I'm afraid we wouldn't make a very good road
show...
