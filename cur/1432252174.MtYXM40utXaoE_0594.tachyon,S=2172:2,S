Language is how you manipulate people from a distance.   Much
more convenient than hitting them.

Crypto *can* keep bits free.  And so maybe language.

But Men with Guns control physical reality, which limits what
those bits can do.  Read the archives on the problems with
linking "credits" to dollars or physical merchandise.

Note that the Saudis are organizing conferences on registering
and recording hawala.  Note that the US will kidnap (mexican
MD for instance) if they can't extradite.

And how many will run a prohibited node when
the penalty is watching your family assets seized,
family members raped, before your eyes are gouged out?
