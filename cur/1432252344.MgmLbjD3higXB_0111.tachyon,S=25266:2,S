 summer of 2000, I visited the last-registered-addresses of vehicles that h=
ad been used on Father's Day Sunday 1998 to surveill me when I drove to a r=

 legal mail that should have come to me at (first) Seatac FDC jail, and sub=

=A0=A0 (Note:=A0 This version of the lawsuit was finalized under trying cir=

 ask for an appeal (send in a "Notice of Appeal" document) within 10 workin=

 after having RE-forged the docket for appeal 99-30210 (probably in May 200=

at appeal.=A0 He did, and he lost.=A0 But he didn't send me a copy of the d=

hat are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alerted that I =
hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.=A0 Solovy's=
 job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events around appeal =
99-30210, and he did so.=A0 I found out the true nature of fake appeal 99-3=

he docket for that case.&nbsp; Had he done so, or had he asked me one of on=
e hundred questions ("I see you've been working on this appeal for 10 month=
s!&nbsp; What are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alert=
ed that I hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.&n=
bsp; Solovy's job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events a=
round appeal 99-30210, and he did so.&nbsp; I found out the true nature of =
fake appeal 99-30210 about June 20, 2003, after I received a copy of
 the docket for that case from the clerks' office of the 9th Circuit Court =
of Appeals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br clear=3D"none">&gt;the judg=

 Leen, was assigned to me about November 21, 2000.&nbsp; I learned early th=
at he didn't intend to actually defend me.&nbsp; I sent a letter to the (co=
rrupt) judge Tanner about December 8, 2000, telling him that I had 'fired' =
Leen.&nbsp; Tanner's response was to refuse to let me fire Leen.&nbsp; At t=
hat point, I realized that I would be fighting not merely the prosecution, =
but also 'my' attorney and the judge.&nbsp; I began learning the law, and p=
ut a lot of effort into self-written motions and objections.&nbsp; I even f=
iled a 'Notice of Interlocutory Appeal' in late March 2001, just before my
 'trial', which divested jurisdiction from that court to proceed.&nbsp; Nat=
urally, they simply ignored this, Leen, prosecutor Robb London (who current=
ly works as the Communications Director at Harvard Law School), and judge T=
anner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of this is described in my lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbs=
