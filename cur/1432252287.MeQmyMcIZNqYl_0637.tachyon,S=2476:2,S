How does it allow the merchant to view the picture
while preventing the thief from doing so?

Saying "it's encrypted" is, at best, sweeping a very large
problem under a small rug.  Who holds the key?  How
does the card or the user authenticate a real merchant vs.
a thief posing as a merchant?

Those are the hard problems.  No one in biometrics
has yet been able to solve them in a general way.
