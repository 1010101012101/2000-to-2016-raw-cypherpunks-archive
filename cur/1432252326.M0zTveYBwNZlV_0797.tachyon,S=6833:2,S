There are a relative few choke points for information distribution
in the West. Not all would have to be taken out at the same time,
only a few, then a pause to process intelligence garnered from
the second attack along with that of the first was on the WTC 
and Pentagon (the anthrax attack provided intelligence for 
the same planners whether done by them or planned for a 
later intel-gathering operation).

The short-lived patriotism after WTC/Pentagon has been
transformed into uncritical jingoism in the US and surprisingly
in the copycat UK.

There has been a stead build-up of intelligence by fire from
the various bombings of US installations leading up to WYC
and the Pentagon, as several military and intellgience analysts 
have noted. And still the US and its allies have not been able
to halt the attacks, despite round-up of a few low level operatives
and convictions -- but no public execution or other merciless
acts of retribution, or none that have been publicized.

The Afghan bombing has been exhibited as relatively bloodless
except for the killing of journalists and a single CIA officer --
agents of information which have become the pariahs of
many societies, not all of them non-Western.

What would have an effect in the West is not only attacks on
the infrastructure of information and its celebrated leaders
but its variety of participants -- students, teachers, preachers,
educators, journalists, publicists, ad writers, entertainers,
intellectual property creators and producers and exporters,
lawyers and a slew of professionals. These are the sources
of the offensive content and the tools, hardware, and weapons
that accompany the content, that drive opponents to murderous
rage in defense of their own cultural content.


The Western conceit that its culture is so superior that it
must impose it on others through missionary campaigns
now many centuries old, through economic policies, through 
eduation, through foreign policies, through military enforcement,
and through disparagement of other cultures, has bred a
deep seated anger toward the prime exporters, the idea
supremacists of state, church and family.

Despite tolerant pretensions, the West has been the bloodiest
culture that ever existed, and is getting meaner and more
vicious as its technological prowess grows and its intellectual
abilities decline -- as with all powerful bandits which get more
stupid as they conquer by force.

The US superpower vainglory is what keeps it ever blind to
the weakness of its power: it's obessession with secrecy
and belief that hardware will prevail over software, those
standard signs of power corruption preceding a fall.

All power aggrandizement thrives on cloaking its predations
with claims of superiority -- state, church and family -- and
refusal to consider that it is not as good as it dreams of
being, that is, the powerful take promotional material for 
reality.

Empires are susceptible to having their illusions shattered
when their cosmeticians lose their skill at concealing the
rot. Or to put it another way, when long successful cosmetic
schemes lose their power to deceive.

The US military is a shell of an effective military operation,
sustained more by publicity than by successful action. It
has had no enemy to test its promise since WW2 when it
gained a foothold in US culture through citizen military
service and luxurious payoffs to industry and education,
especially education and training for advancing Western 
culture through economic, political and social exports.

Targets for centers of these exports are not hard to
identify, and they are not nuclear plants, bridges,
water supplies, and digital infrastructure, probably not
even Washington DC icons of political power -- these
are propounded as in urgent need of protection to divert
attention from crucial nodes.

Again, to see which are juicy targets for undermining
Western culture, look to those hardly protected at
all except by obscurity, by never being mentioned as
needing protection, by never promoted as ideas, places and 
people of influence, by being those supporters of Western
culture which are so fundamental to it the culture would
not be identifiable without them.

These targets are not celebrated, they are taken for
granted as if to last forever, well, as long as King George
lasted on the American continent (his reign did not end
with the American revolution but went overground into
our most distinguished institutions of rank, privilege, 
elitism, secrecy, deceit and conceit).
