Another corollary of your statements is that we can't have an AI 
monitoring Joe User's system to maintain security. No matter how smart 
a consumer-grade AI is, you have to assume the attackers will have AIs 
at least as smart, and dedicated to tricking the defensive AIs. The 
same applies to human users, of course, but humans are more 
unpredicable than a security AI is likely to be, and can be held 
responsible if they're tricked; if the security AI is tricked, the 
vendor might be held liable.

Too bad; I've about come to the conclusion that Joe User is too dumb 
(ignorant, inattentive, careless; in a word, dumb) to secure his 
systems, and doesn't think it worth paying someone to do it for him. 
That's a bummer because no one is going to trust an electronic wallet 
on a machine which has a 50% chance of being 0wn3d any given month. I'd 
been thinking that programs might soon get smart enough to handle Joe's 
security work, but as a result of your message I'm less confident than 
I was.
