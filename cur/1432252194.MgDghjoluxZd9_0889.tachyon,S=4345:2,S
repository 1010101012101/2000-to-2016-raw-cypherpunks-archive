Which is where a distributed grass roots wire-less network based on 'small
world networks' comes into play. In general this new network layer will
have two components. The first are 'static' within a region. This includes
both fixed point and mobile users in that locale. The second, and to date
pretty much ignored aspect, is long-distance long-haul. The answer here is
automobiles using the same sort of technology as above but tied to
highways and byways.

Only if we keep letting 'them' take the lead in the standards definition
and implimentation. This is the true power of Open Source software, it
allows the individual to select what they will use, as opposed to some
dicta from 'them'.

Beep, wrong answer.
