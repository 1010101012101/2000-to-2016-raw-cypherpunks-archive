Does anyone here actually think of this as good thing? At first glance, one
wouldn't assume so--but after seeing the zeal with which some of you bond over
shitting on people who have views different from what somehow mysteriously
passes for "acceptable", I started wondering if maybe you take this
finding as some sort of positive sign of what people can "achieve" through
voluntary cooperation without the heavy hand of government, etc.

I find it literally nauseating.

And as I was reading it, I couldn't help remembering a passage from Zarathustra
which bears repeating.

Once you turn an ice-cold eye toward yourself, this work becomes a lot more
meaningful than just another way to sneer at the sheeple...

***

Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star.
Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer
despise himself.

Lo! I show you the last man.

"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?"-- so asketh
the last man and blinketh.

The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who
maketh everything small.

His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth
longest.

"We have discovered happiness"-- say the last men, and blink thereby.

They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth. One
still loveth one's neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth warmth.

Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk warily. He
is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!

A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much poison at
last for a pleasant death.

One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime
should hurt one.

One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wanteth
to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.

No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wanteth the same; everyone is equal: he who
hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.

"Formerly all the world was insane,"-- say the subtlest of them, and blink
thereby.

They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is no end to their
raillery. People still fall out, but are soon reconciled--otherwise it spoileth
their stomachs.

They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures for
the night, but they have a regard for health.

"We have discovered happiness,"--say the last men, and blink thereby. And here
ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also called "The Prologue",
for at this point the shouting and mirth of the multitude interrupted
him. "Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,"-- they called out-- "make us into
these last men! Then will we make thee a present of the Superman!" And all the
people exulted and smacked their lips. Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and
said to his heart:

They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.
