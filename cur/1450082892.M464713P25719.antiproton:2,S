	Oh, ok. So in principle the stars were underexposed to the
	point of not showing up on film.

	On the other hand, if you point a camera at the sky, on the
	moon, during the lunar night, shouldn't you be able to
	get...something? 

	What about radar resolution? Is it possible to track a 5 x 5 x
	5 m object from a distance of 350,000 kilometers?
