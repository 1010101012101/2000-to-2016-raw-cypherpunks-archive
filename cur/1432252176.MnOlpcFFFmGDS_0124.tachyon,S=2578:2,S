There are, of course, many groups in canada.  Including the moose lodge, 
elks, eastern star, parliament, ladies' sewing circles, church congregations, 
aldermen, political parties, juries, and random sets of people who happen 
to be in the same room. 

However, these are not "groups" in the sense useful to cryptography.
