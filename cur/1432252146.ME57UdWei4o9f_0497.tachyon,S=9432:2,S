The Fall of Reason

 Paul Forest     Dar Al-Hayat     2004/11/23

 Condoleezza Rice is the latest cabinet member to gush out of the oil
patch. She is an obvious choice as Secretary of State for President Bush,
who is disenchanted with General Powell's ability to mouth the words given
to him by the White House spin barons, and yet, convey the impression that
he is not really comfortable as a bearer of false tidings. With Dr. Rice,
President Bush will be admirably served. 

Obviously an extremely articulate illusionist, at the time of the Iraq
justification period, she was in the foxhole shooting back at all
proponents of factuality and, actually, did get in some good shots, when
judged more on intellectual acrobatics than accuracy. Of her many masterful
quotes, one stands out: "Whoever's fault it is, it is certainly not mine,
unless you think it's the President's, in which case it's mine."

It is doubtful that the international world of diplomacy will understand
her nomination and doubtlessly accept credentials, which they can so
clearly identify as that of a studious perpetrator of deceit. She is
unlikely to abandon her credo of: "Our truth above all," and while trying
to outdo herself, she will preside over the destitution of what remains of
U.S. integrity.

Few people doubt, that her assertions that this administration's sole
objective was to surgically remove Saddam Hussein, would have received
ample support from the majority of Arab states. It seems self-evident,
however, that despite the U.S. air strike success in Kosovo, the Bush
Administration nurtured a hidden agenda that required massive intervention
by ground forces, and the establishment of a loyal and friendly new
controlling block in Iraq. This machination was conceived as a manner of
controlling a sufficient amount of world oil reserves, for the U.S. to be a
significant factor in the world price for oil.

In modern history, as well as present times, there are numerous examples of
dominant powers and individuals, venting their anger on the innocent when
the true culprits are beyond their reach. The U.S. military and the current
administration at some point, must have decided that using a surgical knife
is not time effective when seeking to carve out for itself a sizable niche
in the world's most desirable geography.

It is truly amazing that when a despicable act is perpetrated by the U.S.
military, whether in a prison or as recently, in a Mosque, a camera
appeared to have been pointed at the malefactors. We may ask ourselves, is
this the superior work of talented embedded cameramen, or could the camera
have been pointed anywhere with matching results?

These barbarian acts have considerably traumatized much of the world
community of Arab and Muslim nations, which are now firmly convinced that
the President's "war of vindictiveness" may have been intended to dislodge
Saddam Hussein and his regime, but as much thought went into humanitarian
concerns for the population, as in the governance of a post-war Iraq, very
little.

The shortsighted view is that terrorism will once again strike U.S. soil,
and recent utterances by the Sultan of Terror confirm that this is in fact
their intent. Should a disastrous terrorist act again occur on U.S. soil,
the fear mongers in the White House will then feel vindicated by the
tangible validation of their long-held views, and they will point fingers
at their detractors. These, in turn, will likely respond that a more
conciliatory attitude by the administration towards the Arab and Muslim
people, replacing the current militaristic course of action, might well
have prevented that which by then will have taken place.

The longer-term implications, however, are that Arab investments in the
U.S., which are now valued near 2 trillion dollars, will dry up, and may in
fact be downsized in favor of investments in the growing, potentially
friendly and peaceful European Community, whose currency appears destined
to supplant the Dollar as the principle world currency. The U.S. treasury
and financial markets have been surviving on a steady influx of outside
capital, and will be caught in a war of financial attrition which they are
not in a position to win.

Israel's well-being is directly linked to American benevolence and the
Israeli Government may discover the wisdom of having a greater array of
able and willing supporters. A considerable concentration of American
Jewish wealth and influence has been creatively positioned in the American
National Media, and this condition does not exist in any other nation. This
was unmistakably exhibited recently in a promo on itself by CNN, in which
they present, as most trustworthy, six of their regular hosts, of which
four are of Jewish legacy. Simple calculation reveals that since American
Jews represent 2% of the total American population, the selected hosts
amounted to 33 times the proportional representation within the American
population.

True friends of Israel, mainly Americans of Jewish heritage, must
demonstrate to Israel's fanatic right that the citizens of the world other
than North Americans, are not conditioned to readily endure the economic,
human and traumatic sacrifices that the U.S. experience clearly indicates
are to be expected, when fully committed to the exclusive support of Israel
in the relentless pursuit of its political expansionism.

The dire consequences previously described, have stealthily begun, and may
be experienced by anyone approaching a Foreign Exchange counter. Graver
concerns may occur sooner than we might normally expect, at the current
rate of irresponsible deficit spending, gargantuan trade deficits and
progressively increasing labor outsourcing, unless a total policy reversal
is implemented.

First, the U.S. must, somehow, find a way to express their support for
Israel, without openly exhibiting hostility towards the Arab and Muslim
community, their culture, and their leaders. To that end, Israel, whose
only derived benefit in the Middle East conflict has been the ephemeral
inflow of U.S. capital and military resources, must join the U.S. in this
resolve.

There has always been, and there continues to be, an unwritten rule among
journalists in the U.S., that you do not make a connection between the U.S.
total support of Israel in everything of concern to them, and the
bottommost esteem of the U.S. and Americans by most of the world and
particularly Arab/Muslim descendants. Yet, it is clearly obvious that this
is a fact. We must ask ourselves: "What other reason could there be?"

No one can now reverse the momentum of militant intervention by Muslim
terrorists, without a complete agreement between warring parties in Israel
and Palestine. The economic and military support freely given to Israel by
the U.S. is the breath of life that is keeping the Middle East conflict
alive and well.

Any potential solution to this basic Middle East conflict must take the
form of an agreement acceptable to the Palestinians of their own free will.
For this to happen, perhaps new lines must be drawn in the sand, which
would provide a restated Palestine with a significant Mediterranean
shoreline, a united West Bank and Gaza and all Palestine lands south of the
West Bank.

In a dream-like state, one might visualize a peaceful Israel, clearly
separated from the equally peaceful states of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon,
not by a wall, but by a multilane highway, perhaps to be appropriately
known as the "Jerusalem International Highway," under the watchful
supervision of the UN.

George W. Bush has yet to exhibit any capacity for reversing himself on
matters before him, and unless he becomes a born-again rationalist, we can
logically conclude that the developing crisis will inexorably degenerate
into the colossal tribulation that it appears headed for.
