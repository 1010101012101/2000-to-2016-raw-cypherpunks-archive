The internal state of the PRNG is precisely the question.
In a PRNG-based cryptosystem, there are N bits of key,
and if you know them, you can crack the rest of the message.
There are a variety of attacks, including chosen plaintext,
chosen cyphertext, known plaintext, etc. that can tell you
different amounts of information about the key or message.
Some cryptosystems are quite strong, and make the work of guessing
the key based on known quantities too large to be solvable.
Others are quite weak, and mathematicians being the devious sorts
that they are, they can often find ways to exploit the weaknesses.

With a one-time pad, the state of the cryptosystem is as large
as the message itself - you've got one key bit applied independently
on each bit of message.  There is no state of the system that's
smaller than the message itself, and no way to tell if any bit 
you guess is valid or not, because there's one key bit that will
produce a 0 for it and one that produces a 1.
