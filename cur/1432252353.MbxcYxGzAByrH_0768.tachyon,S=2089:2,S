If you give "aid" to the "enemies" of the U.S., that would qualify as
treason even absent a declaration of war, in my opinion. Note I'm
obviously not saying what Hawash (allegedly) did would qualify as
such, and let's remember the DOJ did not file that charge.

"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War
against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and
Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the
Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in
open Court."
