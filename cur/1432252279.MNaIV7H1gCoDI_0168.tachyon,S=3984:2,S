A couple of questions to resident cluebots:

1) what is the bulk of traffic originating on user side and which does not
   end within the ISP?

2) how much of that traffic is in clear? Specifically, what is the
   percentile of SSL sessions, and what is the trend? Do we at
   all already see things SOAPy, .NETy, or XML-RPCy out there in the
   wild?

3) browser-web server connect is bidirectional. Which do's and don'ts
   needs one follow, if one wants to implement an unblockable (well, an
   ISP not granting web access won't stay an ISP for long) p2p
   infrastructure on top of that?

(should have paid more attention to the REST thing on FoRK, damn).

Some illuminating comments highly appreciated.

P.S. Any interest on a #cypherpunks on a silc server? Both client and
     server are easy to set up. http://silcnet.org/
     silc.netropolis.org (208.222.215.99) is there, but seems unreliable.
     Apart from that, SILC just works.
