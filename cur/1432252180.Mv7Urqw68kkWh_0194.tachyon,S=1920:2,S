Now always. If a political discussion can uncover likely threat models, then 
there's some distinct usefulness.

Also, the politics of dis-intelligence is also useful. Those worries about 
super-quantum-TEMPEST is a good example: "Oh don't you bother with your cute 
lil' crypto systems, because we can just watch you  at your keyboard 
anyway..."

So if there's some way to modify "write code" to include "code-impacting 
political discussion", then I agree, but I also agree it still gets rather 
masturbatory.

But then again, it's not like any male has ever wanted to masturbate 
before...
