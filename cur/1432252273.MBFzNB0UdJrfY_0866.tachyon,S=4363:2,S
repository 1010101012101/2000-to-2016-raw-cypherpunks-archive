<b>The MSR Anti-Spam Suite comtains six targeted utilities designed
to help you get rid of that annoying, unsolicited junk e-mail that can
clutter up your mailbox.&nbsp;</b>
<p>Due to the popularity of the internet and the low cost of sending out
advertisements, we are now awash in a flood of junk e-mail.&nbsp;
<p>Rather than ban the transmission of such e-mail (which can get into
rather thorny first amendment issues) at the source, it is our feeling
that we can use technology to help eliminate junk e-mail at the target
(that is, your machine). The MSR Anti-Spam Suite works great in conjunction
with the major e-mail programs.&nbsp;
