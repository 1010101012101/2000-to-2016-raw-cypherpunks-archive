I'm really not completely clued-in to all of the publishing options but
my gut instinct says that the more rapid and widespread the dispersal
the better. The originator of proscribed information needs to be
anonymous but it seems that if the recipients are many and diverse then
the level of guilt associated with reception can be ameliorated. 

A mixmaster chain firing the info off into a whole shitload of lists
looks like a pretty good way to ensure that information is not made
extinct. 

If a DeCSS source+bin zip had been anonymously mailed to 40 million
people the terrain for the legal fight might have been different. I
think JQPublic hasn't yet grasped the absurdity of "illegal information"
and might react unpredictably if told that possessing or forwarding
certain e-mails was a crime. Non-techie people I've spoken with about
the state of affairs flat out didn't believe me.
