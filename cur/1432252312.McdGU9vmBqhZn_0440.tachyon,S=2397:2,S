It is precisely for these reasons that changing your name in Germany is a
major undertaking (costs money, too), and is associated with a background
check (clean rap sheet requried). The transcription rules for furriner names
are strict, too. No Phn'glui M'gl wna'f, Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgha Nagl Ftaghn for
you.

Such legislation, of course, is easy to introduce in the U.S. as well.
I'd be really surprised of you US cpunks didn't have a national ID cum
biometrics issued (er, make that rammed down your throat) a few years
downstream. Unless the general populace wakes up to the fact what's
been going on since the 1970s. Fat chance.
