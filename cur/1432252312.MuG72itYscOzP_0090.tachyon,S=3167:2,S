	So let me get this straight.

	You signed a contract agreeing to pay back monies loaned to 
you for the purposes of getting and education, and now you want to 
avoid paying?

	You know what that makes you?

	A thief.

	A miserable stinking thief that is--in effect--stealing *MY* 
money, since it's a government backed (hence tax-payer paid for) loan.

	I'm paying back my loans, and you can do as well you 
miserable piece of shit.

	People who won't fulfill their contracts need to be dealt 
with by those who *do* fulfill their contracts.
