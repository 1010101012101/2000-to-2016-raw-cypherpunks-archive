> Minister for communications Senator Richard Alstons office didnt
> return phone calls to ZDNet Australia and the Attorney Generals
> department referred the matter to the Department of Defence, which
> said: It goes into the realms of defence and we dont comment on that.

> According to reports from the US, there is widespread support for a
> ban on "uncrackable" encryption products, with 72 percent of Americans
> agreeing that anti-encryption laws would be "somewhat" or "very"
> helpful in preventing a repeat of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

> However, according to Laura Chappell of US-based Protocol Analysis
> Institute, a ban is unlikely to happen. Although over-the-counter
> decryption tools are readily available over the Internet we use the
> same tools for troubleshooting on our own networksto not allow vendors

> According to Grant Bayley, founder of 2600 Australia (

> the Australian Government will surely following suit.
>
> However, such a privacy-restrictive move isn't likely to be a quick

> backflip on privacy enhancements to a position of restricting
> cryptography and allowing much greater government surveillance of
> citizens isn't likely to go down well with an election looming, Bayley
