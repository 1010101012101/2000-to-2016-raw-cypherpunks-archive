First, What's your point?  This list does not require that participants
agree with anyone else's sense of ethics.  This list often considers the

effect of tech on civilization, but you are not required to endorse
(or recognize, or scorn) civilization.  This list often discusses
certain
ethics by themselves, but nothing is taken for granted, and the
timid/naif
may be a little frightened by this.

Second, it is quite clear, even to contract-law/laissez-faire types like
myself, that
some DRM-interested companies are attempting to use the law
to remove some rights from consumers (about gadgets and bits and RF).
Many of us have a maniacally dim view of such manipulation.

Third, if you don't get understand why some people are driven
to understand technology, you should probably go back to your TV.

And you don't sue someone for what users of their product do.
