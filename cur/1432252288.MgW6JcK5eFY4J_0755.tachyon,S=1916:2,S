Hey...can some clever Cypherpunk think of a nice poison pill for ED? 
Theoretically, something like that is possible, but my only ideas aren't so 
hot. For instance, and elderly couple could sow some form of radioactive 
substance into their grounds, in quantities that would take longer than 
their life expectancy to kill them.

Of course, a cleanup might be possible, but that would theoretically wack 
out the cost structures.

There might be other less drastic measures that can be taken, however, such 
as finding a way to boost up the property costs so that the developers lose 
interest or perhaps even creating a very hard-to-find "landlord" that is 
collecting vast sums (on paper) for the rent of the property.

These are crummy ideas, so relax. But I suspect something is possible.
