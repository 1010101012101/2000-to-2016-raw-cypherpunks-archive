That's true. However, you can be immortalized even if your identity isn't
known; you can be known under a nym "unknown creator of the StegoWorm".

Besides, even Unknown Soldiers sometimes get statues. :)

Only the ones who use it to store documents in images on read-write media.
The files in transit and on read-only wouldn't be corrupted.

Speaking of storing data... the best for stego are big not-too-compressed
or uncompressed files. Occassionally playing in a garage band or having a
DV camera could be a good cover for having disks full of the only copies
of WAV and video files, where no "virgin" versions are available for
comparison for bit-level changes. Decreasing prices of DV camcorders could
be helpful here.
