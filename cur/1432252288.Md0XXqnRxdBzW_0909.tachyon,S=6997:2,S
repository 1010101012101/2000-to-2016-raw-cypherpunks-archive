Dear Chief Miller <jmiller@hoa.net>,

I wanted you to be among the first to hear that I've nominated your 
Department, Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Police http://www.hoa.net/reypd/ for 
Lewis Koch's "First Annual George Orwell 1984 Award".  The prize, a 
1949 first-edition copy of Orwell's 1984, worth about $100, will be 
awarded to the reader who supplies the best tip about an  egregious 
assault on personal privacy. The judges will be yours truly, plus 
Richard M. Smith and other officers of the Privacy Foundation. E-mail 
all suggestions to lzkoch@mediaone.net. All tips will be held in 
strictest confidence, so the award might well go to "anonymous." All 
suggestions will be fully investigated and thoroughly checked.

You're being nominated for your approval of placing hidden police 
surveillance cameras in a Reyoldsburg High School student restroom.

In addition I especially found your encouragement to sign your 
Departmental web site guestbook enlightening:
"If you don't sign our Guest Book, we're gonna send the CyberPatrol 
out after ya!"

I hope you win.

Regards,  Matthew Gaylor-
