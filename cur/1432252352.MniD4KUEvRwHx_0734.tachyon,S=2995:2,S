Whenever I receive the following generic troll:

 >Please send me info on bombs...step by step instructions...Thanx

I send the following response:

The real good stuff isn't on the Net.  Call your favorite OP book search 
person and get him to find you a copy of:

Eissler, M. "A Handbook on Modern Explosives: A Practical Treatise, with 
Chapters on Explosives in Practical Applications" London: Crosby Lockwood 
and Son, 1897. 2nd, Enlarged, fair, illus., appendices, index.

It'll set you back about $100 these days.

then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to 
Israel?
