Take this with a grain of salt. I'm no expert.

However: I'd guess that no applications (besides the secure nexus) would
have access to your "list of doggie names", just the ability to display
it. The list just indicates that you are seeing a window from one of
your partitioned and verified applications. I would also assume the
window would get decorated with the name of the trusted application (not
just your secret list). Thus you only need a single secret list to
handle all of your "authorized" applications.
