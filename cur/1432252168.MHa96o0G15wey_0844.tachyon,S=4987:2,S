With USAPATRIOT and HOMESEC REICHSPROTEKTION acts authorizing black bag 
jobs, break-ins, planting of evidence, keystroke-logging, 
administrative rubber-stamp warrants (no judge, just a GS-8 or higher 
saying "Go for it!'), it's time to revisit the issue of trap guns and 
booby traps.

How about an audio warning to computer tamperers? "You have 10 seconds 
to clear the area before this computer detonates."

Then, at the nearest door or sliding glass window, a rigged shotgun to 
decapitate those furiously trying to escape.

(For safety reasons, interlock the shotgun or detcord with the alarms 
on the computer.)

I expect the increase in black bag entries and break-ins is going to 
produce a few major court cases soon. What happens when a homeowner 
surprises a covert entry team in his house and a gunfight ensue? (With 
no warrant being shown to the homeowner, he cannot be said to have 
knowledge (scienter) that the apparent burglars or home invaders were 
actually "authorized.")

A similar theme was in the Cypherpunks-required film "Arlington Road" a 
few years back. (Check your video store, though I don't see it often on 
cable or in the DVD bins, so it may have been deemed by the studio to 
be too close to the truth for public consumption.) A so-called "white 
power" compound is being trespassed-upon by BATFags and narcs, sneaking 
up on the compound without display of a search or arrest warrant. The 
residents think they are being attacked and start shooting. Many agents 
die.

(Of course, at the end of "Arlington Road" even more evil doers are 
eradicated. Recommended before a trip to the desert to shoot.)
