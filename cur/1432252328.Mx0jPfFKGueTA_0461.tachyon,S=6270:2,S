  The fourth beta release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is now available from the
  OpenSSL FTP site <URL: ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/>.  This beta
  contains numerous fixes (among others, security-related ones) since
  beta 3, which explains the long time that has passed between the
  two.

  This is NOT a final beta.  Beta 5, which is planned to be the final
  one, will be released in two weeks if everything works well.  The
  final release of OpenSSL 0.9.7 is scheduled for Tuesday 2002-12-10.
  To make sure that it will work correctly, please test beta 4
  thoroughly, for example with your favorite piece of software, and
  please report back to us!  Also, please test on as many platforms as
  you have available and you have time for, especially on less common
  platforms.

  If you're interested in helping further, please join the
  openssl-dev@openssl.org list, where test requests on specific
  development snapshots will be announced.

  Changes between 0.9.7 beta 3 and 0.9.7 beta 4 include:

      o Support for new platforms: Windows CE, Tandem OSS, A/UX, AIX 64-bit
      o Extended support for some platforms: VxWorks
      o Enhanced support for shared libraries.
      o Support for pkg-config.
      o Lots of new manuals.
      o A few new engines added in the demos area.

  The full set of changes between 0.9.6{x} and 0.9.7 beta 4 include:

      o New library section OCSP.
      o Complete rewrite of ASN1 code.
      o CRL checking in verify code and openssl utility.
      o Extension copying in 'ca' utility.
      o Flexible display options in 'ca' utility.
      o Provisional support for international characters with UTF8.
      o Support for external crypto devices ('engine') is no longer
        a separate distribution.
      o New elliptic curve library section.
      o New AES (Rijndael) library section.
      o Support for new platforms: Windows CE, Tandem OSS, A/UX, AIX 64-bit
      o Extended support for some platforms: VxWorks
      o Enhanced support for shared libraries.
      o Support for pkg-config.
      o Lots of new manuals.
      o Change DES API to clean up the namespace (some applications link also
        against libdes providing similar functions having the same name).
        Provide macros for backward compatibility (will be removed in the
        future).
      o Unify handling of cryptographic algorithms (software and engine)
        to be available via EVP routines for asymmetric and symmetric ciphers.
      o NCONF: new configuration handling routines.
      o Change API to use more 'const' modifiers to improve error checking
        and help optimizers.
      o Finally remove references to RSAref.
      o Reworked parts of the BIGNUM code.
      o Support for new engines: Broadcom ubsec, Accelerated Encryption
        Processing, IBM 4758.
      o A few new engines added in the demos area.
      o Extended and corrected OID (object identifier) table.
      o PRNG: query at more locations for a random device, automatic query for
        EGD style random sources at several locations.
      o SSL/TLS: allow optional cipher choice according to server's preference.
      o SSL/TLS: allow server to explicitly set new session ids.
      o SSL/TLS: support Kerberos cipher suites (RFC2712).
      o SSL/TLS: allow more precise control of renegotiations and sessions.
      o SSL/TLS: add callback to retrieve SSL/TLS messages.
      o SSL/TLS: support AES cipher suites (RFC3268).

  The distribution file name is:

      o openssl-0.9.7-beta4.tar.gz
        MD5 checksum: 43cf89b428fbdd7873b5aae2680cd324

  The checksum was calculated using the following commands:

    openssl md5 < openssl-0.9.7-beta4.tar.gz
