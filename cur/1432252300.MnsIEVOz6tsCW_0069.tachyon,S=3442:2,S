Civic leaders have been presented with a proposal that would be
among the toughest gun laws in the state, making it nearly impossible
for new retailers to sell firearms. All in a city where gun violence is
minimal. The proposed law, drafted by Councilman Chris Mears,

schools, playgrounds or city-owned buildings. In Irvine, almost every
commercial center is within a short walking distance of one or more of
those.
