>Look at how AP was used.

Mike, the main reason the Jim Bell prosecution started was his actions, not
his words.  Some of us on the list (myself included) would be majorly upset
if a stink bomb strong enough to make us vomit was used on us (upset enough
to want someone to take action against Jim Bell).  Had Jim Bell restrained
himself to speech, prosecution would have been much more difficult to start.
Not impossible, but much more difficult.

No government is going to be perfect, as they all must rely on us imperfect
humans for implementation.  However, the tradition in the United States has
been to restrain the government from doing any old thing it likes.  This
doesn't mean that our government will always be fair and just -- it just
means the tendency is strongly that way.  Most other nations are not nearly
so fortunate.  Just because we as a nation have suffered through injustices
like Ruby Ridge does not necessarily mean that we on the downward spiral to
where such cases are the norm.  It does mean, as it always has, that the
fight for justice and right must be made anew by each generation.
