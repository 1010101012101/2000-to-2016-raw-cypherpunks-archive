Good point that deserves much greater attention, drones as good
a starting point as any other evolving surveillance technology. 

Fragmentation of privacy policy and enforcement among a slew 
of stakeholders inside and outside government allows, actually 
encourages, diverse, contradictory, and evasive compliance with 
all too flatulent aspirations for privacy forever subjected to security.

The US has no fully empowered privacy commission, presumably 
to allow continuous evasion of fulfilling privacy promises deliberately 
intended to be violated on behalf of evolving, usual secret, national 
interests of government and commerce. Same old BS of putting 
government and its contractors before taxpayers.

Secrecy, both governmental and non-governmental, remains the 
biggest threat to privacy and security around the globe. Secrecy
policy is a huge mess, bloated and costly, and privacy policy
cannot compete so long as the secrecy hegemon prevails.

US Patent and Trademark Office today seeks comments on
revising policy to issue secrecy orders for "economically
significant patents." Economy as vital as WMDs.

It is apt to refer to all technologies, Google, MS, Cisco, universities,
et al, which perform the dual use of user convenience and spying 
on users. And arguments for both being necessarily linked are 
specious apologias which open the door for privacy abuse under 
guise of security, now economical -- a segue perfect for opposing
Occupy Wall Street.

An industry has grown to eploit the two sides of privacy and
security, using the wedge of secrecy to assure secrecy always
wins over privacy in the name of law enforcement and national 
security.

No privacy policy is worth a centavo due to the ever-present
flatulence about abiding with lawful requests for data access
which in turn is a cover story to hide technological access
outside the law.

Finally, it has become commonplace for technologists to
succumb to legal persuasion to lie about technological
capabilities to transgress human rights. Put a lawyer
and a technologist together and you have a duality now
ruling communications by hook and crook.
