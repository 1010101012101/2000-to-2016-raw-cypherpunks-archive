I think you're wrong about that. =C2=A0It isn't "the same spam page". =C2=
=A0Rather, it is multiple copies of what amounts to (looks like, to the hum=
an eye) the same spam page, but located at different URLs.

Again, I think you're wrong about that. =C2=A0I don't think Google has done=
 anything wrong, here. =C2=A0Rather, I think that someone else has manufact=
ured many pages which look alike to the human eye, but apparently contain h=
idden text that can be searched for and found. =C2=A0Google-search has simp=
ly catalogued the search results, including the otherwise-invisible text. =

Again, I think you're wrong. =C2=A0What I believe I have seen does not "wor=
k against" anybody, except possibly me. =C2=A0Google is simply cataloguing =
the web pages it sees, as the person (or organization) that produced those =
pages intends. =C2=A0The only negative consequence, to Google-search, is th=
at they have to catalog a few hundred kilobytes more of web-pages. =C2=A0Th=
at's no skin off Google-search's nose. =C2=A0And as far as I understand, th=

t be read by a human. =C2=A0If I knew more about the Web than I do, I would=
 probably understand how to adjust my web browser to display visibly what w=
ould otherwise be invisible text. =C2=A0The next question is, "what does th=
