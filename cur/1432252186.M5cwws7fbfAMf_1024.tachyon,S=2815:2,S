Napster Wants License to License
            By Michael Stroud

            2:00 a.m. Oct. 30, 2001 PST

             LOS ANGELES -- Napster CEO Konrad Hilbers says the
government should consider
            compulsory standards requiring music labels to license music
at a fair price if they
            don't close deals with Napster and other independent
distributors.

            "Like any other business person, I'm hesitant to bring
government in," Hilbers said.
            "But government has an obligation to set standards. If
there's no agreement, the
            government should consider compulsory licensing."

Compulsory licensing = theft, buddy.
