This modded Bergen Gasser EB remote-controlled helicopter has a handgun on
its nose. Yes. A handgun. And as you can see in the video, it can also be
fired remotely.

On its own, the Gasser EB is a mean, noisy machine. At 54 inches long, it's
equipped with a 34.5-inch (800-millimeter) blade, and a gasoline engine
powerful enough to resist the drag of a hefty handgun. Which is precisely
what the owner of this beast, Jim Simmons, added to it: A Springfield 1911-A
.45 caliber weapon.

Simmons also added a remote-controlled firing system. And if you think that's
pretty stupid because the pilot on the ground won't be able to aim, think
again: He also added a gun-sight digital camera. In other words: This is a
fully-armed mini-UAV, which you can actually use to fly anywhere, aim, and
fire at whatever target you want.

Yeah, this is exactly how documentaries about loads of dead people start. Or
maybe not people, but polar bears and elks.
