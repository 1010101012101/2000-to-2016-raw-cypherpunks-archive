HACKERS BEG BORING PEOPLE TO STOP ENCRYPTING EMAIL
Security Experts Concur Most of You Have Nothing Worth Encrypting Anyway

San Jose, Calif. (SatireWire.com) 
In an unusual worldwide appeal, the International Brotherhood of
Computer Hackers today asked particularly boring people
to please stop encrypting their emails.
		Please think of others when you encrypt
			[pictures of messages]
    		Cracking messages like this are a waste
    		of valuable hacker time, say hackers.

According to IBCH President Bjvrn Haxor, hackers spend thousands of hours 
intercepting and cracking open encrypted emails  believing it to be "the 
good stuff"  only to find most contain little more than "Two priests walk 
into a bar," or "Hi Bob, here's my new email address."

"Maybe you think hacking coded messages is simple, but it's not  well, 
except for the Microsoft Outlook ones," said Haxor. "The rest of it is a 
pain in the backdoor. So here's a tip: if you encrypt just because you want 
to keep your personal information 'secret,' but all you're encrypting is 
blather about your stupid promotion or a recipe for fruit salad, guess 
what? Your secret's already out. You're dull."
