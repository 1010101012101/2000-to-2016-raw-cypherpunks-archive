Brazil : there's now a nice 3-disc set available that includes the full
142 min. version, a bunch of commentary and extras plus the sweetened 90
min. version shown on 'murrican TV. 

Brazil is CP in the sense that the hunger of the state and marketeers
for database filler and the resultant dangers and fuckups is relevant to
privacy, information and rights issues that once were part of the the
discussion. Now it's mostly mattd and tripple-x critter sex. Not that
I'm implying any direct connection.

mattd - there's way too much of it but it's not totally devoid of
substance. The uncredited posting of someone else's work, well, that's a
big problem unless it isn't someone else's work.
