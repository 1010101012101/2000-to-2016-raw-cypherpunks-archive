In the U.S. government involvement in road, bridge, railroad and canal 
building really got its start during the early- to mid-1800s.  The Whig 
Party's platform was called, by Clay, the American System.  Today we call 
it mercantilism.  The Whigs pushed their internal improvements agenda 
(building unneeded and/or grossly overpriced roads, bridges or canals 
supplied by political contributors) across all the states in the early 
1800s.  Everywhere it was a disaster bankrupting several.  So much so that 
by 1850 all state constitutions banned internal improvement 
activities.  This was the downfall of the Whigs, but many of its leaders 
resurfaced in the Republican party whose first presidential candidate was 
Lincoln.
