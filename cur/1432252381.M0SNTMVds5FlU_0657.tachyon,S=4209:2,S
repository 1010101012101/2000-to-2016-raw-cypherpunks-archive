ACCC welcomes credit card reforms
August 27 2002
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said today it welcomed 
the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) credit card reforms.
"The ACCC has worked closely with the Reserve Bank since the designation of 
the credit card network in April 2001 and strongly believes that the 
reforms will lead to a more competitive and efficient credit card network 
in Australia," ACCC chairman Professor Allan Fels said.
"Increased competition and efficiency will be to the benefit of both 
Australian businesses and consumers."
Professor Fels said a system allowing new entrants to issue credit cards or 
provide merchant services will open up what is currently a closed shop.
