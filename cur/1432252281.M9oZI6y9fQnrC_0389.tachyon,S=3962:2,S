Ask your bank with regard to loans, for example. Once I got the info in
their computers and 'vetted' my 'reputation' to their satisfaction they
now loan me sums of money with nothing more than a drivers license & an
account number (which I only have to say) I don't even have to sign a
document.

Ask the gas station which uses the new pumps that use credit and debit
cards.

Ask your grocer about all those nifty 'discounts' if you will put yourself
in their database.

and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on ... ...

It is the LEVEL or EXTENT of the security. There is not a single state of
'security'.
