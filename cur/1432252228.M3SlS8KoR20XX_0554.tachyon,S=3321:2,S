Don't bet on it.  I was in a discussion group a week or so ago and one
lady who is super devout (of some christian sect, I'm not really sure
which one) claimed that she was always "testing her faith" every day.
It really shook me up because I have faith in testing.  Religion and
reason are not in the same universe!

My favorite response on the subject of god is "I have no need of that
hypothisis".  I forget who it's attributed to, but I think it was from the
late 1800's.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
