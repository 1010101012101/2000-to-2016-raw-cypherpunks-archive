Gambling is about assessing risk and rewards and payoffs. A person 
seeking insurance knows things about his or her health that the 
prospective insurer may not know about. Likewise, the prospective 
insurer may come to know things about the candidate.

This is the way markets in general have always worked. Economists 
talk about "preference revealing" and "selective disclosure of 
information."

In this context, if either side wishes to reveal less than required 
by the other side, it can walk away from the deal.

I can see why you have tended to not participate in this group. Keep 
it that way.
