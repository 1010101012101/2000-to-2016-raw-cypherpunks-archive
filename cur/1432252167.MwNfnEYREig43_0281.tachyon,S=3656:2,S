Kind of like using one of those ugly red lab hot air guns to dry your
hair, eh?

Definitely an honest mistake. 

Unlike the numbers quoted for available doses of smallpox vaccine which
have risen steadily from 3M to 10M as time has passed. Standing in line
for vaccination - would you like yours straight up or with soda. They
prosecute people for diluting pharmaceuticals don't they? 

Numbers bloat not quite as outrageous as the US casualty estimates that
were part of the decision making process for whether to invade Japan or
drop Uranium on it which started out as 10K and reached 1M by the time
public statements were issued.

Bye, I have to drive 300 miles home now, or is that 3000 miles? and
there are over a gazillion cars on the road.
