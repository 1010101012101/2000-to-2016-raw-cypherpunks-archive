Yes, your analysis is way off base.  
The reason is that there are much better algorithms for factoring - 
a factor of 10 difference in the number of clock cycles per step
is rapidly dwarfed by an algorithm that takes far fewer steps.

If you look at Schneier's book, there's a discussion of
factoring algorithms - Quadratic Sieve algorithms are good for
fewer that 120-150 digits, and above that there are algorithms like
the Number Field Sieve and its variants with run times of
	e**( (ln n)**(1/3) * (ln (ln n)**(2/3)) )
which is a lot fewer than trial division.

Check out Odlyzko's work on solutions to the discrete log problem.
