>From Core to Kit  by Mike Esch
How the Nios, a RISC processor on an FPGA, came to
support Linux and the GNU development tools.

alas not online at http://embedded.linuxjournal.com/magazine/issue06/

Basically he boots Linux on a soft cpu ("NIOS") which is implemented
on a reprogrammable logic device (Altera's).  First the Altera
gets configured as a NIOS (plus whatever else you want to put
on there..) then the NIOS boots a Linux build.  NIOS is a
SPARC-like 16 or 32-bit RISC w/out a MMU that Altera sells
for their chips.

Of interest here because if you can't read it you can't trust it; now
you can use GNUtools on a CPU you can read. Also for embedded crypto
system developers in general.
