There are movie critics who'd *like* to block you from seeing some movies,
and if you're under 17 they're somewhat successful at it (or under 13 at 
least.)
And there are critics who make sure that some movie *scenes* don't get shown.
And movie critics like Rudy Guiliani who block some kinds of movie theaters
from at least some parts of their cities.

And there are movie critics who have enough influence on the market
that movies they pan don't stay on the market as long as they
might otherwise, so you might miss a movie because of that.

And that doesn't even count the movie critics who decide that
some movies not commercial enough so they don't get made.
