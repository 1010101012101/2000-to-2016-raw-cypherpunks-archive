Question: What kind of filter do you use in your Java pot?

Answer:   A Bloom filter.


Lucrative is in SourceForge, awaiting use by anyone clever enough to seize
it. In the meantime, I am putting a lot of effort into finding permanent
employment, so updates are coming quite slowly. Anyone who wants quicker
action on Lucrative--the source is out there.


Lucratively,

Patrick
