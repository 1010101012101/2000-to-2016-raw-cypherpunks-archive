Obama calls out encryption in terror strategy speech

President wants 'high-tech leaders to make it harder for terrorists to
use technology to escape from justice'

7 Dec 2015 at 05:20, Simon Sharwood

United States President Barack Obama has given just his third Address
to the Nation from behind his desk at the Oval Office, to deliver a
speech in which he all-but-called-on the technology industry to allow
access to encrypted communications.

The main purpose of the speech was to offer a response to last week's
killings in San Bernadino.  Obama said investigations have found “no
evidence that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization
overseas, or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home”
but did label "an act of terrorism" committed by people who "... had
gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted
interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the
West."

The speech goes on to say that "as the Internet erases the distance
between countries, we see growing efforts by terrorists to poison the
minds of people like the Boston Marathon bombers and the San
Bernardino killers."

Obama therefore explains the USA's immediate response to terrorism and
particularly to ISIL, including military and diplomatic efforts, plus
some restrictions on the right to purchase firearms and stronger
screening of some visitors to America.

Future actions, Obama said, will include an attempt to "urge high-tech
and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use
technology to escape from justice."

The sentence isn't explained, but seems a clear reference to the
technology industry's argument that encryption is essential for
everyday life and therefore ought not to be equipped with back doors
for government use.

The term "escape from justice" also invokes a New York Times op-ed
titled When Phone Encryption Blocks Justice.  Penned by Manhattan
district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr, Paris chief prosecutor François
Molins, commissioner of the City of London Police Adrian Leppard and
chief prosecutor of the High Court of Spain Javier Zaragoza, the piece
argued that "The new encryption policies of Apple and Google have made
it harder to protect people from crime."

Similar arguments emerged after the November 13th Paris attacks, when
it was widely argued that the attacks may have been detected, and
prevented, if law enforcement agencies had access to backdoors
allowing easier and wider surveillance of encrypted communications
services.

Obama's speech is something of a reversal, as he's previously resisted
calls for access to encrypted communications.  Hillary Clinton,
however, has called for Silicon Valley to "develop solutions that will
both keep us safe and protect our privacy," adding that "Now is the
time to solve this problem, not after the next attack."  Clinton's
remarks were made in the days between the Paris and San Bernardino
incidents.
