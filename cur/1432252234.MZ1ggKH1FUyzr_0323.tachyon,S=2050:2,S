New Company Pick for November
Monumental Marketing Inc (MNUM.OB)

OTCBB: MNUM.OB
Firstly to inform you there is a huge PR campaign starting today.

Secondly this is not a fly by night company.

It provides great prospects for investors, provides filings with EDGAR Online.

And is well on its way to the NASDAQ.

Monumental Marketing Owns 100% of Safer-t 
SAFER-T has been established to develop and launch new products and technologies in the Homeland security category, both in the private and professional sectors.


Background
Less than Lethal Weapons ( LTLW) provide a more effective and safer option in situations where force is necessary, but lethal force is not warranted or appears unjustified. 

The markets for LTLW are being driven by the roll-out of new technologies, regulatory pressures to use methods which reduce risk to offenders' lives and continuing high levels of crime and personal violence. Another major factor is increased awareness of security issues following 9/11.

This is a market thats always going to be booming. This is great buy at $.95.

Read the reports and get a piece of MNUM before it takes off.
