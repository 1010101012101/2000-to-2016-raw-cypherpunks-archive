We need to look at the text of this in more detail.  This is from
version 1.1b of the spec:

: This section introduces the architectural aspects of a Trusted Platform
: that enable the collection and reporting of integrity metrics.
:
: Among other things, a Trusted Platform enables an entity to determine
: the state of the software environment in that platform and to SEAL data
: to a particular software environment in that platform.
:
: The entity deduces whether the state of the computing environment in
: that platform is acceptable and performs some transaction with that
: platform. If that transaction involves sensitive data that must be
: stored on the platform, the entity can ensure that that data is held in
: a confidential format unless the state of the computing environment in
: that platform is acceptable to the entity.
:
: To enable this, a Trusted Platform provides information to enable the
: entity to deduce the software environment in a Trusted Platform. That
: information is reliably measured and reported to the entity. At the same
: time, a Trusted Platform provides a means to encrypt cryptographic keys
: and to state the software environment that must be in place before the
: keys can be decrypted.

What this means is that a remote system can query the local TPM and
find out what software has been loaded, in order to decide whether to
send it some data.  It's not that unapproved software "won't work",
it's that the remote guy can decide whether to trust it.

Also, as stated earlier, data can be sealed such that it can only be
unsealed when the same environment is booted.  This is the part above
about encrypting cryptographic keys and making sure the right software
environment is in place when they are decrypted.

But no, the TCPA does allow all software to run.  Just because a remote
system can decide whether to send it some data doesn't mean that software
can't run.  And just because some data may be inaccessible because it
was sealed when another OS was booted, also doesnt mean that software
can't run.

I think we agree on the facts, here.  All software can run, but the TCPA
allows software to prove its hash to remote parties, and to encrypt data
such that it can't be decrypted by other software.  Would you agree that
this is an accurate summary of the functionality, and not misleading?

If so, I don't see how you can get from this to saying that some software
won't run.  You might as well say that encryption means that software
can't run, because if I encrypt my files then some other programs may
not be able to read them.

Most people, as you may have seen, interpret this part about "software
can't run" much more literally.  They think it means that software needs
a signature in order to be loaded and run.  I have been going over and
over this on sci.crypt.  IMO the facts as stated two paragraphs up are
completely different from such a model.

That's true; in fact if you ran it earlier under TCPA and sealed some
data, you will have to run under TCPA to unseal it later.  The question
is whether the advantages of running under TCPA (potentially greater
security) outweigh the disadvantages (greater potential for loss of
data, less flexibility, etc.).

Right, the strongest case will probably be for DRM.  You might be able
to download all kinds of content if you are running an OS and application
that the server (content provider) trusts.  People will have a choice of
using TCPA and getting this data legally, or avoiding TCPA and trying to
find pirated copies as they do today.

I am inclined to agree; in fact I have made many postings (anonymously
of course) in recent weeks arguing that these systems will be entirely
voluntary.  If the functionality is useful, people will use it.
Software vendors who use TCPA will compete with those who don't.
The market will decide.  I am not as certain as you that TCPA will win,
but if it does, it will mean that TCPA is a good technology that solves
real problems for people.

The points I made earlier were that TCPA is unlikely to be mandated,
because it doesn't need to be; that TCPA should compete in the free
market with other solutions; and that this approach actually expands the
set of choices available to the participants.  More choice is always good.

Well, you would use TCPA.  But you have to look at how you got into that
situation.  The way it would have happened was by people voluntarily
adopting TCPA before it became a de facto standard, simply because it
was useful.

I have no credentials in this area other than a general knowledge of
crypto; I am just someone who was willing to devote some hours of his
free time to educating himself on this technology.  I agree that the
spec is written very poorly.

But let me put you on the spot: as someone who has a good
understanding of TCPA, what do you think of Ross Anderson's TCPA FAQ
at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tcpa-faq.html?  For example,
how about his claim in answer 2, "Pirate software can be detected and
deleted remotely."  I must have missed that page of the TCPA spec.
And then he builds on this a couple of paragraphs later: "There will
be remote censorship: the mechanisms designed to delete pirated music
under remote control may be used to delete documents that a court (or
a software company) has decided are offensive...."  He further builds
on this later to claim (answer 11) that with TCPA, programs can be made
to ignore documents created by pirated versions of Word, etc.  All this
has so little to do with anything related to TCPA that it boggles my mind.

And then in answer 12 we're back to the claim that TCPA can stop computers
from booting.  Saddam better not buy a TCPA computer or the U.S. will
render it inoperative, using a "serial number revocation list", according
to the FAQ.  Are you aware of any such capability in TCPA?  I didn't see
any such data structure.

Ross Anderson means well, and so does David Wagner.  But in the long
run it hurts the credibility of critics when they make exaggerated and
unfounded claims.
