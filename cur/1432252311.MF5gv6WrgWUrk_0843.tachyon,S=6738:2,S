VERY URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION

DEAR SIR,

IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT (USD 26 MILLION DOLLARS) FROM
OUR BANK. I HAVE THE COURAGE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK FOR A
RELIABLE AND HONEST PERSON WHO WILL BE CAPABLE FOR
THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NEVER
LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN FUTURE.

I AM MR. SOLOMON BALOGUN THE EASTERN DISTRICT BANK
MANAGER OF
UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC. (UBA). THERE IS AN ACCOUNT
OPENED IN THIS BANK IN 1980 AND SINCE 1990
NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN. AFTER GOING
THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS I DISCOVERED
THAT IF I DO NOT REMITT THIS MONEY OUT URGENTLY IT
WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MR. SMITH B. ANDREAS, A
FOREIGNER, AND THE MANAGER OF PETRO – TECHNICAL
SUPPORT SERVICES, A CHEMICAL ENGINEER BY PROFESSION
AND  HE DIED SINCE 1990. NO OTHER PERSON KNOWS ABOUT
THIS ACCOUNT OR ANY THING CONCERNING IT, THE ACCOUNT
HAS NO OTHER BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION PROVED
TO ME AS WELL THAT THIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT AND THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (USD 26
MILLION DOLLARS). I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A
SAFE FOREIGNERS ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON’T KNOW ANY
FOREIGNER, I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER
BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO A LOCAL BANK
HERE, BUT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT
BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN US DOLLARS AND THE FORMER
OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS MR. SMITH B. ANDREAS IS  A
FOREIGNER TOO.  I KNOW THAT THIS MASSAGE WILL COME TO
YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE  DON’T KNOW OUR SELVES BEFORE,
BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I

WILL INFORM YOU THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE URGENTLY. SEND

THE FULL DETAILS OF THE ACCOUNT TO BE USED FOR THE
DEPOSIT.

I WANT US TO MEET FACE TO FACE OR SIGN A BINDING
AGREEMENT TO BIND US TOGETHER SO THAT YOU CAN RECIEVE
THIS MONEY INTO A FORIEGN ACCOUNT OR ANY ACCOUNT OF
YOUR CHOICE WHERE THE FUND WILL BE SAFE. AND I WILL
FLY TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR WITHDRAWAL AND SHARING AND
OTHER INVESTMENTS.

 I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO INVOLVE A
FOREIGNER WITH FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND FOREIGN
BENEFICIARY. I NEED YOUR FULL CO-OPERATION TO MAKE
THIS WORK FINE. BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT IS READY TO
APPROVE THIS PAYMENT TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS CORRECT
INFORMATION OF THIS ACCOUNT, WHICH I WILL GIVE TO YOU
LATER IMMEDIATELY, IF YOU ARE ABLE AND WITH CAPABILITY
TO HANDLE SUCH AMOUNT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST
ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND ADVICE FOR OUR MUTUAL
BENEFIT BECAUSE THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL NEVER COME AGAIN
IN MY LIFE. I NEED TRUTHFUL PERSON IN THIS BUSINESS
BECAUSE I DON’T WANT TO MAKE MISTAKE I NEED YOUR
STRONG ASSURANCE AND TRUST.

WITH MY POSITION NOW IN THE OFFICE I CAN TRANSFER THIS
MONEY TO ANY FOREIGNER’S RELIABLE ACCOUNT WHICH YOU
CAN PROVIDE WITH ASSURANCE THAT THIS MONEY WILL BE
INTACT PENDING MY PHYSICAL ARRIVAL IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR
SHARING. I WILL DESTROY ALL DOCUMENTS OF TRANSACTION
IMMEDIATELY WE RECIEVE THIS MONEY LEAVING NO TRACE TO
ANY PLACE. YOU CAN ALSO COME TO DISCUSS WITH ME FACE
TO FACE AFTER WHICH I WILL MAKE THIS REMITTANCE IN
YOUR PRESENCE AND TWO OF US WILL FLY TO YOUR COUNTRY
AT LEAST TWO DAYS AHEAD OF THE MONEY GOING INTO THE
ACCOUNT.

I WILL APPLY FOR ANNUAL LEAVE TO GET VISA IMMEDIATELY
I HEAR FROM YOU THAT YOU ARE READY TO ACT AND RECEIVE
THIS FUND IN YOUR ACCOUNT. I WILL USE MY POSITION AND
INFLUENCE TO EFFECT LEGAL APPROVALS AND ONWARD
TRANSFER OF THIS MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH
APPROPRIATE CLEARANCE FORMS OF THE MINISTRIES AND
FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS.

AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS BUSINESS, YOU WILL BE GIVEN
35% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT, 60% WILL BE FOR ME, WHILE 5%
WILL BE FOR EXPENSES BOTH PARTIES MIGHT HAVE INCURED
DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERING.

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EARLIEST REPLY BY FAX ONLY.
