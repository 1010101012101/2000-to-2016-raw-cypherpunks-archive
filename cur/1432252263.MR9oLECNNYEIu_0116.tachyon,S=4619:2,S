Here's an excerpt on circumvention devices:

Article 6
Obligations as to technological measures

1. Member States shall provide adequate legal protection 
against the circumvention of any effective technological 
measures, which the person concerned carries out in the 
knowledge, or with reasonable grounds to know, that he 
or she is pursuing that objective.

2. Member States shall provide adequate legal protection 
against the manufacture, import, distribution, sale, rental, 
advertisement for sale or rental, or possession for 
commercial purposes of devices, products or components 
or the provision of services which:

(a) are promoted, advertised or marketed for the purpose 
of circumvention of, or

(b) have only a limited commercially significant purpose 
or use other than to circumvent, or

(c) are primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed 
for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of,
any effective technological measures.

3. For the purposes of this Directive, the expression 'technological 
measures' means any technology, device or component that, in 
the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or 
restrict acts, in respect of works or other subject-matter, 
which are not authorised by the rightholder of any copyright 
or any right related to copyright as provided for by law or the 
sui generis right provided for in Chapter III of Directive 96/9/EC. 
Technological measures shall be deemed 'effective' where the 
use of a protected work or other subject-matter is controlled 
by the rightholders through application of an access control or 
protection process, such as encryption, scrambling or other 
transformation of the work or other subject-matter or a copy 
control mechanism, which achieves the protection objective.
