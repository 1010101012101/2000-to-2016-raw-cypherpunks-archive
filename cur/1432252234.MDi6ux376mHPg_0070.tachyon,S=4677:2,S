Hmm. So, please send me your noise filter. I could do with one.

The list I'm writing to is not censored, AFAIK.

Actually, they're really about geometry, though there are some kinds of
topology which can support geodesics (not the standard rubber-sheet kind
most people are familiar with, though). For example, a graph can support
the notion of a shortest distance between two points, and that is
definitely a topological entity.

This is an email, not an article. Is it tacky and rude to copy to a list
to which you'd prefer I didn't reply? I think so. Is it polite to
include all recipients in a mail to which you reply? I think so.

Cheers,
