Matts monetarism is an advance on Milton Friedmans;Everyone a mint means 
the govt no longer has to keep a tight fist on the money supply.Its supply 
of money is rapidly depleted as no taxes come in.All attempts to collect 
tax meeting stiff resistance ranging from civil and passive disobedience 
all the way up to the disappearance's of several highly placed IRS 
agents.I'm confident enough now to offer 100,000,000$ BUMs or US dollars 
for the head of GWB.While the remailer threads been interesting,the fact 
that one of the very first in would be Soprano waste management's APster 
for hitmen.
Fascist celebrities,crypto-fascists,the entire oligarchy would be wiped out 
almost overnight.Where the hell are they going to fly to that's not online? 
Funny if they all wound up in Afghanistan.Might help the local economy 
recover.The mexican wave of crypto-anarchy will sweep all nations before 
it.When you see the lungs of America collapse and the life pass out of the 
last empire,who will stand against that power?Everyone with a computer is a 
remailer.Everyone can become a mint with the knowledge that 
reputations,financial especially,will be measured in negative terms such as 
AP nominations.Such is life.


Cruel are the times when we are traitors
and do not know ourselves;When we hold rumor
from what we fear,yet know not what we fear,
but float upon a wild and violent sea
each way...and none.
Macbeth.
