a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled ca||s from any telephone, not just

button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine

high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2OO,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2O05. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi||iken GMBH
