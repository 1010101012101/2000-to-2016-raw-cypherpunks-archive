You can trust anything I say about Math or Programming (especially 
AI and LISP programming -- ie, my job).  A lot of my "rants" in 
fields like architecture, state government, etc, come from situations 
in Kansas, many of which do not apply to California, and I need to 
think twice before speaking once.  Much of the rest (including GPS 
chips in cell phones "within the next couple of years," heard a couple 
of years ago) is gleaned from mainstream media and evidently has its 
share of distortions.

An aside -- Contractors are now building uninsulated homes in Kansas 
(a climate where temperatures range from about 110 fahrenheit to 
-3 fahrenheit over the course of an average year) on floodplains, 
with slab foundations, not even buttressed down to the heave line 
and with no provision for airflow to mediate temperature - and 
people are buying them!  This monumental stupidity was a feature 
of the circus of fools around me for many years, and is still 
where my mind goes by reflex action whenever I hear about electricity 
supply difficulties, power costs and escalating home insurance prices -- 
however irrelevant it may be to the situation in California.  

California, it seems, has its own set of completely different acts 
in the circus of fools, and I'm still learning them....
