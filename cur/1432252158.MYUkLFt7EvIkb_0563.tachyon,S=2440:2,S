A writer for the Voice ( if I heard it correctly ) talked about a
computer captured in Manila that was supposedly used by Ramzi Yousef. He
said that there were documents that described hijacking planes and
flying them into prominent buildings.

This information was turned over to the FBI in 1995 or 1996.

I hope with expanded powers for surveillance and searches that they can
gather better information and shorten the analysis period.
