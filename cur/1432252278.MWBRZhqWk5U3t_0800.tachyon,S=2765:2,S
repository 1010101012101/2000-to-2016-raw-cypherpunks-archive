At the gathering in the Sierras I mentioned, there were many interesting 
things revealed.

One was a map of thousands of "open" communications channels over 
wireless links, e.g., 802.11b--just in the Bay Area. In use by 
government agencies, even security firms doing police state work. It was 
interesting to see what a Yagi antenna mounted in a truck or on a good  
hilltop could do for harvesting tens of thousands of passphrases and 
slurping down gigabytes of files.

The government agencies are filled with incompetents.
