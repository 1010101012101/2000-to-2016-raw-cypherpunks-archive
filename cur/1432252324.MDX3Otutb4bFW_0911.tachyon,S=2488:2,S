I hate to play clipping service, but this story is too important not to
mention.  Many top Greek officials, including the Prime Minister, and
the U.S. embassy had their mobile phones tapped.  What makes this
interesting is how it was done: software was installed on the switch
that diverted calls to a prepaid phone.  Think about who could manage
that.
