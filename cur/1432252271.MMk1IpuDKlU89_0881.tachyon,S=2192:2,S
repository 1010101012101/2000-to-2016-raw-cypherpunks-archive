There are issues at play here: loss of subscribers due to spam flood
on the unfiltered nodes (public archives were full of noise), and the
general decline of email communication due to a culture shift (new
kids do SMS, IM and web fora, not email).

There are some well-managed lists full of oldtimers which manage
to do just fine, though.
