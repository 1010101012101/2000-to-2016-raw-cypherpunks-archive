What a pussy thing to say.

As for Aimee's posts, I've seen nothing of substance. I've seen her, 
or it, post a bunch of trolls, a lot of spam, some kind of 
"Cypherpunks I.Q. Test" junk, and some plaintive squeals about how 
the List doesn't appreciate the natterings of a confused, 
PMS-stricken, impoverished Texas shyster.
