    No, but I did spend 20 years of my life working outside all day, the last 15
of those as a logger in north of Lk. Superior in MN. Awesome bugs.

   True. I did lose an awful lot of sled dog puppys and other animals (baby
goats and rabbits) and get very sick myself from tick-borne Lyme's disease tho,
before they knew what it even was, but I don't advocate chemical spraying for
deer ticks.

  Yah, well, for as much good as it did me. Spent 8 days at Mayo and they didn't
have a clue, wasn't diagnosed until two years later, two years of being pretty
much totally disabled.
