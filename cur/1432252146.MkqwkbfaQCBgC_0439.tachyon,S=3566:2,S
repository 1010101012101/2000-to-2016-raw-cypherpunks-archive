A friend of mine was in the Air Force, and one of his buddies had
put down as a reference on his security clearance application
the job he'd had at the corner candy store growing up in the Bronx.
The D.I.S. folks freaked because the candy store owner
denied knowing him, he'd seen nothing, didn't know nothing,
never hearda da guy.  He had to have his father go back to the
store owner and say, hey, it's ok, it's just my kid in the Air Force,
they're not regular cops, and they really don't care about the
numbers game in the back....
