It is in fact required of US entities.

There are two issues here.

If you are a non-resident alien (an "NRA" - I've always loved that
term) you can sign a W-8 stating that you are an NRA and that you are
not required to have a TIN or SSN.  That takes care of you from that
angle and by definition you don't need a number.

The more difficult element is the "know your customer" rule where
such a signing doesn't really prove anything.  At the end of the day,
the bank - and more specifically an individual banker is personally
liable (the "banker goes to jail" principal) - is required both to
assert that they know the customer and in the event of untoward
activity, which is rather broadly defined, report such activity to
the authorities if it is discovered or !!! should have been
discovered !!! - This latter principal IMO is the one that creates
the extreme level of conservative behavior in the US.
