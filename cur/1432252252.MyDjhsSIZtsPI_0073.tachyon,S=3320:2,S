Well, perhaps your comment was made entirely toungue-in-cheek, but I still 
think you're missing the point.

The point is this: Almost and "side" in this world that has committed or 
commits atrocities can find a true-believing apolegist. And in most cases 
the best of these can concoct an answer to anything you throw at him. As far 
as I'm concerned, that's the whole point of going through this excersize 
(ie, of finding a way to rationalize pretty much ANY form of 
violence/terrorism.) The danger comes when a nation (ie, the guys who 
control the guns) is run by the apolegists, or people who hold similar 
viewpoints.

Put in another way, just because you really really REALLY believe you are 
right doesn't give anyone the right to create huge amounts of turmoil and 
death in someone else's country.
