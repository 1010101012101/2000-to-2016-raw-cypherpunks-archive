No wonder some of these poor kids crack...
I need some help
by Patches Nilnoc Sat Aug 24 10:48:55 PDT 2002
Yesterday at school i was wearing a shirt with a patch that had a flag 
burning on it and it was confiscated. The dean also made my roll up my 
pants because they had an anarchy symbol on them. I want to know if I could 
press charges for trying to stifle my beliefs. Any help would be apprecieated.

There are some responses but no real offer of help to sue the shit out of 
the school.
