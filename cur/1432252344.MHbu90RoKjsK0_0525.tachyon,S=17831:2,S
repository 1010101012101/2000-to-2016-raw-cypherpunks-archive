 =0A=0A=0AJoe, the only reason that the price of cloud storage would fall i=
s if demand for cloud storage falls. The value of cloud storage over time s=
hould be fairly stable, perhaps not as stable as today's US dollar but cert=
ainly more stable than bitcoin is today.=0A=0ABut in the case of tulips, bi=
tcoins, etc., their stability was only derived from their speculative value=
. Bread will be reasonable stable, because people don't speculate in bread.=
 Bread has a minimum price, because there is a limited supply and a clearly=
 defined need. All commodities are not equal. Bitcoin is one of the worst I=
 can imagine, but the tulips during tulipmania take the cake.=0A=0AI believ=
e you can regulate cloud storage in a way that prevents fraudsters from man=
ipulating it. The only assumption I need is that the majority of the networ=
k is honest. You can use hashing + random strings to confirm that a person =
still has the file they are hosting. You only need then to be sure that the=
 person hosting the file and the person uploading the file are not in cahoo=
ts. You can achieve that by making a random mapping between people and host=
s, and only picking the host after a person has announced how much file sto=
rage they wish to rent (and paid for the first month). This makes it too ex=
pensive to host files on your own machines, because you have a very low pro=
bability of getting the opportunity to store a file on your own machine.=0A=
