           Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems 2001
                                 (CHES 2001)
                         http://www.chesworkshop.org

				Paris - France
			       May 13 - 16, 2001

                            First Call for Papers

General Information

The focus of this workshop is on all aspects of cryptographic
hardware and embedded system design. The workshop will be a forum of
new results from the research community as well as from the industry.
Of special interest are contributions that describe new methods for
efficient hardware implementations and high-speed software for
embedded systems, e.g., smart cards, microprocessors, DSPs, etc. We
hope that the workshop will help to fill the gap between the
cryptography research community and the application areas of
cryptography. Consequently, we encourage submission from academia,
industry, and other organizations. All submitted papers will be
reviewed.

This will be the third CHES workshop. The first workshop, CHES '99,
was held at WPI in August of 1999 and was very well received by
academia and industry. There were 170 participants, more than half of
which were from outside the United States. The second workshop, CHES
2000, was also held at WPI in August of 2000 and had an attendance of
180.

The third workshop, CHES 2001, will be held in Paris in May of 2001.  The
topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * Computer architectures for public-key cryptosystems
   * Computer architectures for secret-key cryptosystems
   * Reconfigurable computing and applications in cryptography
   * Cryptographic processors and co-processors
   * Modular and Galois field arithmetic architectures
   * Tamper resistance on the chip and board level
   * Smart card attacks and architectures
   * Efficient algorithms for embedded processors
   * Special-purpose hardware for cryptanalysis
   * Fast network encryption
   * True and pseudo random number generators
   * Cryptography in wireless applications


Instructions for Authors

Authors are invited to submit original papers. The preferred submission form
is by electronic mail to ches@ece.orst.edu. Papers should be formatted in
12pt type and not exceed 12 pages (not including the title page and the
bibliography). The title page should contain the author's name, address
(including email address and an indication of the corresponding author), an
abstract, and a small list of key words. Please submit the paper in
Postscript or PDF. We recommend that you generate the PS or PDF file using
LaTeX, however, MS Word is also acceptable. All submissions will be
refereed.

Only original research contributions will be considered. Submissions must
not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors have published
elsewhere or have submitted in parallel to any other conferences or
workshops that have proceedings.


Important Dates

 Submission Deadline:          February 15th, 2001.
 Acceptance Notification:      March	31st, 2001.
 Final Version due:            April	21st, 2001.
 Workshop:                     May      13th - 16th, 2001.

NOTE: The CHES dates May 13th - 16th are Sunday - Wednesday
succeeding Eurocrypt 2001 which ends on Thursday, May 10th.
