I also own a Para-Ordnance P10, a subcompact 1911 variant with a
3-inch barrel, a 2 finger grip (unless you have the Pearce magazine
floorplates with the pinkie rest) and a 10-round magazine. I am fond
of it, and can shoot approximately 2" groups with it at 10 yards. I
think it would be a decent choice for general self-defense, but I
wouldn't really want to use it against an armored opponent since a
.45 ACP's relatively low velocity and large frontal area equate to
poor armor penetration. It is certainly lighter and more concealable
than my Desert Eagle, though.

Of course a MAK-90 with a 75-round drum has merit in a scenario
involving armored home invaders...

I'ma M1911 man myself. I have fired this weapon in question
and found it quite agreeable. I was pretty amazed. I thought
they were just toys for rich kids. 

However, if you need a rifle, take a rifle. 

For the bulk of that thing, might was well carry
a carbine.
