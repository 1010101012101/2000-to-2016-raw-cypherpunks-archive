I don't think that anti-nymity is a bias, it's just an unfortunate side
effect. Most consumers want single sign-on. Microsoft wants to give it to
them. If you don't like it, you can always get the same effect by using a nym
and those nifty prepaid Amex cards you can buy at 7-11.

Interesting piece on CNET:

A telling highlight:

It's that "single online identity" part that chafes me.  A pretty clear 
anti-nymity bias, as MS forges ahead in tying ones online 
presence irrevocably to their meatspace identity.
