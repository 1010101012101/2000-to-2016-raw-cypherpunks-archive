Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only
part of the way there. It's fine for small, static sites, blogs, and small
chat rooms, but the mail and ID services are each controlled by one
individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.

As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,
since it would be criminally negligent for a hosting provider to use the
same key across all its machines.
