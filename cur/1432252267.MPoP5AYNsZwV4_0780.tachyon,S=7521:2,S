afaik, some people tracked down silk road, because they don't use
anonymization for bitcoin.

you can request some really small amount of money from silkroad to
your bitcoin address repeatedly, and then try to find their node in
p2p bitcoin network by heuriatics, based on how fast the information
comes from each node (the faster ones->closer to actual silkroad
node).

I heard it could be tracked this way and is in Netherlands ;)

anyway the moral of the story is to use bitcoin also with tor
