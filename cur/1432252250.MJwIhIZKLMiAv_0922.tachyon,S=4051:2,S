Lets just say, check out the staff list and 'reasoning' at 

http://www.mediafusion-llc.com ... 

I doubt all would be classified military ppl with a scapegoat engineer if
there wasnt a reason... 

Also 'inductive thrust {capacator/generator/etc}' might be an effective
search?

Note that em fields on power lines are significantly stronger, yet very
similar to those found around all physical objects, such as the earth,
etc... Relevance?
