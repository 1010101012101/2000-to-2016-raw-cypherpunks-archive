The First Amendment is quite clear about prior restraint and 
censorship. Not only is it legal for "The Progressive" to publish 
details of how to make a hydrogen bomb, and for the "New York Times" to 
publish the Pentagon Papers, but it is legal to publish SS numbers when 
they become available.

Now civil actions are another can of worms, and Bill Gates, for 
example, may sue somebody for publishing his SS number. Or I may sue 
the U.S. Marshal's Service for illegally using my SS number as a legal 
ID (which my SS card, still in my possession from when I got it in 
1969) says is to be used for tax and Social Security purposes ONLY and 
MAY NOT be used for identifcation) and letting it circulate over the 
Net.

But such civil suits--by Gates, by cops, by me--are NOT the same as 
prior restraint on publishing words.

(Though of course this is only the _theory_. The fact that all of the 
Bill of Rights, except perhaps the Third, have been violated by the 
Evildoers in government is well-known.)
