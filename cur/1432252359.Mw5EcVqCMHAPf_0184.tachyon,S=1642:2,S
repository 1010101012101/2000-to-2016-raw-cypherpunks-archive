Saw this in an editorial: "Sure, technically, it's stealing. But so is
dubbing a tape, which we all did back when cassette tapes were all the
rage. "
http://www.thenews-messenger.com/news/stories/20030911/localnews/239711.html

It is unfortunate that the RIAA's terrorism has caused people to forget
their
rights, established in law and precedent, to "dub tapes" and time-shift
broadcasts.
This is a form of "chilling effects".  Its akin to "cops" type shows
illustrating
sheeple consenting to searches they needn't agree to ---it teaches
uncivic
unAmerican behavior to the clueless.
