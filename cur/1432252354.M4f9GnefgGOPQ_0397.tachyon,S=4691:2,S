Okay - it DEFINITELY isn't a military force for Geneva purposes. How's
that? You're welcome to your definition, but it won't wash here.

We definitely differ here, and I disrespectfully submit that your line
of reasoning is that of a terrorist: who is not for me is against me. By
that "logic" everyone is fair game. And of course that's the purpose of
the doctrine: to justify murder.

My reasoning is simpler and less legalistic than that which you impute
top me. Murder is a crime. These guys conspired to commit murder, and
did so. They are criminals, and associated in crime; therefore they are
a criminal association.

Nonsense. No reasonable definition of criminal conduct would put the US
government and al-Quaeda in the same category.
