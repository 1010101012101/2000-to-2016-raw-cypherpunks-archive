Sounds interesting,

They are basically trying to reintroduce the "born secret" principle, 
which in US law exists only in an unchallenged part of the Atomic Energy 
Act; though that concept has not been tested against First Amendment 
rights as the only previous case of note (United States v. The 
Progressive, 1979) was dropped by the Government before it reached the 
Supreme Court.

But it's "born again secret" as well as "born secret, again" - it 
applies to all previous technical data, whether widely disseminated or not.
