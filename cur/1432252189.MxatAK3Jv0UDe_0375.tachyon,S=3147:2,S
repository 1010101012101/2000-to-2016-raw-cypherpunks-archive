While I find it difficult to discount the examples of path dependence so
glibly, this begs the question.

Even if path dependence occurs, there is no reason why the government (or
any other body) is in a significantly better position to pick the winners
and losers than the market is. When a standard evolves, it is useful that
the government keep one party from locking out others from access to the
standard, but not determining what the standard should be.
