Herald,

thank you for the kind consideration of our work.

How many images are posted to Usenet every day? I'd say around 50,000
a day, including GIF images and other image file types that we did not
look at [1].

Which USENET archive that stores a full feed from the time before
steganography suddenly hit the limelight of the press would you use?
We had access to a couple of Terra bytes accounting for a few months
of Usenet activity.  Thats what we looked at.

You might have heard that Usenet traffic is mostly for binary data.
That is correct but most of the binary traffic is not in images [2].

If you have any suggestions on how to increase the scope of our
analysis, I would be glad to hear them.  Alternatively, you might
conduct a study yourself as I just released most of my tools.  It
would be interesting to see something more "statistically significant" ;)

Regards,
  Niels Provos.
