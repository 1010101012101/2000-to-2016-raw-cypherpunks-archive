Welcome to the Simply-Spiritual & Wolfsongenchantment Newsletter!

http://www.Simply-Spiritual.com and http://www.wolfsongenchantment.com and have collaborated to become the new owners of the psychicbookstore.com newsletter!

We are two websites metaphysically oriented with access to much of the same information that you received from Psychic Bookstore but will be adding much more over the next few weeks and months to come!  Please visit both of our sites to familiarize yourself with our present services offered and stay with us throughout  the Fall of 2001 and see what exciting and diverse plans we have in store for you!  You can join our individual mailing lists by clicking on our website links at the bottom of this newsletter.  Both websites have some really comprehensive information shared in newsletters pertaining to spiritual evolution. Hopefully you will visit both of our websites in the very near future and get your email addresses incorporated with both websites enabling you to be in free drawings each month for psychic readings etc.

In this issue of the newsletter, we're addressing past lives. 

My angels have been telling me, that I need to enlighten, and share with you on past life lessons. We are All spirit beings within, and to better understand. spirit has "eternal life".
The experiences we go through from life-time to life-time are lessons for us.
We have all pretty much have had flash backs,or mini dreams of certain incidents related to another century, or experience an emotion that relates to some other time. We also, at times continue where we left off from some of those memories in the past, as it may be like an unfinished diary.
Like a haunting from the past, we bring with us our fears, knowledge, talent, personality, etc. The recalls can help us to better understand who we are and enhance or repair some of our life choices in this life.
Cellular memory is a physical memory that the body has stored from birth, Cellular memory does not create, it relies on  the experiences within, in this life time from birth through this life.
Spirit memory are collective memories from all lives we have lived and has a powerful influence over us. Spirit memory creates from life-time to life-time to be continuous.
It is in our awareness, as to how we evaluate who we are. Since the beginning of time the age old question, "who are we" and "where do we come from"
Our physical bodies are carbon based, however, another intervention has to take place, in order to make us exist. The spirit enters the "body" at birth. We then become independent of those around us through all the knowledge we have accumulated from the past lives. Depending on those experiences gives us the level we are in, in this life. whether we have gone through 10-100 pasts, is the degree of knowledge based on those recurrences.
We are constantly being made aware every day of our "spirit-within" (that sorta "gut" feeling) telling us and often reminding us, right from wrong, decisions, knowledge, love and etc. Unfortunately, we become over influenced by our cellular memory through birth in this life time and this feeling and or feelings, add confusion.
As we are evolving and allowing our true spirits emerge, we become more intuitive, and find inner contentment to that knowledge.
Right now the emergence is very strong and the search is on for our "soul-mates". Spirit within can not feel whole till we are rejoined with our other half.
Some very lucky ones, have had the joyful reunion and they feel total and complete.
The time is now to learn and allow your "spirit-self" to manifest in your daily lives.
Tossing out all preconceived memory on the cellular level created from birth in this life time, and allow your true beauty (spirit) emerge.
The vibrations are changing around us on this earth, as it continues to do so, we are also vibrating to a higher level.
Just as we have read about our history and ancestors, evolution was going on then as now. We are still making history. This evolution is forever expanding.
To enlighten, Angels are "light bodies" of all knowledge (old-souls) who have evolved where they no longer need a physical body to make their presence known to us. We all have that within us to become an angel.
Embrace, this era we are now entering into. It is a life changing experience for all.
Your angels are watching, so "STOP, LOOK, AND LISTEN"
