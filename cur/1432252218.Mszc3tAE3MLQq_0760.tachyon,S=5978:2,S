>>  Subject: Computer Experts Question National ID Schemes
>>
>>  For Immediate Release: December 17, 2001
>>  For More Information: Susan Evoy, cpsr@cpsr.org,
>>  650-322-3778
>>
>>  COMPUTER EXPERTS QUESTION NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION SCHEMES
>>
>>  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
>>  a twenty year old international association of computer experts,
>>  released an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) explaining and
>>  critiquing recent proposals to create national identification
>>  schemes (NIDS) in the United States, Canada, and other countries.
>>
>>  CPSR explains that a national identification scheme "could
>>  combine the functions of a driver's license, social security
>>  registration, immigration documents, and other government-
>>  issued identification." Individuals would be entered in a national
>>  data base and issued a "smart" card containing personal
>>  information, including, in some recent proposals, biometric
>>  data such as fingerprints or retina scans.
>>
>>  CPSR president Coralee Whitcomb said, "CPSR doubts that
>>  national identification schemes can provide additional security
>>  against terrorist attacks." She added, "These ideas have been
>>  around for a while, but after September 11 their proponents,
>>  including potential suppliers, who stand to profit handsomely
>>  from massive ID Card programs, used the climate of fear to
>>  dust them off in response to the public's desire for improved
>>  security. National identification schemes instead would endanger
>>  civil liberties, allowing those with access to the data base to track
>>  the behavior, associations, and finances of innocent people."
>>
>>  Moreover, a new identification system could "leave us relying
>>  on the wrong approach to security, and create a false sense of
>>  security that leaves us more vulnerable than before," Whitcomb
>>  said.
>>
>>  CPSR is a public-interest alliance of computer scientists and
>>  others concerned about the impact of computer technology on
>>  society. As technical experts, CPSR members continue to
>>  provide the public and policymakers with realistic assessments
>>  of the power, promise and limitations of computer technology.
>>
>>  CPSR representatives are available for interviews, testimony and
>>  other communications.
>>
>>  Links to resources about National ID Card position statements
>>  and press
>>  coverage, ID Cards for immigrants, Smart Cards, Social
>>  Security Numbers,
>>  Biometrics (Fingerprints,
>>  Retina Scanning, and Face Recognition), and General Security
>>  Principles can be found at
