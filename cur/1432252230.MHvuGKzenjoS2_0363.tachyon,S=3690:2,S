Except when the local firefighters show up when your house is on fire,
you're away, and the gun is rigged...

Actually, the warrant in the Scarfo case was signed by a federal 
magistrate judge. That doesn't mean it's constitutional, but the
judge had exactly this in mind.

See:

http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/fed/html/scarfo2.html-1.html
> Because the encrypted file could not be accessed via traditional
investigative means, Judge Haneke's Order permitted law enforcement
officers to "install and leave behind software, firmware, and/or
hardware equipment which will monitor the inputted data entered on
Nicodemo S. Scarfo's computer in the TARGET LOCATION so that the
F.B.I. can capture the password necessary to decrypt computer files by
recording the key related information as they are entered."
