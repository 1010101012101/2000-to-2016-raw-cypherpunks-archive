Dear Homeowner,
Save 30,000 to 80,000 in interest on your mortgage loan and reduce 
the terms of the mortgage by 8 to 12 years! There is no refinancing
and no change in the present mortgage contract. It's pretty simple,
every two weeks one-half of the homeowners mortgage payment
is electronically transferred from the account of their choice and
deposited into a newly created account setup in the homeowners 
name from that, once each month the full mortgage payment is 
forwarded to the lender on or before the due date. With this method
26 by weekly payments are made yearly, equivalent to 13 full mortgage
payments.  The 13th payments applied 100% to the principal balance.
Although the monthly payment is virtually the same the money that is
saved in interest is incredible! The homeowners funds are FDIC 
insured up to 1000,000 and the money that is saved in interest  
offsets the small application fee thousands of times over! For a free
mortgage analysis call 303-487-7778 or biweeklymortgage@cs.com
Sincerely, Ben Ostreng
