Nope. One can be breaking a user agreement by being 13 and having a Twi=

account -- is that a hack?

"He was going to" !=3D "he did".

I'm sorry, I am unfamiliar with the word "umn".

Ah, "hacking the system" is what we all do, what the whole NoisySquare =
thing=20
was at 30C3, etc. Is that something evil? Is that something to be "kill=
ed"=20
for?

Well, I couldn't have put it better myself:

"Aaron didn=E2=80=99t break into JSTOR, he used a valid JSTOR guest acc=

 on the MIT campus, which runs an open network. Had he downloaded 1 art=

 as well, nobody would have noticed. But he downloaded 4.8 million arti=
