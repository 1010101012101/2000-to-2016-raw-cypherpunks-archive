 >>No, no. AP is funny because it's impracticeable. One does not find an 
assassin exclusively by tracing who paid him to kill. One can (and often 
does) find him because he makes a mistake in the act of commiting the 
crime. Which, if I'm >>reading my history right, is what's hampered the 
noisy proponents of AP up to this point already.

Crime? Wot crime,guvnor? Jim and CJ were not 'noisy'.imo. Im a bit noisy 
cos Im pushing the 'let it all hang out' version.

 >The point is that Bell's theory does a really good job of sorting out the 
business end of assassination,...<

Oh THATS funny.I get it. HAHAHA!

 >>Killing one person, especially a public official, pisses a whole bunch 
of people off. Those people have a tendency to come find their buddy's killer.

Mmm,where do we start,lets get some firebrands and go up to the proffrs? 
Look at sites with no logs for quad anon 'predictors' who may be overseas 
briefly visiting cybercafes,Good luck china.(you just contradicted yrself btw.)
Oh,unless you mean the torture/french village reprisal thang.Win friends 
and influence people.
The one person killed will have had to have done a lot of evil shit to get 
enough pooled (presumably) to tempt a seasoned pro.Unless some professional 
killer turns all altruistic,stranger things have happened.The killer could 
be suicidal.another possibility.Lots of scenarios possible here,movie 
scripts,even.Pop songs,video games.DoCoMo assasinphones.
Someone like a torturer,murderer,terrorist,pedophile is a logical 
candidate.(stephen roach?)Sometimes these happen to be public 
officials.Theres one here
where I live named dennis Tanner.(vic.au) Those killers by remote control 
like arbusto might be be made more accountable.
What better way than...Bell's theory, "a really good job of sorting out the 
business end of assassination"according to you.

KILL THE PRESIDENT! "Id buy that for a dollar!"

 >>No kind of real or threatened assassination can weaken a government in 
which a majority of the governed people >believe. It can only make it seem 
more righteous and be more strong.

Thats true,roll over and go back to sleep,if you live under that govt you 
have nothing to worry about.
More righteous and more smug.
