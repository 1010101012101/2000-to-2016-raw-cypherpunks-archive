WASHINGTON, Sept. 22  California today adopted the nation's first law
meant to protect the privacy of drivers whose cars are equipped with
"black boxes," or data recorders that can be used to gather vital
information on how a vehicle is being driven in the last seconds before
a crash.


Gov. Gray Davis signed the law, which takes effect on July 1, requiring
carmakers to disclose the existence of such devices and forbidding
access to the data without either a court order or the owner's
permission, unless it is for a safety study in which the information
cannot be traced back to the car.

More than 25 million cars and trucks have the boxes that measure speed,
air-bag deployment and the use of brakes, seat belts and turn signals.
But California's privacy law is the first of its kind, says Thomas M.
Kowalick, co-chairman of a committee convened by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers to set standards for the boxes.
Most of the recorders are on General Motors vehicles, but Ford and
others have deployed some. Other manufacturers have plans to do the
same.
