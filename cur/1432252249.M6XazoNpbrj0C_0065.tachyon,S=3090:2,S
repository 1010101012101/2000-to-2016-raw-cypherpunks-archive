Hi all,
     Its obvious that some of us here are developers and still others
have never typed make or gcc in their lives.


    -v and -V options given to various forms of ld caused the embeddment of 
version information in the binary(Sunpro does this also, AND early versions
of MSC allowed embeddment of version information also.)
The fact that most environments dont link -Bstatic and instead link
-Bdynamic means that every time you attempt to produce a binary from
2 different systems that the dynamic link information will
be different checkout link.h link_elf.h link_aout.h in /usr/include


in addition MOST modern developement environments include a date field
when compiled and linked in the binary



     sheesh
     a cypherpunk
BTW.   AARG and eugene are idiots nyah nyah nyah!!
