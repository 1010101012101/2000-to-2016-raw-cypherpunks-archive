The problem with the HackRF (and other USB-based devices) is the bandwidth of
the USB connection, it's not that the HackRF hardware can't handle it, it's
that you can't get that much data to the PC.

(I have a HackRF - I needed a cheap way to track down some odd RFI issues -
and it's a pretty cool piece of hardware for the money, but, as I mentioned
earlier, you do get what you're paying for.  If I could make a wishlist, it'd
be nice to have a rev.2 with some work done on the front- end...).

Peter.
