What do you mean by «legitimate»? And second what do you mean by
«legitimate activities»?

My bad. For me English is a second language. But «fucks us in the arse»
implies a deliberate act. I see your domain is from Poland, which is
quite a backward country when it comes to anything people do, yet a pope
disaproves. Meaning anal sex, heterosexual, homosexual or plain
masturbation is a very very bad thing to do. I might be wrong, but in
this context «GMail fucks us in the arse» implies at least malice. Yet
now you write «I am not assuming malice on Google's part». Help me
understand.

How can anybody draw the line? It's fine as long as they are under an
arbitrary value set by WHOM, but it's wrong after that?

Than they should break Avaaz.

If one company depends so much on another, than you can call the first
one a parasyte. If it's existence depends on Google, than they should
ask nicely and maybe forward a nice sum of money. Or they have quite
some nerve to try to impose rules from the position of parasyte.

Hopefuly for you their niche might be filled afterwards by a company
that can stand on its own.

Don't you think that is for the people to decide?

Because they way you expressed it, as I have no idea what Avaaz is or
does, they are a puny corporation living from Google's leftovers. 
Meaning Google does a good thing for their users.
