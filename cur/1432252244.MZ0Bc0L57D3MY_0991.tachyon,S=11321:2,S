Hal Finney


AS IT turned out, Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto. But for a short =
while, at least, some people thought he might be. =93Satoshi Nakamoto=94 =
is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, =
meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a =
computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any =
central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime =
in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.

Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer =
he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. =
Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a =
partner in the world=92s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly =
had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the =
original =93cypherpunks=94, a small, influential band of cryptographers, =
philosophers and programmers who, in the early 1990s, helped stamp the =
early internet with its culture of rebelliousness, distrust of =
government and optimistic belief in the liberating power of technology.

Two decades before Edward Snowden put the subject on front pages the =
world over, the cypherpunks were discussing how the coming age of the =
internet would allow governments and companies to pry ever more deeply =
and easily into the lives of their citizens and customers. But that same =
computer revolution would also hand ordinary people the power to fight =
back against the organisations that presumed to run their lives. Until =
that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to =
spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to =
carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, =
and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.

For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the =
supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a =
living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it =
with gusto. =93Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, =
creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,=94 he =
wrote. =93[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and =
protect people, rather than to control them.=94 His aim was clear: =93The =
work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of =
making Big Brother obsolete.=94

He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy =
(PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was =
well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be =
unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the =
journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, =
PGP=92s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America=92s spies =
were aghast. Exporting encryption=97which was classed as a weapon=97was =
illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were =
proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world=97diplomat, =
criminal, teenager=97who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, =
Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company=92s second-ever =
employee.

Suspended animation

For a long time he ran a free =93remailer=94, a server designed to =
forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. =
Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each =
other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended =
beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that =
technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals =
evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace =
fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen =
skier and runner.

He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease =
(MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with =
characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death =
sentence=97even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, =
life could carry on with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. He was =
surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease =
=93chose=94 death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their =
bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His =
interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and =
how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to =
communicate with the outside world=97even if it was only by having a =
computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle=97he wanted to =
endure.

When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In =
accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As =
soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm =
called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen. He became one of a few =
hundred people who have elected to have their bodies stored until =
medicine advances to the point where it can safely revive them and cure =
their original ailments. It sounds (and is) science-fictional, and Mr =
Finney was under no illusions about the prospects of waking up again. =
But placing his faith in a technology that has yet to be invented was a =
rational gamble for a committed techno-optimist. And besides, a slim =
hope is better than none at all.
