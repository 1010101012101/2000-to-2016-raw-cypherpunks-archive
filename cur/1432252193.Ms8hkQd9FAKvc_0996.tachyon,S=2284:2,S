I think that this is the whole point. It's impossible to tell what effect removing a species from an ecosystem will have due to the phenomenal complexity of the system. Just removing the mosquito _appears_ to have very little effect, but the wider ramifications of such an action could be disastrous.

It may well be that the desire to preserve the mosquito is in the minority, but amongst those who actually understand the possible implications I would suspect that there is a different viewpoint.
