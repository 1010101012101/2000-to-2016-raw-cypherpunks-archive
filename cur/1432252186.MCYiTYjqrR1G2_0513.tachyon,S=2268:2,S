MAC address space is enough for roughly one device/square meter of
Earth surface. This is about enough for wireless MAC (24 bit for
longitude/latitude each) assigment from, say, WGS 84. Not
enough for elevation, but given that it's rough coordinates, injecting some
noise should remove potential (rare) address collisions.

Pluses are the MACs can be assigned by the system (negotiating how to back
off of potential collisions). Lacking relativistic pings, signal strength is
useful for rough distance estimates of internode distance. Obviously, WiFi
boxes which can directly parse NMEA input can compute the MAC directly,
otherwise it's a one-time (for immobile nodes) operation at setup.

This is obviously of use for geographic routing in wireless
meshes, geographically constrained queries/broadcast, etc.
