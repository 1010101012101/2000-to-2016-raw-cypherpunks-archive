On your own roads. And the car maker tells you where you can go to. And 
which route you have to take. And where you can end up. And then forces 
you to pay for a map.


If the patent hasn't been picked up by the courts yet, then why not? 
*If* the SSSCA were to come into effect (and I have heard little about 
it for several months now... biding its time?), then surely all other 
OSes (subject to legal boundaries) would be prevented by the patent from 
implementing the requirements in the bill?

...and to appease the pedanty, it's hard to have a /more/ correct 
analogy when there was no analogy in the first place. There, got it out 
of my system...
