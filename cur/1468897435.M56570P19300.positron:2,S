That's because the plan changed. The US and Russia are going to divvy up
Syria now. Partition time. OFC that won't happen overnight, but it's now
inevitable.

That's great for Turkey (barring the scenario I presented above), but I
don't see that it's in any way good for "Syrian nationalism"...

=2E...and that was the question at hand.



As far as your other missive's link goes:

    Erdogan Taunts Obama Over Coup Attempt in Turkey
    Erdogan will not forgive the Obama administration for leading him up =
the
    garden path on Syria, convincing him that Washington was leaving no
    stone unturned to overthrow the Assad regime
    http://atimes.com/2016/07/erdogan-taunts-obama-over-turkeys-coup-bid/=




Erdogan's hand is ISIS, and they're already all over Europe thanks to
the Russian AF rout, and they ARE mixed in with the refugee population,
and they HAVE terrorized those refugees to not talk, and IF Erdogan
doesn't get a BIG part of the Syrian Partition pie... Selah...
