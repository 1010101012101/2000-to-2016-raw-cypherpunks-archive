> John (under regional arrest) Gilmore

The feds can't prohibit interstate travel, no?  To visit 2 of the
states, you must use a boat.  Do boats require ID?
I understand that trains now do.

[Note that driving through a foreign country should not be
required.  To boat you pass out of US waters, into
international, and back into US waters.]
