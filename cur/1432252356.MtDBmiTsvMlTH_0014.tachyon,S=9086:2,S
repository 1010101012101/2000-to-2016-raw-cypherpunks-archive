   The Economics of the Rise of Ahmadinejad
  
   Capital markets (or their absence) are central to the emergence of evil and
   the one-party state.
  
   By Reuven Brenner
  
   When Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.S. recently, he
   didn't say explicitly that the Holocaust was a myth. Instead he asked why
   so much emphasis is put on the 6 million Jews who died during WWII rather
   than the 60 million people who perished during the conflict. Then, at a
   Tehran conference where Holocaust deniers congregated with Orthodox rabbis
   who apparently believe the state of Israel should not exist, Ahmadinejad
   offered a message satisfying each camp. He told the delegates that the
   Holocaust should be questioned and that Israel's days are numbered.
  
   One wonders, with the terrible lessons of 20th century totalitarianism
   still so ripe, how history could repeat itself so blatantly and so soon. I
   hold that the answer lies in just how one-party states such as modern Iran
   emerge, and of what happens when the access to capital is limited within
   societies.
  
   Of course, the systematic extermination of the Jews started in the early
   1930s. By then, Germany had rebuilt itself from the ruins of WWI and the
   devastating hyperinflation of the 1920s into a powerful, educated,
   industrialized nation, where science and technology thrived. True, all this
   occurred within a one-party state. Yet, if such apparent prosperity can
   lead to murderous instincts not being suppressed, where is the advantage of
   Western Civilization, which is built on the concept of prosperity? In a
   recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Mark Bowen asked, Why is the
   Holocaust haunting the collective memory of the West? Bowen concluded,
   "what the Holocaust demonstrates is the danger of a one-party state."
  
   This conclusion is partially correct, but it begs the question: How did
   Germany get from the Weimar Republic, a democracy, to the one-party state?
   And why did the Germans tolerate such a state and accept its murderous
   ideology? Whether the Germans agreed deep down with Hitler & Co. is
   irrelevant. Actions - or, in this case, the lack of actions - matter.
  
   During the 1920s, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Russia each
   printed money with abandon. This brought about hyperinflation, which
   weakened or destroyed the capital markets in these countries. Banks failed,
   markets crashed, unemployment rose, and the middle classes lost their
   lifetime savings.
  
   People want to live first and philosophize a bit later. With their savings
   gone, these Europeans turned to two other ways of accessing capital:
   government and crime. Predictably, each of these countries moved toward
   centralization - that is, government become the main financial intermediary.
  
   When the citizens of these countries looked abroad, there was little to
   admire. England and the U.S. were each suffering through depressions (in
   the U.S., due to mistaken fiscal and monetary policies). These governments
   too moved toward centralization, though to a much different degree. Up
   sprung the jargon of "public works" and, eventually, the Keynesian term
   "aggregate demand." Here the governments also would become intermediaries,
   charged with raising and then allocating capital. Importantly, however,
   this was done without England or the U.S. ever becoming one-party states.

   Power is dispersed within democracies, and democracies are always weakened
   when more money flows through government hands. This is true even when the
   facade of democracy persists. When more capital sifts through the
   government, more groups depend on government handouts and have less access
   to sources of capital that are independent from the ruling political
   parties. But the U.K. and the U.S. retained many more independent sources
   of capital than did Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Russia during the 1930s.
  
   The dangers come when a country either does not develop its capital markets
   or destroys them on purpose or inadvertently. When this is the case, the
   chances of one party taking power and imposing its ideology increase.
  
   Conversely, when capital markets are opened, the risk that one-party states
   will emerge diminishes. As independent sources of capital surface,
   political power is dispersed and lasting prosperity follows. Thus, it is a
   mistake to promote democracy without first establishing the ground for
   letting people have access to capital and collateral - or at least
   coordinating such access with political change. After all, prosperity is
   the result of matching people with capital, while holding both sides
   accountable.
  
   What happens when societies either do not have or destroy their financial
   markets? Even today very few societies have developed the institutions that
   can enable the development of deep financial markets - a solid legal
   infrastructure and free media among them. In this scenario, most people
   wanting access to capital have no other option but to turn to government,
   which will raise the money - either through taxes or borrowing - and then
   distribute it.
  
   That's how one-party states such as Ahmadinejad's Iran emerge: People bet
   on crazy ideologies when their customary ways of living suddenly crumble
   and capital markets close. Capital markets are the unique feature of the
   West, and their democratization is the key to the civilizing process and
   the best insurance against the emergence of one-party states. Indeed,
   that's what the U.S. should have been "exporting" all along in the Middle
   East, coordinating the promotion of capital markets with the necessary
   political changes in Iraq.
