Sane...yes.  Well that explains the Wall St vultures, then!

Right, and I do understand that.  While I truly wish we lived in a world 
where could trade and barter for everything, the ISP and utility companies 
want actual payment for services ;)

As was mentioned, nothing is pure or perfect.  Doing the best we can, which 
will be different for everyone, is the goal.  Some people really need to 
have a car.  I don't, so I do not.

A friend and I do our grocery shopping together.  He has a car because of 
work;  I very often take care of his cat.   I'm not going to pretend that I 
can walk or bike home with an armload of groceries and 13 kg of cat litter, 
lol.  We get to catch up and the chore of shopping goes by quickly.

Right on, Zenaan!  (Sounds like we're about the same age, too.)  It's been 
about as long since I watched tv on a regular basis as well.  For my few 
indulgences, like The Walking Dead (yep, vegan pacifist likes zombie 
apocalypse. Hannibal, too!  Save the animals, Eat the Rude :D ), I go watch 
with friends.  More fun that way anyway.
I, um, may have downloaded Mr Robot.  Shhh.

There are several hacker spaces and maker spaces in my city, and many 
informal gatherings.  I'm very fortunate :)

Well, yes.  Being mindful isn't always easy, but does lead to a more 
fulfilling existence.  It's more of... just trying to be a decent human, as 
I see it?  We're all stuck on this rock spinning in space. We may as well 
be decent to each other, things seem to be better that way.

What other rational choice is there?  Arbitrary boundaries of countries are 
drawn and redrawn like a game of Risk played in a dorm room, and with far 
less care; they mean nothing, in the humanistic sense.  We're all in the 
same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.

Note: boundaries of other countries never seem to matter to the jerks who 
run mine, for a much different reason.  I am sorry, world.  More than I can 
convey.

So, yes.  I feel that all of our choices have a global impact, one way or 
another.  I try to tip the scales in favor of the greater good, when I can.
