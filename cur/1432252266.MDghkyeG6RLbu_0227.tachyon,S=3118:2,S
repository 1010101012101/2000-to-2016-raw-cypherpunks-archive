The Federal register is a US government pub that goes out every business 
day.  Circa 1200 pages a day of published rules, regs, and other 
garbage.  Just for the federal government not the states.  No court 
decisions or administrative rulings in it.  Just reading it to find out 
your orders from your rulers would take all day and would be very 
incomplete.  But you (Americans) are bound to obey all of them on pain of 
fine or imprisonment.

Social conventions are complex but not that complex and we are hard wired 
to figure those out.  We're not hard wired to read thousands of pages a day 
of bureaucratese and figure out what it means.

Have you read your ruler's orders today?  Better start reading they're 
gaining on you:  http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/aces/fr-cont.html
