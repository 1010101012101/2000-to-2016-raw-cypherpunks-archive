Brooks on The Lehrer Report last night did indeed go berzerk
in the face of Shield's superior defense of Kerry's reasonable
approach. Brooks repeatedly agreed with Shield's analysis
showing Bush/Cheney was dogmatic, inflexible and incapable
of admitting error, then went on to defend their fundamental
righteousness as being what you have to do to win against
others having the same characteristics.

He said reasonable people like us, meaning the three on the
show, are not typical of those Bush/Cheney are appealing to.
Their base consituency does not want equivocation they want
to be right, and win, no matter what other countries may want.

Brooks conceded that this desire for being a winner take all,
by force if necessary, concealed a fear of being ignorantly
wrong, and that any candidate which exploited this fear by
promising might is more powerful than knowledge and doubt
will do very well.

This argument is made here by James Donald, and before
him, Tim May and groupies.

To be sure the armaments makers aplaud this rock-headedness
of the cowards who always advocate that others die -- preferably
in large numbers -- for the safety of the yellow-striped shickenhawks 
needing their necks wrung.

Yeah, yeah, they'll rooster-crow about popping their peashooters
at anybody who violates their isolationist piss-markings of triadic
carriers, boomers and stategic bombers. But what the cowards 
want is for somebody to cuddle them like mommy did, to keep a 
tit ready to slumber-suck away nightmare doubts.

Brooks got so worked up, Shield's had to pat him on the back
to assure the weenie his futile defense of idiot hatemongerers 
didn't mean he'd get booted from the elite in-nut-hut.
