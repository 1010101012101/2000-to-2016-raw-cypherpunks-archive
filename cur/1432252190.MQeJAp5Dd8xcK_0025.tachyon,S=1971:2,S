I didn't bother wasting my attention enough to see if FZ was deemed
a freak or not in this article.  I will tell you that he was not into
pharmaceuticals but was one of the finest american composers
of the last century ---and Tipper Gore[1] will burn in hell for wasting
his time.  If you want to appreciate his brilliance, the _yellow shark_
album (which puts to music the US form required of immigrants)
