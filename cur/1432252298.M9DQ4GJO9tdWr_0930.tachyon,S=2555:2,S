It's interesting that the history of Justin Berry's page shows all the
edits and reversions.  John's edits are still available through the
history links.

Also interesting is the latest history entry:

14:15, 12 March 2006
<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Justin_Berry&oldid=43436000>
Theresa knott <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theresa_knott> (Jimbo
has asked for us to start again so let's start.)


Regardless of the underlying intent, this is just another edit war.  In
this case, the Boss happens to be involved.  I would be much more
concerned if the history page were altered to conceal the edits.

Didn't we predict edit wars (of a sort) back in the Depew days?
