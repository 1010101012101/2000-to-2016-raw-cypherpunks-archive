Really? Who? If you're refering to either Bell or CJ, in both cases the
individual acted in a premeditated and intentional manner in order to
provoke a responce.

When you yank on a dogs chain, and the dog bites you. It isn't the dogs
fault.

But this isn't going to make much impact on somebody that thinks they're
somehow above answering to others for their actions. Another example of
how the C-A-C-L "I got a right to...." (eg kill people) is full of shit
for the simple reason they forget the "...until it interferes with
anothers expression of their rights".

'bad' to who? It certainly wasn't bad to them. Hitler thought he was doing
a 'good' thing 'in the big picture'.

More of that 'ends justifies the means' crap that seems so popular in
C-A-C-L philosophy.
