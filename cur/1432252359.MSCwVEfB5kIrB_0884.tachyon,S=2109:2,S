Many important, sensitive login sites are not protected, making it
easier to steal passwords from naive (and even experienced) users. See
`Hall of Shame` listing such sites at
http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~herzbea/Shame.html

Examples:
Banks and FIs: PayPal, Chase, SmithBarney (CitiGroup), Bank of
America, TD Waterhouse, Amex, FirstCommand Bank, MidFirst Bank

Security services: MicroSoft Passport, EquiFax, InstantSSL

All sites were warned before being added to the Hall of Shame (few
actually fixed their sites and are therefore not on the page, e.g.
eBay).
