Mask laws in the US, when they're not about bank robbers,
are generally targeted against the Klan.  The KKK occasionally
claims to have religious content - they're out burning crosses -
but that hasn't stopped enforcement that often.

Islam is highly varied - some of the Arab and Persian cultures
are heavily into veils for women, some aren't.  Not sure about Indian.
The Taliban have recently been requiring that men grow beards
(I'm not sure if they require long ones or if short is ok.)

Some of the Arab traditional headdress for men has the
relatively lightweight kaffiyehs, like Yassir Arafat wears,
while some go for heavier, more concealing coverage such as the
turban-like things the Tuareg and other deep-desert folks wear.
That doesn't have religious significance - it's about sunburn and
sand and wind and heat and cold, and immensely practical stuff
if you live in that climate, as well as culturally familiar,
just as cowboy hats and bandannas are sometimes practical
and sometimes just for style.

Many of the Sikh turbans cover the beard as well as the hair.
And Sikhs do get hassled at airports.

You can always go with Nun outfits.  It's easier to get away with
if you're female, but here in San Francisco that's certainly
not a requirement...

Sports events should give you lots of options.
Ski masks, football helmets, hockey goalie masks, green paint -
just make sure you're wearing a jersey for the right team :-)
