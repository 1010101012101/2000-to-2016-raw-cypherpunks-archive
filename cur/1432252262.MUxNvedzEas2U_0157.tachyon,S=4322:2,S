I have been meaning to set up a similar CA for years now, but never
found the time. While you are at it, you might want to configure your CA
to offer S/MIME certs subject to an email ping. (Which is what exactly
what Thawte (a.k.a. VeriSign) is using to authenticate their free S/MIME
certs). Make sure that your CA will only sign sufficient size keys,
responding with a meaningful error message if a smaller key is
submitted.

There is a commercial SSL cert provider with roots in the browsers that
uses just authentication method b) that you propose.

However, for your CA, I would recommend doing away with b) since that
will limit even "legitimate" (whatever that would mean in this context)
users of your CA. Do a whois on cypherpunks.to to see why b) won't work
for everybody. If you don't care about serving users of some CCTLD's,
you can leave b) in. Your CA, your CSP.

YMMV,
