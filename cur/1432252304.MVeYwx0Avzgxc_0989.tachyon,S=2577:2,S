Q: "Do you believe people should be arrrested, tried, and jailed for 
writing in some form that narcs and cops cannot read? Do you believe 
whispering should be made a felony?

Q: If you answered "yes," would you be willing to take a bullet from 
citizens who don't agree? Will you volunteer to work in an office 
building that may be terminated by extreme prejudice by patriots?

Q: Do you understand that by repressing civil liberties, you have earned 
killing?
