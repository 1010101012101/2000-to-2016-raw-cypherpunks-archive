The Transportation Security Administration has awarded the first two work 
orders for its information technology infrastructure.
TSA tapped Unisys Corp. for the agency's billion-dollar Information 
Technology Managed Services (ITMS) program Aug. 2 but postponed making an 
official award until meeting with an investment review board.
A group led by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of 
Homeland Security is assessing all projects valued at more than $500,000 at 
agencies, including TSA, slated to go into the proposed Homeland Security 
Department.
