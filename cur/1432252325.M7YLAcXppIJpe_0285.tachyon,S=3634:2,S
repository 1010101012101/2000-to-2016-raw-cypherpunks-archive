It's also strange that there are relatively few science fiction books
which talk about math. There are some noted short story collections (_The
Mathematical Magpie_ and its sequel), short stories (Asimov's story about
rediscovering "graphitics," Heinlein's "And He Built A Crooked House"),
and authors (Rudy Rucker), but nowhere near the volume of SF based on
physics.

Perhaps it's that there are fewer people familiar with math than with
physics - which leads to fewer people writing such fiction and a smaller
market for it. The same is true for crypto, except more so.

The obvious one would be Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_. I wonder if Greg
Egan has written anything in this vein; he seems to have interests in
computer science, and he even had an alternate history/worldline
travelling story about Turing in Asimov's last year ("Oracle").
