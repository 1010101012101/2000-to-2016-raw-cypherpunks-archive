That should be a no-brainer.

Like they're going to admit otherwise...

Look, managing the perception of friendly fire statistics is super-easy. 
All you have to do is use a little set-theory to define all casualties of
war as enemies.  Presto!  No more friendly-fire incident paperwork.

Take me, for example.  The good government of Canada has been slowly but
surely flushing my life down a toilet for years and years, perhaps even
with the help of foreigners.  (Don't ask, it's a long story.}  However it
is only in the last four or five years that the authorities in question
have been able to escalate the threat I pose to their retirement cachets
and pension benefits by way of cleverly manipulating their selective
disclosure of facts[1] and by virtue of the creative misunderstanding of
what I do in the course of conducting my own self-defense[2] operation. 
911 didn't hurt them any either.

The end result is that I become an enemy of the state as a direct
consequence of the attentions and interference of state actors.  No causal
chain is allowed to officially exist linking a state-sponsored
`harassment' campaign with my subsequent bad attitude, thus I
automatically become the Bad Guy(tm), who then deserves a total loss of
civil rights and forfeiture of present and future personal property
without counterfraudulent due process.

Apparently this method was perfected some years ago, and so I conclude
that LockMart is simply borrowing the technique for their present approach
to selling their corporate image and product line to the world.

professional associates.

Corporate productspeak for `nyah, nyah, nyah."

BFD.  The medical industry has also contributed to a 'change in
humankind'.  Similar sentiments can be attached to the public education
sector, the automotive industry, the steel industry, etc.  Oh, I suppose
we should not also forget the Internet and its boundless potential for
connecting people to each other for arbitrary business and leisure
activities.
 
But the really sad thing about the quoted article is that someone (or more
people) actually got paid to write it.
