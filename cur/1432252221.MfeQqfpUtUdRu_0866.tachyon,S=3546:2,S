My mistake, seems that one county in FL used a different ballot than the
rest of the state. They used a punch style ballot with one column of punch
holes and candidates on both sides:


Bush  --> 0  
          0 <-- Buchanan
Gore  --> 0
          0 <-- Nader
          0
          0

Still seems simple enough to me.

IMHO if the courts order a new election in this county then they need to
do it for the entire state as the electorial college is winner take all
and it would be unjust to allow this one county to determine how these
delegates vote.
