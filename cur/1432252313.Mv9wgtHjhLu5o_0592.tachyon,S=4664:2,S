Thanks for the pointer, a very good essay indeed. :)

I haven't checked in any meaningful way, but that thread doesn't seem to
have any replies from Ralph...  Do you recall any details as to what would
cause oscillations?  Would be interesting to explore this.

I expect that having a way to prove collusion by checking who praises
whom, etc. would likely avoid such problems.  As would I suppose personal
observation of current behavior.

Say for instance Mr. Measels manages to accumulate quite a large sum of
positive repcap, if he spews a bunch of the lame ass CJ knockoff messages,
I suspect most people would adjust their cached repcap's of him pretty
quickly - At least I would.  (CJ did/does write kooky messages, but at
least they're funny...)
