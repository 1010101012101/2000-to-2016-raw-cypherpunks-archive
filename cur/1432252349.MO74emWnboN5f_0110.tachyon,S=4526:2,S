Porn would be a good carrier, as few actually 'rip' the
originals (eg from analog tape) and they are widely duplicated.

When you put out an image you took, you own the copy rights to
it; you also own the rights to the same perceptually-unchanged
image with all the LSBs altered.  Now if you start using
creative manipulations, at some point the new creator owns
a new creation.  

(Ie, a song or picture with the watermark removed is 
still copyrighted; but a processed sample can be used in your
own works.)

Or if somebody took

Of course, if you can prove you wrote the code first.

*Proving* the release date and giving the key and stego program
could convince others.  

Presenting a one-time-pad which generates some contested-code
from some picture is not convincing :-)

Maybe a colleage lifted the plaintext. 

There's a dude from Avanti going to San Quentin for lifting code.
Cost over $100e6 to Avanti, too.

You'd be better off just encrypting the whole tarball and putting
it up on a geocities (etc) site ---Tomlinson style.
