To go a little further, that calculation, like depreciation, is
usually done at the behest of some taxing authority or another. (No,
not always, of course -- transferring an asset's ownership on the
books of one component of the same enterprise to another with its own
books, and then accounting for that on the books of the whole
enterprise, called transfer pricing, is one of the core problems of
finance, a problem which led to much of what we call modern finance,
including a Nobel or two...) Depreciation of an asset is usually a
marvellous way for government to control a business, since, of
course, the amortization/depreciation of capital against a revenue
stream is pretty much what the average large industrial concern is
about. Accounting for "goodwill" has caused the most bizarre
regulatory-driven book-keeping shenanigans than practically anything
else.

Irony is a wonderful thing, however. It may be that if we can figure
out how to do bearer ownership of assets, using various blinded, or
mostly blinded cryptographic transaction protocols, we'll collapse
the difference between calculated asset value, ala depreciation,
transfer-pricing, and "goodwill", and the *real* value of something,
which is its price, discovered in a free market.

The more I've thought about this over the past few years, the more I
think that "reputation" as a *calculated* value, is probably a
wild-goose chase.

But you can't blame a bunch of crypto-engineers for trying, I
suppose.

Cheers,
RAH
