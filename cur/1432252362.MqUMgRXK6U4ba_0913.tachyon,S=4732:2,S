Ramsey Clark, former US Attorney General and well-known leftie,
did a movie about the Yankee-Iraqi war.  He drove about 1000 miles
in a week during the heavy bombing period - a lot of driving around
at night with no headlights (so the Yankees don't bomb him,
but at major risk of driving into craters in the road)
and interviewing people who'd been affected.
Some of the notable interviews were a neighborhood in Bagdhad that
had half a dozen buildings bombed by US attempts to take out a bridge -
the locals were starting to think about blowing it up themselves
in self-defense when the US finally succeeded.

Clark did a segment at the notorious "baby milk factory",
and while it probably was legitimate, his film *really* looked like
somebody trying to make a propaganda coverup pretending that
this <pick your favorite bad activity> factory was a
<perfectly innocent media-squishy liberal-guilt-tripping>
baby milk factory.  There was a pallet of bags of white powder
with a sign in English saying "Baby Milk" on it, etc.
Not one of the high points of an otherwise excellent movie.

Of course, leave aside issues like the appropriateness or
safety of baby formulas as a substitute for breast-feeding -
many of the same liberals who watched the film have been boycotting
Nestle' for years (and watching the Nestle' borg buy up the industry)
because of their dishonest promotion of these products in the
third world where average people don't have safe water supplies
and can't afford the product, and would be much better off
spending the money improving the nutrition of the babies' mothers...
