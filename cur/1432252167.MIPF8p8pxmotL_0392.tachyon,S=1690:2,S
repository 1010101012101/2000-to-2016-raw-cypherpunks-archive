Hi,

Considering that it appears that spammers are now resorting
to DoS'ing sites that host spam lists, wouldn't now be a good
time to investigate the possibilities of a distributed, or at
least, load balanced blacklist provider?

Even something as simple as round-robin DNS with sufficient
nodes (couple of hundred?) should be enough to make such
attacks highly inefficient and far, far less likely to be
effective.

Of course, with round robin DNS, one can target the DNS
servers.

Would this make for an interesting community project?

Any comments appreciated.
