  e-gold Blocks Account Logins From Exploited Computers

  MELBOURNE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--e-gold Users now have additional
  protection against "phishing attacks", thanks to a ground breaking upgrade
  to its Account Sentinel (a.k.a. AccSent(tm)) arsenal of account access
  security features.

  Using DNS blacklist data published by well known third parties, AccSent now
  blocks account access from IPs identified as open proxies, insecure web
  servers, or otherwise open to exploitation by criminals. For the sake of
  brevity, e-gold refers to such blacklisted IPs as "blips".

  As always, the AccSent advantage is that e-gold Users need not take any
  action - or even understand what an IP address, an open proxy, or a
  phishing attack is - to immediately benefit from this innovative new
  feature. However, as powerful as AccSent is, the best protection against
  phishing and other criminal attacks is user education. For this reason
  e-gold urges its Users to carefully read and practice the Security
  Recommendations published on the e-gold.com website.

  According to the Wikipedia.org article entitled "Open Proxy": "It is
  possible for a computer to be running an open proxy server without
  knowledge of the computer's owner. This can be the result of
  mis-configuration of proxy software running on the computer, or of
  infection with malware (viruses, trojans or worms) designed for this
  purpose."

  "e-gold account access from open proxies is not in the best interest of the
  e-gold community - whether that access is from the unwitting owner of an
  exploited computer or from a criminal using an exploited computer as a
  proxy to hide his own identity," says Dr. Douglas Jackson, e-gold Founder.
