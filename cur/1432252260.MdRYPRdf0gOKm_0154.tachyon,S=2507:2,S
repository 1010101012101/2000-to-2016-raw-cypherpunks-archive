[Judge Patel throws out Bernstein case after USG 'promises' not
to enforce the laws requiring notification of publication of crypto
source code]

No, this is NOT great news. The law stands, and promises from
a government agent are of questionable sincerity. If a researcher 
publishes crypto source, the law is still a sword of Damocles
hanging over his head, ready to fall if he displeases the powers that
be.

Great news would have been Judge Patel declaring the
law unconstitutional, or (better) the USG repealing the law.

Ayn Rand, wrong about so many things, had it right:

"There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any 
government has is the power to crack down on criminals. 
Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. 
One declares so many things to be a crime that it 
becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws."
