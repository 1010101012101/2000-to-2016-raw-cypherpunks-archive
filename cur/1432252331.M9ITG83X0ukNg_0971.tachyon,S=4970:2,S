Rape and murder both carry the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and 
many/most other Islamic nations. Not a lot of rapes or murders in most 
of these countries (Indonesia a special case, some war-torn terror 
states are also special cases).

There is some chance for what you describe, but the overall suppression 
of both will make for fewer cases than your analysis hints at. People 
fearing death if they rape will avoid the act in the first place, not 
rape...and then worry about getting rid of the witness. (Besides which, 
technologies are coming which make it harder for perps to get away with 
crimes like this. Encrypted WiFi escrow records of chemical scents and 
sounds, even images. Vastly better forensics, with rubbed-off DNA or 
deposited DNA linked to smells and fluids in public places....)

Two other trends:

1) More use of laptops, tablets, and PDAs under personal control at all 
times, or most times. Locked up when not under personal control. Case 
design which makes it much harder to insert hardware bugs (pretty 
difficult to do so in a Palm or Visor...).

2) Working papers encrypted, even stored offshore, regardless of what 
Mr. Happy Fun Court is or is not amused by.


The publicity about his Mafia guy having his computer bugged is 
probably  helping others to think about security again.
