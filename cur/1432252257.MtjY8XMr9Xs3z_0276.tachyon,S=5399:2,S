For what it's worth, this sounds an awfully lot like what I have envisioned
for the Cryptosphere:

https://github.com/tarcieri/cryptosphere

Contacts would be identified by their (Ed25519) public key. When you add

Really close to what I had in mind, and I plan on using Ed25519. This is
actually an approach that forces you to do more than take a fleeing glance
at a given user's public key thumbprint/ID and I feel that's missing from
many similar systems (e.g. OTR)

My goal was to collect metadata about content transfers in the system by
having all participants in file transfers sign a client-specific long chain
which serves as a record of who has transferred what.

Through the course of normal system operation any given peer will collect a
number of these long chains, which can be run through a collaborative
filtering algorithm (e.g. singular value decomposition) in order to make an
educated guess about the properties of peers you've never interacted with
based on their collective similarity to peers you have interacted with
directly.

Here are some possible implementation strategies. The only one I've made

My plan was to use CurveCP with the Ed25519 private scalar as the CurveCP
private key. This allows you to set up secure channels which are based on
the same identities as the other signatures in the system.

CurveCP presently has some issues with embedding and congestion control but
I hope if people actually start using it these problems will get resolved.

A crypto capability-based access control scheme comes to mind here.
