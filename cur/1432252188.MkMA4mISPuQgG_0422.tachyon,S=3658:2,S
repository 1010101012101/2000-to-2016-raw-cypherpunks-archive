      The message I just sent moments before -- the formatting was trashed,
although the ones before that were fine -- totally random weirdness.

     Ish! I'm getting bummed with NS, but wouldn't use IE on a bet. Why use a
virus magnet? But then, I don't use any other M$ product either, it's all
third rate. Actually, NS on linux works pretty well.
      What I'm probably going to do is just stop using the Mac for
communication at all, and just stick with linux, where I can use mutt and
opera (which is seriously faster than either NS or IE) or maybe konquerer, if
I can get it to work under gnome. I bought the Mac just for DTP, then got
seduced by it's audio/visual stuff and finally started using it for web and
mail too, but that's becoming too annoying.
