Once again you make the mistake that, because YOU are drinking from a spigot 
of hype, that because I disagree with you I must be drinking from some other 
spigot.

There are plenty of counter-examples to the "benefits" of US 
interventionism, particularly throughout central America. But I don't really 
want to debate that point, but instead focus on Iraq.

In Iraq this philosophy of "saving the locals from tyrrany" has taken a new 
turn. In this case, I actually believe that George W, Dick Cheney and the 
whole cabal believe that:

1. The best thing for the Iraqis would be a western-style free-market 
economy. (Check?)
2. An Iraqi free market would slowly stabilise the whole middle east region. 
(Check?)
3. Iraq has resources (ie, oil) that could be utilized to kick-start a true 
industrialized economy (Check?)
4. The US has the ability to extract that oil and then turn those dollars 
into local goods-and-services, thus kickstarting forementioned Iraqi 
industrialization (Check?)
5. Meanwhile, Saddam was really, really bad and a terrorist and he's got all 
sorts of scary WMDs.
6. It is therefore in everybody's best interests for the US to kick out 
Saddam and get this party started.
7. Oh, and the US will benefit too (as we should) as we help ole' man Iraq 
get back on his feet.

But apparently, the locals are not particularly happy about the unilateral 
decisions we've been making in their benefit. Of course, you might chalk 
this up to fanaticism/Islam or whatever, but I suspect they just don't trust 
us (Abu Ghraib), and remember the fact that it was the US that propped up 
Saddam as long as he stuck to the script.

Who knows? If Bush & Co are able to steal this election, maybe in a year or 
two (after the death toll hits the 5 digit mark) we'll start hearing about 
how Saddam wasn't so bad after all, and why don't we give him a second 
chance? (We'll watch him closely, so don't you worry!)
