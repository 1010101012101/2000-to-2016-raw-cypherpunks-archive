Subject: [Dailydave] iAWACS CFP - The no-limit workshop

First International Alternative Workshop on Aggressive Computing and
Security

                           The no-limit workshop

              "Enhancing security with the attacker's mind -
			Orthodoxy and self confidence are weaknesses"
	     "There is no such thing as forbidden knowledge,
		     only forbidden use of knowledge"

	   			iAWACS

			ESIEA - Laval - October 2009

Thinking security can not be done without adopting a preferential mode
of
thought of the attacker. A system cannot be defended if we do not know
how to
attack it. If the theory is still an interesting approach to formalize
things,
the operational approach must be the ultimate goal: to talk about
security is
meaningless if we do not actually do security. In recent years the major
security conferences in the subjects preferred to select papers
according to
fashion topics, conforming to something like orthodoxy and organize
selection
as beauty contests. As a result excellent yet unorthodox scientific
papers are
often rejected and sink into oblivion.

The first international Alternative Workshop in Aggressive Computing and
Security (iAWACS'09) aims to focus on this vision and to allow
researchers and
specialists to present relevant research works, with interesting
results and
operational (theoretical and/or applied) in the field of security. The
different points of view, away from unconventional fashion and
orthodoxy are
particularly welcome. The aim is also to promote discussion of ideas
around
these topics.

Articles submitted will be selected according to the following criteria:
# Interest and scientific/technical correctness/accuracy,
# New results,
# Operational quality

Regarding this last point, the authors should give all information and
conditions for reproducibility of results they intend to present. This
may
include, during the selection phase by the reviewers, assessments
based on
challenges to the authors by the reviewers. iAwacs is not just another
hackers
workshop where the last exploit is disclosed. The aim of the
conference is to
make security concepts evolves through both the attacker's view AND a
thorough
formalization backed by experimental results.

The main topics covered (list not exhaustive) are:
# Cryptanalysis techniques
# Steganalysis techniques
# Malicious cryptography
# Advances computer virology techniques (malware, backdoor...)
# Active security product analysis and testing
# Active security auditing
# Mathematical concepts and applications with respect to the
attacker's view
# Cyberwarfare techniques
# Cryptographic and steganography techniques
# Invisible trap/bacdoor techniques in algorithms and applications
# Implementation attacks
# Interception/eavesdropping techniques
# Forensics and anti-forensics techniques
# Tempest and anti-tempest techniques
# InfoOps techniques
# Satellite hijacking

Articles should be submitted in electronic format, preferably in LaTeX
format,
in English. Submission of Word/OOwriter documents is accepted. The
address for
submission is iawacs2009@esiea.fr. Submissions under hidden identities
or
aliases are not allowed.A technical challenge will be organized during
the
conference. Attendees who want to participate must register on site.
For this
first edition, the theme we have chosen is "Evaluation against active
antivirus
software to evaluate their resistance to removal by a malicious code."
All
results will be shared with publishers of antivirus concerned. The
technical
details of the challenge will be announced later.

Important dates :
# Submission deadline: July 15th, 2009
# Notification deadline: August 20th, 2009
# Final manuscript submission for inclusion into the proceedings:
September 20th, 2009
# Conference dates: October 23rd - 25th, 2009

The conference proceedings will be published with ISBN by the Presses
Techniques ESIEA. They will be given to registered participants at the
conference and can then be bought on the conference homepage. The
conference
will be held at Ecole SupC)rieure en Informatique, Electronique et
Automatique,
in Laval from Friday 23rd to Sunday 25th, 2009 morning. Each author
will have
45 minutes of speaking time, each presentation will be followed by a
technical
discussion between speakers and listeners. Laval is nice medieval city
located
250 km west from Paris and can be reach by high speed train (TGV) from
Paris
International Airport.

Conference registration amount to 400 euros (includes
proceedings ,coffee
breaks, lunches, cocktail reception, social events on Friday evening and
Saturday evening, the conference, shuttle bus between the hotels and the
conference venue).
