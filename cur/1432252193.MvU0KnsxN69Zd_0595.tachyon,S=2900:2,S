Well, the Bush "supporters" I've met aren't normally so sure. They'll kind 
of hem and haw, or saw "Well, he's got advisors...", or "Well, Kerry ain't 
any better." Once in a while they'll point to Buh's believability or 
decisiveness, but I've never seen anyone (besides Mr Donald) attempt the 
role of super-apolegist for anything the current regime has done.

Oddly, when I see Bush speak, I actually in a weird way kind of like him. Or 
at least, I believe that he believes in what he's doing. Don't get me wrong 
now: he's completely wrong, and a wan smile would cross my lips if his 
meeting with Jesus were hastened quite a bit.
