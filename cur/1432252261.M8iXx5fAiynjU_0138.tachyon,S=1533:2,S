There's another reason (The one ESR states in his essay).

 "Scratching the Itch"

You are working on A and run into a problem B, you can't find an canned 
solution to B so you come up one your self.

You don't care about B, you are more concerned about A so you give B away.

Turns out solving B is a bigger deal to the rest of us than A.
