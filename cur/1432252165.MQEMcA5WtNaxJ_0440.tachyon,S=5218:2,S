Dear Fellow Advertiser!!

Too often you have seen the ads FREE FREE NOTHING TO PAY 
and you try to sign up and taa daa there is a pop up screen 
that tells you for a limited time only pay $39.95 and then 
the price goes up by midnight. What the heck that wasn't 
what you said. So once again you are turned off.

If I pull that stunt on you, you reserve the right to report 
me to whoever.

Listen to this for ABSOLUTELY!! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING down you 
can dream of making a five figure salary and a six figure 
soon after. How soon it depends on your willingness to act 
swiftly.

What did I say? Yes you heard me correctly! You can do it 
and all for FREE. 

<<<WHAT IS REQUIRED>>>

If you can answer the following questions then you are ready.
Do you think that you can find five persons who are in need 
of making some serious income? 
Is there a friend who is always needing your help but they 
have a computer and internet access?
Do you have any 2 hours daily to read and send emails or 
other small tasks?
Well I am looking for you.
Send me your FULL NAME and email address if different to 
this one and the information will be sent to you. YES FREE 
of charge. Not the usual, well a $20 deposit is needed to 
weed out the thril seekers. I know when you respond to this 
email you are serious about making money so that's fine by 
me. Click the link below:

mailto: cuatdtop2@zwallet.com

(Remember that email address it is significant)

<<<PAYMENT>>>
If everybody pool their efforts, after 100 persons a check 
of $500 will be mailed to you. With less than 3000 persons 
you would have qualified for approximately $10000 per month. 
ABSOLUTELY NO PAYMENTS!! As a matter of fact they PAY you 
to JOIN.

Mark Twain said: "If YOU want to be SUCCESSFUL then YOU MUST 
first help others to be successful". With this system you 
are doing just that. Finding YOUR 5 persons and helping 
others to find five because all in all you will then be 
receiving that five figure income in a shorter period than 
imagined. This does not stop you from marketing your other 
opportunities but this will definitely assist along the way 
because you now have the funds to advertise.

<<<ACT NOW>>>
What is your verdict? 
Do you think it is possible? 
If you do then make that critical first step NOW!!
Send me your FULL NAME and email address if different at:

mailto: cuatdtop2@zwallet.com

Garnet
cuatdop2@zwallet.com  and will I Really See You At The Top Too?! (cuatdtop2)

PS. In marketing there is a phrase that says SW - SW - SW - N.
Translation. Some Will, Some Wont, So What, NEXT!
What will it be in your case?

PPS Any other questions let me know. I will keep you up to date 
as to the progress of the group as a whole but the Company keeps 
their own electronic record for your direct payments. 
Minimum check $500.

REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS
Please send a reply with REMOVE A-4 in the subject heading.
