We need a good name for the internet with these attributes:
- not so ad-hoc
- physical layer
- localised/ immediate neighbourhood area mini-nets

- eventually (if useful) a meta network connecting these

Since in general we don't own our internet tubes, the mostly
profit-motivated companies that do have ongoing economic incentive to
centralize, control, be taken over by larger fish.

We need to grok a counter-principle, such that we can over the longer
term reverse this trend.

This requires perhaps some perceivable benefit(s) to the local
neighbours and their phy nodes, to warrant the hour or so required to
connect to each other.

So where could such features/ benefits arise?:
- some new dynamic of torrents?
- local/ community "library" concept?
- privacy?
- anonymity?
