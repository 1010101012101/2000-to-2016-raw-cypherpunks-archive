Demonstrate that a 'business' is a right in the same class as life,
liberty, pursuit of happiness?

It is clear a business is a form of 'pursuit of happiness' but that
doesn't make it equivalent. Rights are something you as an individual have
by mere existance. A 'business' can't exist in that environment, there is
no 'market'.

Do people have a right to work? No. They have a right to try to work. They
can do that by starting their own business or working in somebody elses.
But neither are a 'right' in the sense you want to use them.

People have a right to pursuit happiness, why? Because they are already
unhappy, why? Because if they don't get off their ass something will come
along and eat them.
