Yes, this is a major research project in many universities.  Nobody
has a complete solution for the general case but some solutions for
specific cases.  IBM and Certicom both have hardware computation
platforms that allow a single company to verify its stuff is secure
on remote platforms, but the remote platform is under the control of the
company, it's not a generic PC that any consumer owns.

Personally I think it's impossible.  Once the data is in the clear in some
form it can be copied to some other form.  You can't stop someone from
cheating if you want them to get access to data.

No, it's not possible to ship data around and let anyone see it
*and* prevent it from being copied.  What you can do is create
specific environments for specific applications, and there are already
solutions available for those purposes.  The problem with TCPA and
Palladium is attempting to make it generic.

If one person controls all computers, then the specific solution
becomes possible.  But it just happens that most of us don't like the idea
of one person controling all computers.

Patience, persistence, truth,
