News in a country where newspapers full of the following headlines are 
published are not to be taken by face value:

- The eiffel tower was buit by a chinese
- Edison stole the electric light from a chinese
blah, blah, blah...

A friend of mine (who is married to a singapurean and speaks fluent mandarin 
and cantonese) when in her first trip to china, found these newspapers with 
this prepostorous claims. She bought several of them to shown to her 
husband...

In the chinese customs she had them confiscated...

Cultural propaganda against western values and achievements.
