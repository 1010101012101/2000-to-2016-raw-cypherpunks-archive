In case anyone missed it, Manindra Agrawal and his colleagues at the
Indian Institute of Technology have published a paper

http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/primality.pdf

Which purports to give an O(log(n)^12) deterministic algorithm for
primality testing.

Someone on sci.math reports..

"Hendrik Lenstra just wrote to the Number Theory mailing list saying that
the proof is correct, clever and elegant; and it is elementary except for
one result from analytic number theory needed to establish the running
time."

In other math news, there's a recent survey on the P vs NP Conjecture at

http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll.ps

Of 100 theorists responding, 9 thought NP=P, 61 thought NP!=P, 22 had no
opinion, and 8 quibbled over what axiom system would be used.

The piece includes comments by many of the respondents, including Donald
E. Knuth.
