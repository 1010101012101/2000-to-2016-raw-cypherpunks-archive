We are all just echoes of the voices in his head.

But I did work for a company that owned fabs.  And have kept up with
the semiconductor lit.  Yield is a big deal ---you either fit it on a
square
inch of Si or you don't make it (profitably).

The "profitably" part is a non-issue when you have black budgets,
ie $400 toilet seats.

Bottom line: they're not ahead in tech, but they can make things that
private-co engineeers only dream of.  DesCrack is a suitcase, get it?

I'll let you speculate on AESCrack :-)
