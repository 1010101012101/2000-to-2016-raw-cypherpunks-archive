Then let's make proper use of technology. We want to make sure the ID card
is issued by the correct authority, that's almost exactly what digital
signatures were designed for. Just create some uniform way of computing the
data from the card (easiest would be to just use a plain old-fashioned
smartcard), and check the signature against a publicly known public key.
It's really quite simple.

That is the far bigger problem. Identifying these people simply won't make
any difference. If a person is intent on being a suicide bomber, they will
blow other people up with them, no matter how well we can make an
identification.

Couldn't get the thumbprint idea going that quick, but smartcards and
smartcard readers are already in mass production making my idea not easy,
but possible to get underway in 60 days. Completion though would be a matter
of approximately a decade.

Very good examples of how not to go about it. My idea (while far from
perfect or fully developed) lacks the same bottleneck points, the only
information that needs to be accessed millions of times remains static
across years, with a retrieval rate like that it would be more than possible
to simply broadcast the key over a public broadcasting station along side
the current time, since nobody is watching anyway you could easily take over
the closed captioning for a few seconds to send out the key. I'm clearly not
addressing certification of the key as correct but having the president read
back a hash of it at the state of the union address (couldn't be any more
boring than the rest) would certainly provide some evidence.

I agree, no matter what method is chosen, the possibilities for abuse are
excessive (some of these people can't even be trusted not to use a phone
book improperly, give then some real power and who knows what will happen),
and the value of the target is too great. Let's pretend that my idea is
used. Let's say each card costs $10 to issue. How much is impersonation
worth? Well for something of the impact of Sept 11 it could easily be
estimated at billions of dollars. That will buy a massive amount of computer
power, a large quantity of the world's best mathematicians, and a
significant amount of time. I don't like the odds of DSA against that, it's
too close to the wire right now, supplying a target of this size could be
devastating. That leaves RSA varients, but for billions of dollars and a
significant amount of time 2^80 work (SHA1) isn't that much, some less fully
examined algorithm would have to be used, that presents it's own problems.
Basically the target is simply too big for current standards, once SHA-512
is fully examined there may be a chance, but until then I just don't think
the card everyone idea is cryptographicly feasible. The non-cryptographic
methods would pose additional problems because anything that can be
phyisically made by one person can be physically made by another.

That's true, we certainly lose more people to far more mundane things every
day than the WTC tragedy caused. But at the same time you have to realize
that most people don't think about bee stings as a cause of death, they
don't even think about bed they sleep in as a cause of death (look up the
statistics it's hilarious), and both of those cause vastly more deaths each
year as terrorism on average. The problem is that the media has hyped this
up, the president's handlers have told him that this is a big deal, as a
result of this the general populus wants blood. Thinking people know taht we
will never eliminate terrorism, well I guess on a technicality we could, but
it would require extermination of all but 1 human.

I think that line says it all.
