Youre wrong about Borlaug's greatness, and heres why:

- As any environmentalist can tell you, humanity is a blight on
nature. Anything that kills off a few hundred million or a billion
people is good. Conversely, any effort to save human lives is ipso
facto evil.

- As Senator Robert C Byrd can tell you, only white people matter.
Most of the people saved by Borlaugs innovations were little brown
people. Frankly, the world already has enough of them.

- As any celebrity can tell you, youre not important unless the man
on the street recognizes you and cares about what shampoo you use.

- As any manager or politician can tell you, youre not important
unless you tell other people what to do. Scientists, engineers,
mechanics, and other people who work with their hands are all
interchangeable nobodies.

If youve got watermelons, the KKK, TV news anchors, and Congress
opposed to you, theres no way you can be great.


(Note to people who don't know me and are thickheaded: yes, that was
sarcasm.)
