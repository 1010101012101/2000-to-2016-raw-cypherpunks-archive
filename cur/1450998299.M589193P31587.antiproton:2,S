First and foremost, please recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly<br>
USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193), for which this Glomar response<br>
is so named, was a purely military operation, using custom-built<br>
military equipment, on an exceptionally sensitive military mission to<br>

<br>
Second, observe that existing precedent supports the release of<br>
materials responsive to this request. In American Civil Liberties<br>
Union v. Department of Defense Case No: 04-CV-4151 (ACLU v. DoD) the<br>
courts have affirmed the public interest as compelling argument for<br>
favoring the public interest against clearly military efforts. The<br>
Glomar denial should be well targeted; this targeted falls well<br>
outside of the the "Vulnerabilities Equities Process", which is a<br>
public outreach activity communicating with third party partners,<br>
acting in the public interest, regarding software used by public<br>
citizens and business alike.<br>
<br>
Third, consider that it is a well established technique in the<br>
