No.  Safe distributed computing can be attained without any such
centralized control system.  Just as thermodynamic behavior needs no
centralized system of control of atomic behavior, but rather proceeds by
way of statistical mechanics, so safe mass computations may be accomplished
by application of one engineering branch of statistical mechanics, called
information theory.  The main publications are from the Fifties and
Sixties.

oo--JS.
