It definitely is. A selective enumeration (which it will always be) is
merely a political tool. A comprehensive enumeration is impossible to
assure and costly to produce. And who should bear the costs of such an
enumeration? Society as a whole?

It is simply not fair to make law requiring such enumerations. It is much
better to make theft illegal.

Untruth. "Classical economists" are used to not involving terms they
needn't in providing a price quote. I don't pay the costs? I don't charge
the costs. It is logical, simple, practical.

This is the fault of governance, not economics. Simply, the company should
arrange a license to pollute. The license's cost should equal or exceed the
damage to the community - such that individuals in the community are bottom
line not negatively affected by the alteration.

I need a citation on this. It implies there's "environmental value" being
sacrificed for "value of economic size". Apparently the Chinese do think
their economy is worth the damage to the environment. This is also a
cultural issue. Simply put, the author is being an ignorant presumptuous
prick, pushing his values onto the Chinese government planners. There is
absolutely no evidence of economic miscalculations - merely of a different
subjective valuation of nature (or economy). (And even that is not
substantiated in the article)

It merely implies that people that are less rational will lose the economic
game. (it's true, they do generally lose) (it's also untrue, there's no
rational people. Only coincidence of the particular insanity and reality)

Disease is definitely a hard to model and price item. There's lots of
factors, like how the disease spreads, population densities,
countermeasures, who should carry risks, etc. It goes for humans too,
infectious and unhygienic as we are. I'll think on it some other time.

I thought traffic pollution wasn't in the GDP? We do have pollution related
tax in most nations. Uninterpretable (and uncited) statistic.

Uhh... I really don't know what this is supposed to mean.

Oh, more leisure time is "Genuine Progress"? Less punished activity (crime)
is Genuine Progress? Having natural resources is good, but using them is
what makes them resources in the first place. GPD doesn't factor it
destroyed potential, but GPD is just what it is and nobody is pretending
it's more or less.

I appreciate the idea of a better "how good is your nation doing"
indicator. It's very political, and it's best to avoid bullshit in
statistics.

"We should make those responsible bear the cost for their actions" !=3D "Tr=
ue
Cost Economics"
True Cost Economics is a way for one nation to tell another it needs to do
something. It's just another way to do politics, not economics.

Oh, and making those responsible bear the cost for their action is
absolutely essential for capitalism. Without it we're only doing the
horrible parts of capitalism, not the magical parts.
