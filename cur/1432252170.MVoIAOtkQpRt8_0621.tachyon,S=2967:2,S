In the US they are now selling prepaid phones in electronics stores,
computer stores, and -- my favorite -- some Blockbuster movie rental
locations.  You go in, pick up a box, pay cash at the register, and you're
done.  No information is required at the time of purchase.  Refills
available from various retailers depending upon your service company.
Again, you walk in, pick one up, pay cash, and leave.

Please post the actual experiences about obtaining a
pre-paid cell phone (aka "mobile" in the less
developed
world) without revealing any (correct) identifying
info,
such as address, telephone no, name, etc.

I know that it can be done in Canada. Unsure about US,
UK and the rest of europe.

regards,
