Yes, but all this is more complicated, more difficult to do,
and easier to evade, than sending in goons to a certain shop to
beat the owner insensible and seize his inventory.

A ruler who is competent and violent can accomplish all sorts
of things.  As Napoleon said, you can do anything with bayonets
except sit on them, but in fact you cannot do anything with
bayonets. It is hard to do complicated things.

Leviathan is necessarily far less intelligent than the
individuals that compose it.
