You give too much credence to the USA - communism as practiced by
Stalin's co-horts (different again from Stalinism the modern political
ideology), is sort of like "democracy as practiced by the Western
governments". Both were essentially fascist, certainly statist and
socialist.

And the massive internal inefficiencies, lack of motivators for those at
the top to improve efficiencies of the society overall, and other
problems, were a very large part of the problem - Bush and Clinton
declaring behind closed doors "fuck it, we won, we will expand NATO all
the way to Russia's borders" is mostly just ego on the part of certain
North Americans.

The crazies from the basement are currently running this USA hegemon -
we call them neocons or neo conservatives since they are puppets of the
USA BISMIC - revolving doors and all that, the turbo charging of
sociopathy. In the words of Juan, they're psycopaths! Respecting no
sovereignty, no international law, not the rule of law, not innocence
until proven guilty, no mutual respect for other nations, no respect for
the supreme/ultimate sovereignty of the people (any people - it's own
North American humans or humans anywhere else on the planet).

USA is one seriously psychopathic nation bullying the rest of the world
at the moment and daily droning innumerable humans to death, again all
around the world.

Insanity incarnate.

Let's hope China does not copy the USA's bullying ways when USA falls!

Let's hope for the sake of the world, the the fall of the USA is a soft
landing and not Hillary Psycopath Clinton's world war 3!
