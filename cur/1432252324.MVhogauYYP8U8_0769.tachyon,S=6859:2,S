                           CALL FOR PAPERS

          3rd WORKSHOP ON PRIVACY IN THE ELECTRONIC SOCIETY
                Washington, DC, USA - October 28, 2004
                        Sponsored by ACM SIGSAC
              Held in association with 11th ACM CCS 2004

                 http://seclab.dti.unimi.it/wpes2004

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy issues have been the subject of public debates and the need
for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques has been
widely recognized. Goal of this workshop is to discuss the problems of
privacy in the global interconnected societies and possible solutions
to it. The 2004 Workshop is the third in what we hope will be a yearly
forum for papers on all the different aspects of privacy in today's
electronic society. The first two workshops in the series were held in
Washington, in conjunction with the 9th ACM CCS conference and with
the 10th ACM CCS conference, respectively. The success of the first
two editions of the workshop and the increased interest of the
community in privacy issues, is the main reason for repeating the
event.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting
novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic
privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. We
encourage submissions from other communities such as law and business
that present these communities' perspectives on technological
issues. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- anonymity, pseudonymity, unlinkability
- business model with privacy requirements
- data protection from correlation and leakage attacks
- electronic communication privacy
- information dissemination control
- privacy-aware access control
- privacy in the digital business
- privacy enhancing technologies
- privacy policies and human rights
- privacy and anonymity in Web transactions
- privacy threats
- privacy and confidentiality management
- privacy in the electronic records
- privacy in health care and public administration
- public records and personal privacy
- privacy and virtual identity
- personally identifiable information
- privacy policy enforcement
- privacy and data mining
- relationships between privacy and security
- user profiling
- wireless privacy


PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a
conference with proceedings. Papers should be at most 15 pages
excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices (using 11-point
font and reasonable margins on letter-size paper), and at most 20
pages total. Committee members are not required to read the
appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without
them. Papers should have a cover page with the title, authors,
abstract and contact information.


Authors are invited to submit their contributions electronically
through the web site
http://seclab.dti.unimi.it/wpes2004/submissions.html. Submission must
be in the form of a ps (Postscript), or pdf (Adobe) file. Do NOT
submit files formatted for word processing packages (e.g., Microsoft
Word or WordPerfect files).

Papers must be received by the deadline of June 11, 2004 in order to
be considered. Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to
authors by August 2, 2004. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee
that their paper will be presented at the workshop. Accepted papers
will be published by the ACM in a conference proceedings.
