How would you do it? Would you lift public key exchange from OpenSSL or 
GPG? Or just package a snapshot of GPG with Speak Freely, and adapt the 
call syntax?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I am elated that the development of Speak Freely is continuing. I think it
is one of the best Voice over IP applications I have ever tried. I have
been using Speak Freely for at least 8 or 9 years now. I have also been
using PGP since version 2.3a was released. I have yet to get Speak Freely
to interface with PGP the way it is supposed to as per the help file. I
have tried many times with friends also equally adept at PGP and Speak
Freely. We've never been able to have any success. We always have to
generate a key and exchange it through encrypted e-mail.

I would dearly love to have someone provide a step by step tutorial on how
we should proceed. Or, if as I suspect, it doesn't work, I'd like to know
that as well so I can stop losing sleep over it! :-) Any advice or help
would put me forever in your debt. Thanks in advance!
