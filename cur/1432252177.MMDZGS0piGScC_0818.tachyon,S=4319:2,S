I agree they should. But this war was not sanctioned by the UN, nor did 
the US ratify the ICC. Sure, the British and spanish and Italian where 
along for the ride, but the US Administration made it clear several 
times that THEY are going to call the shots on Iraq.

Agreed.

If the US is serious to establish a democracy in Iraq than this would 
also mean a reform of the Criminal Justice system. Most likely built on 
the "best" system in the world and that would make it the US one, no?
