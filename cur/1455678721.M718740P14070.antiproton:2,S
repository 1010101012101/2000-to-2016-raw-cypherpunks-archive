** Law Enforcement Online: Innovative Doesn=E2=80=99t Mean Illegal (https=

Even the Wild West needed a sheriff. And today=E2=80=99s law enforcement =
agents, to be effective, need more than a Colt .45 and a gold star. Crimi=
nal actors have an increasing ability to commit serious crimes remotely v=
ia computers, while concealing their identity and location through the us=
e of various means, including Tor hidden service protocols. To effectivel=
y identify and apprehend these criminals, law enforcement must be nimble =
and technologically savvy, and must employ regularly updated investigativ=
e tools. These tools include Network Investigative Techniques (NITs), whi=
ch enable law enforcement (pursuant to court-authorized warrants) to iden=
tify the real IP address of web users, regardless of proxy settings. Some=
 NITs also reveal users=E2=80=99 operating systems, CPU architecture, and=
 session identification, and others (pursuant to a Title III or FISA warr=
ant) can allow real-time, full-system monitoring.

There has been some level of controversy recently regarding the FBI=E2=80=
=99s use of NITs. But as criminals evolve and become increasingly sophist=
icated through the use of Tor and encryption techniques, so too must law =
enforcement=E2=80=99s investigative measures evolve, provided they are em=
ployed in accordance with lawful procedures and adequate constitutional s=
afeguards.

It was through a NIT that the FBI, in 2015, was able to successfully take=
 down one of the largest dark web child exploitation sites in the world, =
to apprehend child predators. The site, disturbingly named =E2=80=9CPlayp=
en,=E2=80=9D provided thousands of pedophiles (http://www.scmagazine.com/=
staten-island-man-arrested-for-allegedly-possessing-child-pornography/art=
icle/442589/) with images of horrifying sexual abuse of children, as well=
 as guidance on how the molesters could avoid being detected. The Playpen=
 site is reported to have had as many as 215,000 accounts within the firs=
t year, and an average of 11,000 unique visitors per week. The FBI, pursu=
ant to a court order (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/feds-bus=
t-through-huge-tor-hidden-child-porn-site-using-questionable-malware/) , =
seized the web host server in North Carolina and, rather than shutting it=
 down immediately, ran it under FBI control for a limited, two-week perio=
d. During that time, the FBI used a NIT, which exploited a security vulne=
rability in the Tor Browser Bundle, to identify more than 1,300 true IP a=
ddresses.=20
