I don't really see how anything could be fixed or like what steps gamers
should take to fix it? Also I haven't seen any bribing accusations and if
someone would have a proof, I'm sure there would huge backslash and
probably lawsuit. Of course gamers know that EA is 2nd worst game company,
right after Ubisoft, but there's nothing really changeable about it as a
lot of people still buy their games and will continue to do so, because
they've some good games and others just don't care about it. Anyway people
talk most about what other's share and talk about so that's exactly why
there's nothing much about anything else, people just don't talk about it.
So you really need some controversially otherwise that story won't be
talked about, because there's nothing more to say than - "that's bad".

know only single such case about 1 game. And I haven't seen any harassers
admitting that they do it for GamerGate or journalism, but IMO they're just
trolls who like to use this opportunity. They like publicity (even if it's
bad) and that's what they're getting. I'm not sure if you can imagine this
mindset, but I can't deny that it must be exciting to read news story about
death threats you wrote. It actually encourages to do it again. There's
well know internet Rule 14 "Do not argue with trolls =E2=80=94 it means tha=

without precisely defined goal and means how to acquire it. It's somewhat
similar to Anonymous. Also why anti-GamerGate people can't be bothered
policing their own ranks? There are a lot of examples how they harass
GamerGate supporters, eg.
https://twitter.com/QueenyMartha/status/522531549393076224 and for a lot
more look http://gamergateharassment.tumblr.com/  Like I said, trolls are
everywhere. And actually you're wrong about this, there are so called
"#GamerGate Harassment Patrol" where they report any harassment they see,
look at this
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/10/25/While-the-Media-Slanders-=
Gamers-as-Terrorists-GamerGate-Is-Hunting-Trolls-and-Abusers
while anti-GamerGate just keep claiming how misogynistic GamerGate is
without doing anything else. To be honest, I don't see their point at all.
Let's assume that GamerGate indeed is all misogynists and so what? It's not
like anything will change because some feminists are offended.

that so much that they don't see anything else.


Anyway I've too different opinion about this and IMO this discussion is
pointless timewaste. I would even say it could be classified as spam for
this list as I don't really see what's here related to Cyberpunk.
