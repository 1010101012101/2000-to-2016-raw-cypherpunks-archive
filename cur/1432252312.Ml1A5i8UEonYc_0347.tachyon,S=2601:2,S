Doesn't the commentary have equal if not superior status?

Sanhedrin 59a I took the trouble to look up. In fact it says that a non-Jew 
who studies the Torah deserves death. It also says he is a "High Priest" and 
rounds off with a discussion of which animals one may cut living parts from 
and eat.

Whether googling the rabbinical Law qualifies me for the death penalty is 
unclear.

cheers,
Tim
