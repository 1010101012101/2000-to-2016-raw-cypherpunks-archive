What we need is less code, and crypto you can run with a
pencil and an notebook. And cpunks is good practice to 
keep your wits about you.

It's kinda hilarious. Personally I've developed a nice sales
resistance to neo-anarchist and fasco-libertarian ideology, 
*cough* bitcoin *cough* which I actually find more irritating
than the New Left BS.

As for beating a crowd of USENET veterans.. Didn't that crowd
all decide it's easier to whore themselves out to the spooks 
to pay the mortgage rather than look at how crypto might enable
distributed authoritarian-resistant financial systems? 

If Bitcoin is the answer I'm going to be laughing for weeks.


And really, what's with all the slut-shaming?? Come on, have 
some respect for the oldest profession in the world. If we're
actually going to discuss a real important cpunk issue maybe
it should be to show some respect for the whores as they would
be in the best position to infect the system.
