Someone who is too blind to recognize evil when it heaves a
rock at his head needs some more rocks in the face to improve
his vision.

Those pashtun were not enraged because Israel dispossesses
and mistreats palestinians in a far away country.  They are
enraged because they cannot dispossess and murder their
neighbors.

Like any sensible person far away from either Palestine or
New York, they have little concern for the crimes of either
Bin Laden or Sharon.

However a short while ago, the Taliban was slaughtering
various minority groups, throwing their bodies into wells to
poison the ground water, bulldozing their houses and
irrigation ditches, cutting down their mulberry trees and
bulldozing their vines.  Now they cannot do that any more.  I
hope Fisk goes back there for some more beatings.
