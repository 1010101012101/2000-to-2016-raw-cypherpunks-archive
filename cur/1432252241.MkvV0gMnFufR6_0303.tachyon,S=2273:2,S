   Budenny writes "The Register has a story in its [1]ongoing coverage of
   the UK ID Card story. This one suggests, with links to a weekend news
   story, that the Prime Minister in waiting has bought the idea that all
   electronic transactions in the UK should be linked to a central
   government/police database. Every cash withdrawal, every credit card
   purchase, ever loyalty card use ... And that data should flow back
   from the police database to (eg) a loyalty card use. So, for example,
   not only would the government know what books you were buying, but the
   bookstore would also know if you had an outstanding speeding ticket!"
