Well, I went through my "working on a book" phase in 1988-91, when I 
was working feverishly for many hours a day on my Great Crypto 
Anarchic Novel. (At least many of the ideas for the novel turned out 
to be useful for the Next Phase, which was Cypherpunks.)

I, at least, never fell prey to the Usual Malarkey of thinking that 
all I needed to do was feed some ideas to a Real Writer who would 
then help me finish it, or collaborate.

Fact is, generating a book is hard work. In terms of lining up the 
publishers, editors, etc. The actual writing may not be too hard, 
based on some of the fluff I see out there. (Some of the 120-page 
pieces of fluff by Silicon Valley types, for example, which look like 
something easily generated by anyone with even modest writing skills. 
In fact, I'm sure most of these books by Valley CEOs are, naturally, 
ghost-written.)

See!

At least we don't hear this kind of tripe at Bay Area gatherings. 
People are too aware of how foolish this stuff sounds.
