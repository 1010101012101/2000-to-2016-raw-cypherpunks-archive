Ah, not sure why that did that...

But, more to the point - you shouldn't try to read minds and draw
conclusions from sentence fragments. You are not a good mind reader.

.... a centralized group of servers to distributed not only content but
the indexes. The only real distinction between the two is where the
content resides, not a significant distiction since the system still has
centralized servers.

But more importantly the original claim which you just jumped right over
about the intellectual property being somehow different between USENET and
Napster and that if Napster fell down it would take significantly longer
to recover than USENET is simply bogus.

More 'let's give Jim shit because he keeps poking holes in our favorite
thoeries' than 'stick to the topic at hand'.
