All you need is
1. A few activists incl. a few to capture the content (eg, videographer,

photographer) who are willing to carry a few extra pounds
2. Someone to pony up the equiptment (some of which must be treated as
expendable)
3. Someone to set up & test the rig with the deployees.

Depending on your circles, you may find each of these types in different
abundances.
