Many of you may have seen news items about another attempt to form a 
government in Somalia.

Many of you may have seen a news item that the president entered Mogadishu, 
the former capital of former Somalia, surrounded by a large military force, 
and was warmly welcomed.

Well it seems that most of that force was not fighters loyal to the 
president, but fighters loyal to various factions and conflicting and 
incompatible special interests to which the president had made all sorts of 
promises.  It is not clear to what extent the forces were there to protect 
him and ensure he was obeyed, and to what extent they were there to make 
sure he delivered on his diverse promises to diverse interest groups.

The president entered Mogadishu without a shot fired.  He also left it 
without a shot fired, though a few prominent Somalis have announced a 
policy of killing him on sight.

As far as anyone can tell the president spent one day in Somalia, and is 
now back to leading a government-in-exile.

This does not mean that the attempt to form a government has failed, but it 
has not yet succeeded.
