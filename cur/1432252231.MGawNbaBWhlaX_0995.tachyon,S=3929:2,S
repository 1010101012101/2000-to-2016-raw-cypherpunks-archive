You were already in a frenzy of rage before I accused you of 
weeping big salt tears for poor little victimized Saddam.

My position on the Vietnam and Iraq wars is the same as that as 
the mainstream left of the Democratic party (or at least the 
same as the position they will be holding once the primaries 
are over), yet you reacted as if I had called for everyone like 
you to be gassed.

The position you purport to hold is almost indistinguishable 
from my own and that of the Democrat party mainstream -- but 
that is not the position implied by your arguments, nor does it 
correspond to the emotions you express.   Sometimes the 
position nominally taken by leading Democrats fail to 
correspond to the arguments and emotions they express also -- 
Dean has caught some flack for that -- but the discrepancy in 
your case has is far more visible than that of Dean,    You 
will not catch Dean weeping big salt tears for Saddam, nor see 
him deeply shocked by the prospect that Saddam will be tried by 
his victims. and Dean has a legitimate excuse for his
comparativelyt mild hypocrisy -- he is upset about the the
impact of the coming execution of Saddam on his election
campaign, not about the impact on the prospects for a world of
slavery and fear.
