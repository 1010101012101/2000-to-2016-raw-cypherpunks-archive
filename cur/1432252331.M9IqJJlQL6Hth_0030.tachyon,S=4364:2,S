There is also the FAQ-ization of a contentful group.  You yourself
have (rightfully, usefully) pointed to your cryptnomicon tome
and cypherpunk archives rather than regurgitate something already written.

The toadlist is infested with spam, and most posters have migrated to
something
more pleasant like lne.com (blessed be the lne.com folks).

Yes!  His contribution was very useful and generous at a critical time, 
but it is not a negative thing at all that he closes that spamchannel.
