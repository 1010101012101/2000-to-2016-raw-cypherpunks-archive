Good point.  At least I hope they don't. :-)

Perhaps it did, but the licence agreement was unenforceable.  It's
clearly reverse engineering for interoperability (between Linux and DVD
players) so the legal exemption applies.  You can't escape the exemption
by contract.  Now, you might say that morally he should obey the
agreement he made.  My view is that there is a reason why this type of
contract is unenforceable; you might as well take advantage of the
exemption.

The prosecution was on some nonsense charge that amounted to him
burgling his own house.  A statute that was meant to penalise computer
break-ins was used against someone who owned the computer that he broke
into.

Right, but it has an odd effect too.  No legal system gives people
complete freedom to contract.  Suppose you really, really want to exempt
a shop from liability if your new toaster explodes.  You can't do it;
the legal system does not give you the freedom to contract in that way.

DRM, however, gives people complete freedom to make contracts about how
they will deal with digital content.  Under EU single market rules, a
contract term to the effect that you could pass on your content to
someone in the UK but not the rest of the EU is unenforceable.  No
problem for DRM though...

I think lawyers will hate this.
