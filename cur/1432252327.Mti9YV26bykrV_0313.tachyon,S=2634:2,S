"A calendar which was printed in Egypt and
for the month of September shows a
crashing passenger plane with Manhattan
and the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop --
and which was printed in May, a full three
months before the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on America -- has caused an
uproar in the Dutch town of Almere,
Netherlands, the newspaper De Telegraaf
reported yesterday."
