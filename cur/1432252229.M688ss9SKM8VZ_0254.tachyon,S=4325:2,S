[Jim sent me the below message directly without any indication that it was 
also sent to the list. But from past experience, I know better. Another 
example of not-quite-adequate Choatian social norms.]

Anyway, Jim is conflating physical control over an instantiation of IP with 
the rights conferred by IP law. If someone copies Microsoft Word (or a Tom 
Clancy novel) onto a CDROM and gives it to me, I am not liable.
