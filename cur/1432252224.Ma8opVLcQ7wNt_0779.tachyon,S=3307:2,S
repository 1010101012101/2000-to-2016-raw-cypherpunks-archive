Why?

There are two main reasons honest people start banks -
- either they want to make a profit / gain control / etc.
- or else they want to get banking services with some
         predictability they're not finding in the commercial market,
         e.g. in the US, this is a Credit Union,
         or in many cultures, this is some family or private
         group that lends money to each other.
