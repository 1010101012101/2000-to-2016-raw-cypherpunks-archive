"BREAKING: According to Michael Ratner attorney for WikiLeaks
Anonymous has been officially designated a "Malicious Foreign Actor"
by the NSA"
- https://twitter.com/CommanderXanon/status/614153130268299264

designation of "Malicious Foreign Actor" would explain the use of
indiscriminate military technology against an entire venue because of

P.P.S. the "kit falling over" was because they tied the automated
exploitation to DHCP assignment once device connected to 3G/4G data
network. by using DHCP-Relay to inject thousands of lease requests
over a single link, their fork-bomb'ed gear fell over, with haste. i
hope it fucked your intercepts, jerks!  [ this kind of un-targeted
mass surveillance is just as abhorrent as warrantless wiretaps on the
backbone, even if the scope is limited.]
