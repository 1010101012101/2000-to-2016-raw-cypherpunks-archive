Exactly correct.

Suppose you take an old-style film camera, one without any sort of automatic
exposure adjustments, to the bright, sunlit beach, and adjusted it to take
good pictures with correct exposures.  Then you wait 12 hours, and it is 
nighttime.  You do not adjust your camera's settings. If you take a picture
of the sky (except possibly for the Moon) you will see...nothing.  

But if you open up the aperture (a variable-diameter shutter designed to allow 
more, or less, area for light to come in and expose the film), and perhaps if you 
increased the shutter-speed from, say, 1/1000 second to maybe 10 seconds (and
putting the camera on a tripod to ensure it doesn't move), THEN you will be able
to photograph stars.

That should be easy.  And it would be far easier if built onto that object are
 some microwave-sized  "corner cubes reflectors" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_reflector
 , which have the peculiar property of sending radar (or light, etc) directly back in the direction
 from which it came.  Optical corner-cubes are easy to find:  They are on the backs of cars, and are
used as visual retroreflectors on roads.  They are much better than Scotchlite  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflective_sheeting , which is made from
tiny glass spheres.
