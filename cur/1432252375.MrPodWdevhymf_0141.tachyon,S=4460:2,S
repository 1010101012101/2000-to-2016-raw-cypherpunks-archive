I fully support this comment that the whole issue of "legality"  is a 
"side show."


We've known that keyboard sniffers were a major issue for many years. 
I remember describing the sniffers ("keystroke recorders") which were 
widely available for Macs in the early 90s. Others cited such 
recorders for Windows and Unices.

We discussed at early CP meetings the issue, with various proposed 
solutions. (For example, pass phrases stored in rings, pendants, 
Newtons, Pilots. For example, zero knowledge approaches. For example, 
reliance on laptops always in physical possession.)

Frankly, the PGP community veered off the track toward crapola about 
standards, escrow, etc., instead of concentrating on the core issues. 
PGP as text is a solved problem. The rest of the story is to ensure 
that pass phrases and keys are not black-bagged.

Forget fancy GUIs, forget standards...concentrate on the real threat model.
