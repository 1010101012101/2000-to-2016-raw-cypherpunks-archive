Naturally, statists always run to the government for backup (gun-wielding
thugs) when they are in trouble.

So why is this even called "a political dirty trick?"   Don't they call this
"opposition research"?

Obviously a 1st-amendment violation.

It seems there's a real problem with this.  Even if we assume the "legality"
of the anti-anonymous-attack law mentioned above, it seems to me that the
police would have no probable cause to investigate an incident when they had
no evidence that a crime had actually yet occurred.  This would be
particularly true if there was no other obvious crime being committed:  A
publication of true facts about a political candidate, even anonymously,
would not necessarily trigger the law's $300 limit.

Looks to me like the police were doing a political favor in looking into
this case.

Actually, it probably DIDN'T _really_ give them genuine "probable cause."
It gave them what should be best described as "possible cause":  It
indicated that Gunhus had POSSIBLY violated a (unconstitutional) law.  (Or
someone living with her, etc...)

("Probable cause" is one of the most seriously abused concepts in American
law these days, even more then "beyond a reasonable doubt."  IMNSHO, they
can't possibly have "probable cause" if they can't prove at least a 51%
probability that a crime has been committed and the location of the search
contained evidence of the crime.  They probably rarely have this.)

Seems he deserved it.
