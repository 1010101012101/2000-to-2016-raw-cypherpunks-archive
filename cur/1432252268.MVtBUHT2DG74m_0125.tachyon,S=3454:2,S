Indeed, and also "autoregicide". There are few opportunities for that.

Apparently it is not the Done Thing in Nepal to accuse the king of any
wrongdoing - in fact he has immunity from all prosecution or legal
process. (Here in UK you can sue the monarch & it has happened now and
again). So they were forced, when Dipendra (did I spell that right) way
in intensive care but legally king to say he didn't do it because as
king he could have done no wrong.

There is a way out of their logical cleft stick. As prince (if we assume
the initial reports are true, which of course we don't know) he was a
murderer. He became king as soon as he had done the deed. As king he was
the embodiment of justice and promptly executed the culprit, himself.
