Slander is harming another. The fact that speech is involved is irrelevant
to the fact you're causing measurable harm to another. Simply because you
use speech as some component, and speech is protected, doesn't mean the
larger process should inherit the protection.

I realize this is confusing, but keep practicing. You won't have as hard
a time as you did with sex, I promise.

Not at all. It's recognizing a significant, but subtle distinction. One
you miss by a mile.
