  Thanks to John Gilmore's law suit, which he lost but which also had the
judge rule that on domestic flights no IDs were required, anyone with the
balls can now do so safely.  An excellent piece by a person unafraid to
insist on his rights.

  One "minor" problem with this is booking the reservation.  Doing so at
the time of travel means you'll pay full fare.  Book on-line and you'll
need a credit card.  If any on the list would like to use one of our VCCs
to book a reservation and fly without ID please contact us.
