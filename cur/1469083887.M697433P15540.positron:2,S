	So, what point were you making? Syverson and co. did the only
	thing they could have done if they wanted to help the US nazi
	military - What exactly is 'respectable' about that? 

	Any 'good' they did, they did it only as means to do as much
	damage as they could.

	I don't know. What I do know is that the ones who created the
	system and misrepresent it are syverson and co.

	If you don't want to use basic reasoning skills and want to
	ignore evidence regarding how far the sabotage of internet
	'security' goes, that's your problem.

	So what. You know, to me you sound like a christian who
	want to believe bullshit because he doesn't want to face
	reality. Is the tor fairy tale comforting?

	Not the issue at hand...

	If you expect help from the establishment you certainly are fucked.
