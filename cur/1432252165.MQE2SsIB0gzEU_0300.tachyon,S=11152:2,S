Now I certainly don't agree with a lot of Chomsky, bvut this dude clearly 
has an axe to grind. For instance,

"After 9/11, he was more concerned about a fictitious famine in Afghanistan
than about the nearly 3,000 incinerated in The World Trade Center attacks."

What a fucking idiot. The 3000 were already dead, the 'famine' was 
about-to-be. A Chomsky nut could say Chomsky helped avert complete 
catastrophe (though there apparently was a decent amount of famine after 
all, but nothing like 3MM.)

But this misses the point. Mr Donald will no doubt chime in yammering on 
about Chomsky's "lies", but that also misses the point. Chomsky makes very 
strong arguments supporting a very different view of world events, and he 
often quotes primary and secondary sources. If you are going to disagree 
with Chomsky (and in many areas I do), then you've got to actually get off 
your lazy ass and look up the sources and do some f-in' homework. Only then 
are you qualified to refute him.
