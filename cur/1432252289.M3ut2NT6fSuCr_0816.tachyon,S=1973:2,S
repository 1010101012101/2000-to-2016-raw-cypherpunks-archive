Someone please correct my memory if it's wrong, but didn't Variola post a 
signed statement to the effect of "Maj. Variola, Ret. is/was a 
multiple-person account", which had been either compromised or revoked or 
otherwise to be considered null and void? 

I ask because I distinctly remember *some* pseudonymous acct. doing it, 
and memory says it was Variola - yet Variola continues to be used as a nym 
by at least one person.

So, am I remembering the wrong account being burned or not?  Variola?
