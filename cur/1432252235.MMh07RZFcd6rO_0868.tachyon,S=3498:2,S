Leaping over the Firewall: A Review of Censorship Circumvention Tools

Time: Tuesday, April 12, 2011, 12:00pm- 2:00pm

Location: 

Freedom House
1301 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC, USA 20036

Lunch will be provided

As the recent shift in political landscape within the Middle East has shown, the Internet is increasingly influencing the way that citizens around the world gather and distribute information. While these changes occur, it is vital that people are aware of how to protect themselves online and how to access information, news, and facts, when the Internet is censored.

While there are sites that recognize the effectiveness of circumvention tools, there are none that assess the effectiveness of circumvention tools systematically. Freedom House has used its expertise and relationships with leading academic experts on information technology security, censorship, and software development to conduct a systematic assessment of how censorship circumvention tools perform in practice inside the countries they are designed to serve.

Freedom House's Internet Freedom Project Director, Robert Guerra, will join major report contributors Cormac Callanan, director of Ireland-based Aconite Internet Solutions with experience in international computer networks and cybercrime, and Hein Dries-Ziekenheimer, the CEO of VIGILO consult, a Netherlands based consultancy specializing in Internet enforcement, cybercrime, and IT law, to discuss the findings of the report and its implications in the world of Internet privacy and censorship circumvention.

The event will be broadcast live over the Internet. A link to the broadcast will be sent out prior to the beginning of the event.
