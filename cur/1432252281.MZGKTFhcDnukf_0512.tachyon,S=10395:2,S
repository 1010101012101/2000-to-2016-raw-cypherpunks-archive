Not surprising that it should "set off quite a few bells." The 
technologies are likely to profoundly change a lot of things, and 
ring a lot of bells.

Christopher Fazekas is thinking about the issue from the wrong 
perspective. It is not a matter of society deciding, or him deciding, 
or the voters deciding, whether or not to "cast to the wayside" 
certain systems, any more so than society faced a social decision to 
accept or reject the implications of the printing press, or the 
telephone, or technology in general. (See, for example, numerous 
historical studies. A recent one is Ithiel de sola Pool's 
"Technologies of Freedom," focussing on the telephone and its 
implications for society.

A few societies have attempted to make the judgement call that some 
technology, even a whole set of technologies, needed to be rejected. 
China, for example, withdrew its trading/exploration fleets and 
banned many technologies...this back in the middle of the last 
millennium. (And, some would say, in later echoes...)

Usually it is well-nigh impossible to ban such technologies, and 
rulers end up fighting delaying actions only. Examples abound in the 
past century, from control of birth control information to control of 
copying machines. I think it certain that strong crypto and its 
implications is already well along and cannot be reversed or even 
effectively reigned in. (Metaphors as appropriate: genie out of the 
bottle, Pandora's box open, fire already stolen from the gods, horses 
out of the barn, etc.)

I expect that Mr.  Fazekas, now that he has been more thoroughly 
exposed to these ideas, will be able to see the upcoming "fork in the 
road":


Path 1: Strong crypto is restricted, communications are widely and 
pervasively tapped, the First and Fourth Amendments are gutted, rules 
of evidence are changed, all financial transactions are required to 
be reported, communication across national borders is restricted, 
travel to foreign nations is strictly controlled, etc.

(I'll leave it for a later discussion, if there's any doubt, about 
just how difficult it has already become to attempt _any_ of these 
measures. I spelled it out in 1988 in my Crypto Anarchist 
Manifesto--transparent borders, satellites, steganography, etc. Kevin 
Kelly's book "Out of Control" includes my circa 1990 outlook on the 
difficulties facing those who would attempt to control bits.)

Path 2: Citizen-units ignore rules (a la Napster, Gnutella, Freenet), 
they do what they want. Lots of bandwidth sloshing around, lots of 
"degrees of freedom" (a key concept from control theory/physics, and 
a good punning connection to crypto anarchy). Governments freak out 
as the sheeple are downloading files, vising Neo-Nazi and porn Web 
sites, exchanging lists of those Clinton had killed, and so on. 
Clerics call for more control, ragheads demand disconnecting from the 
Satanic West. Politicians scream about "saving the children." But 
nothing does more than slightly slow the inrushing wave. Governments 
warn about how digital money will undermine tax collection and faith 
in the entire system...Cypherpunks say "Yep, that's what we were 
saying more than ten years ago." Academics write papers on the 
implications of regulatory arbitrage, on the undermining of 
international law. Meanwhile, more bandwidth, more untaxed 
transactions, more offshore gambling, more porn, more political 
sites. Even women in Saudi Arabia discover that birth control 
information denied to them locally is available on the Net...though 
they'd better use anonymous remailers and ZKS and Mojo Nation!

Is there a "middle path"? Can the center hold, as the Brits would ask?

Doesn't look like it to me. Oh, sure, there will still be taxes. The 
governments can still tax houses, and cars, and threaten meatspace 
people with various dire actions if they don't cough up some geld to 
the protection racket. But the exponential increase in bandwidth and 
the accompanying degrees of freedom will forever change things 
politically.

And this is not new. I mentioned printing. It revolutionized Europe 
and led to the destruction of guilds--the "intellectual property" 
holders of their day. (Make no mistake, the Guild of Leather Tanners 
"owned" their knowledge in a way quite similar to how modern 
corporations and governments claim to own knowledge.) Printing made 
"how to" books possible (the next most popular books after religious 
hymnals and bibles). The power of guilds began to decline. Likewise, 
religion changed dramatically...courtesy of "95 Theses" and 
accessibility of pamphlets and bibles written in the common languages 
of the time.

The Industrial Revolution was another "knowledgequake" which 
triggered vast changes in the landscape of politics, the law, and 
everything else. Including taxation, interestingly enough. (Left to 
the reader to consider how modern factories made possible certain 
types of taxation and centralization of power.)

Suppose an earlier version of Mr. Fazekas was asking whether these 
changes--printing, steam engines, factory production, 
electrification, automobiles, computers, the list is long--should be 
"allowed"? Allowed by _whom_?

Now, I grant that we don't know yet know if the Net and its related 
technologies (crypto, notably) is comparable to the invention of 
printing and the Industrial Revolution. Or even as important as the 
telephone.

Personally, I think the Net--or, more broadly, the colonization of 
cyberspace--is a dramatic, world-changing event. Not exactly a 
surprising revelation to most folks today, given the changes in just 
the past five years that Web browsers have been commonly available. 
But profound nonetheless.

Where will government be in twenty years? What will happen to local 
laws when cyberspace makes movement around the world so easy? When 
regulatory arbitrage moots nearly any law? When untraceable and 
unbreakable crypto allows "impenetrable bobbles" (a la Vinge) to be 
erected at will? When digital reputations, handled on a peer-to-peer 
basis and not subject to "top-down" commands, become the currency of 
cypherspace?

Unrealistic? Check back in a decade and see where things are headed.

Meanwhile, I welcome Mr. Fazekas to our community.
