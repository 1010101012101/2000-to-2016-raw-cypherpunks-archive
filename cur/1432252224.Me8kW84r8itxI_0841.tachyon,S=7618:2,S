Uh, no.

If I were a duly appointed law enforcement official I could arrest you for the
kind of shoes you were wearing.  You'll have recourse eventually, but it will
be after a 24 hour (or so) stay in the pokey and posting bail and hiring an
attorney, and....

> Maybe "know" is a little strong, "suspect" is probably a better way of
putting it.

You're reaching for the criteria by which the legitimacy of the arrest will be
judged ex post.  The terms you are grappling to find are "reasonable
suspicion" and "probable cause."  The point you are missing is that typically
the only downside for the officer in making an "illegal arrest" is that the
case will get tossed.  Big deal.

Probable cause to arrest exists where facts and circumstances within officers'
knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are
sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the
belief that an offense has been or is being committed; it is not necessary
that the officer possess knowledge of acts sufficient to establish guilt, but
more than mere suspicion is required.

I suggest you attend 3 years of law school or otherwise educate yourself in
the matter before presenting yourself as an authority on the issue and
blathering off for paragraphs on end about nothing in particular.  Sheesh, at
least invest in a copy of black's law dictionary or something.  It's common
respect for the rest of the list members.

> Nonsense. In a LARGE percentage of the stuff a police officer deals with,
there are no constitutional issues (other than the 4th). Robbery, murder,
drunk driving, and the vast majority of traffic violations there aren't many
constitutional issues involved in the laws the enforce, there may be some
issues in *how* they enforce them (4th, 5th, and 6th) but little on what they
enforce.

There are constitutional issues in every interaction with police and citizens.
The question is if they are raised or significant enough to be regarded in the
judicial system.  Probable cause to make an arrest is but one of the issues
that is triggered on every arrest or other police action.

To you the only "questionable" areas are the 1st and 2nd amendments?

Chicago does this.  It requires registration for all handguns.  No
registrations have been issued since the early 70s or so.  It's been
challenged over and over.  It stands.  And will.

The rest of this drivel deleted.  (Is Detweiller back or what?  If so, he's
violating his consent decree).
