I have one here at work. Works wonders. I didn't build it myself though.
I actually paid the subscription too. The $20 seemed worthile to me. I
don't see anywhere in this thing that allows me to make it a vpn
endpoint, but I do have ipsec passthrough enabled and it works fine.

I don't know what you have in mind, but I'm all for it. If this thing
becomes a vpn endpoint that helps me out some, though the 200mhz proc
might not handle as much as I'd like...
