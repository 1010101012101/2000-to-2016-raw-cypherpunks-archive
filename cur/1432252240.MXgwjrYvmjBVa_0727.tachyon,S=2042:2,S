But asymm warfare has to accomplish its goal.  It's not being very
successful.  The only people who are siding with al-qaeda are those whose
brains are already mush -statist socialists, to be precise.  If al qaeda
bombed government buildings or targetted the private residences or offices
of government officials, they might get more sympathy, from me at least.
Destroying an pair of buildings and killing thousands of citizens -most of
whom couldn't give an accurate account of U.S. forces distribution in the
MidEast- is not a step forward.
