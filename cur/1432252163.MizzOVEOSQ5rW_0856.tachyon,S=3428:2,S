What a simplistic and self serving viewpoint.

"What I do is ok because I'm a good person, what they do is bad because
 they're bad people."

Got a newsflash bubba, people(!) do both good and bad things. There is no
such thing as a 'good' or a bad 'person' per se. Just self-serving
bigotry and self-justification, and nobody escapes either.
