I think you are thinking in terms of the American age scale - In england
(and over most of europe although obviously it varies), 18 is old enough
to marry without parental permission, be served in a bar, drive, and be a
practicing homosexual.  At 16 you can have hetrosexual relationships,
marry with parental permission, work (and pay taxes) and rent property in
your own name (you can *own* property from 12)

Most schooling ends at 16, college 18, university (assuming a 3 year
course) 21. I would assume a german at 18 is either at university or
considered of employable age - well into majority.  So legally, "man" is
ok - obviously, this is a shallow typical Skript Kiddie who probably still
lives with his parents, but legally that isn't the case.
