As per multiple request, the weekly mboxes for the Cypherpunks mailing 
list (LNE node) are available at my cpunks archive site:
   http://archives.abditum.com/cypherpunks/

The hypermail conversions are available as before, with new links to the 
.tgz mboxes.

These mboxes are exactly as produced by my mail client. In particular, 
email addresses are not munged. The consensus of those who answered by 
"concerns" mail seems to be that spammers wouldn't get any useful 
addresses from the mboxes that they couldn't get more easily by other 
means.

Annual sets will be added as appropriate to the bottom of the page. So 
far, there's only a 2002 set.
