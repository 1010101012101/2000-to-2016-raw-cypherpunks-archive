The religious person is always battling against reality wich with a minimum 
of inteligence from the observer always bring doubts on the truth of his 
faith.

It's a state of mind wich  can only be compared with mental ilness...
(I've read that there are even some neurological similarities between the 
faithful and the mentaly ill)

The author of that statement: "I have no need of that hipotheses" was 
Laplace, french mathematician on answering Napoleon's question in why is book 
on newtonian mechanics didn't call for god.
