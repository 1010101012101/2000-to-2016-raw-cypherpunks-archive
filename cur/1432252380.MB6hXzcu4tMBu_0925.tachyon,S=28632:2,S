'Spooky action' builds a wormhole between 'entangled' quantum particles
http://phys.org/news/2013-12-spooky-action-wormhole-entangled-quantum.html

note: i must have it all wrong because would it not be possible to
modify the spin of an entangled pair and have it influence the remote
particle likewise. and thus, what need of wires or fiber to connect
events, if a hybrid remote and on-site quatum processing were to take
place. an ecological or ecosystem context of connectivity in & out of
various structures via different forms of entanglement. what if 1,000
circuit boards shared a split particle and were sent to remote areas,
yet one calculation effected the others and likewise, or perhaps 1,000
remotely-connected processing functions embedded in 100,000 onsite. in
other words what if the processor were not discrete nor connected by
means other than resonance or vibration (perhaps decibels indicates
this as an acoustic measurement for light even). of course i have no
idea what i am saying, though as list fool i must speak such nonsense.

map out the brain via spinning particles in brain for imaging, so a
particular tone will occur and this shifting of direction within
molecules or by particles themselves can be discerned, via
polarization.  cannot drink caffiene without now having similar
effect, as if a remote satellite locked onto noggin, the molecular
directionality discerned, like wearing an electromagnetic helmet with
invisible wires into the noosphere. perhaps it is only feeling the

a particular method of decaf coffee intake with controlled
micro-caffeine dose as option for a controlled burn into slightly less
out-of-focus tunnel vision. thus when realizing total exhaustion

if having walked 1,000 miles tired, it was wondered if that too could
be related to a magnetic reversal impacting nervous system subsystem,
some perhaps more sensitive to these effects. such as the electrically
sensitive who can tell when a new satellite is switched on in orbit,
or for those who tend to short-out streetlights when walking by.

http://www.recording-microphones.co.uk/Contact-microphones.shtml

[quote] The Contact microphone comes in a variety of guises and is
also known as a transducer, a pickup or a piezo, and is a form of
microphone specifically designed to pick up audio vibrations in solid
objects. Normal studio mics are all built around the principle of
detecting vibrations in the air but Contact mics are different in that
they are designed to pickup surface vibrations. This means that if you
taped one to a wooden board and then stood infront of it and sang. the
chances are it wouldn’t pick anything up. But tap, scrape, or in some
way touch the board and even the softest vibrations will be picked up
by the contact mic. [unquote]

[quote] PVDF don’t have self-resonance because they don’t have a metal

(use epoxy or silicone), and they’re more robust, piezo discs are
rather brittle. [unquote]

http://gamesounddesign.com/Contact-Microphones.html

note: i have a drum trigger for a MIDI connection though the
traditional piezo is held within a plastic case separating it from the
external surface so only a significant force will trigger it. in
contrast, a device such as the Korg CM-200 Clip-On contact microphone
(below) is in more direct contact with the surface, thus more likely
to sense the resonating/vibrating surface, in this case on a music
instrument though presumably could be used elsewise.

note: thus, either with a mixer preamp and-or-else a digital recorder
the contact mic could be used in lieu of an acoustic cardoid/etc
microphone registering signal out of air pressure. this is a piezo
disk transducer, whereas the following is an example of shielded PVDF

--- on organization ---

in earlier days thought the computer OS would help organize life, yet
the filing cabinet approach remains a junk drawer approach scaled up
to the internet worldwide, existing as a global networked junk drawer.
attempts to develop a system have been delayed (AMS) though as part of
this, an organizational approach to offline data (paper and things)
was realized via a consistent, modular approach to storage, such that
everything now has its place and is manageable, contained as it were,
as part of a ecosystem-like relation between stuff.

my interest in organizing information (concepts,ideas) also exists in
environment, feel much better when everything is put away or space
maximized and storable versus cluttered. so space-savings, maximizing
use of space, easy or improved maintenance, easier to find, etc.

{my computer just crashed again due to a hack from cypherpunks thus
lost paragraph written} though this particular approach to storage via
Really Useful Boxes has transformed my life via organizing what would
otherwise be in chaos, allowing stackable and nestable storage (boxes
in boxes, boxes made for certain dimensional items, such as CDs or
file folders) and also the unique foldable crates/containers that
expand/contract as needed. also, tamper proof pins available. others
may prefer other containers or other brands or approaches, though in
my situation the Really Useful Boxes solved the organization and
management situation and allow continual tweaking over time.

Really Useful Boxes Inc.
http://www.reallyusefulproducts.co.uk/usa/index.php

now if only storage could be connected with barcode inventories or
bluetooth stickers and managed via the OS as part of an ecosystem
approach (i.e. Asperger Management System). must note: a favorite
organizational, stuff management & transport device is the gigantic
Ikea foldable bags. they can help carry a large box or vast clothes,
gear, or supplies and fold down to a small format that fits in a
backpack or bag. excellent if needing to move lots of stuff fast.

^(quasi: offline organization influences approach to computer, online)

other than this, right now, in analog mode with index cards and
post-it notes instead of digital tools, still in paper realm of
organization day to day, the role of the paper shredder still seems
vital to any organizational approach, present to future, say managing
scanned documents that are stored digitally and then either filed or
shredded, given priority. such systems in contrast to doing nothing,
tendency to have data collect as if layers of new dust, and paper
multiplies week by week until unmanageable chaos, unless managing it.
figuring it out via a systematic approach. and that is where
offline/computer/online are mismatched, a huge gap between chaos of
offline filing cabinet and computer and online cloud junk drawers and
data model that has no empirical basis for knowledge or information.
no 'shared truth' that is a relational structure. instead, urls and
search. hunt and peck. where's that copy of the hospital bill again?
maybe the great synchrony is the gap that requires and relies upon the
junk drawer and hoarding approach online, at OS level, and offline,
due to the gap with ideas, the loss of concepts altogether within
computing: "tools for thinking" absent as a worldview.


--- on heartbreak and hope ---

e-ink has been for me the great potential for a more 'idea-based'
approach to display, such that larger format interfaces such as
calendars or maps could feasibly become updateable and readable in a
non-projected-light or blaring screen approach that scorches the
eyeballs or loses readability in the sun or forces extreme fatigue in
high-contrast viewing (screens when read at night in low light or for
long periods of time, hours to days and weeks of interaction).

an upgraded version of the Kindle DX was in my estimate the best
change of finally having a tool or platform for sharing ideas, beyond
the failure zone of email lists and blogs and social media sites, that
'ideas' and conceptualization both in a realm of scholarship and
thinking, as this relates to discussion and feedback and debate, could
be opened up by a tool that meets this realm of *advanced literacy* --
and yet instead, when the next-gen Paperwhite Kindle was announced,
the large format DX had no such update and then was said by some
Amazon representative to not be in further development, thus the only
viable PDF reader at size of actual documents was left in an unlit
condition, eventually removed from their website.

this basically killed off my remaining hope in technological
innovation because it forced any such publishing platform that could
develop for ideas into a constricted zone of haikus only and penguin
classics small-book formats, great for reading on a bus, bad for
complex ideas and diagrams and visual and written communication
combined, at a readable type size where formatting does not need to be
pinched & zoomed repeatedly to move through information, and thus
issues of formatting as it relates to standards, the web deteriorated
into various formatting approaches, canned 'big box' solutions,
monoculture, deafening sameness that adds up to nothing more than the
part.

when i considered the Kindle DX as a platform it seems ideal for
fishing and topo maps, for documents yet also calendar like
scheduling, day planning, etc. though in years of thinking about it
(and never yet using the device), one day it dawned on me the missing
functionality was the very attribute that originally seemed the
greatest feature: free 3G connectivity to Wikipedia.

this is one of those issues for a person like myself who grew up
without an encyclopedia within the home, yet had a yearning
fascination with information yet no access. as it remains today in
many ways, sans cellphone, though having ready access to an online
reference work could then open up questioning and the imagination to
further considerations instead of stopping or limiting next steps in
thinking.  this is equivalent to the advice 'if you do know what a
word means look it up in the dictionary' as a life practice, to
improving literacy, yet at the larger connected realm of ideas in
their expanded explanation and description, integral
conceptualization.

and thus in reverse, the idea arose that wouldn't it be ideal if the
Kindle DX was a _writing platform as well as just reading. not simply
writing a computer, but also, at the e-ink device via touchscreen or
other interface (handwriting, diagramming).

a related concept i have described as 'fractal reading/writing' is in
some ways connected to this ability to write in categories versus
long-strings of conventional descriptive language, more like
programming or code for structures of concepts, as if molecular
entities. going into a concept, not just across it, via language.
modeling the ideas, concepts, structural 'forms', where scaffolding
may exist as substructures hidden or not in given views (xml, tags,
etc)

the realization then that if every Kindle shipped with wiki software
that would allow people to write these structures and link them
together in a new public zone of the internet that is based upon ideas
and concepts and their organization. a public realm like cafe society
where debates and discussions could occur, conceptualization beyond
boundaries of websites or separated blogs, and into the structures
themselves, that would move from individual POVs in relativistic
frames, grounded or not, into a larger empirical structure, if
mediated this way, organized, managed, maintained, say by public
discourse, debate, challenging of hypotheses.

this, tools for thinking and tools for developing literacy, to battle
the engrained ignorance that one-way media and vested opinions
together establish, especially when separated and left unchallenged or
untested beyond a comfortable isolation. what if tools could
reestablish or allow a public zone or square or environment where
today none actually exists. and what if it is wiki and e-readers and
those who use these for scholarship and exchanging ideas, and thus
various platforms and vendors could exist and participate, allow
access and interface, yet also it would involve those with knowledge
of particular domains to develop and model them, and potentially
transform existing conceptions of what a field or discipline actually
is, in contrast to the outdated or detached academic models that may
limit what is approved.

being someone who is intrigued by innovative technological tools with
purpose, it was completely devastating when Amazon dropped support for
the larger format DX. i lost faith in Bezos vision because it at once
manages a future of books while removing the larger purpose of ideas
and concept development they involve, making it a read-only scenario
with Kindles versus a read-and-write platform for those developing
ideas, the people who are creating the documents, so they can review
their own work at scale, away from the PC screen and read others ideas
likewise, beyond its domination over context and interpretation, via
distraction and requirement of multitasking with an OS or other device
with demands.

thus the [concept] + [concept] = [concept] / [concept] approach that
wikis allow could be a new way of 'writing' that is non-linear and
fractal, going into other networked data structures or particular
versions, to create various models of ideas and concepts and new
organizations or a worldview, new interface to online information that
could be developed that is integrated into a single model, and data
could be attached to this, instead of having individual branded
websites reinventing the wheel, they could be data structures instead
with basic facts and details. certainly would deal with information
anxiety issues at every level, from finding out info in a Wolfram-like
computational approach, to the phone-book aspect of just wanting the
facts without the 1mb download of advertising banner ads and all the
tracking data to locate an address, etc. and then it could be
visualized atop that via the various approaches, instead of tied down
into static rendered css/xml sites as UI/display.

there is no reason this wiki-approach could not exist on tablets and
cellphones likewise, (in the sense of 'tools for thinking') though it
is this issue related to readability adn those who are writers or
thinkers or scholars or communicator/conveyors, debaters of ideas,
etc, that in reading or considering ideas, the issues of the screen
and its biasing does influence what is read, how it is read, and
within what parameters (in browser, often with animations running or
OS notifications, or various errors) versus a device purpose-made for
easy readability and reading, the pleasure of textual communication,
even into embedded visuals/diagrams, versus the hassle that is email
or all the formatted bureaucracy blogs require to upkeep while
limiting reference or url-rot or whatever. versus having data stored
as documents in a library within a device -or- accessible as a
structure, as with a wiki-structure of networked data models, that
could become a new realm of the internet, expanding further than
wikipedia yet still accessible. another variant like gopher or mailing
lists, yet more permanent, like earlier days of (lynx-like) Yahoo
categorization yet public, developed as areas of integrated knowledge
and areas of debate and discussion, not limited to the outdated
worldviews held within and requiring censorship to control and
discourage feedback, within institutions. thus, the opportunity for
Galilean/Copernicun remodeling and working-through such conditions
rather than avoiding or voiding such thinking, makign the internet
read-only for ideas in terms of public discourse, debate, ideas,
"books", knowledge, "culture", thinking, etc. i.e. beyond
overly-limiting corporate or institutional or private control over
shared reality.

so Amazon dropped out, and Sony went conceptual and introduced a
fascinating upgrade to their e-ink future with a prototype now
deploying for testing in Japan. see the video:

13.3-inch Sony tablet // the future...
http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57585367-1/13.3-inch-sony-tablet-is-like-etch-a-sketch-on-steroids/

so this is not just an e-reader, it is described as a 'digital
notepad' and 'digital paper', perhaps tending toward the concept of a
clipboard functionality for this kind of device, where it could be
used for formwork, charting, census, notes and writing, scheduling,
etc. and likely would be much more usable than a tablet (including
large sized) due to weight, battery life, readability, and better
functionality with dedicated or programmable task buttons that are not
needing to relate to MP3 and videos, other non-relevant apps or
adds-on (everything!)

it is also mentioned is focused on Universities, so it has an inherent
educational purpose, (potentially: tool for thinking) and is currently
in trials in Japan from what i last read. and a price of approximately
1k USD was recently mentioned, which is also interesting, in that it
makes it impracticle for most citizens unless a niche or supported
project.

this must have freaked out Amazon and reawoken their Kindle DX program
because the device has since reappeared on their website, and for a
heavily discounted price (169 USD, when previously in the 379 USD
range). it was a closeout special before, yet reintroduced, it is a
reactivation of a forfeited category, something that was said
officially a dead-end, and to me was a betrayal of ideas and the
Kindle as a publishing platform, thus the heartbreak that the soul of
books have become only about the money made from them, not the
continuance of ideas they contain and culture they develop and
sustain. yet, along with quadrocopters, suddenly Amazon and Bezos are
back in the realm of critical relevance in this same context by what
is potentially a vital reversal, hopefully and likely indicating a
renewed interest in the large-format e-ink reader as future data
management, organization, communication devices.

it was difficult for a person like me, heavily vested in strange ideas
requiring a platform for their public exchange, to be removed as a
possibility. it was preface to extinction for the very relevance of
thought within networked media, to have the literacy device disappear,
taken over by more jukeboxes with electronic money-slots required for
each & every interaction.

it is potentially heartening that Amazon is responding to innovation
from Sony, realizes the potential and need, and will bring
paperwhite-like illumination to a large format e-reader, a next
generation Kindle DX, hopefully others like Sony will also.

presumably there was not a viable enough market or need or the timing
was not right for such a next stage, in terms of corporate-interest,
before now. yet i think it always existing though is not voiced, yet
it is the vital core of the culture and internet that would use such
devices, especially those who think and organize and share and debate
their thoughts.

 perhaps a next generation larger format DX device would have been too
expensive with older e-ink screens, until the Sony approach. and thus
would not sell enough to justify the investment needed. whatever the
case, the latest ongoing pricepoint for the existing DX indicates a
next generation Kindle DX could be in the works if not using the same
E Ink Mobius screen as the Sony digital notepad, potentially or
eventually. thus it would not suprise if the next DX is somewhere
between the existing and last launched pricepoint, instead of further
towards the 1K USD that is breaking new ground for a prefered display
for written, diagrammatic, textual, modeled information, organization,
and management that tends more towards the library than file cabinet
turning into a data junk drawer approach.
likewise, another such device for construction documents....
