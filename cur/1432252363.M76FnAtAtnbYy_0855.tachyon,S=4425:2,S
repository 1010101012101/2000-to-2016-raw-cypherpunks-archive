Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the deve|opment of a

BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind technologies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annual|y for Po|and and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross
e|ectric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of
re|evant policies, strategies and plans. To fu|fill the mission, EC BREC uses
its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and internationa| organizations.
