All of the comments so far are playing into the red herring of the
technical issues of email backups. You're forgetting that losing email
access is now modus operandi to stonewalling investigations:

  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy
  - http://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-says-it-cant-search-own-emails

What people should be talking about instead is the drafting of a bill
for record retention following the requirements of Sarbanes–Oxley,
specifically for government communications to be used in criminal
investigations against the government. To be explicit, all government
communications should be duplicated into a read-only archive and kept
there for at minimum seven years. And to borrow from a now well-known
NSA program, an XKEYSCORE system should be developed where criminal
investigators can use "selectors" to target people and keywords.

The government shouldn't be worried if they have nothing to hide.
