ving its total structure, especially linearly, such that [n=C2=B9=C2=B2=C2=
=B3] would not be decipherable running algorithms across its horizontal str=
ing and instead solving for each variable or say grouped variables in the s=
tring, eg. [n=C2=B9][n=C2=B2=E2=81=BB=C2=B3][n=E2=81=B4=E2=81=BB=E2=81=B9]<=
br>

</div><div><br></div><div>Thus, while i have no actual idea of how crypto a=
nd binary code relate in terms of encryption methods and decryption, it is =
assumed this approach remains serial and directly interrogates the serial s=
tring to reveal its structure, across various formats of the code (various =
programming, encoding and other data formatting schemes). Thus, a binary st=
ring would be an example, 10100011001010001010101010010101, whereby to solv=
e for [xyz...n] would involve finding the overall linear structure that pro=
vides for such linear organization, say assuming it is encrypted code *)S)*=
S*))SA&amp;*S&amp;**S()S*S)aAUIHNL*0, and therefore the assumption would re=
main that each variable is related to the next in some &#39;coherence&#39; =
and solving one part or layer may reveal another, such as HSKSLLILHSILALSWL=
WLSDUI and thus the string [xyz] is made intelligible by this coherence wit=
hin the linear string, across that massive horizontality (very large stream=
s of data that contain data and programs and messaging).<br>

<br>Whereas for a paradoxical logic approach, each variable could itself be=
 &#39;many&#39; in place of a single bit- or the boundary of the single bit=
 could be [N] and move towards a bounded infinity, a mathematical function,=
 or other calculation in that same location. <br>

<br></div><div>disclaimer, stating the obvious, i have no idea what this is=
 in terms of applied cryptography, there is tremendous gap between these st=
atements and actual code, though to me the approach is much more accurate a=
s &quot;thinking code&quot; that involves human processing via logical reas=
oning, parallel and serial processing, and thus the very idea of a string o=
f code in that view could also function as signal in noise or even absolute=
 truth, in terms of messaging. and so it is obvious &#39;binary thinking&#3=
9; is not like everyday evaluation in the sense that there is grey-area to =
mediating events, a pause to decision- yet within this pause, bounded infin=
ities of hypotheses can be queried (referencing previous instances in store=
d or external memories) that then influence the tallying of the response, w=
hich most likely will be weighted between 1 and 0, unless purely ideologica=
l. <br>

<br></div><div>Thus- *conceptually*- to consider &quot;code&quot; in this h=
uman context, of a living breathing idea that is grounded in empirical trut=
h in a shared human viewpoint, that is to be shared as information, via exc=
hange, it is more grayscale than 10110101010100001, in terms of language an=
d how thinking functions, more about looping and weighting of variables tha=
n having a *single correct result* when there can be several overlapping or=
 contrasting interpretations *at the same time*. So imagine if the binary s=
tring had each bit that was variable instead in a 0-9 scale of weighting th=
e evaluation, such that 10927238292340246. <br>

<br></div><div>This moves the [binary] string into a fragmented string of v=
ariables, more like analog computation [1][0][9]...[6]. In this way it is t=
o consider the &#39;bit&#39; as N-variable, and thus what if it were the al=
phabet instead of numbers: 26 letters possible for each bit: USOWHLSELNSQAH=
BVY<br>

<br></div><div>the issue being that like a slot machine, those [N] variable=
 bits could tally up any potential letter of 26, or +10 numbers with alphan=
umerics, or add lower case and punctuation or symbols and suddenly a small =
&#39;string&#39; of data could involve huge interrelational structures that=
 may or may not be related across the horizontal span, depending on how it =
is constructed via algorithms and conceptual formatting. Maybe this already=
 is the way transformed code is achieved with taking a certain sized conten=
t- variable [x], and then transmuting its entirety into a string or stream =
of obfuscated data that must be &#39;worked at&#39; to decrypt or be transl=
ated to make use of. <br>

<br>The seeming difference would be computationally, how this relation exis=
ts in processing, in terms of hardware and software, though also thinking, =
programming. Because what if there is a limit to these transmutations that =
is forced into a binary 1/0 and thus bounds these infinities to only certai=
n algorithmic space, or even computationally, that such numbers cannot be a=
dequately computed and thus *do not exist* as calculations within machines =
and software approaches, crypto perhaps especially, when the security they =
would provide would be unfathomable in terms of existing brute force calcul=
ations of &#39;linear&#39; patterns.<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>my speculation is of an unknowing of applied cryp=
tography and computer programming yet knowing of logical reasoning and empi=
rical thinking, awareness, and how the two are ideologically at odds in app=
roach in terms of basic assumptions. thus within my condition of &#39;illit=
eracy&#39; there is an attempt to share an idea (pT) about a shared situati=
on from an outsider vantage, with those of highest literacy of applied code=
, yet within what to my observation is a flawed idea and based on false and=
 inaccurate assumptions, in particular the primacy of binarism for security=
 when this nonlinear/multilinear computation (parallel &amp; serial) would =
easily defeat it. <br>

<br></div><div>such that it is not about strings and instead parallel sets:=
 [x|x|x|x]...[n]<br></div><div><br></div><div>as the [variable] yet this ma=
y not be coherent in a horizontal algorithm to solve, it may not have &#39;=
rationality&#39; across, from one digit to the next, revealing its hidden s=
tructure. instead, randomness would be inherent instead of woven into the c=
ode, it would be more revealing information out of noise structures than pu=
tting information into noise that is bounded and can be shaped into structu=
re. in this way also, noise could have structure yet not lead to decryption=
, it may be a false corridor within the ever expanding maze.<br>

<br></div><div>it is that [N] variables each are in superposition, not stat=
ic by default, finite and absolute, and instead &#39;truly variable&#39;, u=
nbounded to a certain extent (infinities within infinities across infinitie=
s via nested sets).<br>

<br></div><div>the conceit or test of the heresy would be 256 &#39;bit&#39;=
 quantum computer that solves 256 AES, though if it were a binary string th=
is could even be trivial, versus say [N]-bit, which seemingly could take *f=
orever* to evaluate, via running, looping code evaluation and a shared empi=
rical model that develops alongside, out of and through the technology as a=
 &#39;thinking machine&#39;-- which, the more it is like the human brain, t=
he more likely the messaging could be made sensible via existing concepts a=
nd structures to test against, evaluating patterns and looking for correlat=
ions. in that context, a three bit [N]-variable string of code could probab=
ly defeat all computing power today, especially if large expanses were allo=
wed, numbers, letters, symbols-- it would be unsolvable potentially, extrem=
ely probable. Largest primes would be a minor detail, another variable seem=
ingly in such a context, due to its potential for incoherence and complexit=
y. <br>

<br>likewise, this [N]-bit approach for random number generators, yet why n=
ot random outside of 1/0 as a noise field, generating strings via a two [N]=
-variable string, just let it run and tap that, without or without structur=
e, would it even matter. in other words: take any two ideas, any two signs =
or symbols or colors or whatever, and relate them and tally and extend this=
 as a process. that is proto-language in a nutshell, this the crazy nut cra=
cked open yet beyond the insanity of my own incapacity to communicate and f=
laws in understanding-- there is something about this approach and basicall=
y observation that has *coherence* that is absent in a binary approach and =
serial algorithms-- because that is not how people think or communicate, it=
 is N-dimensional, geometrical, looping. and processors and code and softwa=
re at present cannot model this, allow for it. and that formats reasoning, =
perception, what options are available to share ideas and evaluate them, an=
d we are stuck in binary because it is enshrined both in technology though =
also in institutions-- it is the dead static code of shared ideological non=
-thinking that is pushing decision-making and actions towards its determini=
stic end game, which is a onesided machine-based value system, devoid of li=
fe, nature, and humanity, except insofar as it profits its own continuing a=
utomated development and further extension.<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>so the gap between my illiterate views and the ac=
tuality of implemented security code by those literate is one aspect, thoug=
h another is my literacy in thinking code and the illiteracy of thinking wi=
thin foundational technology, its infrastructure, and the result of this, w=
hich requires a world like it is, and relies on bad code and ideas to allow=
 for it. thus an audit or accounting of the situation, an attempt to get ac=
ross the idea that there is a model of dumb, unintelligent code at the base=
 of this situation, the approach is so flawed as to be the basis for tyrann=
y, and it ties into &#39;ideology&#39; across platforms, individuals and gr=
oups of people to software/hardware and bureaucratic systems, and in that &=
#39;combined state&#39; of a false-perspective empire, the kernel is corrup=
t and the whole thing invalid, including at the constitutional level which =
itself is ignored, by binary default, the epic loophole of relativistic fra=
meworks allowing the fiction and its virtuality to replace shared logical r=
easoning, because truth and logic can simply be ignored, &#39;privatized&#3=
9;. and enclaves can rule over others as if a caste-system via technology a=
nd ideological assumptions that function as religion, technologists as prie=
sts, gods of this technocratic utopia, the peasants not having the understa=
nding to operate in such a realm, as guaranteed by the originating lie and =
tradeoff that allows for all of this to continue. that absolute truth is an=
 everyday condition and you get to choose what to believe as if a right or =
protected mode of operation, no matter how many others must suffer for it, =
to sustain the illusion and shared delusion. <br>

</div><div><br></div><div>the cloud here in the corrupted model a state fil=
ing cabinet, digital bureau for the bureaucracy, citizens organizing info i=
nto others invisible folder structures, volunteering the data via handover,=
 designed into the technology itself as a marketing and communications stra=
tegy. the sieve of private data is equivalent to entire populations seeking=
 out pickpockets to hand over their contents, incentivized as it is. and so=
 &#39;security&#39; is as if a kind of institutional transparency in relati=
on to a corrupted, failed, rogue state that can read and see everything you=
 are doing, whether or not encrypted, dumb terminals every computer to the =
state mainframe, rebranded and rebadged, hidden, &#39;anonymous&#39;.<br>

<br></div><div>--- more of this insane ungrounded viewpoint --<br></div><di=
v>=C2=A0<br></div><div>it was mentioned a three variable &#39;string&#39; [=
x|y|z] would be differently approached if parallel versus serial, in that e=
ach bit of a binary string could be N-variable in a parallel approach, or s=
o it is assumed possible, as with probabilities and slot machines, or basic=
 everyday observation of events and what enters and exits consciousness giv=
en context. and while not knowing the depth of this in terms of cryptograph=
y, completely out of my depth, it would seem the concept of keyspace could =
relate to how such a &#39;paradoxical string&#39; could exist, given the bo=
undary for determining what N could be for [x], [y], [z].=C2=A0 For instanc=
e if it were binary ones and zeroes, the probabilities could be run and 8 d=
ifferent permutations or combinations: 111, 100, 110, 101, 010, 011, 001, 0=
00. <br>

<br>And within that, perhaps there is meaning. Yet if &#39;the probabilitie=
s&#39; are changed via [N]-bit variables, it could go all the way to infini=
ty for a single variable, and thus BIG BANG inflate via probabilities into =
a huge keyspace, perhaps unpacking structures this way that reference other=
s already developed, as if infrastructure being revealed that connects with=
 others elsewhere, via wormhole-like connectivity and then closing down upo=
n successful messaging, thus encrypting and decrypting via few variables, v=
ia inherent yet hidden structural relations within these combinations, whic=
h could be infinities related to infinities and then the issue of how to fi=
nd them or what to look for. Black box yet even moreso, RNG as model for si=
gnal, not noise, thus tending toward psychic Random Event Generator as if i=
nnate sense of animals before catastrophe, cosmic faults and folds.<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>the idea or difference is paradox- essentially *s=
uperposition* of the bit as [N]-variable, no longer finite and static, pote=
ntially active and transformative, diagnostic even in a sensor sense of the=
 analogue as queued circuit. What if alignment occurs in the string under c=
ertain conditions and not others, what if it tunes in and structures reveal=
ed, decrypt, yet out of tune it vanishes, code collapse or changes as with =
temperature sensing colors, and the variables change, mask into background,=
 returning to mystery. It does not seem that computers today can even adequ=
ately allow for infinity, a single bit of this, versus a larger parallel st=
ring- and what might that mean about thinking, too. nothing more than finit=
e discreet thoughts, one decision to the next unconnected, unless largest p=
rime, say rogue US terror-state pwns earth as if master discourse, shared P=
OV, even though ungrounded- this the dumbed down unintelligent lowliest sha=
