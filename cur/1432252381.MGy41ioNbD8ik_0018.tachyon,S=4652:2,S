Maybe you should look at the oaths that are sworn to by all public
employees, of which LEOs are but a small maggot in a big sewer.  All of
them contain a provision whereby there swear to uphold the
constitution.  Not to follow orders which may or may not be
chain-of-command valid, and *hopefully* constitutional.

As for refusing to enforce laws which are personally believed to be
unconstitutional, this goes on all the time, both officially [Sherriff
Blah refuses to enforce law X - publicly], and unofficially Officer Y
refuses to enforce law X - privately].  

How many weeks before middle schools reopen, anyway?

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
