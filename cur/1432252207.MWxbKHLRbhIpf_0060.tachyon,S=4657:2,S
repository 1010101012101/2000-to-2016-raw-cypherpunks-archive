Which isn't so different from

<http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?ptitle=Top%20World%20News&s1=blk&tp=ad_topright_topworld&T=markets_bfgcgi_content99.ht&s2=ad_right1_windex&bt=ad_position1_windex&middle=ad_frame2_windex&s=AO73EbxYxQ2VudGVy>

but it isn't like the other news agencies are pushing and shoving to
report either one.  Until they do, I'm just a little skeptical.
