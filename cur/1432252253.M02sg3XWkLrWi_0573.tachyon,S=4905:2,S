	But is there as much scrutiny and backlash when they do?

	Here in the US, it is getting to the point where cops in 
larger cities won't even bother to deal with certain crimes in 
certain neighborhoods, as they are afraid that even if they do 
everything by the book, they will get fucked.

	From http://www.nationalreview.com/dunphy/dunphy.shtml

	"One officer, 17-year veteran Eric Michl, put it this way: 
"Parking under a shady tree to work on a crossword puzzle is a  great 
alternative to being labeled a racist and being dragged through an 
inquest, a review board, an FBI  and U.S. Attorney's investigation 
and a lawsuit."

	And it is certainly the case that any one who gives the 
orders to fire into a crowd will face some sort of civil suit 
(whether right or wrong, when there is big bucks at stake, the suit 
will be brought).

	In this country, that discretion is being severely narrowed. 
There is a case in Seattle (IIRC) where a black man was (allegedly) 
*DRAGGING A COP WITH HIS CAR* and was shot dead. People got upset at 
the police for this.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
