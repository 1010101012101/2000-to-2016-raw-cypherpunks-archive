	Well, that's just guessing.

	Exactly. Anarchism is to be compared with other systems
	while holding the rest of variables constant. Otherwise the
	comparison is meaningless.  And 'ceteribus paribus' anarchism
	 wins.

	I'm not sure I'm following. The american coup d'etat didn't get
	rid of government. Actually it created a government that was
	and is worse than the british empire.

	Why would it?

	And if it does, so what? That was the starting point, so
	nothing is lost.

	Well, but that's speculation, not argument =P

	It misdirects resources. If democracy was actually a threat to
	the powers that be, it would be ilegal.

	Well, I would say "not bad" =)  though I think the
