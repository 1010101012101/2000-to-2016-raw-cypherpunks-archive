I think we disagree here. Game theory doesn't support this standpoint. I am
sure having no crime would be better for humanity than the other way
around. But to commit a crime can be extremely profitable, emotionally or
financially. And for me to protect others is not profitable for me
directly. It's like taxes, it's good for society if everyone just pays
their taxes (provided the taxes are fair). But do I want to pay taxes? I
don't know anyone that looks forward to paying his taxes.

Then why didn't you spend 10% of your wealth/income last year on
investigating crime prevention? I appreciate that you feel this discussion
is helping, and it's helping me get my thoughts clearer, but I truly think
a community cannot be expected to behave in a way good for the community
but bad for the individual.

I don't quite see this argument. A murderer and a police officer have
opposing motives. A person in the street will back away from both to
prevent getting hurt, even if he might help either achieve his/her goal.
