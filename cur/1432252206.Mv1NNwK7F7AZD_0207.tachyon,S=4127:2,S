The major objective of the intervention was to arrest Aidid, who whatever 
his sins may have been, was a hero of the revolutionary war against a 
Soviet aligned tyrant, and the major figure in the revolution that 
overthrew socialist tyranny in Somalia.  A major tactic in this US 
intervention was to forcibly close down presses and radio stations that 
gave politically incorrect news -- which tended to be pro capitalist and 
anti socialist news.

Bush's peculiar foreign policy was in line with some of Clinton's recent 
foreign interventions, notably his installation of a Marxist dictator in 
Haiti -- though Haiti is fortunately too corrupt to actually practice 
Marxism.  The dictator of Haiti is merely a Batista, not a Castro.  The 
same was to some extent true of Biarre, the muderous tyrant who Aidid 
helped overthrow.

You should also recall the "Alliance for Progress", which did so much to 
advance communism and socialism in South America.   It seems that the good 
progressives in the state department believed that communists were popular 
because the peasants were eager to participate in Stalin style collectives, 
so if the US would provide stalinist collectivism for the peasants, that 
would make the US popular.
