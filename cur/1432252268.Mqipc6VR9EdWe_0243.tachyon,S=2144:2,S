BBC June 6 2001, a few days after Khatami's election 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1373476.stm
: :	Much of the press that backs Mr Khatami's reforms 
: :	has been silenced, and many of the president's 
: :	supporters have been jailed or face charges

Had the US "supported Khatami", it would have in fact been
supporting not Khatami, but rather those who imprison his
supporters, and who seek to murder people like me.
