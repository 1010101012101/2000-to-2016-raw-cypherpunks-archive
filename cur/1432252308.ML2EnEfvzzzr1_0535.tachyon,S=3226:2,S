Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, its former servants 
have unblushingly labelled themselves anarchists, Jello 
Biafra being a notorious example.

"Revolutionary proletarian nucleus" is almost the same as the 
infamous Trotskyist phrase "Revolutionary proletarian 
vanguard".  Substituting "nucleus" for "vanguard" is like a 
dot com company taking the dot out of its name after the dot 
com crash, Just as "Surfmonkey.com", suddenly became
"Surfmonkey", though its web site is just as central to its
business as ever.
