Thank you coderman for the articles. They provide rare evidence that 
private investigators purchase and use spyware:

"Both Hacking Team and FinFisher claim that they only sell to 
governments, but recently leaked documents appear to show that FinFisher 
has sold to at least one private security company." 
https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/15/cat-video-hack/

"Customer email addresses in the collection appeared to belong to a 
German surveillance company,"
