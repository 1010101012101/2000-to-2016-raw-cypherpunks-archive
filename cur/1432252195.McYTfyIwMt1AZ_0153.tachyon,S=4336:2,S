The article also neglects to mention FEDERAL AGENCIES' pet KILL ratio.
I'm not sure about cats specifically, but dog killing is quite popular.

Evidently the kid was in possession of Envelopes of Mass Destruction as
well as castor beans, guns, and books.  Envelopes!  Everyone knows that
civilized people communicate via instant/text message or email (insofar
as they are distinct).  We have no need for these ENVELOPES, which as
well as being used to send toxins to KILL LAW-ABIDING TAXPAYERS also
cause untold annual economic damage from paper-cut-caused hospital
visits.

I spot the beginnings of yet another war.  Please excuse me while I go
bury my umbrellas.  PATRIOTS use hooded raincoats.  We have no NEED for
barbaric and dangerous implements like UMBRELLAS.

You forgot the guns!  The GUNS!  Those terrible and bloody implements of
death ARE totally unnecessary!  Never mind that they're PERFECTLY LEGAL
and they don't make ricin (excuse me, castor beans) any more deadly.  He
still had guns!
