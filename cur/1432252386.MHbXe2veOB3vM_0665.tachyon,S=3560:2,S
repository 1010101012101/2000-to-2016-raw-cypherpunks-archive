I've been trying to find evidence of this, too. I've sent messages to
self from several versions of Netscape Messenger on Windows and FreeBSD,
then examined the headers. I have only a Verisign certificate; possibly
the cert source would affect the headers that are produced with signed
or encrypted mail. I checked the headers with a Java program I wrote
myself, so I could verify that Messenger isn't silently stripping them
before display.

The only thing that might be the "help" field is "X-UIDL", which has a
value of random-seeming characters. Even with that, I vaguely recall
seeing something about the intended purpose of X-UIDL, and it wasn't to
break the encryption. "Alleged" purpose, perhaps I should say. But my
memory of that is very unclear and quite possibly wrong.

I, too, am skeptical about the help field claim. I'd be very interested
in details.
