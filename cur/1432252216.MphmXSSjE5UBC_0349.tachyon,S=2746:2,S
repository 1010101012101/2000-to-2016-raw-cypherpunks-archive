     Interesting that they included mention of SouthWest airline in this
-- since SouthWest uses ObjectStore ODBMS, a pretty modern database.  As
does at least one other airline, IIRCC.
     I wonder if this is simply about the fedzis attempting to push them
all into using Oracle?
Which would be a real neat mess to watch.
