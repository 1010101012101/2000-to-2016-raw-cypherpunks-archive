We are seeking the help of overseas users of The Electronic Telegraph to 
better understand how we may develop our Expat Portal, Global Network to 
suit their needs.  As someone who has previously registered with the Electronic 
Telegraph, you are well placed to provide us with the feedback we require 
and I would really appreciate your participation.

This is part of a major exercise to review our plans for the site 
and its relationship with the Weekly Telegraph newspaper.  We would very 
much appreciate your co-operation in completing our survey since we need 
responses from users from all around the world.  The survey may be 
completed on-line at:

         http://www.info-e.com/wtinfo

Please either click on this link, or cut and paste the address into 
the address line of your browser.

MPG International, an independent market research firm, is running 
the survey on our behalf, and it is by this means that we can ensure 
absolute confidentiality for the information you provide.

As a reward, all respondents will be entered into a prize draw* 
for one of ten $100 vouchers at amazon.com which you may spend on 
any of the products available from them - books, CDs, games, etc..

May I thank you in advance for your help.
Yours sincerely,

Keith Jenkins,  Editor, The Weekly Telegraph
