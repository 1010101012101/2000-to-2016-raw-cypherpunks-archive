And check out the comment at the bottom:

A lot of initiatives have been started since 911, but DARPA is in a
position to take high
  risks and think boldly about what can be done to solve this national
problem.  We can not
  tolerate more 911?a.  The solution is truly ?DARPA hard.?

Talk about "new speak".  Or are all Masons this nuts?

nuclear powered weapons don't need to expend all their energy in 10
nanoseconds.  10 guys with plasma swords could be pretty effective at
pest removal.  Besides, you got a lot more offices to clean out than just
one city.

But voting is easier.
