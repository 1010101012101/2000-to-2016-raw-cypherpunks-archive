>>The FBI has asked laboratories around the
country for records of workers vaccinated
against anthrax, as investigators pursue a
growing suspicion that whoever mailed the
anthrax-laden letters in New Jersey must
have taken extraordinary steps to avoid
dying in the process.<<

Gosh, there's about 150,000 vaccinated, indoctrinated
people with CBW training, too.  They're called soldiers.

The Feds are totally, desparately, impotent, when they start
chasing scientists.  Hey, maybe they can start on dem sneaky ole
*chinese* scientists that they find so appetizing in a Dreyfus kinda
way.

>>But he cautioned that a combination of
skill, antibiotics and luck could have saved
the mailer from contracting the disease
without having had a vaccination.<<
