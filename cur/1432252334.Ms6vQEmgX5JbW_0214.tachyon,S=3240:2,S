Recall that gas mask possession, sale, and transportation was criminalized
in the city of Seattle during the "state of emergency" declared for the
WTO festivities.

This was during the time you couldn't open the window without pepper spray

Homework Exercise:  Could someone list all the "executive orders" signed
by various Presidents that are now in effect because Bush declared a
"National Emergency", along with what unconstitutional power they confer
and to whom?
