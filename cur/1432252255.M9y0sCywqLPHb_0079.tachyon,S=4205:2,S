http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/31/technology/ebusiness/31TECH.9.html I 
assume the author simply speaks from that "magic lantern" thingie | A 
controversial system installed on a | criminal suspect's computer by the 
government to capture | the encryption passwords of a criminal suspect is 
nearing | its second phase; the F.B.I. has acknowledged that it is | 
developing a similar monitoring system, called Magic | Lantern, that could 
be installed remotely. Peter <<

I infer the second phase is the hard task that an organization of renowned 
kkklutz's has to sell the general populace on the idea of benign govt 
approved viri.Marketing in a word.As most people distinguish between state 
terror and free range its not impossible.A judicious amount of 'newspeak' 
and "mindfuck"should swing it.The govt owns the finest lying weaels $ can 
buy.See scarffed data post,possible illegal wiretap,above.The mafia's going 
crypto,could be a trend.Invest in fish and horse.

"This type of hacking buggery must surely wipe out the fascist United 
States as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my 
employers, associates, or others. Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all 
of those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the 
first place..."
