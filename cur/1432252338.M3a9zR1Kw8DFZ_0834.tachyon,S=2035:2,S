Don't even have to do that. For the UK solution, the entire *site* is
redirected to the url-checking server, who then passes though "clean"
urls, and blocks "bad" ones.

So, best choice is to visit squeaky clean pages. Lots of them,
preferably ones with lots of image content the checking server will need
to proxy, and as wide a range as possible to invalidate the caching.
