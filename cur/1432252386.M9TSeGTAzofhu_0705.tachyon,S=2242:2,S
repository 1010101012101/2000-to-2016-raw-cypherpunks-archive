...I'm sure most are aware that random searches has begun here in NYC, at 
subway stations and in the LIRR. Contraband (drugs, etc...) can get the 
owner arrested.
The next step, of course, will be to start grabbing anyone carrying 
terrorist propaganda, such as the Qu'ran, leaflets, or even the New York 
Times.

The sad thing is that it is still absurdly easy to get whatever you want 
into the subways. For one, not every station has any kind of significant 
police presence (funny, but the Chambers street station this morning had 
multiple possible places where someone could enter with a backpack, despite 
the fact that it opens directly inside "Ground Zero" and the path Trains to 
New Jersey). But even if there were police everywhere, there are still many 
places between stations where someone determined could enter.

OK, OK...so the police are deterrents against a few lone crazy copycats, who 
don't have enough sense to enter away from police line-of-site. But it sure 
seems damned silly to be giving up constitutional protection for the sake of 
an image of protection.
