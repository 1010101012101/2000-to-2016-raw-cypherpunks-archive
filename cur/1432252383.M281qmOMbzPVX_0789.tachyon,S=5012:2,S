A year and a half ago I read one of the most interesting, 
interdisciplinary books I've ever read, "Noah's Flood," by Ryan and 
Pitman. Not a religious book, but a book combining oceanography, 
geology, fish biology, pottery studies, DNA analysis, mythology, and 
several other fields.

The big news today was the announcement that human habitation remains 
have been found where the Ryan and Pitman theory predicted. This has 
profound significance for our culture, for understanding the spread 
of Indo-European language, and for the apparent "diaspora" happening 
at around this time.

(It would not surprise me if the earliest known agricultural 
implements are found in the next few years.)

This is not a Cypherpunks topic, but I believe I've mentioned the 
Ryan and Pitman book here before. And it shows how science is done.

To quote one of the many stories appearing today:

New Evidence of Great Flood Found

By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - The first evidence that humans lived in an area now 
covered by the Black Sea - perhaps inundated by the biblical flood - 
has been found by a team of explorers.

``Artifacts at the site are clearly well preserved, with carved 
wooden beams, wooden branches and stone tools,'' lead researcher 
Robert Ballard said.
...
Columbia University researchers William Ryan and Walter Pittman 
speculated in their 1997 book ``Noah's Flood'' that when the European 
glaciers melted, about 7,000 years ago, the Mediterranean Sea 
overflowed into what was then a smaller freshwater lake to create the 
Black Sea.

Last year Ballard found indications of an ancient coastline miles out 
from the current Black Sea coast. The new discovery provides evidence 
that people once lived in that now inundated region.
