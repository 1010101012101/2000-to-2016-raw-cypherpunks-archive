Whether we put the mofo into power or not is not relevent: the "nation" is a
sovereign, regardless of the current figurehead who purports to represent it.

Note:
I don't *think* that anyone here is arging that Saddam was a nice guy - we're
all just arguing at cross purposes.  Camp A (me) seems to be arguing from a
meta [societal] position, while Camp J is arguing from a personal-dislike
position.  Neither camp is likely to deter the other, since our frames of
reference can never intersect :-(
