They don't.  They like law because it is interesting to them.  It is
interesting like a novel, or an encyclopedia.  When I was a kid I used to
love flipping the pages of an encyclopedia - usually forgetting what I was
originally looking for.  I liked the information - lawyers like the words.

Some people like studying bugs.  Some people like studying brain cells.
Some people like studying anything, because *everything* is interesting.
If you think about anything deeply enough, you find out there's a lot you
don't understand.

As the number of people increase, the social pressure increases, and we
begin to cook in ways we didn't think possible.  Law is supposed to
aleviate that pressure, but it usually backfires.  Lawyers like words,
they don't really care about what they mean in an overall picture of
society, rather than how they relate to each other.

I'm glad Tim knows he can't be a lawyer, but given his comments here,
there may come a day when he'll appreciate what they can do with words.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
