"Except Utah is not in the South by anybody's definition."

I was in Salt Lake City this very morning, and for some reason a lot of 
people sport southern accents. I suspect that's because of a "cultural 
vacuum" effect whereby there's not enough local identity to latch onto so 
they "import" some.

Also as it happens I saw that WIERD Temple downtown there, and asked "Sister 
Johnson" if she really believed God was a guy kicked back in a Laz-Z-Boy on 
the planet Kolab. She could not tell me decisely that this was not the case.

Is Hatch a Mormon?
