That's the sea the fish swim in...so pervasive that no one needs 
reminding of it.

I am arguing for increased privatization, through simple measures.

I don't support this government role.

By the way, there are reports (maybe reposted here) that some hotel 
chains are "cooperating" in programs to link their data bases of hotel 
reservations with airline reservations with government files. So that 
"Joe Businessman" has booked a room at the San Francisco Hyatt Regency, 
Hyatt will link to his flight. Links to his company are next. The 
argument will be that this allows taking him off the list of suspects to 
scrutinize.

We are headed toward a fully-credentialized society. No doubt with 
European-type laws requiring identification for all hotel check-ins. 
(I've been forced to show my driver's license at hotels for the past 
dozen years or so. "Cash" has been discouraged, though it's not illegal, 
yet, for hotels and motels to take cash and no I.D. It likely soon will 
be.)

You are welcome to look for a carrier that operates this way, in my 
scheme.

But if Tim's Airline wants your fingerprints and retinal scans and a 
hefty security bond, you are free to find another carrier.

I don't disagree with your "wants," but the trends are not in our favor.

Privatizing security at least gets market forces back into the equation, 
which they've been out of for far too long.
