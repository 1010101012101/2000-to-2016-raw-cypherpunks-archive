Yup.  Though I'd disagree with the "in direct danger of physical harm" part.
Only the most foolish or intoxicated rioters are right up front.  Rioting at
the WTO or whatever is statistically safer than running with the bulls at
Pamplona and the looting is MUCH better.  By the way, running with the bulls
is something that folks also travel hundreds, even thousands, of miles to
do).

I think you're wrong; they got the same essentials right:  bait the cops,
overturn cars and burn shit.

I have a very good idea, you're just to ideologically fixated to see the
obvious correctness of it.
