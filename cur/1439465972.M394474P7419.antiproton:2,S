NANOG list could link specific papers regarding nature of the internet.
The various flow exporters have sensible default timeouts tend cover
that ok for purposes intended.

In that various activities such as ssh, browsing, youtube, whatever
are confined to being multiplexed in one stream, that makes sense.

The exporting host has open flow count limited by memory (RAM).
A longer flow might be forced to span two or more records.
The "flags" field of some tools and versions may not mark
a SYN seen in records 2+, the rest of tuple would stay same.
Active timeout gives periodic data on longer flows, typically
retaining start time but implementations can vary on state.

Here's an early IOS 12 default...
  Active flows timeout in 30 minutes (1~60)
  Inactive flows timeout in 15 seconds (10~600)

Also consider what is wished to hide, big iso download,
little http clicks, start time of some characteristic session
rippling across or appearing at edges, active data pumping attack.
And what custom flowish things and flow settings an adversary
might be doing to observe those. Traditional netflow seems
useful as idea base to form a better heuristic analysis system.

In old netflow, UDP, where src/dst ip and port tuple is same,
just times out into a record. Some new exotic DPI might form
session context flow record based on application inside, crypto
would stop the cleartext portion of DPI.

Some flow tools don't reassemble so the frag game might slide
by them in an arms race.

There's no censor here. Other operators in the field can and should speak up
on topic (and feel free to bash any my errors or lack of paper / code
/ data posting).

The Snowden leaks and Bamford also indicate NSA-UTAH, gigawatts, massive
international cable tapping, CARNIVORE, NARUS, X-WHATEVER, etc.
Exploitation could use a few offices full of hackers and some good peering
points and hosts, not that huge $billions level of infrastructure and outside
your borders expenditure. Though blackbagging to stand up an IP in the
target net via an active tap could be useful, the driver to localize
due to cost.

Yes, bigdata still has to conform to at least some kind of cost
benefit analysis and substantiation too. Where is the line on that
these days... 2^40, 2^56, 2^80...?

The questions were of a general "intro to netflow" nature, thus
the links, they and other resource describe all the data fields,
formation of records, timeouts, aggregation, IPFIX extensibility, etc.
Others and I on these lists know what "360 gigs" of netflow looks like.
*What* specific info are you looking for beyond that?
Applicability to exploit? Should people print out flows from a degenerate
client and exit use case and line them up?

More tools and tech...

More generally, netflow is not the only passive analysis tool or idea
out there. So focusing on it may be narrow, though it is popular tool.

Well, I'll speculate that by now they've lawyered up and silenced their
OP such that it's unlikely that we'll hear from them (short of coderman
firing a broadside FOIA at them ;) (We're speculating it's 360 gigs of
netflow.)

Everybody's now asking questions what is possible, my job is done ;)
