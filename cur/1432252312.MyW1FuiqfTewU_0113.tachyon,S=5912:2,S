Abstract
Internet surveillance technologies have recently received attention when  
it became public that Western security companies exported such equipment  
to countries like Syria, Libya, Iran, Egypt or Bahrain, where they seem to 
have been used for repression agaisnt political activists. This research 
report focuses on the analysis of the political economy of one such 
communications surveillance technology - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). It 
analyses societal implications of DPI Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) 
surveillance technologies are communications surveillance tools that are 
able to monitor the traffic of network data that is sent over the Internet 
at all seven layers of the OSI Reference Model of Internet communication, 
which includes the surveillance of content data.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on product sheets,  
self-descriptions, and product presentations by 20 European security  
technology companies that produce and sell DPI technologies. For each
company, we have conducted a document analysis of the available files. It 
focused on the four following aspects:
1) Description and use of the Internet surveillance technologies that are 
produced and sold.
2) The self-description of the company.
3) The explanation of the relevance of Internet surveillance, i.e. why the 
company thinks it is important that it produces and sells such  
technologies.
4) A documentation of what the company says about opportunities and  
problems that can arise in the context of Internet surveillance.
The assessment of societal implications of DPI is based on opinions of  
security industry representatives, scholars, and privacy advocates that  
were voiced in white papers, tech reports, research reports, on websites, 
in press releases, and in news media.
The results can be summarized in the form of several impact dimensions:
1. Potential advantages of DPI
2. Net neutrality
3. The power of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for undermining usersb  
trust
4. Potential function creep of DPI surveillance
5. Targeted advertising
6. The surveillance of file sharers
7. Political repression and social discrimination
The conducted analysis of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies shows 
that there is a variety of potential impacts of this technology on  
society. A general conclusion is that for understanding new surveillance  
technologies, we do not only need privacy and data protection assessments, 
but broader societal and ethical impact assessments that take into account 
the political economy of the security-industrial complex.
