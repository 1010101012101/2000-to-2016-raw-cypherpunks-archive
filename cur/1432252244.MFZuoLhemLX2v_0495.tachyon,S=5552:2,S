Gonzo Marketing
Winning Through Worst Practices

Business & Management
Ladies and gentlemen, please return your tray tables to the fully upright 
and locked position, suspend your disbelief and put on your tinfoil pyramid 
hats. We are now entering [cue lights, cue music] the Brand Dimension!
Gonzo Marketing is a knuckle-whitening ride to the place where social 
criticism, biting satire, and serious commerce meetand where the outdated 
ideals of mass marketing and broadcast media are being left in the dust. As 
master of ceremonies at the wake for traditional one-size-fits-all 
marketing, Locke has assembled a unique guest list, from Geoffrey Chaucer 
to Hunter S. Thompson, to guide us through the revolution that is rocking 
business today, as people connect on the Web to form powerful micromarkets. 
These networked communities, based on candor, trust, passion, and a general 
disdain for anything that smacks of corporate smugness, reflect much deeper 
trends in our culture, which Locke illuminates with his characteristic wit.
Just as gonzo journalism arose in response to objective news standards 
that claimed to foster fairness but in practice discouraged writers from 
speaking their minds in their own voices, so too does gonzo marketing call 
for a similar response to assumptions about consumer behavior that no 
longer relate to how people actually live their lives.
Gonzo Marketing is not yet-another nostrum for hoodwinking the unwary. Its 
about market advocacy. It describes how the artist formerly known as 
advertising must do a 180. Its about transforming the marketing message 
from we want your money to we share your interests. Its about tapping 
into, listening to, and even forming alliances with emerging on-line 
markets, who probably know more about your company than you do. Its a 
hip-hop cover of boring old best practices played backwards. The paradox is 
that companies that support and promote these communities can have 
everything theyve always wanted: greater market share, customer loyalty, 
brand equity.
Irreverent, penetrating, profoundly simple, and on-the-money, Gonzo 
Marketing is the raucous wake-up that no one interested in any aspect of 
twenty-first century businessfrom the trading floor right up to the 
boardroomcan afford to ignore.
Chris Locke is co-author of The Cluetrain Manifesto, president of Entropy 
Web Consulting, and editor/publisher of the widely acclaimed and justly 
infamous webzine, Entropy Gradient Reversals. He has worked for Fujitsu, 
Ricoh, the Japanese governments Fifth Generation artificial intelligence 
project, Carnegie Mellon Universitys Robotics Institute, CMP Publications, 
Mecklermedia, MCI, and IBM. Named in a 2001 Financial Times Group survey as 
one of the top 50 business thinkers in the world, he has written for a 
wide variety of business and technology publications, including Forbes, The 
Industry Standard, Information Week, Harvard Business Review, and Release 
1.0. He lives in Boulder, Colorado.
