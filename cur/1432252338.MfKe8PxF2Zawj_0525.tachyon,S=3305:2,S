That
Aaron Schwarz repeatedly drew attention to himself by recklessly 
disrupting the network shows he thought of himself as the state, and 
those who he harmed as not the state.  Much as Henry Louis Gates 
obviously considered himself the state, and a mere policeman as not the 
state.

Snowden knew he risked punishment for civil disobedience, and so made 
his activities as normal as possible, as unobtrusive as possible. Aaron 
Schwarz did not know, and was so horrified to discover he was not part 
of the powerful that he followed in the footsteps of his hero Wallace 
and killed himself.

Plus, just look at the smirk on his face.  That says "I am powerful and 
protected, and those I have just harmed are not."
