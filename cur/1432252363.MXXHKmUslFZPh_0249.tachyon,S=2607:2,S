Not  if you get out more. Someone called proffr regularly writes to 
Independant media re,Columbia spraying
as a direct threat of a runaway greenhouse.Has threatened monsanto 
employees with AP.
And suggested release of foot in mouth many moons ago on Indymedia.
Seems currently obsessed with leading the FIB astray with false leads and 
scare stories.(psy-war)
proffr is probably a victorian police provocator,probably. Opjizm can get 
all their news here...lazy #@$%
