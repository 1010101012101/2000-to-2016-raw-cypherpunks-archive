Even the laborer these days knows some concept of backups and
security, regardless if they have any clue or motivation to do it.
There's zero reason now why hardware makers cannot include a binary
option:

a) i'm stupid, for now just show me knowledge about secure mode
b) ok, instantiate non-nanny-state secure mode

or

a) your device ships in secure mode
b) do you want to be nannied

Any maker that gratuitously retains control for whatever purpose
and does not provide this does not believe in empowerment, and is
thus shameful.
