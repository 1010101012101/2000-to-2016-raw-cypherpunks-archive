Rumsfeld gives press conference on the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein

Doha, Qatar (Routers) In response to questions as to when coalition 
forces anticipated capturing Saddam Hussein, U.S. Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld had the following reply:

(Sung to the tune of "Ticket to Ride", by the Beatles)

In spite of thousands of bombs,
I'm sorry to say, yeah,
Osama first, now Saddam
Has gotten away!
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
Hope he stays there.

He said living in Baghdad
Was gettin' him down, yeah.
He could never be free
With Frank's troops around.
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
Hope he stays there.

Don't know why our drones fly so high,
They're always searching,
Fruitlessly searching,
To see
The hideout of this dictator guy,
They're always searching,
Fruitlessly searching,
To see.

In spite of thousands of bombs,
I'm sorry to say, yeah,
Osama first, now Saddam
Has gotten away!
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
He's gone to Tikrit to hide,
Hope he stays there.
