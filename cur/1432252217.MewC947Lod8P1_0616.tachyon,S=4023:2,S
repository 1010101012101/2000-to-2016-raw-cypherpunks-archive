None of those things work.  Most spammers don't give a shit if you don't
receive email.  I can attest to this by the slew of spam going to
hostmaster, webmaster, and the like on many networks.  What they're really
selling is "ten million addresses" and spam software.  Even if 9 million
of those are bullshit, they couldn't care less.  The more things with "@"
signs in'em the more money they make off clueless businesses.
