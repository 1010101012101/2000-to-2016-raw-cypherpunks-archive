	The irony in this, to use your analogy to bank robbers, is that 
mandating 128bit SSL is not securing the bank vault, but rather making 
sure nobody but the bank teller and the customer know what they are 
saying to each other (SSL being transport security).

	Most bank robbers in the past wanted in to the safe/vault cause 
that's where the *big* cash is. These days that is done by reading the 
database, rather than sniffing the wire.

	But database security is relatively easy and uninteresting.

	So it makes it more obvious when Bill the Abortion Provider sends

	Part of the problem is that security is a PITA, and they get that 
glimmer, and they start worrying about things, but the habits are 
already there.
