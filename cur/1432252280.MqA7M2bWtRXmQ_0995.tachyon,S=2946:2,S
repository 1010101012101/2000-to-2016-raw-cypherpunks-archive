It is the target audience the game is designed for. If you seriously claim
you don't understand the distinction between market targets for Dr. Seuss,
Quake, and "Debbie does Dallas" then you're entire position is pretty much
toast.

Then why don't you support the parents organizations who ask for nothing
more than to mark the games by 'suitable' age (admittedly a rough target
but life isn't easy or distinct at times) and to require parental
intervention when children purchase material above their age class? That
way nobody but the parent is involved.

But, alas, real life doesn't work that way.

No, as usual the libertarian/crypto-anarchy/capitalist position is to put
profit over ethics. Ethical bankruptcy. It's just another example of why
the 'businesses top priority is profit' strategy doesn't work in the real
world.
