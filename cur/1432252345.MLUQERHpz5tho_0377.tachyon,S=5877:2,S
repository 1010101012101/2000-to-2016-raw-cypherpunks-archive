TI Tackles Need for Secure Wireless Environment with Industry-Leading
Security Solution

(2005-02-13)

 Texas Instruments (TI) [NYSE:TXN] today announced it will be demonstrating
with Orange and Trusted Logic a wireless security handset mechanism
designed to eliminate unauthorized handset use and fraud. The demonstration
also features a 128-bit secure contactless payment application and a
customer loyalty application, powered by TI-RFidTM technology. As wireless
evolves to 3G technology, the need for reliable security around
applications handling sensitive high-value data becomes critical; in
parallel, consumer demand for convenient transactions also becomes
significant. With TI4s security technology at the core of TI4s OMAPTM
processors, the solution provides one of the highest levels of handset
security in the marketplace today.

 The first in the industry to provide a hardware-based system-level
security solution three years ago, TI continues to address growing security
concerns and needs by collaborating with industry leaders such as worldwide
mobile operator Orange and Trusted Logic, a leading provider of secure
software components for embedded systems. Together with Orange and Trusted
Logic, TI will be demonstrating secure mobile payment and secure digital
rights management (DRM) at 3GSM World Congress 2005 in Cannes, France,
February 14-17.

 "Typically, mobile phones and user identities are secured by software
cryptography. However, with mobile phone hacking and fraud on the rise, and
as subscribers increasingly use their mobile phones to conduct wireless
transactions and to download high-value multimedia, software security alone
is insufficient to protect users and mobile data," said Edgar Auslander, TI
general manager of worldwide strategy and corporate development, Wireless
Terminals Business Unit. "TI provides a hardware-based security system
designed to meet stringent security requirements set by mobile operators
and financial services and content providers."

 "As new applications, business models and revenue opportunities arise in
the mobile device market, so do the risks posed by hackers and malicious
attacks to handsets to operator and third-party assets," said Laurent
Coureau, strategic advisor, Orange. "TI's complete system-level security
technology, combined with our standard based security middleware OVM,
brings end-to-end security in an open and secure environment, leveraging
trusted hardware and software components and building the foundation for
new, value-added services based on enhanced customer trust."

 In the TI booth, Hall 2, Booth E19, TI will showcase consumer value-added
secure services, enabled by TI's security technology in OMAP processors,
Orange Operator Virtual Machine (OVM) and Trusted Logic Security Module,
including contactless financial transactions and a contactless customer
relationship management (CRM) application. The demo will use Orange OMA DRM
v2.0 compliant secure multimedia contents downloads, rights management,
decryption and play, as well as TI-RFid technology secured by 128-bit 3DES
cryptography, as the air interface.

 "Users are growing more comfortable with carrying out transactions
wirelessly, hence the need for a secure environment becomes even more
critical," said Dominique Bolignano, Trusted Logic president and chief
executive officer. "By leveraging each others' features, Trusted Logic's
Security Module, which fully complies with the OVM specifications, and TI's
security technology work synergistically to exponentially strengthen
overall system security. This enables operators in providing consumers with
a secure, trusted environment for financial services and protected mobile
data."

 Together, Texas Instruments, Orange and Trusted Logic are working to
reduce handset fraud while addressing new security services for the
wireless environment, including DRM and verification; music, video, games
and other application downloads; remote terminal management; m-commerce
transactions; and over-the-air (OTA) provisioning of new services and "bug"
fixes using the mobile phone. TI is committed to an open, non-proprietary
approach to the wireless marketplace and actively works with technology,
applications and security standards bodies to drive open standards and
wireless innovation.
