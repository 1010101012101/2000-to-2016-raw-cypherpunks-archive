It's all just politics...

Bush said keep it out of the courts,
then went to Federal court.

#    
#    The Florida Supreme Court, in a one-paragraph decision, denied 
#    a petition by Florida Secretary of State Harris to halt manual 
#    recounts in at least two counties and consolidate 11 lower-court 
#    cases into a single one. The ruling gave elections officials 
#    in Palm Beach and Broward counties reason to restart a hand count 
#    of as many as 1 million votes.
#    
#    The Bush campaign has argued that the seven-member state panel 
#    - filled entirely by Democrats - has no authority in the case. 
#    "It's my opinion that the [Florida] Supreme Court has no 
#    jurisdiction," said Barry Richard, a Bush legal adviser.
