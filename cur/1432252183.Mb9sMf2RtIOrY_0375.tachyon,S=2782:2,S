In conjunction with First Monday's "Unite to End Gun Violence" campaign,
the Children's Defense Fund (motto: Defend Children, Not Guns) released a
report today on "Children and Guns."

http://www.childrensdefense.org/youthviolence/Gun-report-2000.htm

Readers will be unsurprised and unimpressed by the CDF's usual tactics,
including definition of 19-yr-old gang bangers as "children."

ObCrypto: Children should have widespread access to *all* munitions... not
just naughty handguns.
