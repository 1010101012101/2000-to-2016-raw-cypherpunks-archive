Actually it's the OTHER way around:

"Presidential Executive Order 12333 - 1.13 allows the FBI to provide the
NSA with =E2=80=9Ctechnical assistance=E2=80=9D in the United States=E2=80=
=A6 ie. to collect
metadata about American citizens by collaborating with =E2=80=9Cforeign
intelligence and law enforcement services=E2=80=9D.

In other words, "President Obama could end mass domestic surveillance
with one stroke of his pen."
