	No, they don't. Spoke with an officer this evening about it. 

	The cover (at least the academy he went to here in SillyCon valley) 4 amendment issues, and only from the practical standpoint, not the philosphical standpoint, and mostly was "scenario" based.

	No, they would have to arrest everyone they witnessed (or knew) committed an act that violated the law. 

	Other than said 4th amendment issues, street cops *rarely* get involved in constitutional issues.

	Uh. No. 

	From her *ACTIONS* she did not believe in the "Rule Of Law", but believed strongly in the long arm and mailed fist of the law. 

	Witness her actions, and the actions of departments under her. The FBI was, in direct violation of the brady law, retaining the information about firearm purchases. Witness how quickly the Waco crime scene was bulldozed. Witness DOJ lawyers arguing in the Ruby Ridge case that Lon H. was not touchable by state law because he was a Fed acting under orders.

	Still waiting to hear about the Emerson case (and the 5th is in New Orleans IIRC).

	Well, no. Only about 1/2 of the ablating. The other half is Congresses power to tax. (At the federal level a good number of firearms cases are on charges of failing to file and or pay the class 2 or 3 weapons tax stamp).

	I understand "shall not", it's the "infringed" I'm asking about. 

	Is it *really* an infringement on your rights to require firearms manufacturers to meet reasonable standards of functioning? In fact, given the basis of the second amendment--that arms are to be available for self-defense, defense of the community and defense of or from the Nation, it could easily be argued that government legislation standardizing a reasonable level of functionality and safety (minimum rounds between malfunctions, drop tests) are not only not infringements, but are enhancements--the guarantee (as much as legislation can) that the arm you buy at the Walmart store will be useful in it's constitutional indicated manner. 

	I'm not arguing for such laws, IMO they aren't needed, but they still would mostly like *not* be considered an infringement.

	Whether the free market can provide this or not is orthagonal to the question.

	There are a lot of things that in a society are unavoidable. The question is whether those things should be encouraged or discouraged. 

	My contention is that encouraging a LEO to decide for himself whether a law is constitutional or not is both wrong, and counter productive.

	Factual implementation, outside of dot-coms, should descend from theory.
