Once nice thing about memory-bound functions is that,
while spammers could build custom hardware farms in Florida or China,
a large amount of spam is delivered by hijacked PCs or abused relays/proxies,
which run on standard PC hardware, not custom, so it'll still be slow.

Penny Black or any other system that involves tweaking the email protocols
gets a one-time win in blocking spam, because older badly-administered
mail relays won't be running the new system - if their administrators
upgrade them to support the new features, hopefully that will turn off
any relay capabilities.  That doesn't apply to cracked zombie machines,
since the crackers can install whatever features they need,
but at least all of those Korean cable-modem boxes won't run it.
