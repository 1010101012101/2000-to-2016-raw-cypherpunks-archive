This is the "dead librarian switch."

And in these times when the Constitution has been shredded, when 
dissidents are being sent to concentration camps in Cuba, when thought 
criminals who post links to explosives knowledge are in prison, perhaps 
"dead librarian switch" has literal meaning.

I am giving thought to visiting one of my local libraries and 
sauntering up the checkout desk and casually saying "So, what about 
this Patriot Act and librarians narcing us out to Big Brother?"

Then, after hearing her explanation, just as casually saying "Well, I 
hope it never happens. Because if I ever learn that you have narced me 
out, I would of course have to lie in wait until you leave the library 
and then do what needs to be done."

Seriously, maybe librarians need to realize at a gut level that if they 
act as stool pigeons, as narcs, then some of them may pay the same 
price that rats in general sometimes pay.
