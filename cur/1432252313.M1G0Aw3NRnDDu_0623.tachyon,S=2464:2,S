Someone here suggested Morpheus as a rapidly growing replacement for
the company formerly known as Napster.  It currently (7 Aug 01 8PM EDT)
lists over 610,000
folks online; sharing 712 Million files; totalling 338 terabytes.  Since
beginning
observing Morpheus a few days ago, these figures have grown visibly..

How big is Gnutella?

Do its clients have the excellent download-resumption ability that
Morpheus (and others
built on the same engine) does?
