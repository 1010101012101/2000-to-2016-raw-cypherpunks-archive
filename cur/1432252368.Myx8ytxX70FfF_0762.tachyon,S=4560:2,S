You're right - they did not specifically mention "mesh", which probably 
means this individual is operating even one level of abstraction higher .. 
in the realm of "I know computers can do wonderful things".

ToR in this context doesn't make much sense to me - it's a network 
designed to run over the public Internet, and the whole point of his 
"dream" is to get out from under the thumb of the public internet.

Did I misread, and he thinks that a bunch of low power micro devices, as 
nodes on the plain old Internet, are going to be helpful in any way ? 
Tahoe-LAFS makes a bit more sense, as it makes content available without 
shackling any one system (operator) with liability for that content.

Well, if you're suggesting that I have little to contribute, you're right. 
My interests float into this area, and I've lurked long enough on BATMAN 
and MANET and OLSR to know when to call bullshit, but that's about it.

Make no mistake - I agree with the sentiment that this is possible, and 
that it's coming, and I will be very happy when/if it does ... I just 
think some dose of reality is needed for the boingboing set of 
"technologists".

I think the BATMAN people have some long, detailed summaries of successful 
implementations in places like .de and .it and so on.  By successful, I 
mean, they got packets to flow.  The deeper issues of establishing 
everything with no centralized authority, etc., are unsolved.

That's good news - better that someone is pushing in this direction than 
not...
