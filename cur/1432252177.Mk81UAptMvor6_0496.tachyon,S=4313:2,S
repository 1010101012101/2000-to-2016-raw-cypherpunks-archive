  Subject: Call for IFCA Conference Sponsors, Financial Cryptography and
 Data Security '06

  Dear Robert,

  The Financial Cryptography and Data Security '06 is celebrating its
  10th year in Anguilla, British West Indies from February 27 to March
  2, 2006.  This conference has become a yearly touch-stone for those
  involved in the construction and use of technology in commercial
  environments.  To this end, the conference brings together top
  cryptographers, data-security specialists, and scientists with
  economists, bankers, implementers, and policy makers.

  Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC'06 program will feature
  invited talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations, and
  panel discussions. In addition, we will celebrate this 10th year
  edition with a number of initiatives, such as: especially focused
  session, technical and historical state-of-the-art panels, and one
  session of surveys.

  As a past attendee, IFCA wishes to make a plea for your sponsorship.
  The importance of this conference to the larger security community is
  clear, and it is largely sustainable through the generous support of
  its sponsors.  The benefit to your organization is also well worth the
  sacrifice: sponsors receive the kinds unique exposure to the
  cognoscenti that can only be received at these events.  Sponsorship
  opportunities are available at modest levels and beyond.

  If you are interested in sponsoring, we would be very interested in
  talking to you.  Please visit the conference website:

                http://siis.cse.psu.edu/fc06/

  Feel free reply to this message or send email to myself
  (mcdaniel@cse.psu.edu) or contact me via phone (814) 863-3599 for
  further information.

  Sincerely,
  Patrick McDaniel, General Chair, FC '06
