Interesting: especially in light of the fact that the Supreme Court has held 
that monitoring (with a pen register) the telephone numbers that an individual 
calls from his home is *not* a search, in that it constitutes information 
already being monitored by the telephone company. 

I suppose this same logic would hold true for what's already being monitored by 
the electric company, or, say, what your ISP is already monitoring. So perhaps 
the "solution" to getting around warrants would lie less in superadvanced 
MASINT than in giving the private sector incentives for doing more monitoring 
themselves--while quietly developing your own set of tools to take advantage of 
it.

A sobering thought.
