Huh?  Let's make this simple.  How is California's lack of power plants 
causing natural gas prices to rise?  Plants that don't exist don't use gas 
and don't contribute to shortages. 

California's importing power from elsewhere, so why didn't these other generators 
commit to natural gas suppliers?  

Hint: transmission losses aren't a recent discovery.   

Either you're confused or you're trying to use the cold winter as an excuse 
to create a strawman for your anti-Californian views.  

Tim, Jim and Bill have already given good responses to the economic side 
of things, so I won't comment further in that vein.

Or:

It would be nice if everybody took responsibility for their lifestyle, took 
care of their own power needs and dealt with environmental issues themselves. 
  You have a choice, if you don't want higher power bills, don't use power.
