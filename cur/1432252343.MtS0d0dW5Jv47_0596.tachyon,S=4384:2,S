That is why I wote "usually" -- it may vary.

So, you think that  credit-cards deals would not need names or any real-life id, just assets?

Surely, the merchant gets paid regardless, even  if you use a false name.  But this is not the
end of id fraud. The bank still goes after the money...and uses the law against fraudulent
practices to enforce the cardholder agreement, or criminal statues. If Mr. X uses his wife's
credit-card, Mr. X is technically committing id fraud, and wire-fraud. Of course it works most
of the time... But when it does not, and someone comes enforcing, someone will ask, did you
Mr X, uses Mrs X's credit-card, and represent yourself thereby as Mrs X?
