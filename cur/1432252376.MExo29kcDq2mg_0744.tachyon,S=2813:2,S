Buy a decent fucking modem and dump that dinosaur. At 28.8k we're looking
at less than 1m to d/l a 100k file. Big fucking time sink, especially when
considering the total amount of mail one probably receives. If you're
sitting there watching your mail d/l then you're bitching cause you got
too much time on your hands.

This list is about advancing technology and you bunch want to stay at
1980's sorts of handling technology simply because some small percentage
of folks aren't willing to upgrade to current tech. It's their choice,
it's their cross, it's their loss.

You'r a bunch of self-absorbed self-important whinners.
