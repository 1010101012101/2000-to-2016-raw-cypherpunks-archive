[Note from Matthew Gaylor:   This is perhaps the only spike in 
destabilizing and de-radicalizing religious intolerants that has a 
good chance of working-  A culture attack aimed at their kids. The US 
already heavily pays for programming insertions in the American media 
market mostly against drug use so this is a natural extension-  MTV 
is a prime propaganda target with anti-drug and anti-violence (really 
anti-gun) story lines and  media products, such as CDs, CD-ROMs, 
being financed by the Justice Dept.  I've actually advocated that 
efforts be made to make such programming available in totalitarian 
countries via unblocked and unscrambled satellite feeds.  The Red 
Chinese currently have a problem trying to stem the flow of 
mini-satellite dishes-  To which I say tough luck.]

    WASHINGTON (Variety) - The architects of the government's post-Sept.
    11 propaganda war may well want their MTV on the frontlines in the
    Arab world.

    Rushing to shift perceptions of the United States in the Islamic
    world, Washington and Hollywood are now brainstorming about how the
    entertainment business might help convey a wider -- and more positive
    -- range of perceptions about America. And no demo is more crucial to
    the future of Islamic-Western relations than the 15-30 age group.
    That's where MTV comes in.
