Right, just because Shrubb-ya and Blair lied to get congress to approve a
war on Iraq so he could steal the oil, it doesn't mean that Saddam was a
saint and that his human rights violations (read: torture, murder, rape,
pillage) could be dismissed, and he didn't deserve to be forced off the
throne.

The Hussein bunch got what they deserved.  Fuck'em.

What's disturbing is that "we" put that motherfucker in power, and
supplied him with the means to carry out his attrocies against his own
people, we fueld the fires of the Iran/Iraq war by feeding both sides with
weapons and intel, and so on.
