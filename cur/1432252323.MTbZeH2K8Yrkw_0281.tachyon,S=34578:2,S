TALKS/PANELS FOR H2K2 - 7/12-14/2002 - NYC - www.h2k2.net

------------------------------------------------------------------

Abuse of Authority

Over the years, there have been many stories in the hacker world of law
enforcement personnel who have abused their authority. Two of the more
dramatic cases in recent memory both come out of Philadelphia. Many of
us are already familiar with the horror story of Bernie S. who wound up
in dangerous prisons for nearly a year all because the United States
Secret Service had a vendetta against him. Then there is the case of
ShapeShifter, 2600 layout artist, who was arrested at the Republican
National Convention in 2000 (shortly after leading a panel on the RNC
at H2K) and held on half a million dollars bail as if he were a
terrorist mastermind - all because he had been targeted for speaking
out in public. Hear the games the authorities play and how public
education really can make a difference in putting an end to such abuse.

Hosted by Bernie S. and ShapeShifter

--------------------

Access Control Devices

There are all kinds of access control devices that we come in contact
with every day. They include such things as magnet readers, proximity
card readers, fingerprint readers, camera systems, biometrics, and
basic standard operating procedures for a business. This talk will be a
comprehensive guide to what's out there.

Hosted by Mike Glasser

--------------------

The Argument Against Security Through Obscurity
for the Non-Digital World

In the world of networked computers, security through obscurity is
generally ineffective. Hiding algorithms, protecting source code, and
keeping procedures secret might be effective initially, but eventually
the cloak of secrecy is penetrated. This talk will examine how security
through obscurity is relied upon in the non-computerized world. When
can security through obscurity work? What risk analysis should we use
to examine the role of obscurity in the non-computerized world? The
talk will present and examine the hypothesis that an "open source"
mentality should be applied to security procedures for public places.
This is a logical extension of the lesson in cryptanalysis - that no
cryptographic method can be considered trustworthy until it has
undergone a rigorous examination by qualified persons. Similarly, can
we trust security procedures in the physical world designed,
ostensibly, to protect the public if these procedures never undergo
public scrutiny?

Hosted by Greg Newby

--------------------

Black Hat Bloc
or
How I Stopped Worrying About Corporations
and Learned to Love the Hacker Class War

Hackers must deal with governments and ultimately the corporations
that wield most of the decision making power within them. Looking over
the past few decades of hacker interaction with corporations, we
notice some interesting trends in the two worlds that indicate strong
influences of the corporate and hacker worlds on the other's ethics
and culture, often only hinted at to the rest of the world via biased
corporate PR machines in the form of broadcast and publishing media.
Hacker posts to Bugtraq become resumes, hacker tech like BBSes and IRC
become the technical implementations of every Internet startup's
business plan, hackers testify in front of Congress to warn them of
impending doom directly resulting in increased federal cybercrime
funding, while piracy is accepted by governments and media (but not
the public) as theft. Has hacking become the fast venture capitalist
track to shiny gadgets that go fast and make noise, a la Slashdot?
Should we ignore intellectual property legislation and treaties that
are passed solely to make rich people richer? This talk takes a look
at where hacker/corporate/government relationships have been, where
they are now, and where they could be going - hopefully shedding some
light on everyone's motivations along the way.

Hosted by Gweeds

--------------------

Bullies on the Net - The Ford and Nissan Cases

We could fill the entire weekend with stories like these and we have no
doubt there will be many more such tales in the years to come. With the
help of agencies, corporations, treaties, and laws with acronyms like
ICANN, WIPO, WTO, and the DMCA, the individual very often finds himself
at the mercy of corporate giants with virtually unlimited funding - and
seemingly unlimited power. Throughout it all however, there remains
hope. Hear the story of Uzi Nissan, who is being sued by the Nissan
Motor Company for daring to use his own name on the Internet. We'll
also talk about how the Ford Motor Company sued 2600 - and lost.

Hosted by Emmanuel Goldstein, Eric Grimm, and Uzi Nissan

--------------------

Caller ID Spoofing

A demonstration of how Caller ID works as well as methods that can be
used to emulate and display spoofed Caller ID messages on Caller ID and
Caller ID with Call Waiting boxes using a Bell 202 modem. Details on the
technical aspects such as Caller ID protocol for both regular and Call Waiting
Caller ID. If all goes well, you may actually see a live demonstration of
spoofed Caller ID.

Hosted by Lucky225 and Tray Smee

--------------------

"The Conscience of a Hacker"

Probably the most famous single essay about what it's like to be a
hacker is "The Conscience of a Hacker" by The Mentor, written in 1986.
It's been quoted all over the place, including the movie "Hackers." It
remains one of the most inspirational pieces written about the hacker
community and it's survived well over time. This year, we're pleased to
have The Mentor himself give a reading of it and offer additional
insight.

--------------------

Crypto for the Masses

This panel will approach cryptography from the perspective of enabling a
'digital world' where key social schemes are preserved -- personal
identity, anonymity, and the right to privacy.  We'll talk about the basic
inner workings of cryptosystems, and discuss how they can be applied now
to create and enforce cyber rights.  We'll also discuss the hurdles faced
by crypto and its adopters, and the public at large.  We'll also learn
just how crypto is being threatened and abused by certian global goons.

--------------------

Cult of the Dead Cow Extravaganza

This year, the megamerican computer hackers of patriotism, Cult of the
Dead Cow, honor our country with "Hooray for America!" -- an all-star
revue including the Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales, NASCAR champion Dingus
McProstate, and the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. Reid Fleming will give
a thorough and thoroughly educational description of the history and
symbology of the Great Seal (which you can find on the back side of a
$1 bill). Grandmaster Ratte himself will lead the audience in a
sustained chant of "U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" Oh, and maybe there will
be some new software too.

--------------------

Databases and Privacy

Once again, world renowned private eye Steve Rambam will enlighten and
frighten attendees with the latest updates on the personal information
that is out there about each and every one of us. Find out which
databases contain the most invasive information and who has access to
them, as well as what you can do to protect your privacy. There will
also be a discussion on truth and accountability on the net as well as
live demonstrations.

--------------------

The DeCSS Story

At our last conference, we were preparing to go on trial for daring to
have the code to DeCSS on our web site. Quite a lot has happened since
then. The public perception of entities like the MPAA and the RIAA has
gone down the toilet as their true motives became apparent. We were the
first in what will be a long line of courtroom battles to defend
freedom of speech, fair use, and open source technology. While we lost
the case and the subsequent appeal, we still somehow feel victorious.
Find out why.

Hosted by Emmanuel Goldstein, Robin Gross, and Ed Hernstadt

--------------------

Digital Demonstrations: Criminal DDoS Attack or Cyber Sit-in?

Being able to carry political opinions to the public by showing them on
the street is a basic part of democratic rights. Nowadays, a steadily
increasing part of our life takes place in cyberspace. Things which
aren't happening in cyberspace will therefore get less and less public
attention. How can protest be taken into the virtual realm? What
strategies for "online demonstrations" have we seen so far? How about
the ethical and legal dimensions? Who gets hurt? Host Maximillian
Dornseif will present a new approach for conducting online
demonstrations without adversely affecting other users on the net.

--------------------

DMCA Legal Update

Since we last met, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has claimed
more victims and been at the forefront of all kinds of legal action. We
even had the first instance of a programmer being thrown into prison
because of a program he wrote while in his native Russia! Hear the
latest on the Dmitry Sklyarov case and others that the DMCA is
responsible for as well as what is being done to put an end to it.

Hosted by Mike Godwin, Eric Grimm, and Robin Gross

--------------------

Educating Lawmakers - Is It Possible?

Trying to educate Congress about technology is approximately as useful
as teaching a pig to type. It doesn't work and you get one peeved pig.
But there are sometimes ways to make a difference in law and policy
circles without becoming a wholly owned tool of the Demopublican Party.
A discussion with journalist Declan McCullagh and cryptologist Matt
Blaze.

--------------------

Everything you ever wanted to know about spying
and did not know who to ask....

This is pure balls-out fun. Former spy Robert Steele will answer questions about
any aspect of intelligence or counterintelligence, to include covert
action in Central America, ECHELON, how and why we completely missed
the warnings on bin Laden and 9/11, etc. This can be considered an
extension of the H2K session, which lasted for hours.

--------------------

Face Scanning Systems at Airports: Ready for Prime Time?

A talk about the technical problems of face scanning systems being used
at airports to pick out terrorists. Will these systems work like the
promoters are claiming they will? Or will they fail to catch terrorists
and instead turn our airports into round-up zones for petty criminals?

Hosted by Richard M. Smith

--------------------

"Freedom Downtime"

A presentation of the 2600 documentary on the Free Kevin movement
followed by a Q&A session with some of the key people involved in the
making of the film.

--------------------

Fun With 802.11b

Would you be surprised if you could turn on your laptop anywhere in the
city and find yourself on someone else's network? How about if you were
able to connect to the Internet? Or see someone's private data go
flying by? It's all possible and it happens all the time - all over the
country. This panel will cover 802.11 wireless ethernet networking
basics, as well as detecting and monitoring wireless networks with
active and passive methods. Community free networks, custom antennas,
and methods of securing wireless networks will also be covered.

Hosted by dragorn

--------------------

Fucking Up the Internet at ICANN: Global Control
Through the Domain Name System and How to Escape

Did you know that the entire Internet domain structure is controlled by
a mysterious group called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN)? Andy Mueller-Maguhn, longtime member and spokesman
of Germany's Chaos Computer Club and currently elected from European
users to be on the board of ICANN, will explain the latest developments
at ICANN and how the mixture of intellectual property and governmental
interests affects the freedom of the Internet. Paul Garrin, founder of
name.space and FREE.THE.MEDIA!, will talk about his initiatives to
establish rights to access to the legacy ROOT.ZONE, from the historical
antitrust action against Network Solutions in 1997 through the US
Department of Commerce's IFWP process (the predecessor to ICANN), and
Name.Space's $50,000.00 TLD application to ICANN in 2000 (ICANN kept
the money and took three TLD's previously published by Name.Space). The
question is raised: Is there hope for seeking fair access to the legacy
ROOT.ZONE through due process or is it time to treat ICANN as "damage"
and route around it?

--------------------

Fun with Pirate Radio and Shortwave

Too few people take the time to appreciate shortwave radio. Even fewer
have the opportunity to appreciate pirate radio. Here's your chance to
learn more about these fascinating subjects. Allan Weiner will talk
about his days operating Radio New York International, a famous pirate
station from the 80's that served the New York area before it was
raided by federal authorities in international waters. (We have no idea how
the feds got away with that.) Today Weiner operates shortwave station WBCQ -
along with chief engineer Timtron - which serves nearly the entire
western hemisphere from studios in Maine. Craig Harkins joins the panel
to talk of his experiences operating Anteater Radio during much of the
90's from an 18-wheeler truck. He received international acclaim from
listeners while consistently evading American and Canadian radio police.

--------------------

GNU Radio: Free Software Radio Collides with Hollywood's Lawyers

The GNU Radio project is building a platform for experimenting with
software radios - systems where the actual waveforms received and
transmitted are defined by software, not special purpose hardware. One
of their projects is building an all-software ATSC (HDTV) receiver. An
all-software free ATSC receiver would allow among other things the
construction of the mother of all "personal video recorders." Think
Tivo or Replay on steroids. The folks from the Broadcast Protection
Discussion Group (BPDG) have other ideas. They'd like to lock up the
cleartext signal and make sure that only members of their club would
be allowed to build receivers, modulators, and storage devices for
digital TV. A discussion of where this is all likely to head. Panel
participants include GNU Radio technical folks Eric Blossom and Matt
Ettus as well as representatives from the EFF.

--------------------

Hacking for Community Radio

The technical and political struggle to take back the airwaves for the
community. A panel discussion about the attempt to build linux based
free software that can stream broadcast quality audio over the Internet
from a studio to a transmitter site. In addition, there will be
discussion on attempts to use wireless ethernet to shoot broadcast
quality audio across town with high gain antennas and 2.4 gigahertz
amplifiers.

Hosted by Pete Tridish from the Prometheus Radio Project, Josh
Marcus, Dave Arney, and Roland Aguilar from the Philadelphia
Independent Media Center, and K. Clair from the Genderchangers.

--------------------

Hacking Nanotech

Nanofabrication technology is an up and coming field that will
revolutionize the way humans live on a day to day basis. Host Jim
"Cips" tells what the future projections about nanofabrication are -
things like robots so small you would need an electron microscope to
see them. There will also be an examination of some amazing
achievements that have been accomplished already as well as an analysis
of the possible ethical problems that may arise with nanofabrication in
the future.

--------------------

Hacking National Intelligence:
Possibilities for a Public Intelligence Revolution

Robert David Steele, author of two books on intelligence reform and
sponsor of the Council on Intelligence, will provide a briefing on the
state of the world, 21st Century tradeoffs that are NOT being made by
our elected leaders, and how citizens can take back the power by
practicing the new craft of intelligence to monitor and instruct their
elected officials on key national security decisions. Among other major
aspects, this would translate into a freezing of the Pentagon budget at
$250 billion a year and redirection of $150 billion a year toward
global education, public health, water and energy conservation, and
"soft power" options including diplomacy and information peacekeeping,
a term Steele devised in the early 1990's.

--------------------

Hacking the Invisible World

Everything you could possibly want to know about the workings of
scanners, frequency counters, intercepting/spoofing RF A/V feeds,
STL's, pagers, infrared signs, night vision, electronic surveillance,
etc.

Hosted by Craig Harkins, Bernie S., and Barry "The Key" Wels

--------------------

Hardware Q&A

Explore a different form of hacking and interface directly with fellow
electronics enthusiasts. Javaman and friends will try to answer any
questions related to hardware and electronics including but not limited
to hardware tokens, radio/wireless technologies, embedded systems,
smart cards, and secure hardware design.

--------------------

How to Start an IMC in Your Town

At H2K, Jello Biafra urged attendees to become the media. Since then, many
people have done just that. One of the most powerful tools in fighting
the corporate media's stranglehold on information in this country has
been the Indymedia network. Learn what's involved with becoming a part
of Indymedia, the various hurdles and roadblocks you can expect to
face, and how you can make a difference.

--------------------

Human Autonomous Zones: The Real Role of Hackers

How the role of hackers in society has changed. They used to be a
necessary counterbalance to corporate and government power. Now, it's
more like hackers are the only ones who understand the technology. They
have become a balance to the power of technology itself. A discussion
by renowned author Doug Rushkoff.

--------------------

"I Am Against Intellectual Property"

In the words of host Nelson Denoon: "Quit fucking apologizing for
filesharing. Intellectual property is evil, filesharing is freedom
fighting, and the sooner Jack Valenti is bumming quarters for a living,
the better. The question is not how to protect artists, it is how to
muster enough force to protect the right to hack."

--------------------

The Ins and Outs of Webcasting

While the airwaves have been almost completely taken over by corporate
interests, there is a whole world of broadcasting on the Internet just
waiting for creative minds. Find out what it takes to get an Internet
station going and what kinds of creative programming are possible.
Also, learn what the recently mandated RIAA licensing fees will mean to
the future of this broadcasting medium.

--------------------

Keynote: Aaron McGruder

Just about everyone has at one time or another read the daily comic
strip "The Boondocks." Not everyone has appreciated it. In fact, it's
generated a share of controversy among the mainstream for its
"alternative" views. In addition, McGruder has devoted space to hacker
issues, most notably the DeCSS case - which was presented accurately
for probably the first time in most of the papers his strip appears in.
McGruder is one of those rare individuals with access to the mainstream
who actually "gets" the technical issues. Needless to say, he has been
targeted relentlessly by censors for daring to speak his mind. Sound
familiar?

--------------------

Keynote: Siva Vaidhyanathan

"Life in a Distributed Age"

Distributed information systems of all kinds are challenging cultural
and political assumptions. The moral of the story is that whether we
like it or not, it's time to take anarchy seriously. We have spent the
past 200 years thinking centralization of power and information was the
greatest challenge to republican forms of government and corporatized
commerce. But now, it should be clear, decentralization and encryption
have emerged as the most important dynamics of power.

--------------------

Lockpicking

Barry "The Key" Wels returns from The Netherlands to provide details of some
high security lock weaknesses and to demonstrate some state of the art
techniques of exploiting them. He will tell the story of a company that had
the famous line "Nobody can pick this lock" on their website. Of course,
this was the ultimate motivation for the sport-lockpickers. This panel is where
you can find out if a particular lock can be picked or not. Spare locks are
always welcome, as TOOOL (The Open Organization of Lockpickers)
is short of good locks.

--------------------

LPFM Basics

Learn exactly how to navigate the LPFM licensing process. Pete Tridish
of the Prometheus Radio Project and John Ramsey of Ramsey Electronics
will present background about the fight for community radio and explain
the absurd technical limitations placed on low-power community FM radio
stations by powerful corporate interests.

--------------------

Magic Lantern and Other Evil Things

A talk by Rudy Rucker Jr. on the BadTrans worm and the FBI's Magic
Lantern software. Both of these pieces of software are very similar and
install keystroke logging software on clients' machines. Rucker has
collected a couple of gigabytes of the BadTrans data and will explain
how he parsed it and created a web-based tool for people to browse the
database.

--------------------

Making Money on the Internet While Still Saying "Fuck"

Pud of fuckedcompany.com will speak about his experiences setting up
and maintaining a popular Web site for corporate rumors. How does he
handle confidentiality of rumor-mongers, avoid lawsuits, provide custom
software to drive the site, and make money from it?

--------------------

Negativland - Past, Present, Future

If there is any one group who personifies the concept of "fair use,"
that group would have to be Negativland. The Bay Area based band has,
over the years, drawn the ire of everyone from rock band U2 to American
Top 40 host Casey Kasim to angry parents to confused legislators. Lead
singer Mark Hosler hosts this presentation which will focus on media
literacy as well as the activism, pranks, and hoaxes that Negativland
has engaged in over the years. A number of rare Negativland films will
also be shown.

--------------------

The New FBI and How It Can Hurt You

On May 29, the Federal Bureau of Investigation dramatically changed its
focus. Now, instead of investigating crimes, its mission is to prevent
them, meaning they have virtual carte blanche to infiltrate any law
abiding organization or gathering to make sure all is right. And, even
better, their third priority of dangerous crimes to stop (next to
terrorism and espionage) is "cybercrime." We all know what a wide net
that can be. Hear the dangers firsthand from the people who follow this
kind of thing.

Hosted by Mike Levine, Declan McCullagh, Robert Steele

--------------------

Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

The OSSTMM came about as a need for an open, free security testing
methodology in response to the numerous security testing companies who
claimed to have a secret, internal, and corporate confidential
methodology for testing. It was this methodology that they used to
differentiate themselves from other testing companies. The problem was
that often it didn't exist and the tests turned out to be no more than
commercial scanners set loose on a list of systems. The development of
the OSSTMM began as a series of logical steps to make a good test and
grew into the need to make the most thorough test. This presentation
will show the origin of the OSSTMM and the logic behind it, as well as
results of reverse-engineering the reports of corporate tests,
commercial tools, and commercial presentations.

Hosted by Pete Herzog

--------------------

The Password Probability Matrix

A winnowing method for brute-force password cracking using lossy
compression. Cryptologist Jon Erickson will present the specifics for a
newly developed password cracking method and perform a demonstration of
it. The method is a hybrid between using computational power and
storage space for an exhaustive brute-force attack utilizing a
compressed matrix of probabilistic values. He will demonstrate the
ability to crack any 4 character password with a fixed salt in under
8 seconds (assuming 10,000 cracks per second), using only a 141 meg file.
A normal exhaustive brute-force on the same system would take over
2 hours, and flat text storage of the plaintext/hash pairs would normally
use over a gigabyte of storage. This translates to 99.9% keyspace
reduction and 89% storage compression.

--------------------

The Patriot Act

Members of the New York City People's Law Collective will be discussing
the dangers of the Patriot Act and providing information on warrants,
hacktivism, what is legal and what is not, and ways that hackers,
activists, and normal citizens can protect themselves from The Man.

--------------------

Protection for the Masses

Host Rop Gonggrijp gives updates on two projects designed to help
people protect their privacy from prying eyes. One is a localhost mail
proxy for PGP that is really nice and could "save the world" as the PGP
plugins stop working (soon...). The other one is Secure Notebook, a
project to create a notebook which runs Windows, yet is secure against
theft. Source for all projects will be open for review.

--------------------

RetroComputing

This year's retrocomputing panel will focus on hardware hacking and
cloning such systems as the Apple ][ and C64. Also included will be a
discussion on homebrew microcomputers and kits from the 70's as well as
antique cellphone hacking. Witness firsthand genuine pieces of history.
Attendees are encouraged to bring their really old computers for the
"retrocomputer neighborhood" in the network room.

Hosted by Mr. Ohm, Sam Nitzberg, Nightstalker, and Bernie S.

--------------------

Secure Telephony: Where ARE the Secure Phones?

Panel participants will take a look at the history of secure phones,
what's worked and what hasn't, who the players are, and what needs to
happen to make truly secure telephony a ubiquitous reality. Panel
members include former Starium CTO Eric Blossom and Rop Gonggrijp of
NAH6.

--------------------

The Shape of the Internet: Influence and Consequence

Network researchers have discovered strong power law relationships
in the Internet. These can be interpreted as a direct fingerprint
of the fractal structure present on the net. Work has only recently
begun on analyzing the implications of such a structure on attack
tolerance, government snooping, and the like. In this talk, a review
of these topics will be presented, along with a proposed network
structure that can avoid such issues.

Hosted by Javaman

--------------------

Social Engineering

A tradition started at the first HOPE conference in 1994, the social
engineering panel remains one of our most popular each and every time.
It would be wrong for us to tell you what we have planned because then
our victims might have a fighting chance of escaping. Suffice to say,
we will find someone somewhere who will tell us something they really
shouldn't have because they believed we were somebody we weren't. This
panel is always open to participants so if you feel you're worthy, just
let us know during the conference and you might find yourself up on
stage trying to be clever on the phone.

--------------------

Standing Up To Authority

"How is it you folks have gotten away with not getting shut down by the
powers-that-be?" is the question most frequently asked of Cryptome
(www.cryptome.org) since its inception in 1996. Post-9/11 H2K2 is an
opportune time and place to reconsider implications of this question
with Cryptome founders John Young and Deborah Natsios, New York
City-based architects (of bricks and mortar), who will discuss their
means and methods of sustaining activism in the face of opposition,
with reference to ongoing cases.

--------------------

Steganography: Wild Rumors and Practical Applications

Is Osama bin Laden sending coded messages in the pictures of goods for
sale on EBay? Is that MP3 file carrying a secret note that tracks the
listeners? Steganography is the art and science of hiding information
in digital data and it stretches the boundaries of information theory
and philosophy. An artful programmer can hide secret messages in such a
way that a 1 is not always a 1 and a 0 is not always a 0. This talk
will explore some of the popular schemes for inserting messages and
discuss how they're used by hackers, poets, corporate bean counters,
and programmers on a deadline.

Hosted by Peter Wayner

--------------------

Strategic Thought in Virtual Deterrence and 
Real Offense: The Computer's Role

Computers are pivotal components in modern society: daily life,
banking, and military. What must be considered and what risks do we all
face when they are used in conflict? These concerns are societal in
nature and apply to both "minor" and "major" groups, governments, and
militaries. There will be opportunity for ample questions from the
audience. The intention is to share the overall attendee perspective.
The goal is to be thought provoking, not scare-mongering.

Hosted by Wanja Naef and Sam Nitzberg

Teaching Hacker Ethics with a Common Curriculum

An introduction of a new proposed curriculum guideline for teaching
information ethics to students in elementary school, high school, and
college. This curriculum is being proposed through the North Carolina
chapter of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. The idea
is to foster creative, exploratory, effective, and intelligent use of
information tools (aka, the hacker ethic), rather than powerless
end-user mentality. There are many reasons to desire a common suggested
curriculum for different educational levels. We might argue that most
major advances in computing were brought about by hackers. We could
point out that it's necessary to encourage creative and exploratory
behavior for the next generation of computer users to do brilliant
things. For today's hackers, the goal is simply to shape tomorrow's
hackers so that they will use their abilities to help create a better
society.
