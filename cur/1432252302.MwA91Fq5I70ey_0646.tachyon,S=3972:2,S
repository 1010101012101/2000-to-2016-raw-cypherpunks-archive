"I no longer consider 9/11 a terrorist act."

Fuck. I've been nearing a similar conclusion, though from an entirely 
different, uh, line of approach. Though I don't consider having quite 
crossed that line yet.

I guess in the end we are responsible for the actions our government takes. 
And if we remain ignorant and continue to benefit (and do nothing to stop 
it), then we are responsible, particularly when our military represents an 
outrageously assymetric invasionary force.

On the "left wing liberal" NPR I heard some army dude interviewed. He openly 
referred to Iraq's #1 oil pumping station as "The Crown Jewel", and 
discussed a military action to capture it in terms of a dollar value--"This 
was a $6 billion dollar target" or some such thing.

Let's say that 9/11 may have been a terrorist act, but Bush & pals are 
rendering it an ever purer act of war with each passing day.
