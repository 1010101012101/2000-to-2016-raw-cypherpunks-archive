Do cats buy a lot of audiophile equiptment :8=||

Actually I thought humans are insensitive to phase relations, modulo
inter-aural timing at low frequencies for spatial location.  Perhaps
that
is what you meant?   But spatial location isn't the same as the
frequency-fetishing
audiophiles go for.  To do that well you need casts of the outer ear
too.

You doing owl-type studies on auditory localization?  Audio-visual
mapping
and plasticity?   Making the cats wear funky glasses?
