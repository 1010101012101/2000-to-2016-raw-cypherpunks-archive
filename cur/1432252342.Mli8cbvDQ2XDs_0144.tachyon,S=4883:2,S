Sir, I read your article about the soul catcher and I would like to let you 
know that this device exists in my head since 2ed January 1988 after I had a 
car accident after quitting work for some government relative who harassed 
me both sexually and verbally and then had this thing inserted in my head so 
he could harass me endlessly, I am an engineer and I've been looking for 
evidence since the accident and at last in last mars I found the articles 
about the s.c. , I've been sending letters to influential people since the 
accident, I smell strange odors, my eyes glow in the dark when I open them 
but I don't see that in a mirror, the sound of radio waves transmitting I 
keep hearing in my left ear endlessly since the accident, I can't describe 
how horrid it is to be in this situation, there are more details than you 
can imagine and all horrid, I would like to forget about the whole thing but 
that thing doesn't let me with the audio visual effects I keep getting ,not 
to mention what have my life become, to put it in a few words I'm ruined and 
if I sound paranoid don't believe it cause I'm not , I'm just made to seem 
this way and this device is more than just a lethal weapon it doesn't  just 
kill it mutilates one's being in every since of the word and with the 
unbelievable amount of corruption in this country it is very easy to get 
away with mass murder if you know the  "wrong" people like this very high 
ranked government relative , don’t know what to do more than to commit 
suicide and I don't want this thing that is supposed to be man and human get 
away with such a deed because if he does then this world has come to an end, 
rich people won't just kill poor people or use them but they will be their 
cyber slaves, and I'm not poor at all actually I'm considered rich I'm just 
not a billionaire like he is, endless torture for honest loving people who 
won't sell their souls, ethics and loved ones for money, the end of 
humanity.
This is not a story or some kind of wise crack this is real and happening 
and I want to end it but unless I find some one to help me it won't, much 
more painful details.
S.O.S.
