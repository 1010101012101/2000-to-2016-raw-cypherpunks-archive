Thanks to Ali-Reza for reposting Dr. Dey's reply.

If you are looking for lowest-cost short to medium range communications  
using ham radio, Android phones are not the answer. You still need VHF or 
UHF radio hardware.

There are at least 20 radio manufacturers in China that make small  
variations on a common design of VHF transceiver, that can be bought for  
less than USD 50 each (often much less). Radio repeaters can be built  
using these same transceivers. There is also a huge surplus of  
transceivers in the US that have been made obsolete by the FCC's narrow  
band mandate, that you can buy for a few dollars, particularly interesting 
for higher power mobile radios. Shipping will be your major expense there 
unless you are able to do a freight container full at once.

The biggest problem in most countries is almost always getting legal  
permission to use amateur radio for other public purposes. Solve that  
problem for your group, and find out what frequencies and power levels are 
permissible, and the technical issues are much easier.
