Propaganda is on-topic only insofar as it explores cointelpro, persona management, etc: not strictly crypto, but subversive and political (ab)uses of communications technology.

And, while we're on the subject, I suspect much of this pro-anything-not-West crap is likely to be just that: cointelpro to discredit the genuine content and discourage subscription/participation by a wider audience. It's pretty effective, I think.
