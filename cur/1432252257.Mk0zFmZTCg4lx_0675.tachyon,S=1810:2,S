Hi John

Thanks for the info! Several times in the past I've seen concrete
relevant questions asked on the list without anyone taking their time
to answer them. The stories of these cypherpunks are indeed
interesting and relevant for the list.

I guess the story of Jim and CJ is the reason why one of the
cypherpunks nodes used to have this text on the page:

"It is known this list is under surveillence by US and foreign law
enforcement and intelligence agencies, consider using anonymous
remailers and cryptography"

Regards
