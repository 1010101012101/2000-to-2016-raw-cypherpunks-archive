Portland, Oregon has a similar law.  In practice, they take your car only
as long as it has resale value.  (In other words, it is done for revenue
and not for "punishment".)

Speaking of governmental seizures...

Oregon has a balot initiative to tighten down the seizure laws.  They are
trying to add in that the property can only be seized if the owner is
convicted of something.

Interesting to see who is lining up against this one.


The first few arguments against the initiative are from the animal
shelters claiming that is will harm animals!  The rest are from various
law enforcement agencies and the like upset because they will have not
have this hidden source of funding for toys.
