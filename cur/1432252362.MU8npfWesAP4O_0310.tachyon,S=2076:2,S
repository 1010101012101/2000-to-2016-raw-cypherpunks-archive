Well the email spam is fairly tame -- no actual penetration of 
children.  Such penetration is implied but not shown.   Models 
twelve or older. The usenet spam on the other hand is fairly 
dramatic, in one case the child,  apparent age ten or so, 
appeared to be penetrated in a fashion that would probably
cause serious injury, (one hopes someone was creative with
special effects)
