Software is also still in the "craft" stage where the designers actually
do the
building, in some cases.  Know any architects that can handle an
automatic
nailer?

The article doesn't address the real reason that lone software artisans
(and small software businesses) can still exist: there are niches too
small for Microsoft,
not sexy enough for a squad of Open Source Gooncoders to replicate your
work for free.

Life in the 21st century feels like being a proto-mammal 65Mya, do not
get squashed by the monster lizards nor noticed by the hungry others.
Small, quick, furry, that's us.  Sometimes it gets cold, the lizards
can't move
fast enough, so we eat them.  Last two sentences sound like something Al
Q
could say :-)
