What else would anyone expect?

The U.S. is a kleptocracy, a shakedown state. It operates by stealing 
money from citizen-units and then giving that money to welfare breeders 
and layabouts and corrupt contractors. Basket-case economies like Israel 
get $5000 million a year, with Egypt getting the same amount as a bribe.

As for the grab of Bayer's property, what can Germany do about it?

However, it looks like Bayer is getting the message from this threat to 
simply steal Cipro: they have committed to supplying enough Cipro to Our 
Federal Government to treat 10 million sheeple.

(Why isn't this a matter for individuals to arrange for themselves, 
through some form of insurance? Because Hillary is getting her fondest 
wish: socialized medicine, via a State of Emergency.)
