Or you can just use the Short Form:

"I'm a greedy fool WHO SENT MONEY TO SOME NIGERIANS who promised I would 
Make Money Fast."

It's disgraceful that employees paid by taxpayers are wasting time 
collecting letters from nitwits who believed they could make a lot of 
money by sending it to the Crown Prince of Sierra Leone or the Minister 
of Petroleum Exploration in Nigeria.

"Hello, Friend! I am the younger brother of William Jefferson Clinton, 
Esq., 43rd President of our great nation. My brother is temporarily 
unable to access the funds he deposited in the Cayman Islands in 
exchange for arranging a pardon for convicted terrorists and drug 
dealers. I can get you a cut of his locked-up money if you just send me 
a minor deposit to demonstrate your honest intentions. s. Joe-Bob-Roger 
Clinton, unemployed honkey tonk musician."
