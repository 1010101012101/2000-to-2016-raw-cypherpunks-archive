You are arguing mere _facts_, I am arguing the _reality_ :-)

The _fact_ that something [many things right now] are unconstitutional is
completely irrelevant if nobody is willing to enforce the constitution which
is being violated.  In short, if nobody _does anything about it_,
constitutionality is irrelevant.

Let's face it, the majority of the people I know, both IRL and here, bitch
and moan about the kind of egregious behaviour Shrub and his Band Of
Traveling Fascists are so good at, but how many of us have (to put it into
TimSpeak) done anything about those who "need killing"?  Anyone who has not
taken positive action, and this includes both me and you Jim, does not
actually deserve the protections afforded by that scrap of parchment you have
managed to memorize.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
