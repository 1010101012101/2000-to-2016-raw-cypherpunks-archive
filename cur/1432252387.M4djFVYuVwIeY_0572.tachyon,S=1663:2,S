James Bamford in his new book on the NSA, mentions
the glazing system on an HQ building which is composed
of two layers of glass with wire mesh for TEMPEST
shielding but also that music is played within the glass
layers to garble vibration emanations.

Anyone know of this music system or where more information
could be obtained?
