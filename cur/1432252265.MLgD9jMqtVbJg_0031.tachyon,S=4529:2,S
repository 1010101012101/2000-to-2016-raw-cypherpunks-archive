Tim -

Behavioral psychologists will tell you that the best way to extinguish an undesirable behavior is to IGNORE it.

If Farr's posturings and baitings are truly to be made ineffective, the best course of action amongst the cpunks who care is to killfile the postings and refuse to engage on ANY level.

Rising to the bait, debating whether such-and-such a purpose is behind Farr's postings, speculating on Farr's true intent, all this does is spur on the postings, the baiting, the provocation.  Just say "no" to responding to ANY of Farr's postings, and I would almost put money that the behavior will extinguish within a week.

I wonder why Agent Farr warns about our list "tolerating" bomb 
discussions, and then posts her own provocateur bomb discussions.

I wonder why Agent Farr refers to the "sick people in here" who cite 
names of LEAs and then makes a point to cite LEA persons by _name_.

Agent Farr arrived from _nowhere_ just after the election last year, 
with no previous detectable online interests, on half a dozen of the 
most "controversial" mailing lists and discussion groups. She began 
baiting and provoking, and when that failed, starting her own "Bomb Law 
Reporter" and attempting to entrap discussion group participants in what 
she has claimed are "dangerous" activities.

She has recently claimed that our failure to support Big 
Brother-friendly networks makes us equivalent to the WTC actors.

The witch hunt began a long time ago, but it has taken on new dimensions 
recently. Expect to see the real Agent Farr, who is very probably not 
named "Aimee" in real life, testifying before Congress on his 
"undercover" operations to shut down the Cypherpunks, PGP, and 
Extropians lists.
