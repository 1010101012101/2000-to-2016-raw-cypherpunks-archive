Ah, so even though collateral damage is the inevitable consequence of 
war, that makes it all OK. I get it. So what for the suffering of 
thousands in pursuit of revenge? "The end justifies the means". 
Right. If a million people have to die, be maimed, or lose family 
members so that Bin Laden can be captured you're OK with that.

That's a good defence. Just label the people whose opinions you don't 
like as a "bunch of commies". Then you don't need to take them 
seriously. I'm impressed.

You seem to forget there are people in the left who are for 
restructuring of society so that there is much less government,
and less power centralised in the hands of a few. 

Cheers,
Mark
