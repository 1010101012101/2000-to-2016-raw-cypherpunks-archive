Bitcoin and Opencoin are "sons" of David Chaum's Digicash both. Chaum
is one of the most important cryptographers and freedom fighters in
the world and invented in the eighties the first digital cash, that
was refused, attacked and destroyed by credit card companies
societies, that instead wanted to propagate a model not based on
anonimity. The big difference between them is that Bitcoin is a
complete currency system instead Opencoin is the system to make a
currency (a digital mint). Bitcoin you need to use as-it-is, with
Opencoin instead you can create your own currency system.
