If security is the utmost priority, you will not want "bleeding-edge"
cryptography. You will want algorithms that have been tried and tested in
the field already, and have not shown weaknesses. You will also want to
use existing solutions, such as TLS, PGP, etc., if these will serve your
needs. Developing new solutions to solved problems is not usually
productive.

If your interest is in deploying a system quickly, you will probably want
to hire an independent consultant with background in email security.
You may wish to have someone design the system architecture, detailing
plans for implementation of all the necessary components to address your
needs. Then you can build according to his or her spec in house.
