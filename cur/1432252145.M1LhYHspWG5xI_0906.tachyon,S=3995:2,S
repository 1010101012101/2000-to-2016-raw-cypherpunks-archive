BTW, most and probably all of the major mail clients out there will do
STARTTLS *for SMTP*. It's a matter of servers offering it and clients
being configured to actually use it. It'd be nice if they always used it
if it's available, but right now I think they all require being told to.

Specifically, Mozilla, Outlook, Outlook Express, Netscape (all the way
back to 4.7x at least), Evolution, and Eudora all support STARTTLS
(again, for SMTP). I imagine there are others that do as well.

Amusingly, virtually none of them support STARTLS on any other protocol.
:) IMAP and POP are almost all supported only on dedicated SSL ports
(IMAPS, POP3S). Argh.
