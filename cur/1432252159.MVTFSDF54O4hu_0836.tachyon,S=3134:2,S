A preferable way? I suggest you make a habit of copying *all* cypherpunks 
nodes -- there were half a dozen at one time, right? -- on your posts to 
the list. After all, there is indeed a history of one node seeing things 
and another node not.

But even that may be problematic if a node is down temporarily. Perhaps the 
only way to be entirely certain all cypherpunks subscribers read your 
important email is to copy everyone, all 500 or so subscribers, in a very 
long CC: line. Yes, it's a lot of work, but we'll all thank you for it in 
the end, I'm sure.
