The short answer to the question in the
subject is that HB is not worth using if
you can execute remote code on openssl
(call me a troll just because you disagree).

As for above TOP secret:
I don't believe snowden's documents
about Tor reflect the current
evilness of NSA -- just don't
trust what the NSA/snowden allegedly disclose
about Tor.

Some targets got in jail for 
naively using Tor (check thereg).

Reference for the Tor documents
is the ACLU mirror of snowden.

Probably this drama is explained by
the saying:
"A society of sheep deserves a
government of wolves".
