"...An interesting feature of the seizure procedure described in the search 
warrant, pointed out by John Young at Cryptome, is this wording:

iii. Any data that is encrypted and unreadable will not be returned unless 
law enforcement personnel have determined that the data is not (1) an 
instrumentality of the offense, (2) a fruit of the criminal activity, (3) 
contraband, (4) otherwise unlawfully possessed, or (5) evidence of the 
offense specified above..."

Politechnical?
