Because keeping people operable longer makes for net savings for the
society? This perhaps isn't a reason for *private* companies to issue
insurance fairly, but is a clear incentive to the society to nevertheless
maintain a public health insurance infrastructure. Following the same line
of reasoning, it is beneficial for the society as a whole (whether through
the government or through concerted action of individuals) to pressure any
insurer to comply with this general goal. I think this can be accomplished
without the Men with Guns as well.
