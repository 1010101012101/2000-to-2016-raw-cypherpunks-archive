Virtually in exile
With such personal threats at home, it's not difficult to see why some=20
online journalists and activists chose to work in exile. There are problems=
=20
with this approach, obviously -- their online information might be blocked=
=20
at home, many potential readers will not be able to afford access to their=
=20
site and their critics will always accuse them of being stooges of foreign=
=20
governments - but for some the benefit of being able to tell the truth=20
outweighs these concerns.
The main problem of running a Web site in exile is maintaining local=20
relevance and authenticity when writing from abroad; specifically, the site=
=20
needs regular, up-to-date information from within the country. The only way=
=20
to do this is to develop a network of reliable correspondents on the ground=
=20
and to develop efficient channels for getting their information out of the=
=20
country.
In the worst cases this means either heavily working the phones to your=20
contacts on the ground, or, where phone-tapping is a concern, the smuggling=
=20
of documentation out of the country. On the face of it, that would seem to=
=20
be little advancement on the tedious and dangerous methods of the=20
Communist-era dissidents. Still, when it works, it can bring the only=20
non-regime-sponsored information to the outside world and offers a unique=20
eye on closed societies. The work of the Revolutionary Association of the=20
Women of Afghanistan in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan was certainly one of=
=20
the best examples of such activity the Internet has ever seen.
In less restrictive situations, the Internet itself is the networking tool,=
=20
and e-mail allows =E9migr=E9 publishing to be current from the ground in a=
 way=20
that Iron Curtain dissidents never could be. Even then, however, expanding=
=20
a network of correspondents on the ground is not always straightforward,=20
and the specifics of the local culture and local regime need to be=
 considered.
My own Institute for War and Peace Reporting is familiar with this problem.=
=20
The editors of our online publications covering post-Soviet Central Asia,=20
Afghanistan and the Balkans are all =E9migr=E9 journalists in London who=20
develop their networks on the ground according to the possibilities in=20
individual countries. In Uzbekistan, for example, the situation is relaxed=
=20
enough for us to have a physical office in Tashkent and a rather normal=20
network of correspondents radiating out from it. In Turkmenistan, however,=
=20
the situation is significantly more complicated for us. Forget a physical=20
office: all our reporters on the ground communicate directly via e-mail=20
with our central office in London. Trying to build a normal network there=20
would only attract informants who would turn in all our associates, so we=20
keep our correspondents on the ground isolated from one another. They=20
wouldn't recognize each other if they sat next to one another on a bus in=20
downtown Ashghabat.
But even if you have a developed network of correspondents on the ground,=20
that doesn't mean that people will feel comfortable talking to them. When=20
fear so thoroughly permeates society, mouths stay closed.
In some cases, however, the subject matter is so potentially damaging to=20
people's lives that they are able to overcome their fear of the=20
authorities. The work of the Three Gorges Probe, a Web-site in Canada=20
dedicated to discussing the controversial Three Gorges dam project in=20
China, provides an interesting example of this. Publisher Patricia Adams=20
was reluctant to discuss the details of her network on the ground, but she=
=20
told me that ordinary people in the region are very eager to talk to TGP=20
correspondents about the dam, as they genuinely hope their concerns will be=
=20
addressed. Their willingness to talk is understandable; after all, many of=
=20
them are the ones being resettled by the dam project.
The Three Gorges Probe Web site highlights another particular problem of=20
this genre: oftentimes, the line between journalism and activism becomes=20
fuzzy -- to the detriment of the reader seeking objective information.=20
Adams insists Three Gorges Probe is pure journalism, but it is pretty clear=
=20
that the site offers a mostly critical view of the project. While that may=
=20
be a justifiable editorial policy intended to counter all the official=20
information on the dam project, many =E9migr=E9 sites have very serious=20
problems with balance.
Amnesty International's Umit Ozturk sees this as unfortunate in the Turkish=
=20
case but admits, "It couldn't be any other way." Most Turkish and Kurdish=20
=E9migr=E9 sites are run by "activist reporters," people who care so=20
passionately about their cause that objectivity takes a back seat in their=
=20
online efforts.
Veronica Forwood of Reporters without Borders, however, says it depends on=
=20
the background of the editors. Those who come from a strong journalism=20
background usually try to maintain a sense of balance and concentrate on=20
on-the-ground reporting rather than commentary.
Interestingly, there is now serious talk in U.K. NGO circles of creating a=
=20
non-profit project specifically designed to help =E9migr=E9 journalists=20
establish Web sites with local correspondent networks for the people in=20
their repressive regimes back home. The idea is to provide start-up funds=20
as well as the technical expertise and journalism training needed to run an=
=20
=E9migr=E9 Web site with real impact on the ground.
Real change is not virtual
That impact is the heart of the problem for all Web sites working within=20
and around repressive regimes. For all the excited talk about the Internet=
=20
bringing freedom, actual examples of online publishing bringing about=20
change in these countries are few.
In many ways, the Internet seems to fulfill the same role as samizdat did=20
in Communist Czechoslovakia. Like that old dissident literature, the=20
Internet in authoritarian regimes offers the only place for critical=20
voices, but, sadly, it has little effect on the ground. Remember, despite=20
the international fame of writers like Vaclav Havel, outside of a small=20
circle of intellectuals in Prague, hardly anyone ever read samizdat within=
=20
Communist Czechoslovakia. The Velvet Revolution emerged from direct action=
=20
within a changed geo-political atmosphere; decades of dissident carping had=
=20
nothing to do with real change when the regime finally fell.
As it was with samizdat, most people in authoritarian regimes never get a=20
chance to see Internet publications, and the whole enterprise, both the=20
publishing of banned information and official attempts to stop it, is more=
=20
a game for elites: elite dissident intellectuals criticize elite rulers,=20
and they argue back and forth in a virtual space. The opponents can score a=
=20
few victories in that virtual space, but meanwhile, back in reality, little=
=20
changes for the people on the ground.
Some may find such a conclusion a bit pessimistic, especially coming from=20
someone who works in the field of online journalism in these countries. But=
=20
it is important to keep one's feet on the ground and neither underestimate=
=20
the scope of the problem nor overestimate the ability of the medium.
And there is some reason for cautious optimism. CPJ's A. Lin Neumann, for=20
example, reminded me that, "elites, generally, tend to lead the movement=20
toward change so the fact that the Internet is somewhat confined to elite=20
communication in some places does not disqualify it as a change agent."=20
Neumann points to China, saying that the Internet has had an effect on the=
=20
ground there, leading, for instance, to greater impact of stories on=20
corruption.
Neumann also told me that the nature of the Internet means, "It is simply=20
harder, even for the Burmese bad guys, to keep secrets from the world,=20
because once information gets out it circulates widely."
"Twenty years ago," he noted, "that information -- such as a secret arrest=
=20
that is revealed through an underground contact -- would have to circulate=
=20
by newsletters sent in the post; now it is on the desks of journalists and=
=20
others within minutes."
