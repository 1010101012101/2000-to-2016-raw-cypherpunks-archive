No accounting for taste, of course, but I _loved_ "The Matrix." I'll 
leave it to others to decide whether I'm innumerate or not, whether 
I'm a luddite or not, and so on.

Overall, it's up there in my Top 5 of SF films, with "2001," 
"Terminator 2," and "Blade Runner." Not necessarily in that order.

Given that the characters were clearly described as being in a VR, 
and given that they "learned" to use the new rules they could access, 
the "cartoon physics" was very consistently done. As a physicist, I 
had no problems with it.

Then count _this_ crypto anarchist as a counterexample to your point.

Actually, not so. The so-called "bullet time" effects hit the ads 
about the same time as "Teh Matrix" only because the tools and 
methods spread to the ad business faster than the film could be 
finished and distributed; in many cases, the same folks were taking 
what they'd learned and applying it to television.

In any case, the proof is in the pudding. I certainly thought the 
effects were far from pedestrian.


As to your not liking "The Matrix," fair enough. But using it as some 
kind of touchstone for everything that is bad in modern America is a 
bit of a reach.
