Well, I'd say it's more complex than that. Until recently, the view in China 
towards minorities was that Minorities are fine and dandy as long as they 
don't exhibit traits that are too obviously non-Han while presenting a 
threat to Han-dominated areas. Now, it's more like "Hum...how can we turn a 
profit with these folks? Tourism? Manufacturing?"

Overall, the Chinese have never seemed to have the bloodlust that western 
countires had...they'd always prefer to absorb another culture rather than 
kill it outright.

And yes, while in China I tried to travel to Tibet with a Japanese buddhist 
monk, but Tibet was suddenly "closed" due to the 80s riots in Lhasa (and 
look on a map...that's a LARGE area to simply declare "closed", but it was 
fairly enforceable due to the few viable routes into Tibet).

IN addition, in 1988 there were many cities closed to foriegners. But that's 
mostly all gone now, as joint foerign-market-oriented factories proliferate 
in more and more parts of China. Right now, you'd have to say that China was 
fairly "free" from an economic standpoint, and not free politically, with 
all other areas somewhere in between.
