i like the speed of pre-shared keys assuming key mgmt is secure and
rekeying frequent (e.g. scheduled PSK's or one time pad based
ephemeral key exchange).

but anything using ephemeral keys needs to destroy them properly and
this is more robust  with DH (each end responsible for their
respective key destruction) than shared secrets (both ends must
destroy secrets) in addition to the fact that shared secrets are
usually much longer lived as well.

i do it all the time with openvpn, https, etc.  in theory anything
that supports SSLv3/TLSv1 should support a strong ephemeral DH cipher
suite.  as for particular sites and servers, i'd be interested to know
just what the usual distribution of utilized cipher suites is.  RSA
without DHE probably is the most common.

yup.
in most cases generating dh parameters and explicitly requiring a DHE
suite is the hardest part of any custom configuration needed.  the
session setup costs are a little higher but anyone doing SSL/TLS in
bulk probably has the necessary hardware acceleration in place
already.

as a side note, i'd really like SHA2-256/512 to be added to SSL/TLS
and widely implemented.  AES256 with SHA1 digest is just a little
funny these days...
