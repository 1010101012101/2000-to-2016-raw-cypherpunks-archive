as seen in Red Herring, who observe that the
'automatic shutdown' of sites it doesn't like could
be problematic, to say the least:


BAYTSP, $3M
San Jose, CA
http://www.baytsp.com
THE PITCH:   "BayTSP is emerging with the leading technology
solution to online piracy of digital media. The company has
developed and deployed a sophisticated spidering and
detection service that identifies infringing files by their
digital 'DNA,' and proceeds to automatically investigate and
shut down the offending sites. Customers in the pipeline
include Viacom, the NFL, and major record labels. With a
slim team, low burn, and virtually no marketing expense,
BayTSP has already attracted attention and interest from the
major record labels and music publisher organizations in
their fight against Napster and other peer-to-peer file
sharing networks."
WHY WE LIKE IT:   Interest from major customers.
WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST:   Automatic detection and shutdown
of infringement could lead to disaster if there's a mistake
made.
