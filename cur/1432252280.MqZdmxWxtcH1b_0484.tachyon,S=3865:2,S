Same damn thing. Your point is moot.

Your comparison is thus...if I drive a car then I should have my house
searched because I might(!) drive through your house. That isn't
compatible with the 4th. That is what the crypto argument breaks down to.
Not that I have done it or will do it. But that you can't search my house,
irrespective of whether I did or didn't drive through yours; and you want
to search my house.

The point is to gain the opportunity for unrestrained entry to others
property and activities.

Explain how searching my house keeps me from still driving my car into
yours? It doesn't.
