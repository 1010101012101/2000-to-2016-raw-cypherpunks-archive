five minutes search on google turn up no "2 year hibernation" in her
resume. while it appears that she wasn't very active 1995-1997, that
appears to have been because she was pursuing opportunities outside the
primetime TV business. and she was definitely not inactive in 1997/1998
since she got a few rewards for her work during that period.

something like a date "she vanished from X to Y" would greatly raise the
believability value of this story.
