Because they want to walk down the middle of the street
without wearing automobiles.

Not that New Yorkers are particularly bothered by jaywalking,
but it's the kind of thing that upsets some people.
Needing a permit to march non-blockingly down the sidewalk
or hang out in the park (limiting their incendiary activities
to rhetoric and not cross-burning) would be a constitutional issue,
but that's a mostly lost battle as well;
if you want to act like a parade in a big city,
you generally need a permit.
