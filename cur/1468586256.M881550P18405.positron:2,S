No, only the most successful ones.

Probably not a death sentence (although I think that's what they want
for Assange), more likely nothing, unless he becomes successful at
actually changing some part of the empire, then he'd become a rapist
with public "witnesses" telling their story.

Evidently Sweden's upper eschelongs/ oligarchs are held by North America
regime 'by the balls' - look at the public statements since the
"events", the statements of the two lasses who were supposedly raped by
Assange.

The message is more important to the empire than the punishment - Julian
is holed up until at least 2020 from what we can tell, Manning doing
life in prison, Snowden exiled for god knows how long and because he cut
a deal with the devil (the Guardian) rather than go through Jake
Applebaum to Assange and wikileaks, his exile seems to be for little to
nothing in the way of actual facts.





   Snowden: have you learnt your lesson on this? Or are you compromised
   and therefore unable to admit you made a huge mistake on this one?
   Or are those who helped you flee North America wanting to save their
   asses, given their choice to help you as far as they considered that
   they could get away with helping you (given your personal choices)
   and so this is why your "leaks" are all filtered through the Western
   MSM and basically the facts themselves/ anything of real substance is
   now buried for decades?

   Snowden, do you deny there is a major problem in the particular
   process you chose/ choices you made, in this regard?
