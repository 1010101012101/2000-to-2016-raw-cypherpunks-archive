Either way. Companies like cryptoseal and lavabit are closing so that the
users can't participate in a class action suit against them. Decreasing the
chances of justice by making the next available court room a more
controlled one.

rant: [
This effects the possibiloty of a night watchman state (where private
companies compete for the remaining government services that should be
replaced and become efficient).

They want to bring the ideology of slow public / government controlled
entities / oligopolies controlled by people in the BR. Once the Business
Roundatable's philosophy on businesses affecting public policy came true
and once they started affecting policies themselves: they've decided ->
corporate interest is to use all of our information  for advertisements and
so from what it seems no decent crypto or true private companies shall make
an unregulated alliance better than stopwatchingus to stop the death of a
private corporation.

However, this somehow gets us closer to a social market economy. So that
might be a plus for those that agree but what is a capitalistic society
who's class structure will resemble a fascist one do with any form of
socialism for anybody who isn't in their class? Throw some conformity in
the short run and in the long: starve them with no options except possible
infinite detention or death. These are threats to all companies that are
trying to bypass US intelligence or do anything anonymous. There will be a
monopoly on predictions by inferring trade secrets from the direct access
of these servers / keys / user data. It becomes harder to confiscate
decentralized structures and data centers if they're out in the sea. Except
it may be easier to just send submarines missiles or drones but expecting
that might be a little to schizophrenic. ]

Does anyone know of a project that connects real dedicated pirate ships?
That perhaps get docked here and there but ultimately stay across sea in a
seasteeding like environment?

That might be the cheapest legal way besides satellites, space stations and
low orbit devices. Sea regulation, I believe, is easier to comply with than
air regulation. Yes we are living in interesting times when more and more
people want to be pirates in order to remain free!
