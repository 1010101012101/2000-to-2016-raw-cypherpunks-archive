Seriously, any future crypto-anarchy / anarcho-capitalist society is
probably not going to succeed unless it can project *more* force than we
can project currently with force monopoly -- not less. That *doesn't* mean
centralized, but it certainly means *more*.

Peace Kills. Violence will always be conserved. More is more. :-).

Cheers,
RAH
