:-).

Unfortunately, I couldn't leave well enough alone, I'm afraid.

I haven't gotten flamed in quite a while, but, on the other hand, I haven't
written very much get flamed for, I suppose. As friend Rodney Thayer says,
you're only as good as the people you piss off. Taken in the spirit offered
above, it looks like I've just rattled the bars on the monkey-cage to no
good effect.

Oh, well.

I need to get in the habit of writing again one way or another, even the
word-count *is* in the service of an on-line pissing contest...


Cheers,
RAH
