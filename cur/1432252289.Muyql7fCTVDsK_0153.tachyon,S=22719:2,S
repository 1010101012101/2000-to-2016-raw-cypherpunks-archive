advantage.  So JOIN DISNEY, UPS, BMW and other top companies who are achieving 
remarkable ROI, productivity savings, and yes, even profits, from implementing THE 
MOST EXCITING NEW COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY YET – WIRELESS LANS (WLANS).  Hear the case studies of these WLAN front-runners FIRSTHAND –  by attending Gartner's Wireless LAN Summit, "Unplugged Access to Profitability" November 14-16 in Boston, MA.  http://www.gartnerinfo.com/g2.cgi/1334986/31/us/wlan

PROFIT FROM GARTNER'S OBJECTIVE VIEW 
AT TODAY'S ONLY VENDOR-NEUTRAL WLAN CONFERENCE 

Practically overnight, WLANs have blossomed into a PLAYGROUND OF HIGH-
TECH, "GOTTA HAVE IT" SOLUTIONS for linking any computing device with 
another, locally or over the Internet, in an instant.  So compelling, so successful are the early days of WLANs that they have disrupted the slow migration to 3G wireless services with simpler solutions that are READY NOW. 

WHAT'S HOT?  WHAT'S HYPE?  Find out the difference at Gartner's Wireless LAN 
Summit – THE ONLY OBJECTIVE, VENDOR-NEUTRAL RESOURCE WLAN CONFERENCE AVAILABLE TODAY – and save $200 when you register by October 8.  

Also included in the line-up is a keynote session presented by Allan Scott from Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA).

At this summit, WE'RE FOCUSING ON ACTIONABLE REALITIES that top 
companies are already achieving including PEROT SYSTEMS AND BUENA VISTA 
UNIVERSITY.    Key executives will present case studies of their own WLAN 
experiences to give you a firsthand look at both the opportunities and challenges involved in creating your own wireless network.  For details go to http://www.gartnerinfo.com/g3.cgi/1334986/31/us/wlan. You'll get answers to your most pressing issues including:

* "SHOW ME THE MONEY!"  Discover how smart companies are making money 
  RIGHT NOW during the downturn.  You'll save significantly when you unplug 
  your network.
* "I DON'T WANT TO LOSE CONTROL" Learn how to keep your WLAN 
  private, secure and safe from drive-by hacking.
* "MY EMPLOYEES WORK AT HOME AND TRAVEL" Find out how to 
  mitigate the risks.
* "IT'S ALL ABOUT ROI NOW – HOW DO I JUSTIFY IT?" Determine how 
  WLANs fit into the traditional ROI benefit structure.
* "WHAT KIND OF NEW TRAFFIC WILL A WLAN GENERATE?"  Examine 
  the demands a WLAN will make on your enterprise – and how to optimize traffic.
* "WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH BLUETOOTH AND 802.11?"  Get the up-to-the-
  minute verdict.
* "I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THE WRONG DECISIONS" In this nascent 
  market, you need the right information to make the right decisions.  Costly 
  missteps are something no one can afford.  We'll show you the pros/cons of 
  today's existing technology as well as new emerging solutions.

GET AN EARLY MOVE ON – AND SAVE   
Here's your chance to get on the WLAN phenomenon early in the market life cycle 
where all the opportunities for profit are ripe for the picking.  So seize the early bird 
advantage by registering by October 8, 2001.  You'll save $200 now … and much more 
as your company becomes less and less dependent on all those expensive routers, hubs 
and cables.  Click http://www.gartnerinfo.com/g4.cgi/1334986/31/us/wlan now.  Or call Ashley Pearce at 1-800-778-1997 or 1-203-316-6757.  Be sure to mention your priority code RAF04M when you contact us.
