Hi folks,

Matt Edman has created a "package bundle" that includes Tor, TorCP,
and Privoxy. We've rewritten the Tor win32 instructions to tell people
to use that rather than doing all the steps manually:

http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/tor-doc-win32.html

If you're a Windows user, please take a look and let us know if there
are any installation problems, and if there are any documentation things
we should fix.

Thanks!
--Roger
