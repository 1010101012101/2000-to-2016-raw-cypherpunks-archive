Declan:

I completely agree with you that internet voting isn't quite ready fom 
prime-time just yet. But given the current snafu I highly suspect that 
there will be a lot of interest in the field.

Certainly, I hope one of the few things the new congress will be able to do 
is set-up a commission to propose new voting standards. Hopefully they will 
pick a standard that doesn't give rise to problems 30-40 years in the 
future...


personally, if I had a say I'd say they should adopt the same system Canada 
uses. They use a 100 year old system, had few if any recounts, and managed 
to count all thier manual ballots in less than 72 hours.
