CNN writeup seems to suggest that police no longer need to inform you of 
your rights (Miranda) and warn you against self incrimination.  While 
the justices state this ruling does not condone law enforcement abuses 
to force your to incriminate yourself, we all know how easily abuse is 
covered up or just blatantly ignored.

"But justices also concluded the suspect may be able to collect damages 
because his due process rights were violated during a hospital room 
interrogation. That part of the ruling was sent back to a lower federal 
court for further consideration."

Does this even need to get reported, we all know how the lower court 
will rule, no damages.

It seems the government finally feels it no longer needs to at least 
keep up the pretense of a fair and civil society.
