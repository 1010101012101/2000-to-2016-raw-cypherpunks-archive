	So? Where is it mandated that they cover those?

	In fact, display proof that they *DON'T*.

	Most children--which is where genetic "abnormalities" show 
up--are covered often sight unseen through their parents policies, 
and often before they are even conceived.

	No, you have to have (a) big chunks of assets, and (b) follow 
some *EXTREMELY* thick government rules.

	It's the government stupid.

>And many people are denied coverage outright, therefore removing the
>possibility of simply paying for their coverage.

	Huh?

	How does denial of coverage prevent them from paying?

	Oh, you must not have meant what you wrote.

	You must have meant "many people who are denied coverage are 
denied treatment since they don't have health care".

	Guess why? Government again. If I have a health care bill, 
and pay even a *TINY* bit on it--like $10 a month, the creditor 
cannot file negative reports against me, cannot come after me legally 
etc. even if I owed 20k in medical bills. (you do the math on how 
long it takes to pay off 20k at $10 a month). Therefore, the 
hospitals know that for anything less than life threatening 
treatment, it's a losing battle to provide treatment to those without 
the demonstrated means to pay.

	Medicine is not a commodity, but it's *still* a business. It has to be.
