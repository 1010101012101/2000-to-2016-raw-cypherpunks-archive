Doesn't piss off anyone. Anyone able to understand the sticker sees the 
irony. Anyone not able to just shrugs in agreement.

Around 1982 a friend of mine was proposing to convert a "cherished" 
ocean front dirt lot (something the commies here would like a lot) into 
a "nuclear-powered whale-packing plant." Even his lefty friends laughed.

(Details for the interested. This was Lighthouse Field, which was 
"saved" from development by Santa Cruz lefties, lesbians of color, and 
other folks Harmon Seaver and "Tyler Durden" would no doubt like very 
much. Today the field is a major homeless camp, needle park, and dog 
crap zone. And the city, which has not allowed a new hotel or 
conference center in decades, is in dire financial straits. But, hey, 
they stopped the evil capitalists from buying the privately owned land! 
Their neighbors down the coast also stopped a private owner from 
reasonably developing his land into a set of performance stages, 
hotels, conference centers, etc. He went bankrupt after his land use 
was blocked, the site is now choked with weeds and needles, there is no 
beach access at the site, and the community is squawking that there are 
no "stages" and "performance venues" for the community. I'd take 
everyone involved in blocking Wingspread, the project, and have them 
hanged for stealing Ry Kelley's property. I figure killing the 50 or 70 
major culprits would send a message. Cryptoanarchy will someday mean 
the millions who need to be punished for their crimes will in fact be 
punished and converted into fertilizer, soap, lampshades, and other 
things which can be sold to partially pay for their crimes.)
