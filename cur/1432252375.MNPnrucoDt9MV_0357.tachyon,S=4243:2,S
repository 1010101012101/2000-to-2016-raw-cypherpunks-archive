  Apparently buoyed by the earlier success in the take over of oil 
facilities, Itsekiri women yesterday in Warri marched against three 
multinational oil companies namely Shell, Chevron and Texaco, disrupting 
their operations.
At least one woman was shot dead in the scuttle that ensued between the 
protesters and security operatives drafted to ward off the women from 
advancing beyond the gates of Shell main office, situated opposite the 
Federal Government College, Warri.
The women protest coincided with the commencement of the strike by the 
Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) branch of the Nigerian Union of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) in response to the lock-out of 
some members of the union by Shell management.
But the women, who sealed off the gates to the operational bases of the 
three oil companies simultaneously, said their action was to demand for 
scholarships and jobs for their children and wards, micro credit schemes 
for the women and the aged as well as the immediate end to gas flares, acid 
rains, oil spillage and other forms of environmental degradation plaguing 
their communities.
Hows yer SUV goin' sport?
