It seems to me that charging Bell for 'stalking' in relation to the
collection of public documents violates his 1st Amendment rights with
respect to 'press'.

Not only does that right guarantee you the right to distribute, but it
guarantee's my right as a potential reader to access.

Every citizen has a right to collect what public information they can on
public officials; elected, appointed, or hired.
