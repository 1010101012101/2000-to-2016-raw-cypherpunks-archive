Traditionally speaking, Asymetric warfare has almost always been successful. 
The best example, of course, is the French exodus from Algeria.

As for sympathisizing with OBL, I agree with you, but then again I've never 
been an asymmetric warrior myself. But it seems to me the bombing of that 
Indonesian discoteq wernt a long way towards getting the locals to view OBL 
as just another wannabe remote control dictator wanting to force-feed 
foregin culture into a complex, multicutlural area where those 'solutions' 
might be completely inappropriate.

Meanwhile, however, anyone read that Vanity Fair article? The United States 
has almost single-handedly transformed OBL into an underdog and symbol of 
resistance.
