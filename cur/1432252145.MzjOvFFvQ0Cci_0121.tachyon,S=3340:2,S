Yes and the dogs don't piss on the rosebushes after the first time they
bridge the caps...

Bullets would be "anti-personnel artillery" and the article states that
vaporizing doesn't work
for artillery.  So, um, no.

I tend to wonder how this would work more than once, and suspect that
merely
disrupting the shaped charge or changing the stand-off distance is
protective.

As an aside, I wonder if there are scale problems with huge shaped
charges; could a 100' diam
100' tall charge destroy a bunker 300' deep?  (Supposing you could get
the army engineers on
the ground to build it.. a kinda military burning man I suppose..)
