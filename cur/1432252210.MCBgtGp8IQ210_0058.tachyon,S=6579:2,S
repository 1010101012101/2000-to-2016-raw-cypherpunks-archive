	"does appear to require a higher class of human animal" 

	Maybe so. But I'm sure you know the next few lines in the play
	=P

	If 'humans' are unable to solve their political problems by
	means of individual cooperation, then a HUMAN and coercitive
	government is going to make matters worse. 

	People can't actually govern themselves but they can elect
	other PEOPLE to...governm them. And delegate to their masters
	an ability they don't have! Now that's some Pristine logic!
	

	Sorry, gotta run. Something is burning! (I'm glad I have a few
	gallons of gas to put the fire out)
