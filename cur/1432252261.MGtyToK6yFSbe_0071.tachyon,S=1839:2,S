Obviously the Dumb Ray levels are up and many need tinfoil hats.

The 'net access anonymity in front of the local force monopoly is equal to the
meatspace (physical) anonymity. The mere idea of having "your server" somewhere
else indicates brain damage. It could work if force monopolies were localized;
but they are not for any practical reasons.

So, to anonymously access the 'net, one must be anonymous in the physical sense
while accessing the net.

- use Other People's phone lines and internet accounts
- use OP's access points
- use camera-free internet cafes

Obviously, the time has come to print interesting web pages in newspapers.
