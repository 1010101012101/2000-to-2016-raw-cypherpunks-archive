This, and fuzzing... of all the opensource OS's and all the
ported packages they supply. And dump all of github in it
for fun.

It takes too long, too much developer time, a different
skillset, opensource test suites may not yet cover some
areas that commercial ones do, etc.

Ripe for development of an open perpetual audit project.

That, and printing your own open and trusted chips, in your own
open and trusted fab, are possible now. It's big picture, grand slam,
full circle headiness, but it is doable. People just have to get
together and kick it off.
