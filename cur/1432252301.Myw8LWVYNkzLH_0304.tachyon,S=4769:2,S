That's not really what I'm trying to say.  The question is, is it 
possible for a ruling to be valid under common law and invalid under 
the constitution.  I think the answer is no and the reason (as you 
may have been trying to say) is that the constitution is a part of 
common law, and all decisions since it's creation have, by 
definition, been either constitutional or overruled on appeal.
