That's always an engineer's problem. :)

Tech may be a partial solution. Tim could tape-record the conversation (or, 
if there were sufficient market demand, conference in a neutral party to do 
the recording) and damage the reporter's reputation capital by posting the 
audio clip if he ends up misquoted.

This obviously requires more effort than he appears willing to spend. But 
some PR flacks do record conversations with journalists for precisely this 
reason. (Less so damaging reputation capital, more so obtaining a 
clarification/editor's note if something goes awry.)
