According to the article, 

	"Mr Blunkett discussed his plan for a national ID
	card with Tom Ridge, the head of the US Department 
	of Homeland Security, at a meeting in Washington 
	earlier this month. Mr Blunkett agreed to develop a
	joint programme, using the same technology, with the 
	US, which has already agreed a similar protocol with 
	Canada."

So, apparently Ridge has already decided that (a) Amerikkkans *will* carry ID
cards, (b) these cards will be interoperable with cards from other countries,
(c) that these other countries should be able to access information on US
citizens at will, provided we can do the same to their citizens.

Cute.  Totally fascist, but cute.


I wonder how long they are going to work on this before announcing the good
news formally?
