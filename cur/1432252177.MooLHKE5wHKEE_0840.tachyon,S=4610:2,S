There's no point in trying to fix braindamaged designs by incremental 
patchwork. You know about <http://zgp.org/pipermail/p2p-hackers/>,
right?

If the users didn't consent to auto-upgrade, you could as well write a 
worm with p2p node functionality. God knows some people in China could 
have used some plausible deniability.

Well, duh.

Instead of doubting, try creating a model that might work, and test drive 
it in the simulator with millions of nodes.

The point is to not make content linkable to a specific node.

Instead of inventing a polygonal wheel, try joining any of the many 
efforts like MNet and Freenet, and start hacking.
