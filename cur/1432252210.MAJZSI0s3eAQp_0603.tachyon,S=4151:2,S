It's surprising to me that there has not been a major test case in 
the U.S. on the growing use of warrantless searches--searches of 
houses by the Child Protection Police, searches of businesses by the 
Microsoft Protection Police, etc. It's as if the Fourth Amendment is 
now "dead letter law" (to coin a phrase).

And while we all know that Europe and Russia are not covered by the 
U.S. Constitution, it is unacceptable that the U.S. sends money and 
experts to Europe, Russia, and other parts of the world to teach them 
to spy on citizens (FBI assistance to Russian security services, for 
example), to kill citizens (CIA manuals), and to throw out any 
semblance of respect for property (copyright raids).
