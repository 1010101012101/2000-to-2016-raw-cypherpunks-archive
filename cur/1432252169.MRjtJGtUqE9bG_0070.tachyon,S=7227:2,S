Even this is not a scalar.  Since reputation cannot be bought
and sold, the idea that it is worth a specific well defined amount is
false.

Claiming you have a concept called reputation capital doen't really
solve the problem, it just moves it back a step, leading to questions
like how does one aquire/lose reputation capital, how does one
discover another's reputation, how does one ensure that a party
violating an agreement actually will lose reputation capital,
and so on.  These questions can be answered, at least sometimes,
but usually answering them will make it clear that reputation
capital isn't a single number.
	The idea that a party to a transaction will lose more in 
reputation capital by failing to honor his obligations than he will
gain is a very useful concept. The idea that a nym has a fixed
amount of reputation capital and will lose it all with a single failure
to comply might be useful in certain simplified models, but
it doesn't accurately reflect most real world situations.

well, maybe.  But if we define reputation capital the way you did
(the value one places on one's own reputation) then it's important
to be aware that one can only know the value of one's own 
reputation capital.

So would I, but this is just a disagreement over the terminolgy,
not the concepts.

I think you're going way too far. Proton decay has never been 
observed in the real world, and people have looked for it really
hard.  Whereas a whole lot of governments (including the US
government)  have attempted to solve their debt problems
by printing a lot of paper currency, devaluing the existing currency
in the process.

I'm not convinced that you do. As I've said before, there are two
fundamentally different ways of maintaining anonymity with some
sort of digital bearer certificate
1) you can ensure the "bank" can't identify the certifcates as the
ones you bought when they're cashed in or
2) you can see to it that the bank doesn't know who
"you" are when you buy the certificates in the first place.

Number 2 still seems more natural to me.
