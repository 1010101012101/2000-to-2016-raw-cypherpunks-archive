Yes, incremental helps. Yet let me open another related line of thinking...

Where are the open fabs for makers instead of submitting open
designs to closed fabs? It's 2015, crowdfunding, open source,
non-profits, and public monitoring are done.
We're not talking TSMC scale tech here, but a basic backyard shed
capability to print useable, useful, marketable silicon. ie: Print off
some USB RNG's, radios, DACs/ADCs, even 74 series and discretes,
whatever works.
Then with that open initial platform, start taking commercial
production contracts (even private runs) to pay for growing the
open fab. Even including openly replicating yourself. What is the
minimum capital and endowment needed to gear up to put 1k, 100k,
500k, 1M, 100M, 1B gates that someone, including makers, would
buy down on silicon?
