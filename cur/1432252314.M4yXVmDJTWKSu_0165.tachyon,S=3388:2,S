<http://cryptome.org/freetotravel.htm>Gilmore v. Ashcroft -- FAA ID Challenge
AIR TRAVELER ID REQUIREMENT CHALLENGED
Secret rule demanding 'Your Papers Please' claimed unconstitutional

San Francisco - Civil libertarian John Gilmore today challenged as 
unconstitutional a secret federal rule that requires domestic US travelers 
to identify themselves.





Smooth move. Attempt to board a flight to DC on July 4th "to petition the 
government for redress of grievances". Even if not successful, it will be 
annoying and will be worthwhile if it manages to crack out copies of the 
secret security directives (like FAA SD 96-05)establishing the system.

Keep in mind that until the end of the first Clinton administration, it was 
perfectly legal to fly domestically without ID.
