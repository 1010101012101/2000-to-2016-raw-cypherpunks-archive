Very true. Whistleblowing was invented for officials to disclose
marked-up, tagged and shrewdly redacted information. There
is an international organization of whistleblowers to assure a
steady flow, funded by shadowy sources. Beyond that obviously 
professional outlet there are:

Open and secret generous grants available to scholars, renegades, 
freedom fighters, hackers, siphoners, aggregators, search engines, 
coders, Tors, leakers, spammers, Chinese, Iranians, Israelis, rogues, 
drug kingpins, kiddie porn baiters, civil liberty unions, unions, agitators, 
organizers of the poor and the filthy rich, tweeters and speakers,
priests and TLC givers, every conceivable exceedingly fine-grained 
minority and social and economic injustice aggrievers, Wall Street 
and off-shore greeders, why there is hardly any way to avoid getting 
a piece of the pie directly or indirectly, say, through an amazingly
lucky break and recognition of your long-overlooked talent, a door 
opened just for you and your angry bitch gnawing your deadbeat
balls.

Whistleblowing is a satisfying blow job. That's a recruiting slogan.
