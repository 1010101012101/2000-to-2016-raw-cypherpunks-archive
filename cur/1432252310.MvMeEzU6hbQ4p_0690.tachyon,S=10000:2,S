GRAPHCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Provides Surveillance for Raymond James 
Stadium to Identify Known Suspects, Deter Crime

On January 28th, Criminals No Longer Another Face in the Tampa Stadium Crowd

Tampa, Florida, January 29, 2001 -Graphco Technologies, Inc. (G-TEC), 
a leading developer of technology and solutions for biometric 
authentication, secure access, and expert information-sharing 
systems, announced today that they provided a surveillance and facial 
recognition system at both the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and at 
Ybor City, Florida. The system was in place from January 21 - January 
28, 2001 to monitor potential criminal activities during the sporting 
events and related activities at the two locations.

In cooperation with the Tampa Sports Authority, Graphco Technologies 
partnered with Raytheon Company's (NYSE: RTNA, RTNB) Linthicum, 
Maryland office, Viisage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: VISG), and VelTek 
International, Inc., to provide its FaceTrac facial recognition 
system to the Tampa Police Department and other federal, state and 
local law enforcement agencies.

"Not everyone comes to sporting events with good intentions," says 
David Watkins, G-TEC's Managing Director, "The multiple distractions 
at the nation's premier athletic events provide criminals with 
opportunities to engage in a variety of illegal activities. G-TEC's 
facial recognition system provided the Raymond James Stadium with a 
superior surveillance system that not only captures images of 
individuals but also compares their facial features against a 
database of known felons."

The FaceTrac core facial recognition technology provides the ability 
to locate faces, to build 'face print' templates and to recognize 
matches to images stored in a database. When integrated with G-TEC's 
law enforcement database, FaceTrac allows rapid search, comparison 
and identification of suspect facial photos within the database. 
FaceTrac may be used for surveillance with multiple locations 
networked to a high capacity site, for analysis and system-search 
results. G-TEC installed FaceTrac at the Raymond James Stadium as a 
single site system, integrated with a custom designed database and 
search result notifications for tracking faces in a crowd and 
monitoring access to secure areas.

Tom Colatosti, Viisage President and CEO said, "Places where large 
crowds are present, such as sporting events, are tempting targets for 
all types mischief, criminal behavior and larger threats. Using 
patented Viisage technology, G-TEC has introduced a new generation of 
tools for law enforcement officials to more effectively and 
non-intrusively provide for public safety. As an integral partner in 
the project, Viisage Technology provided G-TEC with the industry's 
leading and most robust face-recognition technology."

Viisage Technology's FaceFINDER software drives the FaceTrac 
surveillance and identification process. Viisage's industry-leading 
face-recognition technology has the world's largest image database 
deployment in surveillance and investigative applications. Viisage 
also provided the project with image acquisition and integration 
technology and services.

During the week of January 21st, G-TEC deployed the FaceTrac system 
throughout the Raymond James Stadium to detect and identify 
individuals who are wanted or suspect, and may present a danger to 
the public. Using standard cameras to recognize human faces during 
entry to the sporting event, FaceTrac continuously compared faces in 
the incoming crowd to an extensive, customized database of known 
felons, terrorists, and con artists provided by multiple local, state 
and federal agencies. A law enforcement task force of local, state 
and federal agency personnel monitored the system. Once individuals 
were matched with photo files in the database, officers of the joint 
task force, circulating throughout the complex, could be dispatched 
immediately to make possible arrests, quickly and discreetly.

In addition to installing cameras supplied by VelTek International at 
the Raymond James Stadium, G-TEC adapted its FaceTrac capability to 
cameras in Ybor City, Florida to oversee the celebrations before and 
after the athletic events. Raytheon Company, a global developer and 
supplier of high-tech products and services, and a G-TEC partner, 
provided sophisticated cameras and expertise to provide police with 
exceptional night vision capabilities for poorly lit or darkened 
areas in Ybor City.

G-TEC, headquartered in Newtown, PA, develops, manufactures, and 
markets secure database and secure communications systems worldwide.
