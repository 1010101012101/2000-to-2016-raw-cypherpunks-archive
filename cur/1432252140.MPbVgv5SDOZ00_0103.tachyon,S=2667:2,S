By whom? Someone at hotmail, or someone who got your password and
logged in as you?

Hotmail shows mail that has already been viewed in a different color
than mail you haven't looked at yet. So it would be obvious if someone
else logged in as you and read your email. But of course there is no
way to know what insiders are doing. Maybe you could explain your
attack concept more clearly.

What would this accomplish? That is, what attack would it make more
difficult? Are you worried that someone is intercepting your email en
route to hotmail, reading and delaying it, then passing it on? And you
hope to detect the unwarranted delay?
