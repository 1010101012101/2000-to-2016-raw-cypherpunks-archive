Pretty standard procedure.  A medical evaluation can detect drug 
users, alcohol users, people whose brain chemistry is different, 
etc.  It can also detect people who are likely to be more or less 
expensive to insure, people who need drugs (from insulin to 
psychopharmaceuticals) to function normally, and people with more 
than a "reasonable" number of knife-fight scars, which might 
indicate that someone is too rash or hotheaded. 

It also gets them DNA samples etc, which they can later use to 
positively identify you if you ever get implicated in anything 
criminal or controversial.  

And finally, they will wind up knowing all about your tattoos 
and brands if any, which will point out people who were in certain 
gangs and societies during certain time periods.  

That's just part of the job.  If you're going to handle secret 
material for any government, that government will want to know 
everything about you no matter how invasive, and they will want 
to own every possible bit of leverage anyone can have on you, 
and they want to be damned sure that no one else has any leverage 
on you that they don't know about.  

Medical examinations are just one aspect of that.  

I bet they audit someone's taxes for the last six years before 
they hire them, too.
