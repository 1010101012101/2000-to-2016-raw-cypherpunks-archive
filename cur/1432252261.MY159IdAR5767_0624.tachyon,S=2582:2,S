WASHINGTON, July 20 . A report by internal investigators at the Justice
Department has identified dozens of recent cases in which department
employees have been accused of serious civil rights and civil liberties
violations involving enforcement of the sweeping federal antiterrorism law
known as the USA Patriot Act.

The inspector general's report, which was presented to Congress last week
and is awaiting public release, is likely to raise new concern among
lawmakers about whether the Justice Department can police itself when its
employees are accused of violating the rights of Muslim and Arab
immigrants and others swept up in terrorism investigations under the 2001
law.

The report said that in the six-month period that ended on June 15, the
inspector general's office had received 34 complaints of civil rights and
civil liberties violations by department employees that it considered
credible, including accusations that Muslim and Arab immigrants in federal
detention centers had been beaten.
