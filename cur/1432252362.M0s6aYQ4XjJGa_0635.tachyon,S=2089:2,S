Maybe I have a minor corollary to Somebody's Law: "All debates about 
privacy eventually degenerate into foolish and off-target debates about 
the meaning of truth."

It never makes sense to argue about a "right to lie" or a "right to 
tell the truth." One man's lie is another man's truth. And even 
_asking_ for a true response is usually an overstepping, as it presumes 
the asker knows what is true and what is not. Pilate said it all 2000 
years ago.
