They were only invented recently, and indeed, I've been planning to 
introduce them to the camram arena. I wonder if they're being discussed 
as a result of the pub conversation I had recently with a Microsoft 
person on this very subject?

One major advantage of memory-based proof-of-work over hashcash is that 
the variation between machines is much smaller (estimated to be a factor 
of 4 from slowest to fastest PCs, for example).

BTW, for those who don't know, SpamAssassin now supports hashcash.

Cheers,

Ben.
