* Stage One of the FUD Campaign, Wednesday morning: "They found a 
whole box of ballots in an inner city, Democratic-leaning, 
pre-school! This will throw the election to Gore."

(quickly turned out that this alleged ballot box contained stationery supplies)

* Stage Two of the FUD Campaign, Wednesday evening: "Thousands of 
elderly Jewish voters were tricked by the confusing ballot into 
voting for Pat Buchanan."

(turned out that, based on interviews, nearly every Jew in Palm Beach 
County claims to have accidentally voted for Buchanan, or 
double-voted. The numbers don't support this, and other counties had 
spoiled ballots, too. A Republican-leaning county in northern Florida 
had 22,000 spoiled ballots.)

* Stage Three of the FUD Campaign, all day Thursday and continuing: 
"At least 20,000 ballots were spoiled because elderly Jewish 
Democrats got confused and tried to vote for Gore after discovering 
they accidentally voted for Buchanan. We demand a re-vote!"

* Stage Four of the FUD Campaign, current: "We demand a manual 
recount. Two counts, the first one and then the state-mandated 
machine recount, are not enough. We are certain that if certain 
counties are counted again, and again, that the extra votes we need 
will be found."

[As Jesse Jackson and Johnnie Cockroach might singsong: "If our lead 
does not mount, you must re-count!']

* Stage Five of the FUD Campaign, ongoing: "The whole Electoral Thing 
is a throwback to the whitemale patriarchy. What matters is the 
popular vote, the first one, before Bush temporarily took the lead by 
manipulating the recounts in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Iowa, and other 
states. The Peeples spoke on Tuesday night!"

A lot of Democrats need to be dealt with when this is (temporarily) through.
