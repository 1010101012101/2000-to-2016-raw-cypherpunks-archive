Probelms are not asymptotically Omega(N!) or Omega(N^N).  Solutions are.  
I don't believe anyone has ever proved that an NP-hard problem can not be
solved in polynomial time.  Not being able to solve a problem in
polynomial time with current techniques does not make it unsolvable.  MIT
people always surprise me.
