Sandy, you are responding to the same poster who has made such illuminating
contributions to this list as the posts titled "aimee's anal urges" and
"running out of tim.." Please don't encourage him.

Cypherpunks has always had its share of kooks.

"Mathew Taylor's" writing style is more obscure than John Young's or Aimee
Farr's, and his posts are as confused or content-less as Jim Choate's or
Karsten Self's. He is better off simply ignored.

Selected quotes:

"cryptoanarchy aka cryptocapitalism seems to be in crisis."

"My name is jim bell,no MY name is jim bell...AAAAAAAAArrrgh! Im screwed."

"Cant you be obsessed with JB and Cryptoanarchy/freenet?"

"War of the flea now must become war of the killer bee."

"Bin laden? Id buy that for a dollar!"

"Dear tim,no real anarchist craps on like you about a 'fruit ot the poison
tree'constitution.FUCK uncle sams racist con job."

"Assasination politics has as much claim for consideration as any other."

"Sustained AP at shrub when executive order on assasins is revoked.?"

"Hell,tim might rope some of his paintball buddies along for the ride."

"Assasination politics was originally proposed for saddam,wasnt it?"

"I pledge 1$ for the closest prediction of the permanent retirement from
politics of the honourable osama bin laden."

"Are you sure its too late for operation soft drill?"

"C/punks with spunk get an offshore AP website up and softdrill any ugly
mother that raises its ugly head."

"Encrypt the reward as described in 'assasination politics'"

"It should be our duty to remind them they may be the ones who are
clipped."


(On second thought, after reading this collection of quotes, I wouldn't be
surprised if "mattd" AKA "Matt Taylor" were actually Agent Jeff Gordon.
They certainly share the same obsession. When was Gordon's last psych
eval?)
