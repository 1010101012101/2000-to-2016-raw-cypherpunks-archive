Spirit of ignorance. Somebody FWD'd a quip from Tim May, posted to another
list, referring to an "Agent Farr," connected with hypothetical terroristic
acts. I am only a victim of May's master polemics.

I'm going to disappoint you.

Texas humor. It's misunderstood. It's partially my fault you caught hell, I
"aggravated" Tim. In retrospect, it was most unwise. I should try to stay
out of his radar.

No, I didn't. I have many admirers.

I'm flattered my head was worth $4.

Reminds me, book of situational interest:

American Political Prisoners: Prosecutions [Under the Espionage and Sedition
Acts]
By Stephen M. Kohn (Praeger, 1994, ISBN: 0-275-94415-8, 240 pages).

The gist: The book is the product of FOIA requests (and a successful
lawsuit), consisting of official correspondence, letters from prisoners,
photos, etc. of people "not thinking correctly." The prisoners in the book
ran a gamut from labor, anarchists, pacifists, etc. Conditions of
confinement were so poor, that some died before trial, others went insane,
or become infected with TB in prison. Many of them simply circulated written
material. Statements such as "gone crazy over patriotism," "We need
preparedness, not to kill one another, but to live peaceably, happily and
equally," and "war is organized murder," effectively netted people
torturous, abusive conditions. We convicted several preachers for preaching
"do not kill," others for criticizing war bonds, many for membership in the
IWW, and a substantial number of people based on no evidence whatsoever.
(WWI was trench warfare. The military had not yet mastered combat
discipline.) In the eyes of many, patriotism was used as a weapon to quash a
movement (organized labor) seen as a threat to our power structure. It put
an ugly, human perspective on what I otherwise knew as just a few cases and
names.

The laws are still on the books. (Our sabotage and espionage laws do need
reworking.)

I was struck by how some called themselves "internationalists." Our national
security outlook predicts the rise of NGOs and networks based on subnational
identifiers, which will be the cause of subversion and insurrection on a
global scale. It doesn't sound too much unlike the "internationalists," does
it?

The reaction in other countries will no doubt be more extreme.

(I don't envy our people that have to make foreign faction-calls in the
coming environment, it's like sticking your head in a guillotine.)
