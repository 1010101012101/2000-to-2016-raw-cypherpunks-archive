i heard about that (DIRT)... i also heard its just a big hoax. Most 
anything of that nature will be shot down by the hacking community. 
Kinda like Carnivore. but anytime you're ever suspicious of anything 
"hacking" your system just drop by astalavista.box.sk and visit their 
new0rder section... you can have the anti-hack in just a few 
seconds... or goto eeye.com and get a copy of Retina Security 
scanner... it'll tell you exactly what your computer is saying to 
others and whether or not you're hackable. very nice tool to have if 
you're worried about security.

                               DIRT Bugs Strike!
                              By Winn Schwartau

  "Imagine being able to monitor and intercept data from any PC in the
                           world anytime you want.

                             Then DIRT's for you.
DIRT stands for Data Interception by Remote Transmission, and if 
Codex Data Systems in Bardonia, New York has anything to say about 
it, will become the next law enforcement tool to help stop the bad 
guys.

  The cops are having a terrifically hard time dealing with 
cybercrime, and they all put on-line child pornography at the top of 
the list because of the emotional response to it. Suspected 
terrorists, drug traffickers, money launderers, are also potential 
targets for DIRT as are various criminal organizations which employ 
anonymity, remote control and encryption to hide themselves. DIRT 
represents a fabulous, but questionably legal/ethical means of 
information gathering by intelligence agencies as well as private 
investigators.


Thus Frank Jones and Codex Data Systems begat DIRT. "We have to give 
law enforcement the tools they need to get real criminals. So many of 
them are now using encryption, DIRT allows law enforcement to read 
encrypted messages."

DIRT operates surreptitiously like a Trojan Horse. It is transmitted 
secretly to a target via email in several ways: either as a 
proprietary protocol, self extracting executable, dummy segment 
fault, hidden ZIP file, application specific weakness, macro, a 
steganographic attachment or other methods the company's technical 
wizard, Eric Schneider will not divulge.

Once the DIRT-Bug is successfully embedded in the target machine, two 
things occur. One, all keystrokes at the keyboard are secretly 
captured and when the target machine is connected on-line, it will 
stealthily transmit the captured
contents to a remotely located DIRT-Control Central for analysis. 
This is how encryption keys are to be discovered and later used to 
develop evidence in criminal cases.

Secondly, when the target is on-line, his PC will invisibly behave 
like an anonymous FTP server, giving the folks at DIRT-Control Center 
100% access to all resources. So much for privacy!

Dave Banisar Staff Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information 
Center in Washington, DC. said DIRT "Sounds like something the Stasi 
would have developed." The problem is enforcement and abuse he points 
out. "The only way to control this technology is after the fact, 
during the trial when the police have to show how they obtained 
evidence."

When I first saw DIRT demonstrated in New York (June 5, 1998), I 
thought, "What if this gets out to the entire Internet community. 
what will happen if we no longer ever trust our email?"

The vast majority of computer crime goes unrecognized, unreported and 
unprosecuted. Despite the fact that the use of DIRT or a DIRT-like 
clone developed by the computer underground violates the Computer 
Abuse Act of 1984 and an assortment of other laws, the ability to 
control it remains extremely slim. And the uses for DIRT-like 
software stagger the imagination.

All that someone with DIRT needs to know is your email address. 
Period. All he has to do is send you an email, with the embedded 
DIRT-Trojan Horse and he's home free, and you are a clueless victim.

Large organizations usually worry about hackers breaking and entering 
their networks. Now they have reason to worry that DIRT-Bugs could 
invade their networks as well; whether launched by an investigating 
law enforcement authority, international competitors or spies, or 
just hackers. The last thing in the world they want is for critical 
workstations to be broadcasting passwords, encryption codes and 
providing complete system access to whoever controls DIRT-Central.

Unfortunately, most firms with whom I deal have little implementation 
of the minor policies they have developed. Thus, defending against 
DIRT can be difficult. However, organizations which utilize NAT and 
proxies in their firewalls achieve some degree of confidence that 
DIRT's remote access capability will not function. Just the keyboard 
strokes (and associated private information) will be broadcast to 
DIRT-Central.

According to the developers at Codex Data Systems, if you are a 
solitary PC sitting on a dial-up or a cable modem, there is nothing - 
today - you can do except don't click on your email attachments. Of 
course, ignoring email from strangers is always a good idea. But, if 
I were a cop or a bad guy using DIRT, I would certainly go after your 
home PC as well as the one at work. It's a whole lot easier, and I am 
going to learn just as much.

With the advent of more and more powerful Trojans, such as DIRT 
(which only occupies 20K), the threat to our networked systems gets 
clearer and clearer. As Frank Jones, the inventor says, "There are no 
more secrets with DIRT."

                          Getting DIRT on criminals

"There is another powerful tool for surreptitiously intercepting 
data, but it is only available to law enforcement and the military. 
Called DIRT (Data Interception and Remote Transmission), it was 
released in June by Codex Data Systems, Inc. Investigators need only 
know your e-mail address to secretly install the program. Once they 
do, investigators can read your documents, view your images, download 
your files and intercept your encryption keys. DIRT was developed to 
assist law enforcement in pedophilia investigations, but future uses 
could include drug investigations, money laundering cases and 
information warfare.

How is DIRT different from Back Orifice? The sale of DIRT is 
restricted, while Back Orifice is

free for the downloading. Also, there are already fixes available for 
Back Orifice, but no way yet to defend against DIRT. "

Most feel secure when they encrypt their data, but it's an illusion 
of comfort if a keystroke monitor is involved. DIRT defeated Pretty 
Good Privacy in a matter of minutes at a recent conference simply by 
stealing the user's key as it was typed in."

Internet & Intranet Business & Technology Report - Oct. 1998

D.I.R.T. - The Ultimate Competitive Intelligence Tool by Deb Cameron

"Codex Data Systems, Inc. of New York has created Data Interception 
for Remote Transmission (DIRT), a surveillance tool designed for law 
enforcement professionals. DIRT is similar to BO in some respects, 
but it is smaller (less than 18K versus 120K for BO) and yet more 
stealthy. It runs as a much lower level process and is virtually 
undetectable. In addition, it cannot be stopped by firewalls.

DIRT was originally developed to aid in the investigation of child 
pornographers and other isolated criminals using standalone PCs. By 
becoming a spy in the user's computer, the law enforcement official 
can gather needed evidence to successfully prosecute a criminal case. 
Frank Jones, creator of DIRT, surveyed the market for computer 
surveillance tools to aid law enforcement professionals. When he 
found no suitable products, he began developing DIRT, which he 
continues to enhance.

DIRT logs all keystrokes on the target workstation and transmits them 
the next time that system is online. Because users type in their 
encryption pass phrases at the keyboard, which are then transmitted 
via DIRT, the product helps law enforcement officials decrypt 
documents and provides them with substantial evidence for criminal 
investigations. All DIRT communications are encrypted on their way 
back to the DIRT Control Center, protecting them in case they are 
intercepted by a random system administrator.

In the latest version of DIRT, the agency need not send the software 
as an e-mail message at all; the law enforcement agency needs only 
the e-mail address or the IP address of the target system. (At the 
very least, the variety of techniques described here should make 
users wary of dismissing the idea that a third party could install 
software without their knowledge.)

DIRT currently runs on Windows 95, 98, and NT systems and a Unix 
version is being developed. Only qualified law enforcement agencies 
can purchase DIRT; furthermore, Codex currently sells the software 
only to U.S. law enforcement agencies.

Jones emphasizes that surreptitious surveillance tools, such as Back 
Orifice and keystroke logging facilities, are illegal to develop or 
possess in the United States, according to U.S. code 2512. These 
tools are illegal even if they are used by network administrators 
unless each end user explicitly agrees to the monitoring.

DIRT is legal because it is a law enforcement tool that can only be 
sold to law enforcement agencies. DIRT itself is not a threat to the 
average corporate network, but the knowledge that such a tool exists 
should make users consider whether their networks are secure. 
Security is clearly a relative term, and organizations ignore 
security issues at their own risk."
