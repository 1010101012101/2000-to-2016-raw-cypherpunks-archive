I confess I know many congressional staffers. Alas, what you say is
not quite right. Most are over-educated: law degress from decent
universities and (this is quite popular) master's and PhDs in "public
policy." What they're under-educated about, often, is an understanding
of how the world outside of Washington works. It's possible to do an
internship in college and move here immediately after graduation and
always work in the nonprofit or government sector. Hardly an honest
living.
