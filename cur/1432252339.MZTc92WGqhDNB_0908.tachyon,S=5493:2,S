The concern with the current price rise and deflationary aspect seems a
bit short-sighted to me.

The mining reward is algorithmically destined to fall to less than 1
Bitcoin per block somewhere around 2032
(https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_Currency_Supply), at which point
around 99% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist will have already been
mind. In the intervening years, Bitcoin has the potential (I dream) to
draw in most or perhaps all of the global economy. The after-2030 state
then looks like a more or less fixed money supply (99% is mined by 2060).=


This is early days. I liken it to the phenomenon of momentary shock
sometimes experienced when one sits on a train, perhaps reading a book,
and misidentifies what is seen out the window as the station suddenly
moving. We're still getting up to speed.

You're still left with the

mining, directly. Meaning you can turn electricity into coin, but not the=

Actually.. Why isn't this how Bitcoin worked in the first place? Maybe it=

just complicates things too much.
