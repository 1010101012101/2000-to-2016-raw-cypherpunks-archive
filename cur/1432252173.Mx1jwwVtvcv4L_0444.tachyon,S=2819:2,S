Exclusion harms you only if it bugs you ---you have to want to be a 
homosexual atheist boyscout for their exclusion to matter.  Non-consensual
violence always harms.

No, liberty is absolute, and probably not being exercised if *someone*
isn't offended.  Your suggestion to "play nice" is quaint but irrelevent
when talking about sovereign adults.

Tolerance means tolerating intolerant groups.  The latter-day euros (germans
and french esp.) don't get it.  When you burn nazi literature you have become
them.
