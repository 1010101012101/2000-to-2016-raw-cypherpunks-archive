    Except make it all that more likely that Salvinorum would be scheduled.
A much better choice anyway for defensive (or offensive, for that matter)
would be nicotine. Easy to get, one drop of pure nicotine on someones skin
would be deadly. A dilute dose would knock them out -- the dog catchers
used nicotine in dart guns to knock out dogs. Problem was, a bit
too much and the dog died, not enough and it just got woozy. 
   So with a squirt gun full of DMSO and nicotine, you just squirt the
perp again, if the first wasn't enough. The medical examiner would 
probably decide it was a heart attack.
