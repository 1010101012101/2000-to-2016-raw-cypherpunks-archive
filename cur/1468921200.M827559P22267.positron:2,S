He's not my friend, Juan. He works for the fucking US Navy, after all.

But I do respect him. Think about it. He and his friends got US military
funding for a project that provided deniable and secure communication,
but only by making it public, for use by both funders and their enemies.

It might be that this vulnerability was crucial for selling it to US
military. But that's distinguishable from the argument that it's
intentionally designed to be vulnerable. There's also the fact that
nobody has come up with anything practical that's not vulnerable to
global adversaries. So it seems unlikely that he had such a design that
he put aside as unsellable.
