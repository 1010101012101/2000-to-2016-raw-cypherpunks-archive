Im glad you like Ockam's razor pete,its almost as good as Ockers 
razor.That's the one that's going to remind this list
every time you post that you exposed another list member to a parole 
officer's bust.
That this may have been accidental stupidity is what Ockams tells me.
That it was Peter Treis eugenics experiment as treacherous and slimy as 
they come is what Ockers razor tells me.
The punishment should be a straight razor across the throat in either case.
I'm complaining to your company about you spamming this list as well.I hope 
you get the sack.All women working there
should be aware of you,that's clear.
Crawl back under your rock,Trei,go die.
