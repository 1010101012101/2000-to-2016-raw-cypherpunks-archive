Actually, the final challenge was solved in 23 hours, about
1/3 Deep Crack, and 2/3 Distributed.net. They were lucky, finding
the key after only 24% of the keyspace had been searched.

More recently, RC5-64 was solved about a year ago. It took
d.net 4 *years*. 

2^69 remains non-trivial.

   Its fine assuming that moore's law will hold forever, but without 
that you can't really extrapolate a future tech curve. with *todays* 
technology, you would have to spend an appreciable fraction of the 
national budget to get a one-per-year "break", not that anything that 
has been hashed with sha-1 can be considered breakable (but that would 
allow you to (for example) forge a digital signature given an example)
   This of course assumes that the "break" doesn't match the criteria 
from the previous breaks by the same team - ie, that you *can* create a 
collision, but you have little or no control over the plaintext for the 
colliding elements - there is no way to know as the paper hasn't been 
published yet.
