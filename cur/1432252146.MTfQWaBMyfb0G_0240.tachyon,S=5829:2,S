You seem to miss my point here (and in general), and since this is probably 
the closest area in which we agree, I'd suggest it's worthwhile examining 
this.

Let's first of all agree that the proliferation of crypto is a good thing. 
If crypto is rarely used, then MY usage of it is actually almost worse 
(depending on context) than using it. More than that, increased use of 
crypto implies increased cost of monitoring. The $$$ nature of the 
assymmetry is mirrored precisely by the calculational assymetry. Ideally, it 
seems to me that this should be exploited.

"If only everyone" is I agree largely pointless in and of itself. However, 
when coupled to some fairly easy and obvious applications of "greed", the 
potential results are interesting. Want an example?

We now see file trading, messaging, and possibly even IP telephony occuring 
in P2P networks. Some of the P2Ps will be/are encrypted...a primitive form 
of "blacknet" you might say. Couple this app with popular notions of 
"protecting us from the terrorists" and you may have wildfire. That's the 
goal: wildfire.

You're problem is that you don't realize that crypto is no longer a 
technological issue now. It's now a social and marketing one. The fact that 
"Tyler Durden" actually has little of major insight to say completely misses 
the point. Ideally, "Tyler Durden" is a generic, popular figure that 
embodies virulent, 'stoopid' popularity. Tyler Durden is not an 
intellectual: He's basically a dumb punk and a rabblerouser. Ideally, he's 
every man.  He's everything you've always been afraid of, but he is 
precisely the one who can set you free.
