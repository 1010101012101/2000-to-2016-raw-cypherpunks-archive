A wise goat knows not to leave the herd. And

That's the 'fuck it, kill em all' concept, certainly approved
at the highest levels of certain govt's.

Careful, women earn stays in reformatories, guilt avoids no gender.

Because no one inside or outside the US seems willing
to haul its ass into the Hague (or other appropriate venue)
on charges to resolve the whole extrajudicial, torture, killing,
spying, rendition, global non-war war, econ/etc meddling thing,
et al. You'd think an accusation of murder would be a guaranteed
ticket to at least a grand jury. Yet as months and years tick
by those who could do such hauling keep washing it all under
a veil of disjointed weak rhetoric till they forget. Why this is...
maybe we can't grasp. But the depths to which it could slide are
pretty scary, both globally and in everyone's locale.

the ones who will never forget...
