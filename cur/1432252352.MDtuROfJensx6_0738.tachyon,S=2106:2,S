The 'Cypherpunks' aren't an organization. It's a mailing list, nothing
more. It happens to be a mailing list about cryptography, civil liberties,
and economics. It's not about bombs, hacking, or other such 'script kiddy'
bullshit.

I'd also suggest finding out info about a mailing list BEFORE joining. Who
knows what the owners might be doing with the data.

If you'd like more info,
