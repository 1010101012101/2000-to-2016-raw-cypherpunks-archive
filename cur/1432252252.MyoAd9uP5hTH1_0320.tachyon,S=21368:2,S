ok so i know structure is not known tantamountly as anarchy but guess what

The best thing to do at this stage would be to convince Kevin friendly<br>

creates an unhealthy environment, drawing away many others from<br>

for<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Dragonfly that<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 can be found on the CFRG mailing list or meeting minut=
es. =A0The<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 contrast between Kevin&#39;s enthusiasm and the group&=
#39;s skepticism is<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 striking [CFRG_SUMMARY]. =A0It&#39;s unclear what this=
 enthusiasm is based<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 on. =A0There&#39;s no record of Kevin making any effor=
t to understand<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Dragonfly&#39;s unusual structure, compare it to alter=
natives, consider<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 possible use cases, or construct a formal security ana=
lysis.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 2) =A0Twice Kevin suggested a technique for deriving t=
he Dragonfly<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 password-based element which would make the protocol e=
asy to break<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 [IGOE_1, IGOE_2]. =A0He also endorsed an ineffective a=
ttempt to avoid<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 timing attacks by adding extra iterations to one of th=
e loops<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 [IGOE_3,<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 IGOE_4]. =A0These are surprising mistakes from an expe=
rienced<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 cryptographer.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 3) =A0Kevin&#39;s approval of Dragonfly to the TLS WG =
misrepresented CFRG<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 consensus, which was skeptical of Dragonfly [CFRG_SUMM=
ARY].<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 4) =A0Kevin&#39;s NSA affiliation raises unpleasant bu=
t unavoidable<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 questions regarding these actions. =A0It&#39;s entirel=
y possible these are<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 just mistakes by a novice chair who lacks experience i=
n a particular<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 sort of protocol and is being pressured by IETF partic=
ipants to<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 endorse something. =A0But it&#39;s hard to escape an i=
mpression of<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 carelessness and unseriousness in Kevin&#39;s work. =
=A0One wonders whether<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 the NSA is happy to preside over this sort of sloppy c=
rypto design.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 While that&#39;s of course speculation, it remains baf=
fling that an<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 experienced cryptographer would champion such a shoddy=
 protocol.<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0The<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 CFRG chairs have been silent for months, and haven&#39=
;t responded to<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 attempts to clarify this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Conclusion<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 ----<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 The position of CFRG chair (or co-chair) is a role of =
crucial<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 importance to the IETF community. =A0The IETF is in de=
sperate need of<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 trustworthy crypto guidance from parties who are above=
 suspicion. =A0I<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 encourage the IAB and IRTF to replace Kevin Igoe with =
someone<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 who can<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 provide this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 Thanks for considering this request.<br>
