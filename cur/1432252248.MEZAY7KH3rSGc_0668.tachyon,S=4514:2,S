I think the cops will _someday_ come to rip my place apart. So?

Show me exactly which law I am breaking by placing some of my 
documents or files in a place even I cannot "turn over all copies 
from."

I have never heard of such a law.

You talk a lot about "courts not being amused" but I can find no 
evidence that such laws exist. Nor can I find any case where a Mafia 
don was prosecuted for "spoliating" a future prosecution by 
whispering.

Do you have such examples? And an appeals court assessment of the examples?

Cites?

Remember, the hypo involves placing material in irrecoverable forms 
prior to any actual court case.

And I think you're way off-base. "Known or should have known" that I, 
for example, will eventually be raided by the TP means that it is a 
crime for me to place files beyond the reach of those same TP?

I know you believe yourself to be a Real Lawyer. I cheerfully admit that IANAL.

But I say you are full of it.
