Here's a 'Texas' state view...

http://faxxon.cifnet.com/taskforce/sigdisc.htm

Think of a signature as proof of action/intent.

It's a 'verb verification mechanism'.

<P>Also, have a question regarding how many States accept laser generated=
  signatures on documents. This has come into question recently in  regar=
ds to assignments that have been sent to NH for recording and  have been =
refused because of the laser signatures. I know this has  been discussed =
at the NACRC meetings but can't seem to get my hands on  the info...The N=
H Registers of Deeds Assn. took a vote a few years ago  Not to accept the=
 laser signatures. NH Law requires original documents  and with that, we =
assume it to also mean original signatures. Any help  on this would also =
be appreciated.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Thank You! That's a good question. I will ha=
ve my staff (Liz, that's  you) conduct a survey and get back to you and o=
ther states' recorder  associations with an answer for each state.</P>
<P>The general form of the question we will use is,</P>
<P>"What form of signature do your recorders accept:</P>
<P>(1) Original only (as determined by recorder)</P>
<P>(2) Original and (check acceptable ones)</P>
<P>(a) stamp of signature</P>
<P>(b) laser printed signature</P>
<P>(c) a mark (e.g. X)</P>
<P>(d) what else? _______________________________</P>
<P>(3) Anything, as long as properly notarized</P>
<P>If (1), how do you determine what an "original signature" is?</P>
<P>If (2)(b), how do you tell what is a "laser" signature?"</P>
<P>I am told by my attorney friends that it is accepted law that the  con=
cept of "signature" is not what you and I as laymen think it is. It  is n=
ot just the cursive, written in ink name we think of.</P>
<P>The argument that the definition of "original document" includes a  co=
ncept of "original signature" probably does not hold up under  careful sc=
rutiny. It might be better to consider the concept of  original document =
as tied in with the legal requirement for  acknowledgement of signatures =
by a notary. Looking at the issue that  way, you could say that any docum=
ent that meets the requirement of the  notary statute is an original docu=
ment. Then, the issue of the form of  the signature goes away altogether!=
</P>
<P>Here are some questions for your recorders to ask themselves regarding=
  this issue.</P>
<P>(1) How do you know that a signature is the "original?" There are  peo=
ple passing millions of dollars of fake paper money in the US today  who =
have used laser printers and copy machines to make the money. Is  your st=
aff expert in determining the real thing from a "copy."</P>
<P>(2) Let's say that all of your staff has taken a course in "original  =
signature detection." Are you as a recorder then placing yourself in  the=
 position of being a legal guarantor that the signature is  original? Do =
you want to be in such a position?</P>
<P>(3) Let's say that the course tells you, as some recorders I am told  =
now do, to wet you finger and run it over the signature to see if it  smu=
dges. (This is probably the only go way to do the test.) But  smudging a =
signature is altering a document. What gives a recorder the  right to alt=
er a document? What is the document later ends up in court  and it is dec=
ided that the smudged signature is invalid because of  your action?</P>
<P>(4) During this refinance boom, do you think that a bunch of bank Vice=
  Presidents are sitting at their desks signing the 10 million new  mortg=
ages, assignments and releases that will be recorded this year?  That's a=
 lot of writer's cramp.</P>
<P>(5) Assuming the "signature" is properly notarized, how can you  justi=
fy rejection in any case?</P>
<P>(6) Whose job do you think it is to define what an original document  =
or an original signature is? Yours? The courts?</P>
<P>I'd be interested in the reaction of your recorders to this issue at  =
their annual meeting, and whether they are willing to officially  change =
their position on original signatures.</P>

<P>As a elected county clerk/recorder with almost 17 years in office it</=

<P>Anything, as long as properly notarized. Under Texas law most document=

<P>Such issues involving originality, effectiveness, timeliness, etc. sho=

<P>Carl,</P>

<P>With regard to signatures for the Standards Committee, I have no stron=
g opinion about their being required on UCC filings. Since the filing is =
a notice, and not a recording of the original debt and security instrumen=
ts, and since there are provisos for corrections by both secured party an=
d debtor, I don't see that signatures are all that important. On the othe=
r hand, signatures as a condition to access the filing system electronica=
lly, might prove useful . . . especially electronic or digital signatures=
=2E I will reserve my discussion on signatures for standards on recording=
s at the county recorder level.</P>
<P>As to the NH message attached, states differ on these facsimile signat=
ures. In fact, that differs within states. Florida, for example, does not=
 approve facsimile signatures for notaries unless the notary has some dis=
ability that would prevent her from signing. State officers are specifica=
lly empowered to use facsimile signatures. The 1996 Digital Signature Act=
 defines electronic signatures as any combination of letters, characters =
or symbols a signer attaches to a document with the intent to authenticat=
e it. That language is very close to the language used in the UCC statute=
s (both Florida's and the model act). I believe NC modified its notary ac=
t this summer and specifically rejected non-original signatures, while au=
thorizing digital signatures in dealings with the government. GA, UT, VA =
and WI recently passed legislation authorizing use of digital signatures =
by notaries.</P>
<P>An original signature and an original document are two different thing=
s. An original document does not necessarily require an original signatur=
e. I refer members to Benjamin Wright's book: "The Law of Electronic Comm=
erce." He devotes several chapters to signatures and documents.</P>
<P>I think anyone attempting to come to terms with signatures needs to fi=
rst understand what one is and why we use them. The most important thing =
for Ms. Guay, and recorders in other states, is what do the laws and cour=
t cases in NH or your respective states say about signatures.</P>

<P>Carl: I have to agree with my colleague in the great state of Texas (D=
ianne Wilson). As long as the document is acknowledged, if needed, then m=
y obligation is to record, not to "spit" test it, x-ray it, drop kick it =
or anything else. The UCC (specifically under negotiable instruments) giv=
es ample support for the fact that a signature can be made manually, by m=
achine or device or as a word, mark or symbol "by a person with present i=
ntention to authenticate a writing." (3-401) The burden of contesting a s=
ignature is also covered by the UCC under 3-308. If most states have adop=
ted some form of the UCC, then I guess those particular recorders will ha=
ve to follow their state's direction. (After all, we have to admit that e=
ven though the UCC is supposed to be "uniform" it never will be as long a=
s we have 50 states who have their own particular interests.) In Colorado=
 we also rely on the Uniform Recognition of Acknowledgments Act (found ju=
st before a rousing discussion on Outfitters and Guides) to provide furth=
er direction. As a Recorder I don't have the time to gaze into my crystal=
 ball to figure out if someone intended to sign a document manually, digi=
tally, or mechanically. </P>

<P>The italicized text is Mr. Ernst?s original notes. Joyce responds to e=
ach item:</P>

<P>The argument that the definition of "original document" includes a con=
cept of "original signature" probably does not hold up under careful scru=
tiny. It might be better to consider the concept of original document as =
tied in with the legal requirement for acknowledgement of signatures by a=

hat meets the requirement of the notary statute is an original document. =
Then, the issue of the form of the signature goes away altogether! </P>

<P>Wouldn't the notary be acknowledging that they had before them a copy?=
 Could they really be able to acknowledge a "signature" when no one was s=
igning in the immediate instance.  Would we need to change the "acknowled=
gement" language and form?  How 'bout the following:</P>
<P>&#9;Yup, that's a copy!</P>

<I><P>Here are some questions for your recorders to ask themselves regard=
ing this issue.</P>
<P>(1) How do you know that a signature is the "original?" There are peop=
le passing millions of dollars of fake paper money in the US today who ha=
ve used laser printers and copy machines to make the money. Is your staff=
 expert in determining the real thing from a "copy."</P>
</I>
<P>If this is getting so difficult, maybe we could demand that blue ink b=
e used.  It would show up really nice - especially if the ink on the prin=
ted form is black.</P>

<I><P>(2) Let's say that all of your staff has taken a course in "origina=
l signature detection." Are you as a recorder then placing yourself in th=
e position of being a legal guarantor that the signature is original? Do =
you want to be in such a position?</P>

</I><P>If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the records vault.</P>

<I><P>(3) Let's say that the course tells you, as some recorders I am tol=
d now</P>
<P>do, to wet you finger and run it over the signature to see if it smudg=
es. (This is probably the only go way to do the test.) But smudging a sig=
nature is altering a document. What gives a recorder the right to alter a=
 document?  What is the document later ends up in court and it is decided=
 that the smudged signature is invalid because of your action?</P>
</I>
<P>You don't toss a bucket of water on the signature and rub like you're =
removing denture stains.  If you are obliterating the signature, you are =
doing it wrong!</P>

<P>(4) During this refinance boom, do you think that a bunch of bank Vice=
 Presidents are sitting at their desks signing the 10 million new mortgag=
es, assignments and releases that will be recorded this year? That's a lo=
t of writer's cramp.</P>

<P>Why should recording officials be the only ones experiencing pain from=
 the refinancing boom?  With the points they charge, the least I should b=
e able to expect is a real signature from my banker.  I work for my money=
, shouldn't they for theirs?  If I cry too much over their writer's cramp=
, I won't have enough moisture left to spit on their signature!</P>

<P>(5) Assuming the "signature" is properly notarized, how can you justif=
y rejection in any case?</P>

<P>QUESTION:</P>
<P>What is the notary doing saying that someone personally appeared befor=
e them and executed a document if they didn't observe a real person whose=
 identity they have checked applying a pen to the paper?  Do any states h=
ave "Laser Notaries" and do they resemble Luke Skywalker or Princess Leah=
?  Will the "Laser Notary" sign by laser imprint or will their signature =
need to be an original?  Is a laser signature better than a rubber stamp?=
  Why should anyone sign?  Couldn't we just use a thumb print or is that =
too messy?  Will I be able to sleep tonight with these weighty matters ru=
nning through my head?</P>

<P>(6) Whose job do you think it is to define what an original document o=
r an original signature is? Yours? The courts?</P>

<P>If you could record copies, several copies of deeds would get recorded=
 and clutter up the record.  If there is a discrepancy between the severa=
l copies of the deed that got recorded, which would be the acceptable one=
=2E..once it is microfilmed or scanned, you can't tell from the image whi=
ch is the deed that contained the original signature.  The one with the o=
riginal signature would have a greater probability of being the version t=
hat the seller signed, but you couldn't tell from the images which was wh=
ich.  In our county, judges have enough to do keeping criminals behind ba=
rs.  While attorneys have every right to earn money any way they can, the=
y are the only ones who would benefit from the situation I have described=
=2E  Checking for an original signature is relatively simple and is a muc=
h better use of my tax dollars than having highly paid judges listen to h=
ighly paid attorneys argue over which image is the real one!</P>

<P>However, I will take these questions to the Registers in Michigan and =
see if they react in a more kindly fashion.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3>
<P>(Alaska is the only state with this designation. I asked Sharon to sum=
marize how the recording system works in Alaska so you can understand her=
 unique situation. She wrote):</P>

<P>The recording system in Alaska is operated by the State of Alaska. We =
do not  have counties; while there are a number of organized boroughs wit=
hin the state, recording functions do not operate through them. Instead t=
he state has created thirty-four separate "recording districts" that enco=
mpass the entire  state, and these form the jurisdictional boundaries for=
 all documents required  or permitted to be recorded in a specific distri=
ct. We have fourteen offices  throughout the state, so many of these offi=
ces process documents for multiple recording districts. There are distric=
t recorders at each office, and recorder  managers who supervise three re=
gions within the state. As state recorder, I oversee all of the state's r=
ecording operations, as well as the UCC central  file system in Alaska. T=
his is often a daunting task, given the fact that Alaska is such a huge s=
tate (it's more than 1100 miles from my office in  Anchorage to our Nome =
location and nearly 800 miles in the other direction to our most southerl=
y location in Ketchikan!). </P>

<P>With that background, here are her comments on the signature issue:</P=
>
<P>Carl, I concur with the discussions relative to accepting the document=
 when the document is acknowledged, even if the signature may not meet th=
e recorder's subjective view of what is "original." </P>
<P>Here in Alaska, our statutes do require, as they do in many, if not mo=
st, other jurisdictions, that every document submitted for recording cont=
ain an "original signature". Our statutes also delineate the few specific=
 document types that are required to be acknowledged (conveyances, powers=
 of attorney, etc.). In these instances, the notary attests that the docu=
ment was executed in his/her presence and we accept that fact as confirmi=
ng that the signor's signature meets the requirement of being an original=
 signature.  </P>
<P>For document types not required to be acknowledged, our recorders stil=
l attempt to determine originality of signature (based on color of ink, i=
mpression into paper, or the infamous "smudge" test), because our statute=
 requires that an original signature must appear on the document before i=
t can be recorded. Our customers are familiar with this requirement and b=
ecause of this, we rarely reject a document for this reason.  </P>
<P>When our recording statutes were liberalized a few years ago to elimin=
ate the many ambiguities and conflicts that historically forced Alaska's =
recorders into the role of operating as "document police", the original s=
ignature requirement was one requirement that the legislature left intact=
=2E However, in today's world of rapid technological advances, determinin=
g whether a signature is "original" is as difficult as distinguishing bet=
ween diamonds and cubic zirconia with the naked eye! The faster that reco=
rding jurisdictions move away from document policing activities such as t=
his, the better the public will be served. </P>

<P>Sharon, thanks you for your thoughts on e-signatures. In Texas, if the=
 notary "has knowledge" that the signature is valid it is not necessary t=
o "appear before". Most recorders have been very receptive to e-signature=
s, but some still do the "smudge" test you mentioned. Thanks again for yo=
ur comments.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE=3D"Arial"><P>Darrell Pierce</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>(Our UCC guru on the Standards Committee, wi=
ll admit to being an attorney. He has been involved in the discussion of =
signatures with respect to the Uniform Commercial Code for the past 6-7 y=
ears, and is also an independent observer of our discussions of real esta=
te related matters. Here is his contribution.)</P>

<P>I have read with interest the dialogue regarding signatures on recorde=
d documents. My thoughts (for what they are worth - i.e., priceless to th=
ose who agree with me and worthless to those that don't) are as follows:<=
/P>
<P>There is a major distinction (maybe) between signatures on most record=
ed documents and those on UCC financing statements. UCC filings are merel=
y notice filings. They are not documents that create legal rights between=
 parties.</P>
<P>Yes, it is true that the filing of a financing statement serves to per=
fect a security interest and protects the secured party from the bankrupt=
cy trustee and from subsequent creditors, but the operative document that=
 creates the security interest is the security agreement which still must=
 be "signed" by the debtor. [I add quotation marks because revised Articl=
e 9 speaks in terms of an authenticated record, not a signed writing, the=
reby enabling electronic commerce - which raises the same issues raised b=
y signature requirements for other recordable documents like mortgages an=
d deeds - more to follow.]</P>
<P>The financing statement is merely a notice to the world that a secured=
 party may have a security interest in the described collateral. It does =
not inform the searcher as to the nature of the underlying deal or the am=
ount or type of obligation that is secured.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Revised Article 9 takes the position that debtor signatur=
es on financing statements can and should be eliminated. The burden of ch=
ecking signatures (and they are not notarized so how can the filing offic=
e to anything to verify them?) outweighs the possibility that such checki=
ng could eliminate unauthorized filings (it cannot do so). Revised Articl=
e 9 provides other procedures to solve the unauthorized filing problem by=
 allowing for correction statements to be filed, by having all filings re=
main of record for one year after they lapse, by allowing filings to be r=
eadily amended, by giving statutory damages to debtors when secured parti=
es fail to terminate filings where there is no outstanding obligation and=
 no obligation to make future advances, and by calling for states to ensu=
re (through other law) that unauthorized filing activity is criminal.</P>=

<P>Real estate documents are operative documents and the recording system=
, by requiring the original to be recorded, offers searchers a full set o=
f information as to the nature and scope of the underlying transaction. T=
here is also a title searching mechanism inherent in the system. The UCC =
filing system makes no attempt to be a record of who owns what personal p=
roperty.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I hope we would all agree that however important signatur=
es are in the real estate world, they need not be important in the UCC wo=
rld.</P>
<P>I also do not purport to argue how recorders should act under current =
law. Each state has its own laws governing recording and those laws are n=
ecessarily upheld by recorders. Those laws may be more or less rational, =
or not rational at all, but until changed they are the laws to be followe=
d. But let's focus on the question of what should the law be.</P>
<P>Once upon a time, it was thought by many that recording offices could =
serve as repositories of the definitive information as to ownership of re=
al property  and the nature and extent of other interests (such as liens =
and claims) therein. Some states made unrecorded conveyances completely i=
neffective (at least outside of equity - courts always seem to find a way=
 to do rough justice when inequitable conduct has occurred). But such law=
s led to "races to the courthouse" when unscrupulous owners would try to =
sell identical or overlapping interests to more than one party.</P>
<P>Other state s thought to have the recording system act as a notice sys=
tem or some combination of the "race" and "notice" functions. </P>
<P>Regardless of purpose, the fact remains that the recording office cann=
ot ensure that its records will always reflect what is the legal outcome =
of priority and ownership disputes. There are always matters of equity th=
at will never be reflected in the system. Even the most scrupulous signat=
ure checking cannot stop forgery.</P>
<P>I am certain that no recorder wishes to take responsibility of represe=
nting that all recorded documents are genuine and are in fact what they p=
urport to be.</P>
<P>Given that documents may have been forged or that copies as opposed to=
 originals may have been erroneously accepted for recording and the fact =
that microfilm records do not inform a searcher as to the apparent validi=
ty of a document, it seems that the only position a searcher can take is =
to assume that everything that appears of record is genuine and a potenti=
al encumbrance on title. </P>
<P>As far as I know, recorders do not examine documents to ensure that th=
ey are legally sufficient. They do not always check legal descriptions. T=
hey do not ensure that all warranties are obtained in each deed. They do =
not ensure that the tax escrow in a mortgage is adequate or that it compl=
ies with consumer laws. They do not ensure that all rights related to the=
 land in question are conveyed. All these matters are left in the hands o=
f the parties.</P>
<P>All recorders are doing by checking signatures (leaving aside the rare=
 cases where they know the parties to the transaction and can recognize s=
ignatures) is verifying that the document presented is an "original" sole=
ly to the extent that it and the notarial acknowledgment were signed in i=
nk and are not photocopies. They cannot verify a lack of fraud or forgery=
=2E They cannot verify whether the mortgage loan has been funded or the c=
onsideration for a deed in fact paid. They are merely requiring forgers t=
o forge "originals" instead of photocopying a forgery or transmitting a f=
acsimile of a forgery.</P>
<P>Fraud doesn't happen that often. That is not to say that it doesn't ha=
ppen regularly, but it does not occur in the vast supermajority of real e=
state transactions that lead to recordings of documents. Usually the bank=
s, attorneys, title companies and parties involved are honest.</P>
<P>I would estimate that, like most other situations, the biggest deterre=
nt to fraud is not the crooks inability to forge a signature (that the re=
corder wouldn't recognize as a forgery anyway), but the fact that a numbe=
r of people usually need to be involved in a real estate transaction due =
to its nature and complexity involved, a unless a forger is very capable =
and knowledgeable (and no one can stop such persons), it's hard to get ot=
hers to be a party to a fraud. Other protections against fraud include th=
e relative inability of a forger to get possession of a piece of property=
 so as to be in a position to one's self out as an owner to a lender or b=
uyer.</P>
<P>I believe the only reason to require original documents to be recorded=
 is to prevent fraud. Notaries are the vehicle to try to ensure that the =
signatures on the document were made by the people the documents suggests=
 made them. All the recorder can do is determine that the signatures are =
in smudgable ink (or is it not in smudgable laser form?). Fraud is a low-=
incidence event and courts are required anyway to solve the problems crea=
ted by fraud. Even when fraud is on the agenda, signatures are easily for=
ged and notary seals are easily purchased or forged. As long as we requir=
e all the formalities to be observed between the parties with respect to =
the original document, why require the original to be recorded?</P>
<P>I have no doubt that fraud is a serious problem, but I have serious do=
ubts that the recording system can stop it.</P>
<P>I would be curious to know how many fraudulent documents have been dis=
covered by recorders. If we knew the answer to that question we could com=
pare the savings against the enormous cost of recorders' intake procedure=
s, of rejected documents that need to be re-submitted, of the inability t=
o handle recordings electronically or by fax (the cost to FedEx originals=
 all over the country), and of maintaining systems and/or advisors who ca=
n respond to an ever-changing array of non-uniform procedures.</P>
<P>Shouldn't the recording system become more like the UCC? Shouldn't it =
be a notice system only? Don't the courts necessarily get involved in rea=
l estate disputes anyway and aren't they in a better position to determin=
e whether a copy is bona fide or not? </P>
<P>Once upon a time, it may have true that originals were recorded and re=
tained in the recorder's records. That would serve the purpose of allowin=
g the original to be later examined by a court. But that advantage has di=
sappeared in the age of microfilm and imaging.</P>
<P>Having rambled this far, let me assure the reader my mind is not yet m=
ade up. Real estate, unlike UCC's, is forever. Maybe there is some merit =
in creating the presumption in favor of the filer when the recording syst=
em assures that a purported original was reviewed by the recorder, especi=
ally as there may be no original to be found many years later when the ma=
tter is litigated. It may also be the case that the parties who could hav=
e authenticated any copy are no longer living, but we have the government=
's assurance of sorts that a purported original once existed. Is this rea=
lly helpful? Or are we only making sure that forgers forge originals?</P>=

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Carl Ernst asked the two associations representing notaries to comment=
 on Mr. Wileman?s statements regarding &quot;appear before&quot; and &quo=
t;knowledge.&quot; Here are their responses:</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE=3D"Arial"><P>John L. Jones and Lisa Fisher of the Am=
erican Society of Notaries</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Lisa summarized the notary?s duty as follows=
: </P>
<P>Carl, by now you have received John's and my email outlining some nota=
ry 101 teachings.  I wanted to correct Mr. Wileman's assumption that  "if=
 the notary "has knowledge" that the signature is valid it is not necessa=
ry to "appear before."  <B>Personal appearance is the Golden Rule of a pr=
oper notarization</B>.  In a handful of states, a witness can swear they =
saw someone sign a document, but that is not a practice observed by Texas=
 officials in the Secretary of State's office-the office that regulates n=
otaries.  Please pass on the Golden Rule.  Thanks,  Lisa Fisher.</P>

<P>John Jones addressed the questions put to him by Carl Ernst in some de=
tail, as follows:</P>
<P>Lisa Fisher and I collaborated on the questions you asked and offer yo=
u the following... If you want to roundtable it some more, give Lisa a ca=
ll at 850/671-5164.</P>

<P>Question: Are there differences between the states in whether the nota=
ry must use "come before" language or "known to me" language.</P>

<P>Answer: These are two different issues. Every state requires the perso=
n giving an acknowledgement or taking an oath to personally appear before=
 a notary. One of the things the notary does while the person is before t=
hem is to prove identification. That's done by either producing sufficien=
t ID or by being personally known to the notary (or in some cases, to a w=
itness or witnesses who are also present). The "come before" is the doctr=
ine of personal appearances.</P>

<P>Question: Can a facsimile signature (e.g. laser-generated) can be &gt;=
used in a &quot;Known to" state but not in the other unless the person (e=
=2Eg., bank officer) comes to the notary &gt; with a stack of laser-signe=
d assignments and says, "All these assignments contain my &gt; signature,=
" in which case the notary would still be able to use the "come before" l=
anguage.</P>

<P>Answer&quot;: If you leave out the "Know to" state reference, this is =
more or less correct. The issue is whether or not the signature has to be=
 attached in the presence of the notary. For an acknowledgement the answe=
r is no. Documents that are acknowledged are typically land records (deed=
s, mortgages, etc.) where the signer is stating that he is who he says he=
 is and is acknowledging that he is signing of his own free will. In most=
 jurisdictions it is acceptable to bring a signed document before a notar=
y and say "that is my signature, please notarize the document." The notar=
y gets proof of identity, which may be personal knowledge of who the pers=
on is (my boss, an employee, a friend, etc.).</P>
<P>On documents where the person is taking an oath, such as affidavits, t=
he signer needs to be in the presence of the notary to take an oath. The =
typical language here is "Subscribed and sworn to . . ." so the notary is=
 stating that the document was signed before him.  Of course the notary c=
ould go into the office with the person whose electronic signature is bei=
ng added to an electronic document and watch that process, then notarize =
the print-out.</P>
<P>Neither of these types of notarizations addresses how the signature ge=
ts added to the document. The first could certainly be the scenario you u=
sed where a group of pre-printed documents with laser signatures are hand=
ed to a notary by the person whose signature was printed on the document.=
 Since the notary works for the person, he/she personally knows him. But =
he needs to be in her presence when she notarizes the documents. If the n=
otary is a temp, say, she would need to see proof of ID, but could still =
notarize all the documents with him in her presence.</P>
<P>But that doesn't address whether or not the laser signature is legal. =
That answer depends on individual state statutes and case law.  More and =
more states are formalizing signature law to include any characters, lett=
ers or symbols attached to a document with the intent to authenticate it.=
  This is the type of language that has been in the UCC acts for years. S=
tates are also addressing the issue of what are documents, or writings. E=
lectronic documents are showing up in both the statutes and in case law a=
s being as valid as physical (i.e. paper) documents.  If an electronic do=
cument is legal (whether by statute or by case law), and if any symbols, =
characters or letters attached to it with the intent to authenticate are =
used to sign such a document are legal (also either by statute or case la=
w), you have a legal signature.</P>
<P>I'll save for another day whether the electronic document and signatur=
e are the original and the paper  print-out the copy. That argument gets =
even more convoluted when you consider that many of today's document prep=
aration programs may generate these printouts on-the-fly by taking boiler=
plate forms and merging data from a database together with the signature =
of the person and streaming the result to a printer without ever creating=
 a single electronic document.</P>

<P>Question: If there is such a difference in the notary statutes, which =
states have which language?</P>

<P>Answer: Statutes vary and the particular language for a state's acknow=
ledgements and oaths are frequently in the statutes. But the concepts of =
personal appearance and personally known are universally  independent of =
one another.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Question: While I'm thinking about it, let me go even further:  Let's =
say that the bank officer presents a stack of laser-signed, blank assignm=
ents to  the notary and says, "I have pre-signed these assignments and  I=
 authorize my computer department to fill them in  upon the authorization=
 &gt; of my staff."  Is there anything legally wrong with the notary ackn=
owledging  the signature even though the document is not complete?</P>

<P>Answer: Not good form even if legal.  It's not legal in Florida.  Typi=
cally the list of assignment references should be entered into the comput=
er or fed from a database prior to printing.  If not, the computer depart=
ment should fill in the information before the notarization. But, if the =
notary is taking an acknowledgement, i.e. "Acknowledged before me by ____=
_, who is personally known to me or who produced as identification ______=
_, this ___ day of _____, 199__.", then it is sometimes done. We do NOT c=
ondone it.</P>

<P>Question: Is it the responsibility of a notary to determine if a docum=
ent is complete or  even filled in?</P>

<P>Answer: A notary should certainly scan a document for blank spaces. It=
's a protection for the signer to be sure there are no blank spaces that =
could be filled in later to alter the document to the signer's disadvanta=
ge.  And the notary doesn't want to abet a fraudulent act by helping the =
signer with an "official" document later altered to the signer's advantag=
e. Florida law requires a notary not notarize an incomplete document.  Bl=
anks make the document incomplete.</P>
<P>On the other hand, many documents are compound by nature. A part of a =
document may be notarized while the balance may have blanks to be filled =
in by others in the chain of processing. In those cases, the later additi=
on of information in the blanks is not material to the act of taking an a=
cknowledgement. An example are the spaces left for recorders to put recor=
ding information, or for a title company to enter indexing information. T=
hat does not alter the document from the point of view of what the signer=
 acknowledged before the notary.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE=3D"Arial"><P>Deborah M. Thaw, Executive Director, Na=
tional Notary Association</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Question: Are there differences between the =
states in whether the Notary must use "come before" language or "known to=
 me" language.  </P>

<P>The answer is no.  Personal appearance is a requirement in all states =
except Arkansas.  Every state is operating under some uniform acknowledge=
ment act so the language is virtually the same.  Mr. Wileman's statement =
that signers in Texas needn't appear before the Notary and that a notariz=
ation may be based on the Notary's familiarity with a signature is a viol=
ation of the law since the Texas statutory notarial certificates clearly =
state that the signer must appear before the Notary at the time of the no=
tarization.  There is no obligation to SIGN in the presence of a Notary i=
n the act of acknowledgement, but the signer must BE in the presence of a=
 Notary. </P>
<P>The reliability of the signature on a document received for recording =
has been a long-standing issue.  We believe that a statutory requirement =
that each signer affix a signature in the journal of notarial acts afford=
s the Notary the valuable opportunity to compare the journal signature wi=
th that on the document and on the signer's ID cards;  it also may show t=
hat the signer laboring to make a convincing forgery -- an opportunity of=
ten missed with acknowledged documents, which needn't be signed in the No=
tary's presence. Thus, a recorder, relying on the Notary, could be more a=
ssured that the signatures are genuine. Unfortunately, only a few states =
require journal signatures and legislation which proposes such a safeguar=
d is vehemently rejected by all lending institutions, attorneys, and othe=
r organizations who believe it impedes the notarial process, takes up too=
 much time and requires, at the very least that signers must appear befor=
e the Notary, a requirement, I might add, in every state but one.  Even i=
n cases where there are hundreds of documents to be "notarized" states wi=
th journal signature requirements accept one signature in the journal for=
 the appropriate number of documents handed over to the Notary by the sig=
ner at that moment in time.  </P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Request From Omaha Attorney Firm</P>
<P>&quot;Enclosed is a proposed acknowledgment to be used for our client,=
 who is no longer able to either sign nor affix his mark to a document fo=
r recording in your office.. We propose to use a facsimile stamp of a pri=
or signature made by him.</P>
<P>It is my understanding that you are going to discuss this matter with =
the Douglas County Attorney?s office. In order to assist?we enclose a ref=
erence from 80 CJS <I>Signatures</I> =A7 7, which allows for the use of a=
 stamp. We also enclose a copy of the case of <I>Graff v. Graff</I>, 179 =
Neb. 345, which would allow another person to sign on behalf of someone.&=
quot;</P>

<P>[Note-In the <I>Graff</I> decision, the court based its decision in pa=
rt on the fact that &quot;The deeds appear to be regularly acknowledged. =
No attempt was made to impeach the certificate of the notary.&quot;]</P>

<P>The Deputy County Attorney responded in an opinion to the Register of =
Deeds:</P>
<P>&quot;?I have concluded that the deed can be recorded provided it is p=
roperly acknowledged.</P>
<P>Both Nebraska law and general law hold that when a grantor is not able=
 to affix his signature to a document, a facsimile signature or the grant=
or?s mark can be affixed to the document. This mark or facsimile signatur=
e will generally be treated as an original signature <B>provided that the=
 grantor acknowledges that such mark is to be considered his original sig=
nature</B> [my emphasis]. Of course, the acknowledgement must be properly=
 and duly signed and be in an original form on the document to be recorde=
d.</P>
<P>The circumstances in which a facsimile signature or mark other than an=
 original signature of the grantor are rare and should not be accepted on=
 a routine basis. Your inquiry as to the authenticity of the signature an=
d the legality of the acceptance of the documents was the appropriate cou=
rse of action and should be followed in the future.&quot;&quot;</P>

<P>In another letter dated in 1989, a county attorney stated the opinion =
that &quot;a ?FAX&quot; copy should not be accepted in lieu of the origin=
al deed for recording purposes.&quot; Nor has anyone in this current exch=
ange has suggested otherwise, since the acknowledgment would not be an or=
iginal.</P>

<P>[Note-The Nebraska statute contains a section defining what a signatur=
e is, that reads, &quot;Generally, in the absence of a statute otherwise =
providing, a signature may be affixed by hand, by printing, by stamping, =
or by various other means.&quot; This has been further interpreted by Neb=
raska courts to allow typewritten, engraved, photographed, written in pen=
cil, and even cut and pasted from one instrument to another. Thus Nebrask=
a law is pretty clear in broadly defining signature. <B>I?d like to hear =
from other states about their statute, if any, on how a signature is defi=

</FONT><B><FONT FACE=3D"Arial"><P>Kathi Guay 11/19/98:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>Our association had a very interesting discu=
ssion about computer generated signatures or facsimile signatures at our =
meeting on Nov. 18,1998.  We reaffirmed our vote that we took Sept. 28,19=

on the National level, if you get anymore feedback, please let me know. T=
hanks for all you help.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I asked Kathi what the legal basis for rejecting these signatures migh=
t be, and she responded on 11/20/98 (my emphasis):</P>

<P>The legal basis that our Association is using in rejecting facsimile o=
r computer generated signatures is <B>the lack of statutory authority to =
do so</B>. The only statute covering facsimile signatures allows Public O=
fficials Only to use those signatures in very limited situations. The sta=
tutes covering the Registers does not allow <B>nor does it specifically m=
ention that they can be accepted</B>. Our interpretation of "original Doc=
uments" includes what we interpret to be a physically handwritten mark ma=
de by the person by whom the signature represents. It is made by them onl=
y. We are also relying on what our statutes require for acknowledgement, =
the person must appear and sign in the presence of a JP or notary. We rea=
lize that this is not the case in some of the other states. There was con=
cern about <B>the possibility of fraud</B>, though it is not a direct con=
cern of the Registers, more a consumer concern. We all realize that once =
a document is microfilmed or optically scanned, that it is impossible to =
know if it was an original signature, but, we also realize that if we mak=
e every attempt to ensure that the document conforms to our current statu=
tory requirements "original document&quot; to include an original signatu=

<P>PS. We do not spit test signatures, we eye them only and make our best=
 determination. We have only received a few copies of signatures. I guess=
 bottom line agreement of our association was, until there is <B>specific=
 legislation that allows us to accept </B>a facsimile or computer generat=

<P>Conclusion</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3D3><P>I will end this phase of the discussion for =
now the way it began, with a few questions for future consideration, base=
d on Kathi?s notes regarding the outcome of the New Hampshire Registers? =
annual meeting:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Kathi says the New Hampshire recorders are acting based on a lack of =
statutory authority, that is, they cannot accept anything but an original=
 signature because the legislature has not said they can accept anything =
else. Is this logical, or can it be used to allow any recorder to do anyt=
hing extra-statutory just by saying, &quot;Gee, I have to reject all left=
-handed signatures because there is no statute to allow me to accept such=
 a signature?&quot;</LI>
<LI>The possibility of fraud exists in all transactions recorded. That is=
 the reason behind the laws of notary and witnesses, for example, to &quo=
t;assure&quot; that signatures are genuine. But what happens when the not=
ary is in cahoots with the fraudulent signer? Whose problem is this anywa=
y?</LI>
<LI>Harking back to Walt Wileman?s comments, what recorder is to say that=
 he does not stand with his notary by the system printer that prints his =
name when he prepares assignments and say to his notary, &quot;Each of th=
ese signatures is mine?&quot; What gives any recorder the right to say th=
at a notary is complicit in acknowledging what the recorder thinks is an =
invalid signature. Should the notary be brought before the state board fo=
r expulsion?</LI></OL>

<P>Another, related discussion has started as of 1/23/99 regarding the ne=
ed for and reasonableness of &quot;Statutory Requirements for Document Re=
view.&quot;</P>
<P>We will come back to the signature issue some time in the future as pa=
rt of a white paper about the content of documents. In the meantime, this=
 document will be posted to the Standards Committee Internet web page to =
help any recorders who are facing this issue in their state or county.</P=
