I recently got a phone call from my ISP RE:The Pacifier,spitting the dummy 
letters.J.Thomson the lawyer was harassing them and calling them 
twits,stating that the FBI had been informed about me and so on.Some of the 
mans charm shines through the pacifier letters.Oh he also claimed to have 
knowledge of various depraved or naughty websites that I surfed to!
Seems if someone well heeled can hassle your ISP enough then *you*may be 
blamed for the wasted time at the ISP.
Ill send a copy of AP to Speakeasy if you send one to Useoz.com.
