Heh.  I'd been assuming the original 
	"Does the string 'G3' mean anything..."
question was going to be about Macintoshes or something :-)

Meanwhile, the spam filters at pobox.com suddenly decided
that almost everything posted to Cypherpunks or Cyberia-L
this evening rates a  [spam score 5.20/10.0 -pobox],
so in standard Choatean fashion, I figure I ought to leave it
in the mail headers like his CDR: internal-use fields.

				Thanks!
