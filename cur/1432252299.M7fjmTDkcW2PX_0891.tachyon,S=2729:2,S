Simpler solution there then is to say
"well, good - that means that the Government can still monitor terrorists,
but that the minimum-wage employees answering the helpdesk at AOL can't
read though your mail while they are bored."

You don't need to - just convince them that it is safe against casual
snoopers (and to be honest, most "sensitive" email the government couldn't
give a damn about, but your neighbours would find very interesting indeed
:)
As long as you get the desired end result (them using crypto) do you
really care what they think?
