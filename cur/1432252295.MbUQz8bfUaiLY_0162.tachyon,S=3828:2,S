Actually that raises the interesting question-

If we could do so without stolen money and without collateral damage, would 
it be moral to invade countries and kill their governments to prevent the 
oppression of their people?

That is, since all governments violate people's rights and some violate 
them more than others, would attacks on governments by outsiders be proper 
(as internal revolution presumably is)?

My poli sci prof once said "after the 'Revolution' of 1845 in England, the 
Liberals imposed laissez-faire."  Can one impose non-imposition?

Is it wrong to kill a government?
