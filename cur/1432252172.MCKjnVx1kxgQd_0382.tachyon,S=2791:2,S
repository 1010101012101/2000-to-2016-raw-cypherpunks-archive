Eric hasn't formally abdicated, but let me remind everyone and the archives
that there's an alternative node, cypherpunks@ds.pro-ns.net, that runs in a
substantially similar way to Eric's.  It even uses some or most of the same
scripts that Eric uses on lne.com.

(The functionality that we're referring to here is that spam is mostly kept off
list by only allowing posts from members of the list plus known anonymous
remailers, known members of other nodes, etc.  Posts that don't make it
initially get forwarded by the node owners, and then posts from that user make
it automatically from then on.)

The ds.pro-ns.net node is hosted at the ISP that I own, so it doesn't suffer
from any dialup connectivity issues.

(I volunteered to take over for Eric in private email.  He suggested that
I remind everyone of the alternative, first.)
