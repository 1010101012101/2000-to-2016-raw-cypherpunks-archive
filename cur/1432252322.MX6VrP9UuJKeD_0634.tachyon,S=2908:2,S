Isolated biometrics are nigh to useless. But integrated, they become
increasingly more and more difficult to fool. Some of it is cheap, too.
There are phase-evaluating 2d integrated sensors which have a depth of up to
7 m, which are very cheap in principle. Mounted in a gate, this will give you
face/ear/head geometry. Calculating a fingerprint from a topology map is
something any embedded can do. With IR/NIR you'll get a skin pigmentation
map.

Teraherz will give you body geometry. Olfactorics will give you volatile MHC
fragments, and thus a hash of your immune diversity (and your current
perfume). Add gait recognition, and you've got a real rich telebiometrics
signature.

Anyone who owns that infrastructure is even more dangerous than who 0wns the
voting machines. The perfect enabler to establish a totalitarian control
system.

Absolutely. It's like owning a mint for grant money.
