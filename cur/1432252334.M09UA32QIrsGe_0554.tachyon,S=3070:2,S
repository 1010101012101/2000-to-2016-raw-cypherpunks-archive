Very nice analysis.

If you greatly reduce Google's speed of search, what kind of 
compression-gains can you get?   Imagine an archive which is
highly compressed [1] but used mostly to counter censorship.

[1] That JPGs etc. are already highly compressed means that
if you keep pictures, you won't gain as much by trading off
search speed for compression.
