The original vaccine was based on cowpox, the nearest 
relative of small pox.  However it was insufficiently 
effective and reliable, and so was furtively replaced by a 
weakened strain of smallpox, which was grown on cows.  The 
sellers of the vaccine continued to represent it as cowpox, 
but it was in fact a mild variant of the real thing, 
smallpox.

One reason for ending routine smallpox vaccinations was fear
that the vaccine might re-evolve virulence.
