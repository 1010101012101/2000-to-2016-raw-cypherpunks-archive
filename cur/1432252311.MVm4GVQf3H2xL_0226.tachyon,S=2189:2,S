The purpose of this is purely a show and indoctrination.

1. No self-respecting terrorist would go to a fucking library to do terror reading (maybe there is something positive here - I think that we should get protected by pigs from extremely dumb terorists.)

2. No library that I am aware of requires ID to do on-site anything. The same goes for internet cafes and open wireless access points.

3. Buying books for cash is anonymous as it gets - it's unlikely that a library will have something that university bookstore or Internet doesn't have. Again, poor terorists should be caught.

I want to be terorized by professionals.
