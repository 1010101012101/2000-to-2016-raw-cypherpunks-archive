Right, that will likely be a major factor. I'm betting that we'll see
regional forest burn-offs, as precipitation shifts away from the
equator. Amazon will become grasslands and desert. Africa too.

Migration will be a bitch. Maybe US and EU will nuke strategically to
prevent that. Maybe we'll finally see WWIII ;)

Before too long, it won't matter ;)

Interesting times are coming, for sure ;)
