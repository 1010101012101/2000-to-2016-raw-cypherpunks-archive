I believe they are all using ABA encoding.  Of course, I could also be
wrong :-)

Again, I may be wrong, but IIRC, there is now n active effort to
standardize the physical properties of licenses.  Not long ago, we had
such a diversity of formas that it was impossible to detect real from
fake.  For example, until recently, the New York license was literally a
piece of paper (with no photo!), and the New Mexico license was the size
of the _insert_ you would normally see on a laminated card.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
