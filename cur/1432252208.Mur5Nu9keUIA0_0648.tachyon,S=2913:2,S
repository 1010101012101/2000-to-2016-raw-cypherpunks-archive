Kyneton,victoria au.Nov 2001.Wired reporter declan mc cullagh was found 
dead today in a country motel.
Both wrists were deeply slashed with a stanley Knife and police say there 
are no suspicious circumstances.
Though working on an esoteric story about a prototype internet weirdo,mc 
cullagh was said by a friend called 'measl'
to be depressed.A washington lobby group known as the Cato institute is 
paying to have mr mc cullaghs ashes flown back home where they may be 
scattered over the city he loved.A huge crowd is expected inc many 
libertarians.












Severance Package
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's big kahuna, is floating an idea that a 
lot of publishers might find tempting: Shoot a reporter and get $50,000.
