Subject: APM: Crypt::RC4 module

Okay-

I've progressed, but aren't understanding something. I tested the 4-line
perl implementation of RC4 algorighm and it was an asymetric cypher (give
it encrypt key and value n and in encrypts, give it decrypt key and n and
it decrypts). Yet the Crypt::RC4 only takes a passphrase, which I gave it
the encrypt key and it decrypts with the encrypt key also.

Does anyone know how to give it the encrypt key and n to encrypt so that
the decrypt key and n works properly? The man page and perldocs for this
module are lacking in that information, I understand the algorithm, but not
how to combine the keyparts to make it work. The one example I found on the
net obviously read the docs and didn't run it, since they used just the
encrypt and decrypt keys, which doesn't work.

Thanks-

David
