The military recoilless rifles are more or less bazookas -
their objective is to fire a relatively large and usually explosive shell
to blow up tanks, trucks, and other big hard targets,
while still being conveniently portable.
I'm also puzzled by the "flakes" comments - rapidly expanding gasses
are plenty of reaction mass, though perhaps there's some sort of
wadding to provide increased gas pressure that gets flaked in
the explosion.
