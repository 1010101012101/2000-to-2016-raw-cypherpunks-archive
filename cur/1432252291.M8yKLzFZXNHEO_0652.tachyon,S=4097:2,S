  Don't like ID cards? Hand over your passport
  By JAMES SLACK

  Anybody who objects to their personal details going on the new "Big
  Brother" ID cards database will be banned from having a passport.

  More here.... * Cameron to swop ID cards for guards

  James Hall, the official in charge of the supposedly-voluntary scheme, said
  the Government would allow people to opt out - but in return they must
  "forgo the ability" to have a travel document.

  With one in every eight people saying they will refuse to sign-up, up to
  five million adults could effectively be refused permission to leave the
  country.

Well, that's only true if you use a regulated carrier and insist on using or presenting a Brit passport.  Looks like a great opportunity for entrepreneurial people to become 'gypsy' transports.  Instead of illicit trafficking of kidnapped people they can now tap into a new, profitable, but much less risky illicit business. :)

  One concerned member of the public, Andrew Michael Edwards, asked what
  would happen to people who refuse to join the #5.4 billion scheme.

  Mr Hall replied: "There is no need to register and have fingerprints taken
  - but you will forgo the ability to have a passport".

He meant, of course, only a Brit passport.

  Therefore, anybody who objects to ID cards on principle and wants to keep
  their personal details private must remain in the UK for the rest of their
  lives.

Or opt out of entering countries at authorized ports of entry.  For example, in most countries with sea coasts its a relatively simple matter to enter territorial waters, lower an inflatable tender to discharge or acquire passengers, and return or move on to the next destination, never having entered a port.  With freestanding, fiber masts, little or no metal rigging and low thermal signature (if you sail instead of motor) and angular hull designs to provide stealth, they should have low probability of intercept on radar and thermal imaging (two of the most effective means to spot and interdict water craft on the high seas).

This is good news as it possibly sets the stage for ID objectors to become global vs. national citizens, to cross borders with the impunity that was previously only the purview of criminals and terrorists.  The more citizens that see The State not in their best interests and acting accordingly the better.
