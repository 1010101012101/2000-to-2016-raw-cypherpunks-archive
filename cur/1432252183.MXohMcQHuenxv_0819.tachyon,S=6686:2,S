Actually, there's a curious legal precedent which might
help the satellite holders. One of the NASA probes (perhaps
the atmospheric probe to Jupiter? Did we have a Venus probe?)
had an instrument window made of diamond. The fairly large 
diamond used drew considerable import duty when it was 
brought into the US, but that duty was returned after the 
launch, since the diamond had been 're-exported'. This 
seems to my IANAL logic to set a precedent that an
asset in space is not in the US.

Actually, the USG doesn't give a damn whether it's in the
US, in another country , or neither. If they want to, they'll
tax it. Expatriate US citizens have to pay income tax on 
foreign earned income to the US (I think only the US, Egypt,
and the Phillipines do this). Even if you give up your US
citizenship, the IRS expects to tax you for a further 10 years
if your net worth is over $350k when you vacate your
US citizenship.

If you don't pay up, they might not be able to extradite 
you if you're now a foreigner, but they'll go after your 
assets in the US, or arrest you if you set foot on US soil.

(13 years as an expatriate leads to some specialized 
knowledge :-)
