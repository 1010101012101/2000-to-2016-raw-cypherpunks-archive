Care for a rat sandwich?
"...there is another Coulteresque pundit also in desperate need of 
accountability, to say nothing of restraint: Michelle Malkin. Malkin's 
syndicated column appears regularly in such newspapers as The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution, The Miami Herald, The Washington Times, The Houston 
Chronicle and The New York Post. She also shows up as a commentator on Fox 
News and has an editorialist background from The Los Angeles Daily News and 
The Seattle Times. Unlike Coulter's unadulterated spinning, Malkin's 
columns commonly draw upon at least some interviewing and investigation. 
But this reportage does very little to temper the extreme language and ad 
hominem rhetorical abuse characteristic of her finished product.
One of Malkin's favored -- and most irresponsible -- rhetorical techniques 
is a time honored one: guilt by association. And she adds her own unique 
flavor to this device: The associations made in her columns are frequently 
of her own idiosyncratic creation and not necessarily existent in real 
life." MORE ON
