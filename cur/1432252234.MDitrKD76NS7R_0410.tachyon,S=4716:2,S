No argument here.  That's absolutely true.  All I'm saying is 
that I'd rather be subject to theft (at predictable times and 
in predictable amounts) rather than invasion and monitoring.  
It's not that one is good; it's just slightly less annoying, 
inconvenient, and evil.

The real solution, of course, is open-content music.

They shouldn't be.  Now, do you *really* want the infrastructure 
in place that would permit tax collectors to distinguish between 
those who are and those who aren't?  Didn't think so.

>Should paper be taxed so as to support writers?

Interesting analogy.  I hope someone uses it in court.

Get real.  If they put snooping software in windows, it will be 
accepted as "normal" within a few years, and the leap is short 
from there to "legal requirement".   I don't want the "legal 
requirement", and I'm willing to pay money (extortion money if 
you think about it, but what the hell, that's nothing new where 
governments are involved) to avoid it.

Yep.  No argument there; all that means is that in the fight to 
keep snooping software out of operating systems, political greed 
is one of the weapons that's on our side.  What's your point?
