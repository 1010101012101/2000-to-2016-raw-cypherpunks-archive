>German federal law (http://www.iid.de/rahmen/iukdgebt.html). In the U.S., 
>since the Federalist Papers were published with effectively "absolute" 
>pseudonymity, surely the framers of the U.S. Constitution had them in mind 
>when crafting the Bill of Rights. Justice Thomas lists more 
>contemporaneous examples in his McIntyre concurrence 
>(http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-986.ZC1.html). Saying 
>anonymous technologies are indefensible concedes a crucial point: that the 
>government's power is so sweeping that police have the right to learn our 
>identity in all cases. So much for whistleblowing and anonymous reports of 
>public brutality.

>Perhaps more to the point, the twin privacy-encroaching technologies of 
>automated electronic surveillance and efficient large-scale databases did 
>not exist decades or centuries ago. "Absolute" anonymity lets us reclaim 
>some of that lost zone of privacy. Lastly, trying to remove "absolute" 
>anonymity from the Internet (banning strong encryption and computers that 
>can be programmed not to keep logs) would be far more disruptive, 
>destructive, and harmful than proposals like Hollings' CBDTPA that Larry 
>has rightly opposed. --Declan]
