'geodesic' means the shortest possible path, with respect to the geometry
of the 'space', between two points.

Fractal simply means non-integer dimension.

Computer networks, at least copper or fiber based, can't be fractal. The
traffic patterns can have fractal patterns (e.g. Foucault Dust
periodicity) but that isn't the same thing at all.

'fractal geodesic network' is spin doctor bullshit.

And the Internet is most certainly NOT(!) geodesic with respect to packet
paths.
