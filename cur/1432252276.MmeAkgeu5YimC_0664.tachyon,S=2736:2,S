Is there any RF sigint at all done at the Utah site? It could
all well be just a big crunch and storage facility. It would
help if we had a good fiber map of the general area.

I suspect that the NSA is doing a lot of decentral signal
prefiltering and processing at the network edge, and only uses 
large central facilities if they're unavoidable.
