"Within the NetCamo ( Network Camouflaging ) project, we study how to
prevent traffic analysis in mission-critical QoS-guaranteed networks."

Some of the people from this project gave a talk at the USENIX Security
works-in-progress session on "a quantitative analysis of anonymous
communications." Abstract is at:
http://www.usenix.org/events/sec01/mcdaniel_wip.html

Anyone else taken a look at these people?
