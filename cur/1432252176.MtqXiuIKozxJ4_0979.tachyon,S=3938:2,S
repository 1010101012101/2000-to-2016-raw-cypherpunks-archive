The IRS is getting lazy but the Official Taxpatriates Page isn't.

The "Service" is late with the 3rd Quarter taxpatriates list but our page 
continues to improve anyway.  Apparently The IRS' International District 
which has issued the taxpats list ever since it began, has been reorganized 
out of existence.  Its functions have been transferred to the Philadelphia 
Service Center and the famous Doug Rogers who has signed every list issued 
so far has been given new responsibilities.  We wait with baited breath for 
the 3rd Quarter list so we can find out who's in charge these days.

Meanwhile, we've added some more articles on taxpatriation

http://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0616/5912016a.html
http://www.frissell.com/taxpat/Whatabout.htm

and added JFile and MobileDB databases of taxpatriates for those who use 
Palm devices.  (These databases have also been contributed to the Memoware 
site: http://www.memoware.com/cgi-bin/mwsearch.cgi?Any=taxpatriate.)

Question for the taxpatriates who read this list (we know you're out 
there).  Have you filled out IRS form 8854 
http://ftp.fedworld.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8854.pdf and ratted out your income 
and assets at the time of expatriation? If your income is more than $110K 
per year or your net worth is more than $500K, you are assumed to have 
expatriated to avoid taxes.

As always, the Official Taxpatriates Page can be found at:
