Pretty close to what Newsweek ( http://www.msnbc.com/news/639937.asp  )
is now saying:

" NEWSWEEK has learned that the FBI is aggressively trying to locate a
summer intern from nearby Florida Atlantic University in connection with
the investigation. The intern, who sources said came from a Middle
Eastern country, had sent an e-mail to all employees that a top American
Media official described as peculiar. The email thanked company
employees for the help he gave them, but then contained language
suggesting that he wasnt saying goodbye."

MSNBC is reporting on the air that the anthrax was mailed and may have
been mailed to  other newspapers as well. (Howard Fineman is being
interviewed on the Chris Matthews show.)
