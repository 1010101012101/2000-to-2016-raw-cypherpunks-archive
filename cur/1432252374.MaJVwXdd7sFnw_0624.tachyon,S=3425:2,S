                The Big Five accounting firm said in a statement that
                in recent months, electronic files and other documents
                related to its auditing of Enron had been destroyed or
                deleted.

                Chicago-based Andersen said its company policy
                "required in certain circumstances the destruction of
                certain types of documents."

                However, the firm said, millions of documents related
                to Enron still exist, and it has managed to retrieve
                some of the deleted electronic files. Andersen said it
                is continuing retrieval efforts through electronic
backup
                files, "and is continuing in its efforts to fully learn
and
                understand all the facts related to this issue."

......
Sounds like someone needed to store (and backup) their docs encrypted,
then lose the key..
