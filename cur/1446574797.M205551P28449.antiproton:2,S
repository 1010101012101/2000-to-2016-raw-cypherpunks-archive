Excellent development if the bill is enacted. Should shatter the complacency
of crypto advocates and foster other means and methods now getting
short shrift due to the faith in crypto hyping and marketing -- and tons of
excuses why crypto has not been as effective as foreordained, blame
users, blame implementation, blame standards committees, blame spies,
blame legislators, blame certificate authorities, blame hardware, blame
insiders and outsiders, blame amateurs, blame backdoors, blame
venal marketers who sold out to authorities, blame duat hatters working
both sides of the porous divide, blame open and closed source, the
pile of excuses grows exponentially as money is heaped onto the
fire for burning through faster and faster. NSA has at least 191 colleges
on the take for information assurance studies, with more joining daily
to get while the getting is good, sending graduates to corporations,
institutes, NGOs, hack world, leak world, defy authority world as
evidenced here in this sacred site of tipped gravestones to cipher
heroics.
