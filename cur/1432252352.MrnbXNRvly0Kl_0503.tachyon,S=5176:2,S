U.S.'s neighbors rap expanded border ID program

Fingerprinting and photographing at Canadian and Mexican crossings called
divisive
By DOUG STRUCK and KEVIN SULLIVAN
Washington Post

Andrea Schnekenburger pressed her two index fingers on a scanning pad at
the U.S. border, becoming one of the first travelers to submit such data to
a vast new bank of fingerprints and photographs that will be taken of
millions of people who cross land borders to enter the United States.


"At least they didn't use ink," said Schnekenburger, 42, a German resident
of Canada en route to a U.S. business appointment on Nov. 18. "It was
easier than I thought."

Three U.S. border crossings - one from Canada, at Port Huron, and two from
Mexico, at Laredo and Douglas, Ariz. - launched a program run by the
Department of Homeland Security to collect fingerprints and photographs at
U.S. borders. It will be expanded to the 50 busiest crossings by the end of
next month, U.S. officials said.

The requirements won't apply to U.S. or Canadian citizens or to travelers
under age 14 or over 79. There are exceptions for Mexicans with special
border-crossing cards known as laser visas, according to Homeland Security
officials.

Only 3 percent of an estimated 108 million people who enter the United
States at legal land checkpoints annually will be affected, they said,
while the program will increase security for the United States, catch
criminals and speed processing at the border by computerizing some
functions.

But groups in Canada and Mexico complain that the new process will collect
an Orwellian databank of personal information on law-abiding visitors, will
unfairly target racial groups, might slow the border-crossing process and
is unlikely to stop a terrorist from coming into the country.

Mexican critics say the program is another step toward making the borders
in America "a dividing line" and a sign of "distrust" of Mexicans. Canadian
critics say files created on thousands of their residents will
"criminalize" the border process.

Those crossing the bridge with no Canadian passport, like Schnekenburger,
are directed into a building where an agent takes digital photos of them
and scans their index fingers.

The system began operating at 130 airports and seaports in the United
States in January, and fingerprints and photos already are required as part
of the application for anyone needing a visa.

But this expansion to land crossings particularly affects the busy daily
commerce across the borders of the country's only contiguous neighbors.

Canadian passport holders and Mexicans who work in the United States and
have a laser visa card, which already carries the bearer's photo and
fingerprint, are now exempt from the program. U.S. officials have sent
mixed signals about whether the data collection eventually will include
everyone.

Critics in Canada say the exclusions mean the program unfairly targets an
estimated 1 million Canadian residents who are classified as "landed
immigrants" or permanent residents who have not obtained a Canadian
passport.

Critics also say the new process will exacerbate delays at the Mexican and
Canadian borders, which already have considerable daily shuttling of trucks
and workers.

"This program could turn what has traditionally been a bottleneck into a
complete blockage," said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a leading
international relations specialist in Mexico City. "This could be truly
terrible. The border, instead of being a connecting bridge, is becoming a
dividing line."
