White House gets tougher on data centers in new policy
The Data Center Optimization Initiative will supersede 2010 Federal Data Ce=
nter Consolidation Initiative, a foundational effort that led to the closur=
e of 1,900 data centers since 2010.

ata center inventory.=C2=A0
As set forth in the prior FDCCI=C2=A0policy, agencies must continue to redu=
ce data center inventory to "essential enterprise levels." The new policy d=
efines data centers as=C2=A0=E2=80=9Crooms with at least one server, provid=

Based on this definition, agencies must complete a review of their data cen=
ter inventory by Aug. 31.=C2=A0
Scott=C2=A0in a blog post=C2=A0touted the "enormous progress" the federal g=
overnment has made reducing its data center footprint since 2010.
"Agencies have closed over 1,900 data centers, reducing the real estate foo=
tprint of Federal data centers by more than 1.2 million square feet, and ma=
de significant strides toward optimizing existing data centers," he wrote. =
"These efforts have resulted in nearly $1 billion in savings and a Federal =
data center inventory that is more efficient, effective, and secure.=C2=A0"
The new policy cites the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act as a driving for=
ce, holding CIOs accountable for "implementing and measuring progress=C2=A0=
toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum."=C2=A0
Particularly, the DCOI=C2=A0holds=C2=A0CIOs to meet stringent goals around =
consolidation and optimization. In the next three years, agencies must clos=
e at least 25 percent of their tiered data centers =E2=80=94 centers with s=

tems and a backup generator =E2=80=94 and 60 percent of non-tiered data cen=
ters, which are smaller systems, like server rooms and nodes.=C2=A0
"This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of the overall=
 Federal data center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31% in the =
real estate footprint occupied by data centers Government-wide," Scott wrot=
e.
Likewise, the policy calls for agencies to reduce annual data center costs =
by at least 25 percent by fiscal year 2018, estimating a savings of $2.7 bi=
llion if achieved.=C2=A0
Agencies must also achieve optimization targets in five other areas, accord=
ing to Scott: "installation of energy metering to track power consumption; =
a power usage effectiveness (PUE) target to improve energy efficiency; virt=
ualization and server utilization metrics to ensure IT equipment is being u=
tilized efficiently; and a facility utilization metric to drive more effici=
ent use of space in Federal data centers.
To get there, OMB has called on the General Services Administration to prov=
ide a marketplace of shared services so that agencies of any size, with any=
 budget can strive for these goals.
GSA will provide a=C2=A0Data Center Infrastructure Management Tool Assessme=
nt to help agencies access tools "to monitor, measure, manage and/or contro=
l data center utilization and energy consumption of all IT-related equipmen=
t," and share other best practices to help agencies comply with the policy.
"The marketplace will ensure an even playing field for customers to learn a=
bout and negotiate services with providers," GSA Administrator Denise Turne=
r Roth said in a statement.
