Here's my link:

Dear Friend,
           Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is 
Brent Whinfield and I live in beautiful Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada. 

My 'Phone number is: (416) 287-2564

You will find the link to your page on my site at: 
http://www.cashflowvideo.com/gnutella.html

You might be wondering why I did this.

I want you to link to me. 
So I linked to you first.

It has been proven that reciprocal links increase web traffic 
substantially. This is a win-win opportunity!

Many search engines are now using the number of links in a 
website in their formula to rank the site. You see by 
getting more links to both your site and mine, we can together 
possibly achieve a higher position in the search engines. 

Of course this will greatly increase traffic to our individual 
websites.

So by linking to you, I've already initiated the process of
getting us higher rankings. 

Please let me know whether or not you think this is a good 
idea. 

Thank you!

May God bless you,
Brent Whinfield

P.S - Here is the link that I'm asking to be placed on your website:
