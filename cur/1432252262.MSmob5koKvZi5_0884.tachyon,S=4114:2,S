It's a technologically-enforced contract with a specific machine, not 
with a person, corporation, or other entity.

I wouldn't call this a "smart contract," as if it were something new, 
because processor ID and "per seat" software seats have been around for 
a long, long time. (Others have mentioned what Sun has had, and I will 
mention that the Symbolics Lisp Machines I worked with in the mid-80s 
had processor IDs on the motherboards which software licenses for 
expensive software (KEE, the Knowledge Engineering Environment, from 
Intellicorp) could and did check.

And if this infrastructure is mandated by government, it becomes a lot 
more than a variation on dongles.

"Put principle over greed"?! What makes you think this list is involved 
in Microsoft's scheme?
