I hope at this point the retractions by the Register have been well  
circulated. Just to make it absolutely clear, we have never and never  
will sell out a customer. This is simply shoddy reporting at its worst.

A blog first reported this months ago as "an anonymizer" which was then  
picked up as "The Anonymizer" in some articles, which then printed  
corrections. In fact the company involved was Surfola which is not  
connected to us in any way shape or form (and which I had never even  
heard of before this).

Months later the Register picked up on an old uncorrected version of  
the story and printed it without any fact checking at all. This is a  
shocking breach of editorial responsibility.

I would have hoped that my years of working on free open source privacy  
tools (such as Mixmaster) before founding Anonymizer would lend my  
reputation some weight, or at least give me the benefit of the doubt  
until the matter was clarified. I am deeply troubled to see death  
threats against my employees (and I would assume myself) without anyone  
taking the trouble to even ask us to comment.

It has always been easy to contact me directly, next time I hope  
someone will do so before assuming the worst.

	-Lance
