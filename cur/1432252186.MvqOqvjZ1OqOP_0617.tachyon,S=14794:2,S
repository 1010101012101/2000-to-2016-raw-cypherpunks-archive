"it is not that the body is inhabited by the soul, it's just the other
way around, it's that the body inhabits the soul, the soul is
inhabited by bodies- by many bodies. the soul is the sphere in which
we communicate, and our bodies are in this sphere, where we shared
this... cordless communication, by directing our information packages
on different wavelengths."


// leading model of orientation: architecture --> text, (since 15th c.)
// 1. geology, 2. parasites and real-estate, 3. electra complex, 4. circus

[highly recommended. profound understanding & observations,
conceptualization and awareness. philosophy of architecture...]

Keynote lecture by Elisabeth von Samsonow: The Plasticity of the Real
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGBzbHMf7iI

"architecture as cybernetic loop through geology;  architecture is parageology"

"people take the role of [the] Electra... who confronts a big problem
when her mother loses power. truly nothing is more disagreeable than a
weak person to depend on. one would get furious with that person. and
the {unknown} is more and more turned against the earth directly,
which makes it finally difficult to enjoy (architecture in the form
of) parageology. ...all the building, all the digging, and hollowing
out get more and more performed by rage and despair against the earth
and by complicity. ...this is the age of archi-heresy that marks a
period where the ontological tie between architecture and geology is
broken and dissimulated. archi-heresy is not operated against a
monotheistic god but against the earth. it is the dismissal of geology
as the principle of architecture when an open heresy - another earth -
is simulated, a pseudo-earth- offering space and arranging material."
(cartography replaces geology, gps orientation)"

"architecture... more of a gardening practice (and biology), than parageology."

"a large part of the built world, the environment of today, could have
been {mould} to the thick surface of the earth. the fetishizing of the
eye and the look made architecture an issue of vision but in fact it
is not. it is an issue of the whole body that is equipped by a proper
sense of space and matter." ... "instead of impressing the public with
pornographic forms and fancy structures, architecture must concentrate
on its geological mission. where else? now the strata of the earth are
completely irrelevant compared to the price per square meter of the
{superficials}, all future architecture will include mining and
geologic expedition as well as metallurgic and ecologic research- such
as finding out where the veins of water go as well as those of petrol,
and any other liquids and tissues and minerals and stones and soft
{earths}. this will be the {infernal-jective} operations of an
architecture that reconquers and finally integrates its proper
foundations."

Changing the conversation: Polymers disrupt bacterial communication
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-conversation-polymers-disrupt-bacterial.html

"As part of their research into the development of artificial cells
and programmable bacterial coatings, the team found that
polymers—long-chain molecules—that were able to arrange bacteria into
clustered communities were, surprisingly, encouraging these bacteria
to actively 'talk' to each other. This communication occurred by
quorum sensing (QS), a way in which bacteria signal to each other, and
coordinate response to environment. Quorum sensing also controls the
way in which bacteria release certain types of molecules—for example
as a defence mechanism or as tools for infection."


Better police surveillance technologies come with a cost, scholar says
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-police-surveillance-technologies-scholar.html

[quote]  "Much of the Supreme Court's previous treatment of police
surveillance has rested on the belief that individuals have no
expectation of privacy in public places, and that surveillance
technologies that merely improve the efficiency of police
investigations comport with the Fourth Amendment," he said. "While
officers must obtain a warrant before using some technologies, the
courts generally do not regulate efficiency-enhancing technologies."
Those assumptions have been workable in the past because of the
limited use and capability of efficiency-enhancing technologies. But
with the advent of automatic license plate readers and surveillance
cameras with biometric recognition, the efficiency of the surveillance
itself is becoming a constitutional issue, Rushin said.

"Since no one has a reasonable expectation of privacy when they're in
public, that means that a police officer can do whatever a normal
person can do without any kind of special approval," he said. "They
can observe your license plate and write it down on a piece of paper
and run it through a database. But now they could also use an
automatic reader to scan license plates in bulk – up to 1,800 license
plates per minute, in fact. That will invariably vacuum up enormous
amounts of data on innocent people, too.

"So you have technology that might replace the efforts of dozens, even
hundreds, of individual law enforcement officers." [endquote]


Physicists 'uncollapse' a partially collapsed qubit // reversible peek
http://phys.org/news/2013-11-physicists-uncollapse-partially-collapsed-qubit.html

"... the recovery method is not perfect. The probability of recovering
the qubit's state depends on how much it has collapsed, so that the
more collapsed the qubit is, the less likely it is to recover. A fully
collapsed qubit has zero probability of recovery.

Still, the recovery method could be very useful for overcoming one of
the biggest challenges in developing quantum systems: decoherence,
which results in the loss of a system's quantum properties."

--- crypto experiment corner ---

a potential realm of non-computer crypto could be realized in an arts
& crafts context and or writing and typography and signage. recently
saw a new style of LED sign for restaurants while random searching for
a standard LED scrolling display, seeing what is available today. and
a "LED lighted writing board" appeared, perhaps they are all over the
place and i've yet to encounter the ubiquity yet, though it has
potential for transformable writing via LED light.

the Amazon links here are to show a basic kit:

28"x20" Flashing Illuminated Erasable Neon
LED Writing Board Menu Sign with Control Button
http://www.amazon.com/Flashing-Illuminated-Erasable-Complete-Fluorescent/dp/B00D50GJHK

note: the different color markers are related to the colors of the LED
light, and via this property, some colored text could fade out while
other text remains, due to the color of the projected light. in other
words, an invisible ink or reverse-invisible ink effect could exist,
especially if typography were to have superposition of letters or
symbols that could retain coherence in partial states, or transform
their meaning given what colors are activated. (notice on this
example, the remote control is similar to the LED lightbulbs that
change colors, thus the concept need not be limited to the writing
board...)

Image® Flashing Illuminated LED Lighted Writing Board
7 Color Lights 28 Modes up to 28 Feet Remote Control Restaurant
http://www.amazon.com/Flashing-Illuminated-Restaurant-Specials-Promotions/dp/B009CEX796

so it would be an issue of what fluorescent marker colors are
available and what light colors are available, as to what the range or
number of phase changes could occur via this method. certainly
lighting engineers (forget their actual title) have used such effects
for animation and movement, though it could also be used for hiding
and revealed patterns, etc.

and this following url has examples of signage  with this
changing-color effect that influences the appearance of what is
written. (see right column animated signs)

LED Writing Boards With Various Lighting Effects
http://www.displays2go.com/C-4747/LED-Writing-Boards-With-Various-Lighting-Effects

now perhaps UV and IR wavelengths and blacklight would be needed
though if distance is taken into account, scale of glyphs or type,
the existing color range could also potentially have enough difference
to make some signs more predominant than others, this within a context
of intra-sign and infra-sign structuring. like having:  \/\  appear in
a given color, and then \ \ when the color changes to a particular
phase, if not also /\ and / using other hues.
