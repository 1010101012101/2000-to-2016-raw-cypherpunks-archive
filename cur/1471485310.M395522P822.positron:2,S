The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events."

Arguing about anthropogenic climate forcing is just fucking useless. The
latency is too great, and there are too many positive feedbacks. By the
time that impacts are undeniable enough to motivate substantial
reductions in CO2 emissions, it will be too late.
