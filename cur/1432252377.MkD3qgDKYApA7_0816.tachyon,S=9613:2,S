  At its 10th year edition, Financial Cryptography and Data Security
  (FC'06) is a well established and major international forum for
  research, advanced development, education, exploration, and debate
  regarding security in the context of finance and commerce. Kicking off
  this the 10th year festivities is our Keynote Address by the renowned
  cryptographer Ron Rivest.  One of the most influential figures in
  cryptography, Ron will review some of his past predictions and lessons
  learned over the last 10 years, and prognosticate directions for the
  next decade.  The conference will also feature an invited talk by
  Michael Froomkin, "Are We All Cypherpunks Yet?", about the current
  legal landscape of Financial Cryptography.

  Registration for Financial Cryptography 2006 is now open; details and
  online registration can be found at http://fc06.ifca.ai along with
  information about discounted hotel accommodation and travel.

  Financial Cryptography is organized by the International Financial
  Cryptography Association (IFCA). More information can be obtained from
  the IFCA web site at http://www.ifca.ai or by contacting the
  conference general chair, Patrick McDaniel, at mcdaniel@cse.psu.edu.
