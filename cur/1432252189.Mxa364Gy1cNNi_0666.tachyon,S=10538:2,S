So the question remains - can an outside controller send an app to
the TOR such that the app does not report its existance to the user?
Possibly not, but if the TCPA hardware allows the link, then Palladium
is off the hook for being part of "the evil empire", and the empire wins
anyway.

And as long as the user has control of the TOR, that's not a problem.
But with TCPA, does the user still control the TOR?

Basicly, MS's point of view is that Palladium is their baby, and they
need solutions to their problems.  TCPA is independent, if they can be
meshed, great (from MS's view), if they can't, so what!

So long as that holds, seems ok.  But what about a virus that loads
into the TOR and tells the TOR "don't tell anyone I'm here".  Seems like
that could be a problem.

then I hope they move slowly and carefully.  People don't trust
microsoft much.

This implies that anyone can write a TOR as part of their app???
Now I'm really confused!

I'll believe it when I see it :-)

OK, that's where TCPA becomes a problem.

Right on.  If you guys want people to trust palladium, you better get the
discussion out in the open in a hurry.  The level of confusion is now
high enough to sink it.

That would be good :-)

MS will need a "paradigm shift" in how they market things to get
that point across.  Good luck!

Patience, persistence, truth,
