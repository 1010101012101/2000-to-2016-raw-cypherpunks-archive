Dearest MapleLeafPharmacy,

For several years now I have been uusing your prescription services for all
of my
medications. I was purchasing from the buying USA drug store and paying a
small luck for my doctor recommendation.  Then I got smart and started
acquiring from your Canadian company. I didnt even require a doctor
direction to
purchase from you.  You have rescued me well over 10,750 dollar in the last
5 years.
Your assistance are quick, reliable, you offer more than 2K medical
treatment and
your quality is number one.  

Your delighted customer,
