Oh, you want to eliminate voting districts.  I apologize for not reading
your intentions into your earlier comments.

Are States "geopolitical distortions" as well?  Are countries?

If you're going to propose an alternate system, please clearly identify
1) the voting pool, and 2) what they're voting for.  If the pool is
voting for a party instead of individuals, how does a winning party pick
representatives?  Is that selection method fair?

There are many, many ways to conduct elections, and your proportional
representation system has serious problems of its own.  It
underrepresents regional interests, and doesn't guarantee a
geographically diverse set of representatives.  You could complain that
geography (and in general physical boundaries) isn't important, but
you'd be wrong IMO.
