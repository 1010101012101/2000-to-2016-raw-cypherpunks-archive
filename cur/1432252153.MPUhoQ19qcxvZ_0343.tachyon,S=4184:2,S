Secretive and conspiratorial organizations are exceptionally vulnerable to 
infiltration and takeover by other secretive conspiratorial groups.  This 
led to a peculiar situation among the numerous little trotskyist factions 
where each Trotskyite secret caucus contained an inner secret caucus 
controlled by yet another Trotskyite secret caucus hostile to the first 
secret caucus, and even though nothing much was at stake other than the 
official line to be upheld in pamphlets no one read, they invested huge 
energies in ever more complicated plots and counter plots, infiltrations 
and counter infiltrations.

It is entirely plausible that KGB has infiltrated Opus Dei, and Opus Dei 
has infiltrated the KGB, and both have probably infiltrated the CIA and 
FBI, who are also probably spying on each other.
