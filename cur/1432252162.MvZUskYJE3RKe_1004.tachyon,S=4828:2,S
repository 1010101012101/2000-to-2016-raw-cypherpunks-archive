That's generally true of biometrics.  Unless taking the measurement is so 
intrusive it's obvious when it's taken (e.g., maybe the geometry of your 
sinus cavities or some such thing that requires a CAT scan to measure 
properly), there's no secret.  People constantly seem to get themselves in 
trouble trying to use biometrics in a system as though they were secret.

The best you can usually do is to make it moderately expensive and 
difficult to actually copy the biometric in a way that will fool the 
reader.  But this is really hard.  In fact, making special-purpose devices 
that are hard to copy or imitate is pretty difficult.  It seems enormously 
harder to find a hard-to-copy, easy-to-use "token" that just happens to 
come free with a normal human body.

I think the best way to think about any biometric is as a very cheap, 
moderately hard to copy identification token.  Think of it like a good ID 
card that just happens to be very hard to misplace or lend to your friends.
