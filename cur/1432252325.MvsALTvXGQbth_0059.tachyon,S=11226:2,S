True, but even the most casual perusal of the archive suggests you've got
plenty of them.

I bet a person could really learn a lot by spending some quality time
with Google, taking careful notes on the differences between posts you ignore,
ones you're content to dismiss with frosty condescension, what really seems to
bother the hell out of you, ones that should bother the hell out of you but you
choose to  ignore, etc. etc. It's a wonder someone hasn't pulled a number on
you already. Sometimes I wonder about "Agent Farr" though.

Of course.  As long as you aren't getting jerked around, more power to you.

Why talk about it though? The sheer satisfaction of imagining feds and sheeple
crapping their pants in fearful anticipation? Even if nothing happened at all,
you have to realize unsympathetic people who aren't in on your peculiar brand
of humor are going to take things like this at face value and hold it against 
you. You risk getting slapped around with the anti-paramilitary training 
statutes whether you're kidding or not. Odds are you don't care one way or the
other, but it seemed unnecessarily reckless, that's all. For your own sake.

- From the "Allegiance to the US" section of the handbook on reasons for denying
clearance:

http://www.dss.mil/training/adr/alleg/allegF.htm

Laws Regarding Private Militias

Federal law prohibits paramilitary training and the manufacture or transport of
weapons with the knowledge or intent that they will be used to create a civil 
disturbance. (Ref 10) Federal law differs from most state laws prohibiting
paramilitary training in that it applies only to the trainers, not the
trainees. Under most state laws governing paramilitary training, participation 
as a trainee is also illegal.

Laws are on the books in 41 states to ban either the militias themselves or
paramilitary training or both. (Ref 11)

The two types of laws operate differently. Anti-paramilitary training laws ban
groups whose members know or intend that a civil disorder will result from 
their activities. Anti-militia laws ban all unauthorized militias, regardless 
of whether the participants have any specific criminal intent or knowledge. 
Anti-militia laws generally require evidence that a group of people are
associated together in a formal military-type organization. Anti-paramilitary
training statutes, by contrast, can be used against groups as small as two or
three people. Both types of laws generally exempt organizations like hunting
clubs.

These laws are seldom enforced, but they are relevant to an adjudicative
determination that an individual is engaging in either lawful or unlawful 
militia activities.

Oh, but it's not just my fevered mind in particular. See "Association With
Certain Extremist Organizations or Groups" as a reason to deny security
clearance in the above handbook. The list might not be a group now, but once
you get branded as having conducted illegal paramilitary training for whatever
reason--joke or not--the sad fact is you certainly will be.

Guilt by association with a thoughtcrime, of course.
