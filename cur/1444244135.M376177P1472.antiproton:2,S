Speaking of Ellsberg, there's more to the man's backstory than most of you  
were probably aware of, listen to this fantastic interview with Douglas  
Valentine for the juicy bits. [1]

"Interview 709 – Douglas Valentine on Ellsberg and the CIA
Corbett • 07/17/2013

Today we’re joined once again by author and researcher Douglas Valentine  
of DouglasValentine.com to talk about his article “Will the Real Daniel  
Ellsberg Please Stand Up?” We discuss his little-known experience as a  
Pentagon observer to the CIA’s Revolutionary Development (RD) Program in  
South Vietnam from 1965 to 1967, the cast of disreputable CIA officers,  
drug runners and murderers that he was involved with there, and the  
accusation that the CIA ordered him to release the Pentagon Papers to take  
pressure off of investigations that were looking into the role of the  
agency in Vietnam at that time. We also explore why the establishment left  
refuses to examine this aspect of Ellsberg’s famed whistleblowing story."
