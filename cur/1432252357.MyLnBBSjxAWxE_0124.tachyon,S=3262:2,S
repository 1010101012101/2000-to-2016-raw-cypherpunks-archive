>From a press release today:

---

Adobe Systems Incorporated and the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation today jointly recommend the release of Russian 
programmer Dmitry Sklyarov from federal custody.

Adobe is also withdrawing its support for the criminal
complaint against Dmitry Sklyarov.

"We strongly support the DMCA and the enforcement of
copyright protection of digital content," said Colleen
Pouliot, Senior Vice President and General Counsel for
Adobe. "However, the prosecution of this individual in
this particular case is not conducive to the best
interests of any of the parties involved or the
industry. ElcomSoft's Advanced eBook Processor
software is no longer available in the United States,
and from that perspective the DMCA worked. Adobe will
continue to protect its copyright interests and those
of its customers."
