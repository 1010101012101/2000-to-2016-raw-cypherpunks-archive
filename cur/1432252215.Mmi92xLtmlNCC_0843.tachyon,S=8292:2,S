If you read the language carefully, you will see that 1201g only 
permits *circumvention* as part of cryptographic research (and then 
only under limited circumstances). There is nothing in the law that 
allows publication of results.

Even the recent Shamir, et. al. paper on RC4 and WEP could arguably 
violate DMCA. WEP could be considered a TPM since it protects 
copyrighted works (e.g. e-mail). More importantly RC4 could be used 
in some other copy protection system that we don't know about -- it's 
use might even be a trade secret.  There is simply no way to 
guarantee that a given cryptoanalytic result doesn't compromise some 
TPM. Even software that breaks Ceaser ciphers could be actionable. 
DCMA is *that* bad.
