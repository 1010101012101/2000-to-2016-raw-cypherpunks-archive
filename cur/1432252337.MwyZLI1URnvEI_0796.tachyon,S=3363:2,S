I found a stainless steel locking pliers multi-tool behind my ice chest 
on my deck. Someone probably used it at the party as a bottle opener 
and forgot it was there. Perhaps it was left on the lid of the ice 
chest and it rolled off in the semi-darkness when someone else opened 
the lid.

It's one of the models made by one of these vendors: Leatherman, SOG, 
Gerber, Buck, etc.

Describe the brand and/or how it operates, opens, etc. and I'll hold it 
for you or make other arrangements for you to get it back.

Comment on the meeting,/party: I counted about 50 people at one time or 
another, peaking at about 40 during the late afternoon indoor session. 
A lot of people I'd never met, nor heard of. (If someone lost the 
multi-tool and doesn't read Cypherpunks, oh well, think of it as 
Darwin's blade, now mine.)

Thanks to all for making for such a great meeting and later party!
