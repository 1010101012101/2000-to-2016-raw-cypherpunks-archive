So here's the 'obvious' question:

How fast can dedicated hardware run if it were a dedicated Stegedetect 
processor?

In other words, how easy would it be for NSA, et al to scan 'every' photo on 
the internet for Stego traces? (And then, every photo being emailed?)

And then, how fast can someone write a worm that will make every photo 
stored on a harddrive look like it's been stegoed?
