deadSwap: A Game Of Cloak And Data

deadSwap is an offline file sharing system where participants covertly pass a
USB stick from one to another. The route of the USB memory stick and the
identity of the other participants is not known by the users but controlled
by local, independently operated SMS gateways that are kept as a carefully
shared secret by their users.  Overview

deadSwap is a social experiment exploring the possibilities of creating an
entirely off-line file-sharing and communications platform where people pass
a USB memory stick from one to another.

The coordination of the passing-on of the stick is done through an anonymous
SMS gateway, meaning that the system does not require Internet availability
and also that, with certain precautions, it can be a very private system that
is quite difficult to monitor.  How To Participate In An Existing deadSwap
Network

To participate in a deadSwap network you only need to send a request to the
respective SMS Gateway. The person who has stick at that moment gets the
request and contacts you with the rendezvous information for the delivery.

When you have the stick, you will eventually get a request SMS, which you
have to answer with the rendezvous information for the next transfer. All
SMS's will be send through the gateway. No participant will have the phone
number of another.

Please see the Secret Agent's Handbook for more details.
