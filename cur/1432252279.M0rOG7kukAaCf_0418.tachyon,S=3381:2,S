Home schooling remains legal in KKKalifornia despite occasional attempts by 
school districts to suppress it.  If you do real home schooling where you 
neglect to register your home school with the geheime stadt polezei you are 
very unlikely to even come to the attention of the authorities much less 
have any trouble with them.

Most of the "Department of Children's Services" seizures of kiddies that 
are fodder for Net libertarians and right wing nuts would not have occurred 
had the little nipper's parents not handed them over to the educational 
authorities in the first place.  Since sending one's kids to slave schools 
is the world's most common form of child abuse, the fact that families are 
"punished" for it by having their kids drugged, lobotomized, and 
(occasionally) seized is not as troubling as it would be had they not 
decided to damage their kids themselves by entrusting their brains to the 
government.

No government school = no files = no starting point for oppression of 
children by the authorities.

Some years ago, my daughter was asked by a woman in a shop why she wasn't 
in school.  She gave the answer I had previously suggested, half in 
jest.  "My daddy doesn't believe in your schools.  He says they're 
controlled by the communists."  Further deponent sayeth not.
