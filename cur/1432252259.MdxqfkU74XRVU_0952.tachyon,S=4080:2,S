Thanks dumbo for saving me the work and proving that companies will not 
survive the state very long when crypto-anarchy comes.I never claimed to be 
an *informed poster* btw, just an anarchist with an interest in crypto.I 
quoted RSA math in a recent post to so your wrong there as well.With all 
this chest thumping and loud farting,I notice you dont deny being a low 
snitch who deserves necklacing.
