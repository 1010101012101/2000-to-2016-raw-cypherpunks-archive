I havent read Kaspersky's report but the general argument is supportable.
The hardware on which the high speed internet runs is increasingly concentrated
under fewer owners.  How many internet access providers exist where you live
and do they significantly differ in Terms of Service, i.e. friendly to privacy?
Google alone now carries from 6 to 10% of all the traffic.
viz. http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/10/youtube-bandwidth/

The laws governing (or attempting to) what is allowed on the internet
are also swinging in favour of more control and traceability.  
Indeed, if the ACTA currently being negotiated is implemented,
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/leaked-acta-internet-provisions-three-strikes-and-
Tor could well become illegal, (a) because it can be used to circumvent
restriction of copyrighted content by country and (b) because you can use it
to hide identity while filesharing (even though we discourage that).
EFF and friends succeeded in repealing some PATRIOT act insanity,
but national insecurity and corporate greed continue to infect
all areas of law and social reality including the internet.

Anyway, there is a volunteer project which may help Tor work 
on the kind of grassroots internet you describe:
