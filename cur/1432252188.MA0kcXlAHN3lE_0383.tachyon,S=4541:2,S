Well I think its fair to denigrate it as obfuscation not encryption if the
key lives on the same machine as the ciphertext.  At best it makes it less
risky to dispose of dodgy disks - now and then such things turn up on ebay
with client data.  At least if you encrypt it properly, and do NOT put the
key on the disk, then you can safely toss them in a dumpster, not physically
destroy them etc.
