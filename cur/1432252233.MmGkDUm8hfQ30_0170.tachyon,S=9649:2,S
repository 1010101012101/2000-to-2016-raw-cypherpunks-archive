WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared=
 that

terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his

heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.



Cheney has a history of heart trouble, suffering the first of five heart

attacks at age 37. He underwent a heart transplant last year at age 71.



In an interview with CBS=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9D60 Minutes,=E2=80=9D Cheney says=
 doctors replaced an

implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007. The device can detect

irregular heartbeats and control them with electrical jolts.



Cheney says that he and his doctor, cardiologist Jonathan Reiner, turned off

the device=E2=80=99s wireless function in case a terrorist tried to send hi=
s heart a

fatal shock.



Years later, Cheney watched an episode of the Showtime series =E2=80=9CHome=
land=E2=80=9D in

which such a scenario was part of the plot.



=E2=80=9CI found it credible,=E2=80=9D Cheney tells =E2=80=9C60 Minutes=E2=

Sunday. =E2=80=9CI know from the experience we had, and the necessity for=

my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.=E2=
=80=9D



Cheney and Reiner are promoting a book they co-authored, =E2=80=9CHeart: An=
 American

Medical Odyssey.=E2=80=9D



In the =E2=80=9C60 Minutes=E2=80=9D interview, Reiner says he worried that=
 Cheney couldn=E2=80=99t

stand the pressure that came on Sept. 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked

the U.S. Medical tests seen that morning showed Cheney had elevated levels=
 of

potassium in his blood, a condition called hyperkalemia, which could lead=
 to

abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest.



Reiner says he watched news coverage of the day=E2=80=99s events on televis=
ion and

thought, =E2=80=9COh, great, the vice president is going to die tonight from

hyperkalemia.=E2=80=9D
