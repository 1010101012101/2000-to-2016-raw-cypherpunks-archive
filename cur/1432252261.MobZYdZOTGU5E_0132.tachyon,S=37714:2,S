1. EDPS endorses data breach notification provision in ePrivacy Directive
============================================================

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has issued his opinion on the
new draft text of the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications
(ePrivacy Directive) as proposed by the European Commission.

One of the important changes supported by the EDPS with the new text is the
creation of a mandatory security breach notification system. The system
should require the Telecoms and ISPs to notify their customers when personal
information has been lost. But Peter Hustinx wants to go further and asked
for the system to apply not only to "providers of public electronic
communication services in public networks but also to other actors,
especially to providers of information society services which process
sensitive personal data (e.g. online banks and insurers, on-line providers
on health services, etc.)."

EDPS has explained in his opinion that such a notification has clear
benefits: "it reinforces the accountability of organisations, is a factor
that drives companies to implement stringent security measures and it
permits the identification of the most reliable technologies towards
protecting information." and openly supported the concept, despite some
private sector opposition. "Indeed, the simple fact of having to publicly
notify security breaches causes organisations to implement stronger security
standards that protect personal information and prevent breaches."

Another important change backed by EDPS in the ePrivacy Directive is the
possibility given to legal persons to take action against those who infringe
spam provisions. Thus the ISPs, as well as consumer associations and trade
unions representing the interest of spammed consumers, may take legal action
on their behalf before courts. EDPS wanted to go further by proposing "class
actions, empowering groups of citizens to jointly use litigation in matters
concerning protection of personal data. In the case of spam, where a large
number of individuals are receiving spam, the potential exists for classes
of individuals to join together and launch class actions against spammers."

EDPS also asked to extend the possibility for the legal persons to ask for
damages for any infringement to any provision of the ePrivacy Directive.

Peter Hustinx considered that the Directive should therefore broaden its
scope of application to include providers of electronic communication
services also in mixed (private/public) and private networks and welcomed
the clarification regarding the inclusion of a number of RFID applications
in the scope of application of the Directive.

2. More Internet content blacklisted in Europe
============================================================

The European Ministers of Justice and Internal Affairs have agreed to make
publishing bomb-making instructions on the Internet a crime. The French
authorities are discussing making the publication on the Internet of any
alleged pro-anorexia information a crime.

Justice and interior ministers from the EU member states backed a proposal
from Commissioner Frattini to harmonise the normative acts that will make
the "public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment, and
training for terrorism" a crime. According to the statements of the EU
officials publishing these acts on the Internet completed the European
legislation in this domain. They described the Internet as "a virtual
training camp for militants, used to inspire and mobilise local groups."
Gilles de Kerchove, the EU anti-terrorism co-ordinator, declared that there
are approx. 5 000 websites that are used to radicalise young people.

The plans triggered some criticism from free speech supporters that
considered the move could be misused by authorities. Recent news, cited by
UK Liberal Democrat MEP Sarah Ludford reports that: "UK police threatened
anti-China protestors at the display of the Olympic Torch with arrest under
anti-terror laws." Dick Marty, Chairman of the PACE Sub-Committee on Crime
Problems and Fight against Terrorism, questioned the Commission's proposal
on
incorporating the Council of Europe's Convention on terrorism which would
"establish the criminal offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist
offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. However, it
omits to include the convention's Article 12 safeguard clause in the
operative text of the framework decision. Mentioning fundamental human
rights only in the preamble or in a recital is not enough. The message,
outside as well as inside Europe, must be clear: anti-terrorist measures
must be conditional on respect for fundamental human rights."

Ben Hayes also explained in an article for Statewatch the potential problems
of the measure: "While the recurring publication of the 'Danish cartoons' of
the Prophet Mohammed continues to provoke anger in the Muslim world and a
defence of 'free speech' in the West, a proposed EU law on 'public
provocation' to terrorism could criminalise widely held political views -
but it has barely raised a murmur."

Another type of content is now on some French politicians' agenda as public
enemy number one: pro-anorexia websites. A draft law that makes
any kind of propaganda for products, objects or methods used for an
"excessive thinness" a crime was adopted by the National Assembly on 15
April 2008 and now it will pass to the Senate for consideration. The draft
law supported by the deputy Valirie Boyer foresees penalties with 2 years
imprisonment and 30 000 Euro as fines for publishing such information
online. The report drafted by the deputy accused the pro-anorexic websites
and the big number of blogs written by young people that are supporters for
this method of life, as being too easy to be accessed by the French youth.

3. Russian Government wants to control all WiFi devices
============================================================

On 14 April 2008, Fontanka.ru online newspaper reported that
Rossvyazokhrankultura, the Russian Mass Media, Communications and Cultural
Protection Service, intends to ask for the mandatory registration of all
WiFi devices, including personal home networks, notebook computers, mobile
telephones and PDAs.

Vladimir Karpov, the deputy director of the agency's communications
monitoring division, told the newspaper that wireless Internet users will
have to register any electronics using WiFi technology. The registration
could take as long as ten days for standard devices like PDAs and laptops
and the noncompliance may bring forth the confiscation of the respective
equipment. Users wanting to operate a wireless access point or a
WiFi-enabled home router must obtain a license which might need, in certain
areas, a special approval from the Federal Security Service.

While in most countries there is free and open access to WiFi networking
with certain limitations on the maximum signal strength of the
transmissions, the Russian agency's opinion might reverse previous decisions
of the Russian government. In 2004, the State panel for Radio Frequencies
gave open rights to a narrow band of spectrum for indoor wireless networks
and in July 2007, mobile wireless devices were excluded from the list of
electronics requiring registration.

Rossvyazokhrankultura, the author of this bureaucratic, unprofessional and
extremely unrealistic policy, was created in 2007 by the merger of the
Russian media and telecommunications regulatory bodies. "Similar conclusions
speak to the complete professional deterioration of a unified regulatory
agency. It is now engaged in all manner of fields - protecting cultural
riches, registering mass-media outlets, control of legal compliance on
personal data, monitoring communications, allocation of radio frequencies
and so on. The organization is led by a metallurgic engineer by background.
It is unlikely that he can simultaneously manage communications personnel,
fine art experts, journalists and attorneys" stated an anonymous industry
specialist.

4. Eurobarometers on data protection in EU
============================================================

According to a couple of Eurobarometer surveys on data protection, issued by
the European Commission on 17 April 2008, EU citizens have little faith in
the security of data transmission on the Internet.

Two surveys were conducted by Gallup in January 2008, investigating the
perceptions on data protection among EU citizens and data controllers
respectively. The surveys involved about 27000 EU citizens and 5000
companies from all 27 member states.

The findings of the surveys show that 82% of European Internet users have
little trust in personal data management on the Internet and 64% of EU
citizens are concerned about data protection issues feeling that the
awareness and information on these topics are not satisfactory enough. The
lack of information appeared to be a major problem. Especially the national
data protection authorities were rather unknown to most of the EU citizens.
Only 28% of respondents said they knew about such institutions existing in
their country.

Less than half of the respondents think data is properly protected in their
own countries and more than half of them considering the legislation cannot
cope with the increasing amount of exchanged personal information.

The surveys also reveal an increase in the awareness of the risks related to
potential abuses of private data, proportional to the increased use of
privacy protecting tools and technologies. Privacy-enhancing technologies
(PETs) that include automatic anonymisation after a certain lapse of time,
encryption tools and cookie-cutters, are better known by companies, more
than half of them using now such tools. The studies revealed that, although
increasing, the level of awareness it still relatively low among EU
citizens. More than two thirds of Internet users in some country (such as
Ireland or France) say they have never heard of PETs.

One of the topics covered by the studies was data monitoring. Citizens, as
well as data controllers, agree on the monitoring of passenger flight
details (82%), telephone calls (72%), Internet (75%) and credit card usage
(69%) to combat terrorism but only within well-defined limits. About a third
of the respondents believe only suspects should be monitored while about 20%
wanted even stricter safeguards.

Commenting on the results of the surveys, Commission Vice-President Jacques
Barrot, temporarily in charge of justice and home affairs, said: "It is our
intention to fully analyse and understand the feedback we have been given by
Europe's citizens in this survey and we will ensure these comments inform
the work we are doing in this area this year. I am convinced that this
survey will also be a salutary lesson for all stakeholders involved in
handling personal data and maintaining data protection".

5. Setback for IFPI in its case against PirateBay
============================================================

After the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) sued
the PirateBay at the end of March 2008 demanding 1.6 million euro in
damages as compensation for 24 albums, new elements have occurred forcing
IFPI to limit its demands.

The Stockholm District Court indicted the four PirateBay founders
(Svartholm Warg, Fredrik Neij, Peter Sunde, and Carl Lundstrvm) for breaking
copyright law. The fine to be paid by PirateBay was established according
to the number of times the 24 albums were downloaded. Moreover, the
companies demanded general compensation as no permission was given by the
copyright owners for the downloading. "The damages now being demanded are
based on the albums which the prosecutor has included in his indictment. The
injury to the record companies, the artists, and the copyright holders
caused by The PirateBay's illegal activity is many times greater," said
Lars Gustafsson, head of the Swedish chapter of IFPI.

"Their numbers are pure fantasy" said Svartholm Warg who claimed the figures
were based on multiplying the retail price for the album by the number of
times it was downloaded.

Now IFPI has had to apologize to Max Peezay (whose given name is Tom Piha),
a Swedish rap artist, for having included his album Discokommittin among the
albums selected at random for the indictment against The PirateBay, without
his permission. IFPI assumed that the rights to the album were owned by
music distributor Bonnier Amigo, and therefore has not asked Piha if he
wanted to be a party in the suit, while actually Piha owns the rights
himself. The artist explained that his main revenues came from concerts
rather than album sales and that free downloading was compensated by the
fact that he got more fans from people discovering his music on the
Internet.

As a result, IFPI reduced the level of compensation to be paid by PirateBay
by 12 000 euro. However, Piha had to suffer from the process finding himself
in the middle of this battle, being questioned by his fans and fellow
artists. "I wish I hadn't landed in this situation. I can see now how easy
it is to become a pawn in this game," said the artist who disagrees with
IFPI's approach.

The trial date has not yet been set and in the meantime more artists might
come forth in the support of PirateBay.

Another new element in this picture is the news that a Swedish policeman who
helped in the investigation against The PirateBay is now working for
Warners Brothers, a plaintiff in the pending court case. As reported by
newspaper Sydsvenskan, the police officer got his job several months after
the completion of the preliminary investigation and is now scheduled to
appear as a witness in the trial.

"The question is how long this was under consideration. If it was under
consideration at the time of the investigation then it is a scandal," said
Peter Althin, a lawyer defending the PirateBay founders who also added that
if it was found that the discussion between the police officer and Warner
Brothers started before the end of the investigation, which took a year and
a half, it was possible that the prosecution would have to forget about its
findings and start again.

6. Changes in the German copyright law
============================================================

The extension of the copyright law aimed at fighting illegal file-sharing
adopted on 11 April 2008 by the German Government creates concerns on how
the p2p-related lawsuits will be considered under the new law.

The new text forces the ISPs to reveal the names and IP addresses of the
file sharers. However, some lawyers warn that the procedure is limited by
conditions that could turn against the music industry in court procedings .

The present procedure is as follows: industry detectives report the IP
numbers of file sharers to the German police who traces the suspects and
prosecutes those who offer more than 1000 tracks.
However, the industry can demand the police files of all file sharers and
has already sued 16 000 of them for civil damages.

With the new law, the music industry fears it will no longer have access to
this police data and moreover, a prosecuted file-sharer will only have to
pay 100 euros instead of 1 000 or more as until now. The old bounties were
considered as unfair and irresponsible.

Other elements may be unfavourable to the record industry. The limitation to
"commercial-scale" file sharers in the new law prevents the industry from
catching the small illegal file sharers it has been tracking down lately.
The law also makes it more expensive for the industry which has now to
support the costs of the legal cases.

It is too early yet to decide whether the new law is really good news for
file sharers as there is no clear definition of the term "commercial level"
for which the 100 euro fine has to be paid in case of law infringement. At
this point, the privacy advocates as well as rights holders believe that the
interpretation of the law will be in the hands of the court.

7. France considering new rules for web 2.0
============================================================

A French Parliamentary report suggests a change in the law (LCEN) that
implements the European Directive on e-commerce in order to make clearer the
distinction between editing and hosting activities in the new applications
related to Web 2.0.

The report of the Deputy Jean Dionis du Sijour on the application of the
LCEN was updated on 16 April 2008, after the first version was submitted to
the Parliament on 23 January. The update concerns some of the latest court
decisions in France that established the responsibility of some websites for
others' RSS feeds or for user-generated content. The report specifies that
the law has created a hosting status that is different from that of an
editor and that "this distinction must not be emptied by the court
decisions."

The report also claims that the law needs to be changed in order to comply
with the new applications available, such as hosting collaboratives websites
or online auctions. This could be helpful in order to avoid the situation
already presented in EDRi-gram, when Paris Tribunal condemned 3 different
French websites for linking to another website containing gossip information
on a French actor.

But the report also suggests increasing the obligations on the hosting
companies, especially by making public the methods used to fight illegal
activities, that would prove their good will. This provision could be
enforced by an independent authority, like the French Data Protection
Authority (CNIL).

But the French Government does not seem to share this opinion. The new State
Secretary in charge with information society, Eric Besson, made clear in
the first public appearance that he didn't think that the law needed to be
changed. "I will not be the Minister of Internet castration" he declared in
a public meeting to Dailymotion, one of the biggest video-sharing French
websites.

Since Mr. Besson has an objective to present to the French Government by 31
July 2008 the new plan on information society, he may discuss also the
problems of the new type of applications on the Internet.

8. ENDitorial: Will France Introduce the Digital Guillotine in Europe?
============================================================

Ever since DADVSI, the French implementation of the European Copyright
Directive, Internet users in France have faced increasingly
disproportionate threats of punishment for claims of copyright
infringement. The latest scheme promoted by the content industry against
unauthorized sharing of music and films on Internet is called "flexible
response" or "three strikes, you're dead".

The principle is simple: repeated infringements result in getting cut
off from the Internet. A claimed copyright infringer is identified by
automated Internet traffic filtering and by a rightsholders'
denunciation. After a complaint to the ISP, a letter is sent warning the
alleged infringer that he might be being cut off from the Internet. In the
early versions of this scheme the punishing fines were to be sent out
automatically, but the fines were later replaced by the proposal to cut off
Internet access instead.

The proposal further includes the creation of an administrative authority
responsible for enforcement, making sure the disconnected Internet users are
not able to use the Internet again for a set period of time. The scheme is
unclear as to the possibility to appeal a mistaken claim or to whether a
punished Internet user can also be sued in a civil law suit. State
authorised software for securing Internet connections has been proposed as
one solution to uphold legal protection of innocent citizens.

Promoted by the French President Sarkozy, flexible response has become
known as the suggested main measure in the Olivennes report, which until
recently was generally thought to provide the basis for both French and
European legislation to come. But not so any more; a majority vote in the
European Parliament on the 10 April 2008 suggests otherwise.

In contrast to the French solution, the Swedish government has rejected
such a regime as disproportionate. The Swedish Ministers of Justice and
Culture concluded in March 2008 that ostracism from the Internet as
punishment in a society whose daily activities are increasingly
intertwined with the digitally networked environment is not proportional
to the infringement of copyright, especially without intention for
commercial gain. Its only justification, that of deterrence, has been
shown repeatedly to be ineffective. The Swedish Government has also
pointed out that large owners of media content should "not use the
copyright laws to defend old business models" but should do more to
provide attractive alternatives to unlicensed filesharing services.

In an effort to bring the Swedish Government's policy decision to the
European discussion, and to oppose Sarkozy's plans, MEP Christofer
Fjellner (EPP) initiated a cross partisan platform together with former
French Prime Minister MEP Michel Rocard (PSE) and MEP Guy Bono (PSE),
Rapporteur for the European Parliament's Report on Creative Industries.
Together they signed, with more than 90 MEPs supporting them, an
amendment to the report which effectively rejects flexible response:

"Calls on the Commission and the Member States to recognise that the
Internet is a vast platform for cultural expression, access to
knowledge, and democratic participation in European creativity,
bringing generations together through the information society; calls
on the Commission and the Member States, therefore, to avoid adopting
measures conflicting with civil liberties and human rights and with the
principles of proportionality, effectiveness and dissuasiveness, such as the
interruption of Internet access."

Following the tabling, the internal debate over the amendment intensified
and was complicated when the liberal group (ALDE) unexpectedly asked to
split the amendment into two parts and vote on them separately, presumably
to save flexible response. The first part related the Internet and the
importance of rights and proportionality had overwhelming support, while the
second part explicitly mentioning "interruption of Internet access" was
harder to support for many French MEPs who would not go against the explicit
will of their own government. However, with a close vote on the second part,
the amendment ended up being passed in its entirety.

In the aftermath of the European Parliament's decision, the French
Minister of Culture, Ms. Christine Albanel, has clearly announced her
intention to move on with the Olivennes proposal. She is currently
planning to put it to vote in the French Parliament before the summer.
Accordingly, to this date, there are no indications that Sarkozy's decision
to use the French Presidency to propagate this scheme at the European level
has been revised.

In Brussels it is also unclear whether the initiative by MEPs Fjellner,
Rocard and Bono will have an impact. Neither of them is listed as a
speaker or moderator at the next High Level Conference on Counterfeiting
and Piracy on the 13 May 2008, while MEPs who voted in favour of flexible
response are. It is a matter of public interest to ensure that there is a
balanced debate and that seats are reserved for politicians representing
the European Parliament's position on what otherwise risk to be a very
controversial conference.

In media and the political blogosphere the impact of the vote is increasing.
Of particular interest is the correlation between the Member States with a
well developed Internet infrastructure and the way their MEPs voted: the
digitally advanced Nordic countries have all clearly rejected the French
digital guillotine.

More than 250 million Europeans regularly use Internet, says Commission's
ICT Progress Report

More than half of Europeans are now regular Internet users, 80% of them have
broadband connections and 60% of public services in the EU are fully
available online. Two thirds of schools and half of doctors make use of fast
Internet connections, thanks to strong broadband growth in Europe. These are
the findings of a Commission report on the results achieved so far with
i2010, the EU's digital-led strategy for growth and jobs.
