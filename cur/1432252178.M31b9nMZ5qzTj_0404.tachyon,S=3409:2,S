Yet another cypherpunk idiocy, the idea that the government is scurrying
about trying to get information on cryptography out of libraries.  A
good example of the narrow focus and lack of reasoning on the part of
cypherpunks.

The government is trying to make it harder to get sensitive information
related to infrastructure vulnerabilities.  It has no interest in
suppressing information on a widely used technology like crypto.
You might as well predict that they will pull all the books about the
internet off library shelves in order to try to improve network security.

And by the way, Marc de Piolenc, what happened to your assignment about
using Chaumian credentials to improve air travel security?  You were
given the favor of pointers to Chaum's papers; you were expected to
provide something back in return, quid pro quo.  Why don't you work on
that instead of inflicting unfounded opinions on the group?
