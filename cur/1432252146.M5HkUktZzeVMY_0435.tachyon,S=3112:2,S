He moderates it.  His choice.  Single point of failure, regrettable.

Amusing!  Because he keeps cryptography@ politics free, for the most
part.  Which seems to be why some knowledgable people post there
and do not bother with this group.  Specialization is fine.  I find it
useful
that both tech and techsocially clueful folks post here.

A problem with editors in a free market?   That's a bit
reflexively-anarchic, no?   One man's "chafing" is another's
"straying off topic" I guess.

Reputation/editing is useful for keeping S/N high, not that one can't
invest
personally (eg in kill files) to do this.

The distributed-CP remailing architecture is interesting, and enforces
an
anarchic (editor-free) forum, which is a good thing, but as a result has
a
S/N that deters some folks who are worth listening to, who do post
in the other, moderated forum.
