The colonization of everyday life
"...a clause was smuggled into a security patch in June.
On the other hand, users already consent to similar conditions whenever 
they use the Windows Update facility - and few complain.
The change needn't apply to corporate users. Microsoft recently introduced 
Software Update Services, which allows managed upgrades across the Intranet 
to users with Active Directory. (So you don't have thousands of desktops 
hitting Microsoft servers at once).
We've asked Microsoft if this was a legal or a technical decision, and what 
was behind the decision to make installation of the service packs 
conditional on this clause. We await their reply.
