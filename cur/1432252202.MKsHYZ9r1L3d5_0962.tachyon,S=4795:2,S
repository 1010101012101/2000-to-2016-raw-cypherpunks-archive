So don't use their tools.   Don't abuse the law against the maker
of a tool which can be used improperly.  It is simply
wrong to blame a gun or drill or code maker because some evildoer
(virus propogator) used the tool against you.

Let me guess: the State gets to decide how many bugs per line of code?

You mean decisions that don't fit *your* fancy.

You don't understand the convenience vs. security tradeoff too well.
Or the importance of convenience to sales.

Not even mentioning the tendency of the patches
>(and following patches to patches) to break something else.

And this doesn't happen with other OSes?  Please.  And every
version of *nix has always shipped with everything off, maximally
locked down?  Right.

[Tech: Since when have MS SSL bugs had *anything* to do with worms and
virii?
And does MS even support SSH? ]

There have been plenty of security and overflow bugs in Open* security
apps.

Yawn.

Your bias is turning you into something dark.  I sort of expected
this reaction, since I was defending MS's right to exist.
But if MS is treated this way, so is Joe Coder.

Caveat emptor.  Some folks buy cars with no airbags; others buy
cars with a dozen.   Should everyone be forced to buy the safest
car (as defined by the State, of course).

If Marcy clicks on attachments, runs mail clients
that run embedded scripts, basically spreads her legs and
lets everyone in, how is this different from someone who
rolls their SUV because they were clueless as to physics?

Au contraire, I'm sure someone who asserts class-action status is
interested in hearing
from the public she is so kindly protecting.

Its a real shame when (albeit deserved) MS-hostility/contempt biasses
folks into
immorality or irrationality.  Its like blaming the authors of the SMTP
RFC for
spam.
