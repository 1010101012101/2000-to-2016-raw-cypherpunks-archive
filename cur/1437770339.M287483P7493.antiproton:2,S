Without getting into the issue of whether patents encourage innovation.. 
I do think that medical devices are a special case. If you have a heart 
implant, that thing needs to be "unhackable", but also totally 
verifiably safe. So there should be firmware signing, no mutable state, 
verifiable memory safety...but the code should be open source, and if 
need be the firmware signing key for each device (needs to be different 
for each device!) should be accessible by a legitimate owner.

So, no more remote-hackable heart implants, but doctors and cardiac 
technicians can still apply critical patches and inspect the source for 
sanity.
