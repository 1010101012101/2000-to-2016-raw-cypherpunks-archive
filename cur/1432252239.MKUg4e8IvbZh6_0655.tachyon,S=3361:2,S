Well, just a few hours ago, actually [for certain values of the word
'terrorism'.]

A gunman has gone on the rampage in a regional parliament 
in Switzerland, killing at least 14 people. 

Several others are said to have been injured by the man, who 
was disguised as a policeman, when he opened fire during a
session of the assembly. 

The incident took place at the regional parliament building in
the canton of Zug in central Switzerland, 25 km (16 miles) 
south of Zurich, at 1030 (0830GMT) on
Thursday morning. 

Police say the man also detonated an explosive device.  

[...]
There are unconfirmed reports that while he
was shooting, the man demanded that an
appeal he had recently filed be reviewed by
parliament. 
[...]
Swiss radio said the attacker had left
behind a letter in which he spoke of a "day of
rage against the Zug mafia".
