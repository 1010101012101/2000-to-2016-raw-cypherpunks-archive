Huh? 

A couple of years ago I was driving through Lancaster county , Pennsylvania
(ground zero for the Amish in the US). There were plenty of Amish houses on
the edge of towns, which most conspicuously did *not* have the power, phone,
and cable hookups which the 'English' houses did.  Can't speak for water or
sewage, which would be underground.

These were not isolated farmhouses, but otherwise 'normal' looking suburban
tract homes, I'd guess not more that 10-15 years old.
