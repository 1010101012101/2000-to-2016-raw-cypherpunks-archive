	Not exactly. I am well aware that the chinese oligarchs are in
	bed with western oligarchs to...various extents. 

	I said it would be a good thing if russia/china opposed the US,
	but it's not something that's happening to any serious degree,
	I'd say.

	Which means that the working chinese have been forced by their
	own government to finance the americunt-wall-street financial
	mafia. Good for goldman-sachs. Bad for Mr. Li.

	Governments 'lending' money to themselves, which seems pretty
	absurd, simply means that they keep printing billions out of
	thin air.  Need money? Just print it! Isn't socialized banking 
	amazing.

	Yeah, all creditors are equal, but some creditors are more
	equal than others. Some creditors are going to lose more than
	others...

	Stealing from the biggest thieves on the world? =)
