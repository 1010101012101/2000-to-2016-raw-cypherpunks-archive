 Ashcroft Says Those Questioning Administration's Anti-Terror Plan Could
                            Be Aiding Enemy
                 By Karen GulloAssociated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General John Ashcroft said trying Taliban
members in open U.S. court could create "Osama TV." He defended military
tribunals for terrorists and suggested that anyone who criticized them
was aiding the enemy.

Our legal powers are targeted at terrorists," he told the committee. "To
those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my
message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our
national unity and diminish our resolve."

White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday that criticism can
hurt the anti-terrorism fight if it
undermines anti-terrorism legislation pushed by the administration.

"The attorney general's implication is clear. If you do not march in
lock step with the government, you are supporting the terrorists," the
Center for National Security Studies said in a statement.
