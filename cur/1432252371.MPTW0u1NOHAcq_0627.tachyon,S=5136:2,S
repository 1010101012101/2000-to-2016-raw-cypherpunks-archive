It would be simpler, and probably fairer (in a general sense) to discard
those ballots that are suspect. Elections such as this should not be
re-run.

Take it down to its most general form. Gore and Bush are tied. My
ballot was mangled during processing and is unreadable; I successfully
sue for a rerun of the election, just for my ballot alone.  Is this a
good thing?
