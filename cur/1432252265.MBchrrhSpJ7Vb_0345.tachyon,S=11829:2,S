Expert Warns Al Qaeda Planning Major Biological Attack

By Ed Offley

It is becoming clearer by the day that a month after the Sept. 11 aircraft
hijackings, a biological warfare attack is being launched against the United
States by as-yet unknown terrorists. The discovery of anthrax in letters mailed
to the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, NBC and ABC, following an
initial exposure at American Media International in Florida, betrays a cunning
and carefully organized intent-- particularly with the discovery that the
anthrax mailed to Daschles office has been found to be "weapons grade"
material that could indeed kill hundreds if not thousands of people if released
in a significant airborne plume.

Is this new phase terrorism merely a crude and ineffective ploy, or the
harbinger of even more serious danger to the nation? Nuclear physicist Robert
Koontz, who has researched and tracked the al Qaeda terrorist network for
several years, is warning that he has discovered evidence on the Internet that
Osama bin Laden may be planning a much larger biological warfare campaign--
using more than one form of germ agent-- and is using "coded" illustrations to
signal and direct additional sleeper agents purportedly already armed with
biological weapons.

Dr. Koontz has posted the coded paintings and other evidence at the following
website:

http://www.bringmenews.com/Messages/National_Security/Alerts/Alert_003.htm

Dr. Koontz revealed this disturbing information in an interview with
DefenseWatch, on Tuesday after what he described as a frustrating inability to
persuade federal officials to take the information seriously. The interview
transcript is reproduced in full below.

Interview with Dr. Robert Koontz

DefenseWatch: How did you first become aware of the art?

Let me begin by saying that I was following cyber-tracks of Ahmed Alghamdi, one
of the lesser known terrorists aboard flight No. 175 that crashed into the
South Tower of the World Trade Center.

In doing this detective work, I came across Alghamdis name posted on a fan
club that was started by a Bahraini pilot. So, I found the name Ahmed Alghamdi,
I found an e-mail address for Alghamdi, and I found the names and web sites of
numerous other people, many of whom had names of Middle Eastern origin. But
that in itself was not surprising given that the web site is a fan club for a
Middle Eastern singer.

Nevertheless, my initial (intuitive) reaction was that I might have come across
an al Qaeda communications node, and I now know that to be at least partly true.
Having decided that I might have come across an al Qaeda communications node, I
began looking at the web sites of all those who had posted their URLs on the
fan club web site. After carefully looking at a few of the posted web sites, I
noted that a man by the name of Muzaffar Wandawi identified himself as an Iraqi
living in Amsterdam. The fact that he stated that he is an Iraqi drew my
immediate attention, for it is well known that there is possible Iraqi
involvement in the terrorist attack of Sept. 11. But that was not taken to be
anything more than circumstantial.

DefenseWatch: Please describe how you became suspicious that the images
themselves might be the messages/instructions.

When examining this mans art, I found it to be disturbing, but I did not at
first think that it was suspicious--until I came upon the picture
labeled "Downfall." In that picture, Wandawi clearly showed two towers burning,
and there appeared to be a picture of the smoking Pentagon just to the right of
that image. Then there was a man riding on what appeared to be an Arabian
horse, and the man appeared to be dressed like a pilot, without his jacket on.
The haircut of the rider of the horse was also in the manner of a pilot. The
painting was dated 1988, which seemed to be rather early. But I have since
concluded that the painting might have been done in 1998.

In all events, I grew very suspicious of what I saw, for it is essentially
impossible for someone to create such a constellation of images of a terrorist
event in the future-- without having intimate knowledge of the attack plans. Then I set about filtering the data and came across an image of the White House
that was buried under some mild clouding. Next, with the filtering, I could see that the burning tower actually represented a large building that was
burning in almost exactly the way that the buildings burned at the World Trade
Center. At this time I was convinced that the artist was an Iraqi intelligence
agent or an agent of al Qaeda.

Later, I discovered more images that were clearly targeting information of a
specific nature. I have not published those yet; an expert in this type of
cryptography is working on the problem at this very time.

DefenseWatch: One of the illustrations shows Osama bin Laden next to a cartoon
character from Sesame Street. What significance does that image have?

The Sesame Street character that has appeared in a huge poster with Osama bin
Laden is significant in that it is yellow and has a mask-like quality. And one
can be certain that it was not placed on that huge poster by accident, as some people have stupidly suggested. It is a signal.

Since it is my assertion that the al Qaeda group is using yellow as a symbol in
association with biological weapons, which it has done elsewhere, I conclude
that the yellow Sesame Street character in the poster represents a signal that
relates to biological weapons. And, as one can clearly see, we are under a
biological attack at this very moment. But it is my opinion that the biological
attack that is happening now is "baby stuff."

DefenseWatch: What federal authorities or agencies have you attempted to
contact to warn of the potential threat from the art? Please describe the
reaction or lack of reaction to date. Do other private experts share your
assessment or is there disagreement?

I have attempted to communicate to the FBI on two occasions, sending e-mail to
four of their offices. There has been no reply, even though I am warning that
al Qaeda is planning an apocalyptic germ warfare attack.

I am waiting to hear from other experts.

DefenseWatch: How widespread is public awareness of this?

I have principally limited this information to Col. David Hackworth and certain
other trusted individuals. But I am beginning to release information to members
of the news media, by virtue of the fact that I feel that the FBI is not going
to take this seriously. It took them seven days to understand that we are under
an anthrax attack. And about 8,000 FBI computers are more than eight years old. Not every FBI office can even surf the Web. They are in the Dark Ages.


Regarding the certainty of the information, I can say with 100 percent
certainty that Muzaffar Wandawi had prior knowledge of the terrorist attack on
Sept. 11, and I can say with 100 percent certainty that he is intimately
involved with other planned acts of terrorism against the United States. These
include a planned attack on one of the most vital communications centers that
America has; an attack on the Main Building of the National Security Agency [at
Fort Meade, Md.]--inside of which is situated a communications center that
handles everything from presidential orders relating to use of nuclear weapons to some CIA and State Department traffic. It appears that perhaps 12 private
planes would attack the NSA main building when a certain signal is given. I
know what that signal is, and I know what conditions of defense alert we will
be in when the signal is given.

Let me conclude by saying that the evidence I have posted at my web site indicates that al Qaeda  in association with Iraqi intelligence  plans a biological attack that they hope will kill millions. I assume that this will occur with the use of exotic diseases, such as Ebola, but also smallpox and everything one could possibly find in a Russian bacteriological warfare laboratory. The information that I have indicates that the Russian mafia has sold these kind of bacteriological materials to bin Laden.

So, just as there was a group of 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, I assert that there is a group of maybe 20 germ warfare agents who will release the aforementioned types of diseases in the very near future, hoping to create epidemics that will kill millions. That is what the encrypted images at Wandawis web site suggest to me.

I urge that people go to the web page where I have placed this evidence and
examine the materials for themselves. The URL is:
