Exactly. I was rolling my eyes rather than my ass <g>, but it works out
the same.

The first two examples that came to my mind were kidnaping and security
clearance background checks. While one may debate whether kidnaping
should be a federal crime, it _is_, and it's the Feebs' job to
investigate it. Similarly with background checks for clearances.
Perfectly valid reasons to talk to the Feebs.

On the other hand, I can't think of a good reason to talk to DEA, ATF,
or IRS without a valid warrant. I'm not sure the first two even have a
valid reason for existing (the same goes for the IRS, to a lesser
extent), and all three have an even more egregious history of violating
the norms of decent society than does the FBI.
