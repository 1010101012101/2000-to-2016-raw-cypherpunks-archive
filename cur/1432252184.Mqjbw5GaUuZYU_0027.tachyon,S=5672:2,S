If by "right from the start" you're including "back in ~1987, when I 
was on standards committees that were specifying SGML for their 
applications", then yes, the trainwreck was around then, even before 
HTML or the web.  "Computer-Aided Logistics Support", aka CALS, was 
trying to address standards for handling documentation, mainly for 
the aircraft business and military contractors; you couldn't fit the 
design and maintenance documentation for a typical cargo airplane 
into the airplane itself.

The people who got the concept wanted to be able to do things like 
have maintenance manuals that you could read on whatever display you 
had, whether it's a high-res computer terminal or a monospaced 
wrist-mounted screen when you were standing on a ladder working on an 
engine, and you'd have objects like "a 2nd-level header".

The people who didn't get it wanted to be able to have data formats 
that could keep track of page numbers (so you could replicate taking 
the old page 1435.2 out of a 3-ring binder and replace it with an 
updated version), and objects like "a line of 14-point bold-faced text."

We ended up with some botched DTD that sort of let you do both, 
badly.  Graphics were supposed to be in a portable vector-based 
format, but they didn't have that finished while I was still working 
on that committee.  And eventually Sir Tim came up with HTML, which 
was sort of like a simplified DTD that did basic markup mostly 
correctly (plus hypertext and forms entry!), though with bitmapped 
pictures, and later people started to botch it up by letting you 
specify specific fonts and layouts (even if the reader's display 
didn't look like the author's), and Javascript to try to plaster over 
the botches, and it's been unsafely downhill from there.
