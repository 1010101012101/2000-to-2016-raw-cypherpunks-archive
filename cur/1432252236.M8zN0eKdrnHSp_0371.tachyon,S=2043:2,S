> Not so. What stops editors' output to be re-distributed at zero cost ?

Editor produces output in the form of signatures that indicate approval
of content.  Editor encrypts content to customers' public key before
signing it.  Customer can't redistribute Editor's signature in a form
that's useful to anyone else without also distributing his own secret
key.  Hence, re-distributing Editor's output is at the cost of revealing
one's own secret key (which will have financial consequences if Editor
arranges the deal correctly).

There are probably neater ways of achieving the same result.
