By this you mean a dynamic, immediate MITM where
the attacker proxies through to the website in real
time?

Just as a point of terms clarification, I would say that
if the attacker collects all the information by using
a copy of the site, and then logs in later at leisure
to the real site, that's an MITM.

(If he were to use that information elsewhere, so for
example creating a new credit arrangement at another
bank, then that technically wouldn't be an MITM.)

Perhaps we need a name for this:  real time MITM
versus delayed time MITM?  Batch time MITM?

The user+client has to authenticate the server.  Everything
that I've seen over the last two years seems to fall into
that one bucket.

Maybe.  But that only addresses the MITM, not the
theft of user information.
