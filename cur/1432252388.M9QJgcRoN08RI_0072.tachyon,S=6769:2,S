Even though I'm PLUNKED, and he is currently on a lawyer-hate rampage...

Ah, yes. The (illicit) "credit rating market."

Thank you for the "Dick & Jane" version. I may not be the smartest kid in
the class, but I am going to skip a grade, and address the value proposition
Mr. May is *really* talking about, although with a twist of legitimacy:

I find open source information banking/trading/merchant (whatever) systems
problematic propositions, beyond anonymous cash, especially viewed in light
of this hypothetical on a distributed open source intelligence
haven-brokerage.

	i.e. How do you set yourself up as an anonymous, neutral, info-Switzerland?
...How will you 	obtain critical mass and critical trust? ...Where is your
back-door, infosec accountability 	if you are nothing but digital wind?
...How do you set up a buy-sell marketplace for 	intelligence -- the value
of which cannot be determined prior to analysis, even where there 	is a
robust reputation capital metric in place? ...How do you enforce polycentric
merchant 	society rules in the context of an anonymous transactional system?
...Requirements for	admission?  ...Quality control? Reputational
systems?...What is your post-transactional 	enforcement mechanism? ...MUST
you have anon cash? (Just lotsa questions.)

On the other hand, take Steele's concept, turn it into an distributed ghosty
"INTELLAGORA" (?) to facilitate and tap these new public-private and
private-private transcontinental intelligence flows, attain critical mass,
and you would have an exceptional value proposition.

Nothing happens without a value proposition, and there is only one lucrative
"live" information market: the intelligence habit. Whoever gets in the
middle of this public<-->private intelligence collision stands to make
serious bank. There is no legacy system, so, if doable, it's load and
lock-in. In comparison, the likes of ZKS and MojoNation seem small
footsteps -- not just in terms of the potential market, but also in terms of
the opportunity for the mass incorporation of cypherpunk concepts.

(This is not "subversive" hypothetical. Western/Allied intelligence
communities would be the primary benefactors and contractors.)
