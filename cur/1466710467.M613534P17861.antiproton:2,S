	It's not their list, it's funded with stolen money. And even if
	it was their list, that doesn't give them any divine
	rule-making authority.

	That's true. The fact that they are now showing their
	true fascist colors is a good thing.

	boyce is just a left-wing fascist. It's now fashionable among
	left-wing fascists to pretend to care oh so much about women,
	while ignoring cases where women are actually hurt.
