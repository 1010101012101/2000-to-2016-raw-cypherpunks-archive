It seems from this article that perhaps MS already had worked out how
to do copy protection with Palladium, or at least thinks it possible
contrary to what was said at USENIX security:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26651.html

> [Palladium related job advert...] Our technology allows content
> providers, enterprises and consumers to control what others can do
> with their digital information, such as documents, music, video,
> ebooks, and software.  Become a key leader, providing vision and
> industry leadership in developing DRM, Palladium and Software
> Licensing products and Trust Infrastructure Services.

"control what others can do with [...] software.  [...] develop DRM
[...] and Software Licensing products".

Also again shows that Palladium is quite centrally a DRM platform,
which is kind of obvious from the design, and anyway from the naming
of the associated patent "DRM-OS".

MS recruits for Palladium microkernel and/or DRM platform
By John Lettice
Posted: 13/08/2002 at 10:23 GMT

Microsoft's efforts to disassociate Palladium from DRM seem to have hit
their first speed bump. Some voices within the company (and we currently
believe these voices to be right and sensible) hold the view that Palladium
has to be about users' security if it's to stand any chance of winning
hearts and minds, and that associating it with protecting the music
business' IP will be the kiss of death. So they'll probably not be best
pleased by the Microsoft job ad that seeks a group program manager
"interested in being part of Microsoft's effort to build the Digital Rights
Management (DRM) and trusted platforms of the future (Palladium)."
