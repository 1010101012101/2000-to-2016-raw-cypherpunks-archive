Although I have misgivings about the stability of bitcoin, I support its use. (It's the only thing out there that is completely de-linked from official currencies and from things like precious metals, that is workable for more than just local exchange).

To explain my perplexity on bitcoin stability, I quote from the site cyclonite linked: 

"How much is a Bitcoin worth?

More all the time...

As you can see, over a 4 week period, recently...

The value of  `8?1.00 BTC (one Bitcoin), went from  US$0.06  to  US$0.50  ...within only about 4 weeks.   Yes...   That was an 833% increase in it's value.   Wow."

(http://www.bitcoinme.com/)

For me, a currency that is to be widely used, should be stable. Stable means it doesn't go down in value, but it also doesn't go up in value excessively. It should be roughly keeping its value. Going up as much as bitcoin evidently does, is a form of instability that will bring disturbance to a marketplace using bitcoin as its means of exchange. 

This instability could and should be remedied by adjusting the target total of bitcoin creation with an algorithm that takes into account the number of active bitcoin users. As the number of users increases, the total target amount of bitcoins to be created (which currently is fixed at 21,000,000) should increase, slowly creeping up to accomodate the demand of new users for bitcoins, in a way to keep the value of one single coin roughly stable. 

I do not know whether the creators of bitcoin would be willing to do this. 

For me, such an adjustment will be necessary to take bitcoin from experimental status to widely-used alternative means of payment status. 

Kind regards
Sepp
