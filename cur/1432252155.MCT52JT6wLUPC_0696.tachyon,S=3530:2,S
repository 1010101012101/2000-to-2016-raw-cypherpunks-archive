The TCPA specs were carefully designed to permit the user to obtain
multiple certificates from multiple CA's and thus, if, and that's a big
if, the CA's don't collude and furthermore indeed discard the true name
identities of the customer, utilize multiple separate identities for
various online applications. I.e., the user could have one cert for
their True Name, one used to enable Microsoft Office, and one to
authenticate the user to other online services.

It is very much the intent of the TCPA to permit the use of pseudonymous
credentials for many, if not most, applications. Otherwise, the TCPA's
carefully planned attempts at winning over the online liberty groups
would have been doomed from the start.
