John, my ill-mannered, surly, and lovable friend, you may have
read it, but you sure didn't understand it.

My point, such as it is, is that the Ohio case is a natural expansion
and mild evolution of "child porn" laws in the U.S. If y'all are going
to get upset about the Ohio statute and prosecution, then you should
be looking critically at state and federal obscenity laws and child
porn laws as well. John, to his credit, seems to be doing that.
