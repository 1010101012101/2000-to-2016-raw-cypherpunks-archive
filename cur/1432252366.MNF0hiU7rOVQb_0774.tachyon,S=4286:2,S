The Trots I encountered in Australia seemed remarkably
similar to the Trotsky that I found in the history books.
Perhaps that is why they called themselves Trotskyists.

The story of the Russian radical left is full of hypocrisy,
betrayal and murder. The story of the Catalonian radical left
is also full of very similar hypocrisy, betrayal and murder,
with the added twist that in Catalonia the anarchist
nomenclatura was sold by the anarchist leadership into the
hands of their enemies.

The differences that seem so big and important from the
inside, are small from the outside.  I notice that you
approvingly cite Huben's FAQ, whose central argument is that
the federal government is the rightful owner of everything in
the USA.

The abrupt change in the "anarchist" program after 1938
demonstrates that they saw, you see, what I saw.
