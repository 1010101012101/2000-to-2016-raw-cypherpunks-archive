The RSA Security Conference in San Francisco is coming up:
Feb 23-27.

As in the past, free Expo passes are available if you register online at
the conference site: http://2004.rsaconference.com/ (The expo is not
open all days - check the schedule).

Last year, getting a badge required an ID and getting photographed.
I expect its the same this year. Some list members succeeded in 
gaming this system in highly entertaining ways.
