Yeah, I know it was a bit of a tangent. But read any one of them at random 
and I'll bet you'll come across a lot of things you didn't already know. 
And rather than taking one side "globalism is good" or "globalism is bad" 
(like the Salon piece), the ones I've read give plenty of justification for 
pros and cons of all kinds. 

The real enemy of the poor is complacency.
