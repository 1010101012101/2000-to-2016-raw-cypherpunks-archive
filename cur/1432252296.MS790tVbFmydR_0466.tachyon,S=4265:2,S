I have something like this in the making. if you're working on a
similiar project - why not team up?

in addition, access to the email account is via encrypted means only:
either forwarding through S/MIME or SSL channels or IMAP with SSL.

plus a local mixmaster for sending out mail (in the process mixing it
without mail that's merely travelling through).


an optional (2nd) e-mail address can accept unencrypted mail, but before
forwarding will encrypt it (PGP). goal: your home machine never gets an
unencrypted e-mail.

not planned here. I'm on the e-mail aspect only.


data you need to provide is minimal - a username/pwd and/or a forwarding
e-mail. we don't want to know what we have no technical need to know.

all payment can be done anonymously - that's an important point and
possibly the most difficult one.

all of this is doable. as I said: I'm working on encrypted e-mail
services at the moment (I bounced a couple stego ideas off this list
recently).
