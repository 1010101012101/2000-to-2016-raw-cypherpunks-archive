Agreements similar to this that sources make with media organizations have 
been held by courts to be enforceable, yes. I suspect this one would be too.

Too late? How about damages.

No, reporters will want to ask questions on the phone, or, more rarely, in

An essay by Tim isn't good enough for those reasons and also, frankly, for 
more parochial reasons of "exclusivity."
