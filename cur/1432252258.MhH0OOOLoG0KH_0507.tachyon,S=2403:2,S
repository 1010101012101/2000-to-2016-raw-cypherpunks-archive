Your analysis hangs on this assertion.  You may be underestimating the
revulsion of the US electorate towards the actions of the current
administration.

Here is a related question: How do you think "infantile" US citizens

blood on American soil?   Iraq happened exactly because Bush is
exploiting the outrage of US citizens over the 9/11 attack.
