The system is quite "self healing" in that once any attack is over, the
scraps will be quite efficiently picked up and woven into new fabric again.
No money can be "spawned" in the system, anything adverse that slipped into
the block chain will be sorted out after.

The expense of changing a transaction increases over time, if you want to be
sure of a transaction: wait it out. Up to a point that reverting the
transaction would hold no profit. That said it's relatively hard
to organize such an attack and it would most likely leave large traces.
