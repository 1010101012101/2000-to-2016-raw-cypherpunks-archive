Awesome.

"
Brain computer interfaces (BCI) are becoming increasingly popular in
the gaming and entertainment industries. Consumer-grade BCI devices
are available for a few hundred dollars and are used in a variety of
applications, such as video games, hands-free keyboards, or as an
assistant in relaxation training. There are application stores similar
to the ones used for smart phones, where application developers have
access to an API to collect data from the BCI devices.

The security risks involved in using consumer-grade BCI devices have
never been studied and the impact of malicious software with access to
the device is unexplored. We take a first step in studying the
security implications of such devices and demonstrate that this
upcoming technology could be turned against users to reveal their
private and secret information. We use inexpensive
electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI devices to test the feasibility
of simple, yet effective, attacks. The captured EEG signal could
reveal the userbs private informa- tion about, e.g., bank cards, PIN
numbers, area of living, the knowledge of the known persons. This is
the first attempt to study the security implications of consumer-grade
BCI devices. We show that the entropy of the private information is
decreased on the average by approximately 15 % - 40 % compared to
random guessing attacks.
