There has been far more concern about opponents of the war
being intimidated than supporters.  Yet the nearest thing to
real censorship happened to Ann Coulter, for calling for holy
war against Muslims.  Meanwhile college professors loudly
complain that the occupants of the trade towers had it coming
to them for imperialism, colonialism, and oppression, and
keep their jobs, and a comic strip spits on the flag, and is
not dropped.

What happened to Ann Coulter is not censorship, but it is lot
closer to censorship than the fact that the tenured
supporters of terror find themselves mentioned as tenured
supporters of terror.
