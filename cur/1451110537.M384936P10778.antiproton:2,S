Not true, Governments provide a great deal of return on investment for
lobbyists, and some of this *cough* economic growth *cough* ends up
in your retirement funds! This is 'good' if you like growth, right?

Now you give me an idea, how about we automate router firmware dumps, 
and start providing free wifi for campaign staffers in collaboration
with www.ngpvan.com

If you are going to run a good political campaign in the digital
world, you need to start with a router firmware dump...
