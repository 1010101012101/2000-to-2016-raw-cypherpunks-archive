Both. As someone already explained, you can write a specific algorithm that
will compress a string of 100 zeros to a single 0. Now, if given a random
string of 100 bits, there is a probability of 1 in 2^100 that this string is
all zeros - in which case you'll manage to compress it. But in all cases,
your algorithm won't accomplish anything. And in the one case where you're
lucky, the string is NOT random - it's specified.
