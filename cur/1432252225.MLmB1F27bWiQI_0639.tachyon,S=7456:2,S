I did for a while, but then I moved hardware and didn't see any reason 
to set up PGP again. At best, it was a signal to people that I cared 
about security/privacy, at worst it was making everything I posted 
non-repudiable for no useful reason.

The fact that miniLock is authenticated but repudiable makes it a better 
bet for PGP-usecase purposes *anyway*, and my minilock ID is in my 
signature (again, had lapsed by accident) for people who want to use 
miniLock outside of peerio.

But, miniLock isn't (opportunistic pun) "turn-key", it requires 
launching, authenticating, dropping a file to encrypt, typing in a 
miniLock ID to encrypt to (encrypting to yourself probably makes it 
non-repudiable if someone acquires your private key, beware!), 
downloading the encrypted file, and then transmitting the encrypted file 
out-of-band.

Now, implementing Peerio server is something I endorse. If I weren't too 
busy, I'd investigate doing it myself, it looks like fun. If anyone does 
feel like it, they have miniLock for JS-based servers, and deadLock for 
Python-based servers (needs some work/bugfixes).
