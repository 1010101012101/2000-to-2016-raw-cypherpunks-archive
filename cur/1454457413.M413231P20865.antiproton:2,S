I think the answer is that they're difficult subjects to address. People
generally prefer to address issues they think they understand. Not to
excuse it; it's something everyone needs to work on, but it's going to take
some time. There's also the self-selection effect where most of those who
"roast you in words, with glee" differ from trolls only that they seek out
some form of legitimacy for their trolling. It seems to me that a far
better way to deal with "anti-social communication" would be to ignore it
and encourage others to do so if it's trolling, or to privately reach out
to the person to try to help them understand why their method of
communication is counterproductive, if it seems like they can be gotten
through to.

To be fair, none of us is going to kidnap you and throw you in a cage, nor
shoot you, nor blow you up with a nuclear weapon. There are degrees of
bully. Though I think it would be more appropriate to describe government
as "a home for kidnappers, murderers, and thieves masquerading as a
collective defense."

Yep. Trolling is a problem in any public community. The best way to make
trolls go away if there is no active moderation is to ignore them, but that
requires encouraging those who respond to them to avoid doing so in the
future. IOW, you need leadership regardless of whether you have moderation
for a community to thrive. Moreso, in the absense of moderation.

In crypto-anarchy generally, yes. In this particular community, well, like
in any community it's going to take hard work.

Indeed. I thought this was a crypto-anarchist community, not a space for
social inepts to come where they don't have to take responsibility for
their complete lack of empathy or even basic consideration for others. But
that's probably an unrealistic expectation given the general state of
nerd-dom right now.
