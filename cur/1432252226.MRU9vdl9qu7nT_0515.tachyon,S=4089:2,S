Which of the three list archives? I'm subscribers to all three of the
major lists you sent this to and NONE of them (especially if you're
talking about the moronic discussion on cypherpunks from a couple of
months ago - where NOTHING, especially no working algorithms were
discussed) have ever demonstrated a single algorithm that can decide if an
arbitrary block of symbols is encrypted or not (unless of course you know 
a priori by pre-defining it, which isn't the same problem as you describe 
at all).

Ah, now you change the rules of the game with 'controlled environment'.
That wasnt' in  your first description. I told you there was no such
algorithm.

ps shooting the can-sat down isn't the point, and to answer your
   question, a lot more than it costs to put them up there.
