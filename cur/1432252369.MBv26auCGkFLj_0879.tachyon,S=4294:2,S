That's a quantization issue ---you are recognizing a 'ward' but the 'at large'
election means the city is the unit of quantization.  If you got 'ward'
voting someone could complain that smaller units were fairer, etc.

In some places whether or not you feel 'represented' might include whether
your religion (sex, albedo, etc.) was 'represented' by either a representative
who looked like you or who held a formal position given to those of your type.
(cf the protestants' representation in various (catholic) north ireland legal
bodies)

Another interesting facet of 'representation' is how obligated your
'representatives'
are to act as their electors wish, and penalties they face for violating
constitutions.  

And whether subsets are 'allowed' to leave and form their own representative
bodies (cf LA vs. the Valley, FRY, US civil war)
