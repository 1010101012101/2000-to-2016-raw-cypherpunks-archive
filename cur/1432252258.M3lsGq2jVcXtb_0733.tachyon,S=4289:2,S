I have missed that one; however, it is wrong - if people hold them, then
they become MORE valuable, and thus you have high deflation - the purchasing
power of money grows - which is great. And if their value gets so big that
subdivisions start to become necessary, one can always convert them to "new
betabucks", each old one being worth a million new ones. End of problem.
