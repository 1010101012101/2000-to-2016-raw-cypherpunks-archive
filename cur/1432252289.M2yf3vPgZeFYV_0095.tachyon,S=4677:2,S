You don't have a whole lot of choice. Few places in the world do even as
well as the US in the broad range of things you might be interested in.

Any rich country has this, at least in towns, and enclaves in a lot of
poor ones.

Ditto. We probably have better ones over here in Britain than you guys
do. But you might not like other things about us.

If you are techy enough you can get these anywhere. You get paid less in
poor places of course, but then things are cheaper.

Nope. Most European countries have more restrictive laws than you do,
though in practice the difference isn't that great. Everywhere you will
get government interference, it depends what you object to most. The
kind of personal firearms that are common in the USA are illegal almost
everywhere else. But then your crazy US alcohol laws are the laughing
stock of the rest of the non-Muslim world.  In Singapore you can get
banged up for spitting in the street.

Maybe by being very rich and in effect living in a fortress?

Or by making do with less money.
