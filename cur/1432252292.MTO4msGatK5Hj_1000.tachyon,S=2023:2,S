Actually, in New York, they do.  At least they *did* when I lived there,
all the way up to 1985.  They had exactly one tank (used to mow down the
drug houses in AlphabetTown), and an APC.  Oh, and the PD helicopters were
bought, paid for, and maintained through inventive use of the "Auxiliary
Police" program (more appropriately the Placebo Police program.  STOP or
I'll hurt myself!).
