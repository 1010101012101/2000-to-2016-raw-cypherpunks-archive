Fire guts Pakistan government edifice holding extremist records 
AFP 
Islamabad, January 16 

A 16-storey government ministry building reportedly containing sensitive records
on extremist religious organisations was almost completely gutted in the Pakistani
capital, police said Wednesday. 

Authorities said it appeared a fire, which started on the upper floors, was caused
by a short circuit but were not ruling out other causes. 

The Shaheed-i-Millat building housed 15 government departments, including the
record-keeping offices of the interior ministry. 

Reports said the records included information on extremist religious organisations and firearms.
