"libertarian socialist" is an oxymoron."
Like anarcho-capitalist?
I do use anarchist gerberally.Tim Im posting articles under your name at 
Indymedia.When I do I try to be very exact with it.
but sometimes Im cutting and pasting like a whirling dervish and dont 
attribute.Thats usually with the more outre statements you make in your 
less lucid moments.Im just telling you as a courtesy,Oh and thanks for not 
popping me in the corn.
          "Who wants to participate to help form what will be the LAST 
revolution on earth, the one that'll take down ALL the governments?"
