I visited that 419eaters site, and I must say I have really mixed feelings
about what the people are doing there.

It's certainly unethical for Nigerians to try and make a living by bilking
foreigners with elaborate schemes that promise vast riches in return for an
advance fee.

But Nigeria is a very poor country, with high unemployment, where people are 
forced by economic circumstances to do almost anything to try and feed their 
families.  I see no reason to be proud of reverse-scamming a Nigerian out of 
$80 when it might be his entire family's food money for the month.

Only idiots fall for Nigerian Spam. (well, aside from that lady who worked 
at a bank, and sent some Nigerian $1.3 million of the bank's money)

It seems to me the relationship between affluent Americans and poor 
Nigerians is an example of a dominant class/subordinate class structure, and 
in such a structure, the subordinate class has rights, and the dominant 
class has responsibilities.

It is beneath the station of those those with the power to define, describe, 
and profile the world to pick the pocket of some poor black man in Africa, 
while encouraging him to pose for funny pictures that will be laughed at on 
some comfortably well off white person's web site.
