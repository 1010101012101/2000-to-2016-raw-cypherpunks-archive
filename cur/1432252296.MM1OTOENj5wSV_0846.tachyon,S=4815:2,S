> What I suspect the US military would really like to see is a spy satellite at geosync altitude (22,000 miles) with an apparent aperture of perhaps 150 meters, so that it has roughly the same resolution on the ground as existing fast-orbital spy satellites.  (orbital period circa 90 minutes or so).

Balloons, that's what the military uses for high resolution imagery. And they are so good to stay aloft that not even with a .50 machine gun you would be able to down it. The only way to do that is to fly a drone nearby carrying some pounds of dynamite and fire it off.
