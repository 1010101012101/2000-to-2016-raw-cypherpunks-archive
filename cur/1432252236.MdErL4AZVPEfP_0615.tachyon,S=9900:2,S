That's true. But they do in fact do research into malware, and it is infact
my right to request information for "personal noncommercial use" which
includes attempting to secure my computer.

If the government produced records on how to best design a tree house, I am
still allowed to request records on how to build a tree house. I cannot
force them to create new records, but for records they have already
produced, they have the duty and obligation to make a reasonable search.
