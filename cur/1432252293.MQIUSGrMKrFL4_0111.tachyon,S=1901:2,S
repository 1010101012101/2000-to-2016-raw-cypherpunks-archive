First of all, there were 19 children killed in the OKC bombing. Were
these children guilty of some crime worthy of being killed by a truck
bomb?

Second of all, you make it sound like McVeigh was just your average-Joe
American. How could a non-fundamentalist knowingly kill 168 people? 

Third, does not being a suicide bomber make your cause more noble?

Curious why you seem to think McVeigh was justified in his actions.
