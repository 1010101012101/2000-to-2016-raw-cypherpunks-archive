Advertising in newspapers could cost you a 
fortune. It can also be a lot of
work. You may have to pay for everything 
including each letter in your ad, the
length of time you run that ad and so on. It 
could cost you hundreds before you
get an order.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Building a website
and offering services and products from there is 
better then newspaper ads, but
your sales depend on the popularity of your 
site.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you know there are many 
ways to advertise your line of
products or services but the best way is <b><font 
color="#FF0000">E-mail marketing</font></b>!<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can buy a list with several thousand 
fresh targeted E-mails and send
them your advertisement for free. Just pay a 
small fee for the list and you can
advertise to thousands virtually for free. No 
other way to advertise is
cheaper!! You simply buy a fresh list of email 
addresses and just email your
advertisement. Think of a product or service to 
offer. Type up and advertisement
and with several thousand emails you can market 
your product or service for
FREE!!!! Everything hinges on your advertisement. 
If&nbsp; you're offering a
good service or product and it's catchy then 
you'll
make a sale. Email Marketing is not spamming if 
you target your customers. We
can process a list for you that targets any 
audience. And remember…you are
advertising virtually for free. The only thing 
you're buying are mega email
lists that are targeted towards a given 
audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="AlgerianBasD"

guarantee…….SpinDo
Enterprises will offer you a list of <span

<p class="MsoNormal">Do you ever see those ads 
offering a list of millions of
email addresses? I see them every day. It's 
nearly impossible for those
companies to guarantee every address they send 
you is a working account.<span style="mso-
spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Right? I'm sure they didn't hand count 
them .Most of these companies
are scams because many of there emails are 
duplicates or what we call
"dupes". And even if they were all accurate 
accounts…..I highly dought
they filtered out the addresses you don't want to 
email to. Such as emails
with the extension .gov, .org, .mil and so on. So 
say you did order a list of
over a million emails, it is reasonable to say 
these emails are at least 2-6
months old. Our list…..processed when your 
payment is received!!! Do you think
these companies process 10, 20,<span style="mso-
spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>50,
80 million emails the same week you make an 
order??<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Impossible….but we guarantee ours is! Plus 
we sell "general" and
"targeted" list for the same price!!!</p>

We specialize in smaller list to ensure our 
product is the most accurate and
reliable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;<o:p>

</b>When you mail your check or money order, 
please state what you are selling
so we can create a list of emails only for that 
audience.</p>
<h4>Here at SpinDo Enterprises everything we 
offer is flat rate. No extra hidden
charges like many companies. Due to the
