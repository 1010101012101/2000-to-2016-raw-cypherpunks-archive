Darryl W. Perry Calls for Ross Ulbricht to Be Pardoned
Ross UlbrichtFrom Darryl W. Perry=E2=80=99s=C2=A02016 presidential campaign=
 website:In 2013 Ross Ulbricht was arrested for allegedly operating the bla=
ck market website Silk Road. In early 2015 he was found convicted in what w=
as essentially a kangaroo trial, where his attorney was prevented from pres=
enting evidence of government corruption in the case, because of an ongoing=
 investigation. Two of the federal agents investigating the case have since=
 been arrested for=C2=A0fraud and money laundering.Ulbricht=E2=80=99s lead =
defense attorney Joshua Dratel wrote in a court filing, =E2=80=9CIn contras=
t to the government=E2=80=99s portrayal of the Silk Road web site as a more=
 dangerous version of a traditional drug marketplace, in fact the Silk Road=
 web site was in many respects the most responsible such marketplace in his=
tory, and consciously and deliberately included recognized harm reduction m=
easures, including access to physician counseling. In addition, transaction=
s on the Silk Road web site were significantly safer than traditional illeg=
al drug purchases, and included quality control and accountability features=
 that made purchasers substantially safer than they were when purchasing dr=
ugs in a conventional manner.=E2=80=9DMeghan Ralston, a former harm reducti=
on manager for the Drug Policy Alliance says Silk Roadwas =E2=80=9Ca peacea=
ble alternative to the often deadly violence so commonly associated with th=
e global drug war, and street drug transactions, in particular.=E2=80=9DDes=
pite the improprieties in the investigation and the trial, and despite the =
fact that Ross Ulbricht actually made the black market safer, he will be in=
 prison for a minimum of 20 years. The Ulbricht family has said they plan t=
o appeal the conviction, however they shouldn=E2=80=99t need to do so. Ross=
 Ulbricht should be pardoned, as should all non-violent drug offenders![end=
