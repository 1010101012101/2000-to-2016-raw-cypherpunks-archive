You don't keep 120+gbps running without some government backing you.

I can only think this is some sort of major political statement, by 
some people with significant political (and real) capital to spend.

Who's got the influence and money to do this, and why? I can only 
imagine it's some sort of reaction to the USA freedom act.

So if you think your data collection system might now be illegal,
do you open source it because it'll spill the beans on the banksters
who double-crossed you?

Regardless of why, how do you manage data integrity of such a large
dump so you are not looking at intentionally manipulated data?
