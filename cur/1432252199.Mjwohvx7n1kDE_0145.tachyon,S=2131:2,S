Robertson was quoting "columnist Joel Mowbray, who has written a book entitled 
"Dangerous Diplomacy: How the State Department Threatens American Security."" 
The threat was Mowbray's.

Interesting that the State Department goes after Robertson rather than 
Mowbray.  Could it have anything to do with the idea that few(er) people know 
who Mowbray is?
