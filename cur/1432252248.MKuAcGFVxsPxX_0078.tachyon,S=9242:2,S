This certainly gives one good reason not to piss off one's neighbors, eh?
This is of course the whole point of shunning.  It is a way of getting
people to behave in ways that are approved of by their community.  If they
do not, they risk being left to their own devices for survival.  No doubt
you will argue that people must be forced to provide for those who offend
them, at gunpoint if necessary.

Complete bullshit.  In other words, "Violence is whatever I say it is."

So, people should be allowed the freedom of expression, thought and
association, yet they are prohibited from shunning?  You simply can't
have it both ways.  Either one is free to not associate with someone or
they are not (in which case, their "freedom of expression and association"
are nothing but lip service).

Even if it requires *forcing other people* to do things they don't want
to do.

People must behave exactly as you define "playing nice".  Otherwise, you
think they must be forced to "play nice".  Clearly, you're right and
everyone else is wrong and everyone else must be forced to do things your
way.

"Oh, but if they'll just 'play nice' then everyone is free to do as
they please!"

Except somehow merely refusing to associate with someone is categorized
by you as physical violence.  And apparently as a shop-owner I cannot
exercise rights over *my own property* if what I choose to do is
inconvenient for someone else.

The shop owner must be *forced* to tolerate behavior he doesn't approve
of?  What happened to his right to his own property?  Must he also
allow people to have sex in his shop?  Or masturbate?  Or curse?  Or
insult his customers?  Or slander the shopkeeper?  Or sing loudly?

Which set of things must he be forced to accept?  And if he throws
someone out for engaging in one of these behaviors, which things will
cause the Men With Guns to come and arrest *him* for "violating their
right of expression"?

Since food and the like are necessities of life, isn't anyone free to
come in and just take whatever they like from the shop?  After all,
"What if you do not have the means? You just die?"  No, clearly the
shopkeeper would be "doing violence" to me if he tried to prevent me
from taking what I need to live.

Life is unfair.  Get over it.  Those that depend on others for their
well-being or continued survival would do well to be more polite to
them.  If you live at home with Mommy and Daddy, then you'd better
behave as they specify.  Likewise, if you must rely on commerce with
others for your survival, you'd better think twice about offending them.

Why not?  You're already there.  Whatever Sampo thinks is "fair".
In Sampo's world, it's okay to force someone to provide service to
those who insult them or offend them.  I wonder whatever happened to
*their* liberties.
