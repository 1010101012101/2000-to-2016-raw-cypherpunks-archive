Two points.  First, Joe Sixpack won't use it if it requires
an extra click; but he might if the mail queueing is in
the background.

Second, spammers use trojans that establish local mail relays (!)
You think they won't steal some cycles to pollute? 

Ok, three points.  If you're sending from your PDA, 
either deal with the battery-life-loss as a cost of 
emailing from your PDA, or have your net-connected host
do the work.  Again, transparently, or no one will use it.

Personally, I favor an Assasination Politics flavor solution,
but that's unlikely to gain widespread favor :-)
