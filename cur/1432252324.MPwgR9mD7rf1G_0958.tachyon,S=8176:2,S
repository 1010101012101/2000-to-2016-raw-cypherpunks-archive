Yes, there is some discussion of it on slashdot, including several
other people who have commented similarly to anonymous that it is a
pretty big privacy invasion and centralised control point problem.

The claim that you can optionally be anonymous and not use a cert, or
get an anonymous cert is plainly practically bogus.  You'd stand about
as much chance of having your mail read as if you shared mail hub with
spamford wallace -- ie 90+% of internet mail infrastructure would drop
your mail on the floor on the presumption it was spam.

Plus a point I made in that thread is that it is often not in the
internet user's interests to non-repudiably sign every message they
send just to be able to send mail because that lends amunition to
hostile recipients who from time-to-time target internet users for
bullshit libel and unauthorised investment advice etc. 

Companies also are I would expect somewhat sensitive to not signing
everything for similar reasons as those behind their retention
policies where they have policies of deleteing emails, files and
shredding paper files after some period.

In addition PKIs because of the infrastructure requirements have
probem complex to setup and administer.  So now we've taken one hard
problem (stopping spam) and added another hard problem (hierarchical
PKI deployment) and somehow this is supposed to be effective at
stopping spam.

In addition unless there is significant financial cost for
certificates and/or signifcant and enforceable financial penalty and
good identification and registration procedures enforced by the CAs it
wouldn't even slow spammers who would just get a cert, spam, get
revoked, get another cert and repeat.

Certificate revocation is already a weak point of PKI technology, and
to reasonably stop spam before the spammer manages to send too many
millions of spams with a cert, you have to revoke the cert PDQ!

And finally it all ends up being no more than an expensive
implementation of blacklists (or I suppose more properly whitelists),
because the CAs are maintaining lists of people who have not yet been
revoked as spammers.  Some click through agreement isn't going to stop
spammers.  Legislation or legal or financial threat is going to stop
spammers either because any level of registration time identity
verification that is plausibly going to be accepted by users, and this
is also limited by the cost -- higher assurance is more cost which
users also won't be willing to accept -- will be too easy for the
spammers to fake.  And email is international and laws are not.

It is pretty much an "internet drivers license" for email.

I also think that fully distributed systems such as hashcash are more
suitable for a global internet service.  My preferred method for
deploying hashcash is as a token exempting it's sender from bayesian
filtering, and any other content based or sender based filtering.

That way as an email user you have an incentive to install a hashcash
plugin http://www.cypherspace.org/hashcash/ because it will ensure
your mail does not get deleted by ever-more aggressive filtering and
scattergun blackhole systems.  The camram system
http://www.camram.org/ is a variant of this.

It also more directly addresses the problem: it makes it more
expensive for spammers to send the volumes of mail they need to to
break even.
