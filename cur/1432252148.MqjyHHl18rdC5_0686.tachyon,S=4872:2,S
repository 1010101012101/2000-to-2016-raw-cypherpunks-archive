Yes, but you >CAN< specify that PGP and GPG and OpenPGP and other flavors
are acceptible.  

However, for a closed mailing list you simply require a particular (or
a set of) flavor of email encryptors which the listserver will understand.
Simple.  Solved.  Done.

So your arguement is bullshit.  These have clear text tags indicating what
the encrypted data was encrypted with.  End of story.

You can check the level of entropy in a block, which will tell you that
it is either random, random looking, or encrypted.

Certain encryption algorithms MAY have some characteristics over just 
plain random data.  For instance WWII engima had a flaw whereby if you
encoded an "A" you would never get back an "A".  This was very useful
for Bletchley.  

If you're trying to detect whether or not there's hidden stego in 
something there are several ways to find out.  One is simply if you get
two copies of the same media, you can compare them.  Another is to look
for statistical differences in the low bits based on the program that
generated them.  You'll find that the low bits of audio for instance
aren't all that random usually... etc...

If you've got a good stego program, it will try to compensate for the
bits it changes.  Depending on how good it is, you can figure it out.
