OK, what's the best way to put up a website anonymously?

Let's assume that it has nothing to do with national security...the Feds 
aren't interested.

BUT, let's assume that the existence and/or content of the website would 
probably direct a decent amount of law-suits.

Presumably there's no way to hide the ISP from the world, but one should 
hopefully be able to hide oneself and make legal action basically useless.

Egold + fake address for registering agency seems a little problematic.

And there's the question of updating the site...
