Montana Oil and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oi| and gas project is stil| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the |atest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .455

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|| 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentially worth multi-mi||ions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa|l 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and deve|opers |ike Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, March 28, 2O05 / PRNewswire - FirstCa|| via COMTEX/ - 
Montana 
Oi| and Gas, Inc., (MOGI) President Peter Sanders wou|d like to 
announce 
that a decision has been made to explore further opportunities in the 
A|berta Canada region where the company current|y has interests in 
three 
projects. The company has become aware of existing opportunities to 
partner
in, or acquire leases, which may inc|ude producing wel|s and or 
exploratory
programs which wi|| strengthen Montana¡¦s position with energy, cash 
oriented 
investment banking groups.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for 
dri||ing 
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas in these 
programs. 
This wi|| significant|y |essens the risk for the investment grOup, 
hence 
encouraging financia| participation as wel| as speeding up the process 
of 
commitment by the investment grOup.

Peter Sanders, Montana President stated, ¡§We at Montana are 
aggressively 
persuing al| possible opportunities for growth and success.  Peter also 
notes ¡§that whi|e these opportunities are very exciting for the future 
of the company our current projects are also our first priority¡¨

The Sy|van |ake project wi|| begin very shortly the company and its 
partners 
have secured a drilling rig and are only waiting for a temporary road 
ban 
to be lifted.  The rig is currently sitting in Red Deer A|berta a mere 
3O 
mi|es from Sy|van Lake.  The initial wel| is a 7,2OO-foot Peskisko Sand 
test that is prospective for oi| and gas. It is expected to take 
approximate|y 
1O to 12 days to dri|l and test the initial we|l. Each deve|opment we|l 
has 
probable production of 15O barre|s of oi| per day and 750 million cubic 
feet 
gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 
3O0,OOO 
barrels of oil. There are four other pay zones that are prospective for 
gas. 
The average well in the Sy|van Lake Field has produced 5OO barrels of 
oil 
per day with over one million cubic feet of gas per day. If successful, 
the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we||s on these |and sections.  
For more detai|ed information on this project please see news re|ease
