I don't make a moral criticism of Declan because he doesn't appear to 
have any choice in the matter. It's  not as if he could have simply 
said "Fuck you" to either the Toto/CJ or the Bell subpoenas.

For instance, in cases where I have been subpoenaed, I have complied. 
To do otherwise, to rot in jail on a contempt charge for several 
years the way that D.C. chick did, is foolish.

I take it, Seth, that if you are ever subpoenaed you will do the 
morally right thing and go to jail?
