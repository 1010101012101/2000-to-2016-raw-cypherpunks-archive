1. YOUR POWERIZE USER ID AND PASSWORD

You must use your Powerize User ID and Password to login on the 
Powerize Web site before you can get free access to great research. 
Only after you login will many of our pay-per-view articles and reports 
be available to you for free.  You will also need your User ID and 
Password to set up your free Powerize Alerts.

You should first login in where it says "Powerize Members Login Here" 
on the Powerize homepage. Note that your User ID and Password ARE case 
sensitive!

If your Web browser is set to accept "cookies," our Web site will
automatically remember your User ID and Password the next time you 
visit.

After you login you may change your password. If you want to change
your password, click on the "Your Account" button on the Web site
(http://www.powerize.com/pubdoc/youraccount.kml), and follow the
"Change your password" link.


2. ABOUT YOUR FREE MEMBERSHIP

You'll be able to access great research from about 2,400
of our sources for free in your search results on Powerize.
Your search results will feature two kinds of listings, which
will be labeled appropriately:

Free: The information you as a member can access
for free will be clearly labeled in your search results.

Pay-per-view: Other documents will only be available to you on
a pay-per-view basis. Free summaries are available for most pay-
per-view sources, especially news articles. You'll always be able 
to review the free summary before making a purchasing decision. 
The average price for pay-per-view documents is less than $3.00.

You probably noticed that we did not ask you for your credit card
information when you registered. We will ask for your credit card
information only if you want to access a pay-per-view document that
you aren't entitled to access for free.
