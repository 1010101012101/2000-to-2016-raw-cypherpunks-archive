I don't have to imagine it. I have been on the witness stand trying 
to explain terminology in technical documents that was quoted out of 
context by opposing council. (We won, but it cost a bundle in legal 
fees and management time.) I would also remind you of the _NSAKEY 
flap and countless product liability cases where minutia in 
engineering documents played a pivotal role.  Also there is a big 
difference between comments in source code or Unix command names and 
a technical specification, like an RFC, that undergoes a formal 
review and approval process.  The last will be given much more weight.

Even if your spec contained an explicit definition of 
"non-repudiation" that made clear its technical limitations, there is 
a high likelihood that the public and the legal system will be 
mislead. But the definition you cite dose not even do that. Here is 
what my "Random House Dictionary of the English Language" says about 
the meaning of "prevent:"

"... Prevent, hamper, hinder, impede refer to different degrees of 
stoppage of action or progress. To prevent is to stop something 
effectually by forestalling action and rendering it impossible: 'to 
prevent the sending of a message'..."

No cryptographic technology that I am aware of can fairly be said to 
render the denial of an act impossible.
