That is what he did say:  This thread started when someone
proposed publishing thought crimes into an irretrievable medium
such as freenet in order to render moot any future court orders
to hand over all copies of some item of forbidden knowledge.

Unicorn condescendingly explained that would be illegal, but with
suitable mystic legal incantation it would be legal to escrow the
forbidden information with some offshore lawyer.

Which is of course total bunkum -- for the court can be as
unamused by one act as the other, but the act that requires more
explanations and legal documents gives them more handles to undo
it and more reasons to put one in prison, and more inconvenient
knowledge about one's affairs and activities, generates more
legal costs, and puts one in front of the unamused judge for
longer, giving one more opportunities to get into deeper trouble.
