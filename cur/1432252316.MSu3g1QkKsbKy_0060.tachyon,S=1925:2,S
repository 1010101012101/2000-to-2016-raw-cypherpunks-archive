There's that, and the watermark removal you mentioned,
(see Felton et al.) but why bother?  Someone from someplace
not under the grip of the DMCA regime will buy the marked file,
and not care about its propogation.  If incoming media files are
blocked by a national firewall (no first amendment for imports..
customs can seize your porn when you re-enter the US)
well, crypto just laughs at this.
