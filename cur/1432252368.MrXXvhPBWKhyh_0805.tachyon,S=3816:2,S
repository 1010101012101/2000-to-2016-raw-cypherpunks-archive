Sure, no problem, if the manufacturer is not acting under state
direction.  Let us instead suppose, as seems likely, all
manufacturers are directed to upgrade TPM with clipper chip
technology.

Obviously as long as TPM is not backed by legal force, it cannot
do anything very bad.   But the TPM technology puts my throat
where the legislators can cut it.

The hardware supports it.  The spec says the software and CA
policies will not.  The spec also says that both software and
policies can and will be frequently revised.

There is obvious potential there to back TCPM with anti
circumvention laws, and all sorts of unpleasantness.
