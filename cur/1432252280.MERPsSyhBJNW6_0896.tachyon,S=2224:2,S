GoldNow is in the process of helping set up an entire small island
population (pop. 1900) to accept/trade in e-gold. The second highest
priority we have is to educate the new e-gold users on keyloggers,
trojans etc.

The place is Norfolk Island, approx. 450 miles northwest of New Zealand.
They are the descendants of the mutineers from the Bounty.
Pitcairn Island was where they came from. The Queen of England at the
time asked them to move to Norfolk Island instead, which they did...
interested parties can read the history at http://www.nf

The author Collen McCulloch lives on Norfolk Island, as well as singer
Helen Reddy.

NF folk claim to be independent from Australia. OZ government says they're
not. They have had a bun fight for about 150 years about this very issue.
There is an uneasy truce at present, but the Australian government demands
that NF do not mint their own currency. So, that's where GoldNow & e-gold
steps in...
