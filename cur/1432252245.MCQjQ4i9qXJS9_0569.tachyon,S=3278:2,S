WTF movement indeed.  

One of the biggest tactics of the feds seems to be creating a
"movement" or some other sort of organization, then accusing people of
leading, supporting, creating or otherwise being a part of it.

I can think of lots of examples....  Steve Jackson Games, DeCSS,
EarthFirst, OK city, etc.  (It's not just for geeks, that's for sure).

The theory of a "movement" is part of the FUD surrounding Bell.  It's
not that HE's assassinating people, but that his "followers" might.

Subpoenas getting email addresses for Cypherpunks subscribers might
not be part of Bell's case, but are easy to imagine for similar
federal witch hunts.  Welcome to the "movement."
