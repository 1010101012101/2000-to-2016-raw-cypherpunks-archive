// attempt at a basic comparative example here...

--- code play ---

first to reference the previous transparent ziplock with letters (ACID) to
provide conceptual framework for what follows... and how the *interpretive*
aspect of the code, its encoding/decoding and encrypting/decrypting, may
likewise relate in some way as a transformative, calculative process (if
not phase-change). not going theory, just abstraction into a realm of
N-dimensions and probability versus linear equation exegesis...

here are some online resources then for examining the letters [A,C,I,D], as
recombinational variables:

#Internet Anagram Server mentioned two solutions:
http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html

    CAD I, and ACID

#Scrabble Word Finder lists 8 word solutions:
http://www.scrabblefinder.com/solver/

   4 letters: acid, cadi, caid
   3 letters: aid, cad
   2 letters: ad, ai, id

And other scrabble word searches find additional, including 'da' and 'i'

So there are these permutative interactions that can occur within and
between signs (letters and their arrangement, though also symbols) and this
is mapped out to some degree with anagrams, palindromes, ambigrams, rebus',
kangaroo words (word within a word), and so on.

#Palindromes, anagrams, and 9 other names for alphabetical antics
http://theweek.com/article/index/244111/palindromes-anagrams-and-9-other-names-for-alphabetical-antics

In terms of language, this is a zone of paradox where multiple meanings
could exist in a 'string' that could have more than one interpretation, say
the word 'top' and 'top', one indicating 'the upper part of something' and
the other 'a child's toy' via dictionary reference. yet without context how
can you determine which viewpoint is correct: is there actually a 1:1
meaning or is it one to many? Thus, in some sense, weighted given the
environment it occupies for observation. Thus paradox, though also
superposition, and an aspect of the unknown or mystery within the ordinary
and everyday that in a binary worldview would seek to determine a 1:1
answer and discard the other 'variables', and linearly "progress" in such
computations down a particular _unique path that then is equated with _the
correct path, analytically, even though potentially arbitrary or flawed.

Any such search engines for 'words' can be broken via substitutions, as
mentioned before, and doing so would limit or bound the interpretation to a
smaller set. Thus using a number one instead of capital 'i' causes the
library reference to ignore the variable, discard it from consideration,
and only analyze ACD; returning only 3 sets: cad, ad, da. So it moves from
8 words to 3 words due to illiteracy or incapacity to translate or
substitute, as mentioned previously.

Yet once again consider the ACID letters, in particular the letter 'I'
again as it may be hypothetically or conceptually connected to the letter D
and result in new letter potentials: P, d, q, b --- likewise the letter 'C'
could be turned sideways into the letters U and n.  Note the transgression
of upper and lowercase alphabets, opening up a much wider range of letter
combinations via allowing multiple scales to co-exist in the evaluative
framework. Further, the letters C and I can be combined into a second
letter D.

Thus A,C,I,D, can become [A,C,I,D,D,U,n,p,d,q,b] as a potential string, if
'suspending judgement' and allowing time to configure and reconfigured *in
a probability space* these co-existing parallel potentials. inputting the
string (aciddunpdqb) at the Scrabble Word Finder leads to 110 words, with
six letters the highest word count of eleven total.

A question being, is the 'string' ACID really only ACID, as if 1:1 in terms
of code and its meaning, and if 'decrypted' perhaps CAD I would be a
result; and likewise, what if this could range to 110 words, without
considering two or more letter acronyms and abbreviations, and then, each
of these unpacked "variables" could potentially be related to one another
as a structural framework from which to further reveal or construct code,
such as via the subset words: candid, baud, pin. Perhaps keys or a bermuda
triangle zone that submerges or reveals purposefully scuttled content. This
location related to another inside the same hash function: cab, pain, quid;
or yet another: cabin, cupid, id.

Essentially sets related if not collided and run against other sets, one
against many, symmetries or asymmetrical dynamics, spins, planes, fields,
layers, levels, zones of meaning shared and unshared. Perhaps someone could
even have the key and yet get lost in the ever expanding forest of never
ending choices, thus: the labyrinth is constructed by each interaction and
decision and without the correct context, variables in their superposition
could remain hidden in their correct interpretation (A=A)

how could you know without an observer of shared identity and same model of
empirical truth to reference, given N-possibilities for each choice and
evaluation, potentially, as this is bounded by whatever the keyspace may
be: only capital letters, alphanumeric plus symbols, whatever. and
likewise, in terms of computation and equipment, could this same HASH
function be recreated _without identical equipment, due to the floating
point aspect (if it were to still exist) in computating irrational numbers,
given a necessary boundary to stop and round up or down at that limit, thus
forcing alphabets or equations into one hash scenario or another-- and
could enough of this be controlled to even allow two machines to function
identically or may there inherently be noise (chaos) between them, and so
it is an issue of approximation, creating the same structures via unpacking
a superposition ~bit-string and yet having variability still within these
parallel models

It just reminds so much of enigma and patch cords that perhaps the the RNG
with patch-cord like custom circuit wiring could tweak machines to a shared
match or 'entangled parallelism' that technology may be limited in allowing
due to limits to standardization at the level of unique processors with
slightly different characteristics, processor temperatures or working
transistors that could somehow effect computation, speed, rounding, at what
boundary the evaluation is bounded. perhaps different bounding could
provide different codes or access: abc^10 opening up one hash and abc^2
opening up another entirely different subset universe in terms of what
appears in its relational structuring. different tech, different hashspace
(?) given how much infinity can be modeled and to what extent -- And thus
what might keys be. what if the starting variable was used multiple times,
such as opened at one level and then reopened at another, and these
compared, or some mathematical computation occurring to parse each against
the other, and using that derivation for the keyspace. The idea of custom
wiring in addition just unpacking then potentially allowing one version of
crypto-signage to be used many times and in many different ways, as if
signpost even or relay or storage device, as if such crypto could be
infrastructure, if not alive like a sensor network in terms of feeding and
routing information through such matrices

it is curious if perhaps this is opposite the idea of the hash, in that it
is an inversion or reverse hash function or something such, due to its
exponentiality of parallelism and superposition versus linearity that
appears standard to the naive outside observer of this.

Just to provide a different example entirely, for consideration- imagine a
two variable string, [v][w], in this superposition context. Despite the
known transmutations such as the letters being flipped and turned, such
that two letters v = w, or when flipped could equate to acronym 'mn', it is
more than a single letter as the variable and instead, say, the signs S and
O that are overlapped for a single variable [v], such that their layering
appears as if the number 8 or letter B. and likewise, a second variable as
letters F and L traced atop one another, resulting in the combined letter
E, much like a Jasper Johns painting or 7 segment or 16 segment display. In
this approach, [B][E] then could, as a 'string' carry these other letter
potentials within it or could no longer be decipherable as a standard
alphabet letter and instead as a structural pattern, and then computation
could occur via breaking down these patterns in that abstraction, mapped to
potential letters and numbers and their recombination. For instance the
letter B is equivalent to number 8 and via 7-segment displays, encompasses
all numbers 0-9 in its geometry. Thus what if [3][E] were suddenly
evaluated in a context of letters [S,O,B,E,L,F] and its 47 words unpacked
from this starting point; say 'fobs' <=> 'lobes', as a subset universe
within which, via another key, may match to a circuit elsewhere or provide
meaning and thus 'shared framework for interpretation' whether intentional
or unintentional. likewise, lesbo and sol, fe, Io, os & so -- leading into
potential transcendent oblivion... or other dimensionality beyond what can
be determined, predicted or controlled even- the RNG as REG, tapping cosmic
circuitry as if interdimensional tendrils of noosphere

--- another aspect ---

in terms of superposition variables, the length of [x] in the string
[x,y,z] could be _anything. the bit as container could hold a bounded
infinity, it could hold a mathematical function, it could hold five numbers
or a hundred million trillion, or could nest or subset other variables in
chained relations, such that x = xz. and thus a larger string could
generate more complex entry code or certain structures, yet it may be
unrelated to solving the interior of the hashing package because its inside
is larger than its outside

symbols especially relevant here, HIOX, fractal codes, ciphers within
signage so that it is beyond ordinary language to begin with, such an
approach could be two variable and encompass a vast universe of relations,
say as a partial HIOX symbol (16 segment) or fractal-based sign of letters
embedded one inside the next, say a Y being letters I and V combined, yet
far beyond this and into a keyword written inside a starting letter, at
scale, and moving downward or across, and having that be a variable that
unpacks certain letters and characters and not others, thus potentially
relating this outside with inside via the starting string, thus providing
context via its superposition options that may be more complex
"structurally", all of this requiring a standard approach that is shared,
grounded in truth and logical reasoning, to allow 'the language as code' to
be useful for shared communication, carrying ideas, or being the idea-
seemingly about providing context, creating the conditions allowing for
such interpretation to exist

also, it should be noted that this could easily involve numbers and so
alphanumerics could exist in a state of superposition between their
mathematical and linguistic meaning, again 'variable' in terms of
interpretive framework; for instance, a number 4 may be missing its
hypotenuse or upper-left bracket -- given character style or typographic
standard -- and thus it may look instead like a sideways letter T, in some
sense. And thus the glyph representing sideways-T could *potentially*
occupy both the realm of the letter T and-or the number 4 in terms of
superposition, given that it is somewhat corrupted or incomplete or has
extra information (such as Q and O similarly).

thus a starting bit-string could have strange symbols that could map into
letters and numbers via transformation (its de|con-struction via
constructions and destructions) of subset relations and dynamics, unpacking
particular characters and relations, creating a particular type of noise
field for other content, perhaps framing it for interpretation. And thus
language itself, tending towards noise if not illegible, may look like
actual hash code to start the string, then unpack its contained information
based on these variables that may normalize within certain parameters and
not others, providing both signal and noise- and perhaps having multiple
keys or no keys and to be accessed or referenced via temporary tunings or
harmonizations, as if emergent data, or a particular correlated state of
shared mind, et cetera

--- example ---

so i could provide a ~bit-string (do not know the correct word so that is a
conceptual placeholder until someone those knows what this is define the
concepts accurately) such as the following and it could be assumed to
operate and function within these stated dynamics...

   [nv+x!]

in other words: [n][v][+][x][!]

And here is what i think is peculiarly interesting- is that i could shared
with you 'the key' that created this string, for a subsequent parallel hash
function, via superposition, yet it may or may not be relevant to what is
unpacked on the inside unless it were activated, and thus it is like an
on/off switch that may not be in the interpretative context and so can be
routed around if compromised, or used as ruse and trap to set up
alternative interior corridors and pathways to checkmate mimics via false
perspectives.

so, running through the example... potentials: n, c, u, v, n, >, <, +, t,
j, r, x, +, v, y, ., l, i, !

Note duplications are added for combination potentials, especially useful
for acronyms or symbolic 'compressed' meaning, mirroring of palindromes,
etc. likewise, punctuation is allowed for its dual-use language capacity,
the exclamation point rotated into the lowercase letter i, and period
useful perhaps in other ways as well. As with plus sign and the lowercase
t.  the issue of archetypal transference alongside transformative mutation,
as if organization, allowing for entropic reversal or coherence gains even
via losses, such is the "calculus" of the signage, as if moving from
concept 1 (speed) to concept 2 (acceleration) yet within a different
conceptual realm, wide ranging if not arbitrary

and thus the issue of *potential*, as with potential energy- *potential
meaning* and potential interpretation, framework, structure, that may exist
momentarily or collapse given shared or unshared identity, referent,
whatnot.

so it would be possible to say 'cat' is what generated the original string,
the upside-down caret (^) removed of the crossbar a hint or clue to the
uppercase A at another scale (uppercase versus lower), and the plus sign
functioning as a category-crossing letter t. and that could be the basis
for generating the hash funktion, via this string-- and it may or may not
be relevant, it may or may not be used beyond this threshold, it may or may
not be the framework once the interior is unpacked, and this depends on the
keyspace and how many variables will be referenced on the inside, though
could also be on the outside as well, and only [n,v,+] could be used in
their permutations and nested recombinations- meaning different hashes
could be referenced and made active depending either on generating key, as
a partial string (thus secret) or it could be entirely open and yet of an
unshared POV, bounded and limited in observation via threshold of
eavesdropper, and thus their biasing could force only some variables and
not others, which it is proposed may make it nearly impossible to decipher
externally without knowing what is being communicated in a given framework
or context that is only partially observed and evaluated. such that it may
not add up the same, just as unpacking the string with different hardware
capabilities may generate different random interrelations as noise though
also structure, if somehow calculations are not tuned A:A and instead it is
closer to A1=A2, though compensated for. it is as if relativism itself is
the encryption envelope, its warping skew distortion where the data can
hide within and between and the revealed structures *whatever they may be*
could be one-time pad connections or stable grids or force fields spanning
multiple such hash universes that interconnect or feed data one into
another again perhaps like wormholes

further, phonetics could be used for substitutions such that the original
lowercase letter 'c' and its subset [v, ^, c, n] could be replaced by 'k'
such that kat=cat in terms of pronunciation yet has no trace of a c from
which to decipher via a dictionary search, unless phonetic. in this way the
original string [nv+x!] could instead be: [kv+x!] and generate an entirely
different inferiority to reference, which may or may not be keyed to 'cat'
in any given instance, unless it were to be, yet may not reveal anything
even if the key is known, given perspective and variable timing and
interpretations. it could be throwaway or only active on occasion or a
divining method such as organizing cards out of a Tarot deck for reading, a
process that establishes interpretation though in a magical context, and
thus perhaps more ritual or procedural yet still an important vital step.
i.e. if everything is in tune, because the arbitrary could cut either way
if not 'literate' and capable of handling this kind of code and
interpretation as it were- it could drive you crazy

of all the myriad possibilities, this is a infinitesimal example and it
would be in the collection of all various techniques and approaches and
evaluation and surveying their coherence and decoherence dynamics and
related functionality that perhaps a new approach to coding could be
developed in this alphanumeric and symbolic parallelism where sign=sign is
essentially outside of the language as it operates in consciousness, unless
brought into a realm of shared truth (1) and shared perspectives for
exchange. thus creating or *revealing* that realm, essentially navigable
infinity and issues of markers, lighthouses, obelisks, waypoints,
ecosystems and ecologies, mazes, traps, that mapping data or mining,
storing, conveying, relaying information within preexisting contexts,
frameworks, could be utilized- made infrastructural, another paradigm
entirely that aligns with consciousness, not the deadzone of the silicon
wasteland as if final destiny of life with the singularity, leading to
death and nothingness as ideal future.

current and currency. a realm for those literate and of shared awareness.
keeping the lies and the liars and their falsehood out of the equations,
trapping them in their own false perspectives and thus bounding the
interaction while the false perspective is dismantled, freezing everything
binary in its place while the word keeping spinning. this, perhaps a
reverse-vertigo effect of the nonsensibility of the perceived world, though
from another point of view. the oppressive ideology extinguished, no longer
capable of sustaining the lies and controlling events from an external
position, losing power of 'shared awareness' by dissimilar or dismantled
structures-- sitting ducks. quack,quack.

pared, or some mathematical computation occurring to parse each against the=
 other, and using that derivation for the keyspace. The idea of custom wiri=
ng in addition just unpacking then potentially allowing one version of cryp=
to-signage to be used many times and in many different ways, as if signpost=
 even or relay or storage device, as if such crypto could be infrastructure=
, if not alive like a sensor network in terms of feeding and routing inform=
ation through such matrices<br>
<br></div><div>it is curious if perhaps this is opposite the idea of the ha=
sh, in that it is an inversion or reverse hash function or something such, =
due to its exponentiality of parallelism and superposition versus linearity=
 that appears standard to the naive outside observer of this. <br>
<br></div><div>Just to provide a different example entirely, for considerat=
ion- imagine a two variable string, [v][w], in this superposition context. =
Despite the known transmutations such as the letters being flipped and turn=
ed, such that two letters v =3D w, or when flipped could equate to acronym =
&#39;mn&#39;, it is more than a single letter as the variable and instead, =
say, the signs S and O that are overlapped for a single variable [v], such =
that their layering appears as if the number 8 or letter B. and likewise, a=
 second variable as letters F and L traced atop one another, resulting in t=
he combined letter E, much like a Jasper Johns painting or 7 segment or 16 =
segment display. In this approach, [B][E] then could, as a &#39;string&#39;=
 carry these other letter potentials within it or could no longer be deciph=
erable as a standard alphabet letter and instead as a structural pattern, a=
nd then computation could occur via breaking down these patterns in that ab=
straction, mapped to potential letters and numbers and their recombination.=
 For instance the letter B is equivalent to number 8 and via 7-segment disp=
lays, encompasses all numbers 0-9 in its geometry. Thus what if [3][E] were=
 suddenly evaluated in a context of letters [S,O,B,E,L,F] and its 47 words =
unpacked from this starting point; say &#39;fobs&#39; &lt;=3D&gt; &#39;lobe=
s&#39;, as a subset universe within which, via another key, may match to a =
circuit elsewhere or provide meaning and thus &#39;shared framework for int=
erpretation&#39; whether intentional or unintentional. likewise, lesbo and =
sol, fe, Io, os &amp; so -- leading into potential transcendent oblivion...=
 or other dimensionality beyond what can be determined, predicted or contro=
lled even- the RNG as REG, tapping cosmic circuitry as if interdimensional =
tendrils of noosphere<br>
<br></div><div>--- another aspect ---<br></div><div><br></div><div>in terms=
 of superposition variables, the length of [x] in the string [x,y,z] could =
be _anything. the bit as container could hold a bounded infinity, it could =
hold a mathematical function, it could hold five numbers or a hundred milli=
on trillion, or could nest or subset other variables in chained relations, =
such that x =3D xz. and thus a larger string could generate more complex en=
try code or certain structures, yet it may be unrelated to solving the inte=
rior of the hashing package because its inside is larger than its outside<b=
r>
<br></div><div>symbols especially relevant here, HIOX, fractal codes, ciphe=
rs within signage so that it is beyond ordinary language to begin with, suc=
h an approach could be two variable and encompass a vast universe of relati=
ons, say as a partial HIOX symbol (16 segment) or fractal-based sign of let=
ters embedded one inside the next, say a Y being letters I and V combined, =
yet far beyond this and into a keyword written inside a starting letter, at=
 scale, and moving downward or across, and having that be a variable that u=
npacks certain letters and characters and not others, thus potentially rela=
ting this outside with inside via the starting string, thus providing conte=
xt via its superposition options that may be more complex &quot;structurall=
y&quot;, all of this requiring a standard approach that is shared, grounded=
 in truth and logical reasoning, to allow &#39;the language as code&#39; to=
 be useful for shared communication, carrying ideas, or being the idea- see=
mingly about providing context, creating the conditions allowing for such i=
nterpretation to exist<br>
<br></div><div>also, it should be noted that this could easily involve numb=
ers and so alphanumerics could exist in a state of superposition between th=
eir mathematical and linguistic meaning, again &#39;variable&#39; in terms =
of interpretive framework; for instance, a number 4 may be missing its hypo=
tenuse or upper-left bracket -- given character style or typographic standa=
rd -- and thus it may look instead like a sideways letter T, in some sense.=
 And thus the glyph representing sideways-T could *potentially* occupy both=
 the realm of the letter T and-or the number 4 in terms of superposition, g=
iven that it is somewhat corrupted or incomplete or has extra information (=
such as Q and O similarly).<br>
<br></div><div>thus a starting bit-string could have strange symbols that c=
ould map into letters and numbers via transformation (its de|con-struction =
via constructions and destructions) of subset relations and dynamics, unpac=
king particular characters and relations, creating a particular type of noi=
se field for other content, perhaps framing it for interpretation. And thus=
 language itself, tending towards noise if not illegible, may look like act=
ual hash code to start the string, then unpack its contained information ba=
sed on these variables that may normalize within certain parameters and not=
 others, providing both signal and noise- and perhaps having multiple keys =
or no keys and to be accessed or referenced via temporary tunings or harmon=
izations, as if emergent data, or a particular correlated state of shared m=
ind, et cetera<br>
<br></div><div>--- example --- <br><br></div><div>so i could provide a ~bit=
-string (do not know the correct word so that is a conceptual placeholder u=
ntil someone those knows what this is define the concepts accurately) such =
as the following and it could be assumed to operate and function within the=
se stated dynamics...<br>
<br>=C2=A0=C2=A0 [nv+x!]<br><br></div><div>in other words: [n][v][+][x][!]<=
br><br></div><div>And here is what i think is peculiarly interesting- is th=
at i could shared with you &#39;the key&#39; that created this string, for =
a subsequent parallel hash function, via superposition, yet it may or may n=
ot be relevant to what is unpacked on the inside unless it were activated, =
and thus it is like an on/off switch that may not be in the interpretative =
context and so can be routed around if compromised, or used as ruse and tra=
p to set up alternative interior corridors and pathways to checkmate mimics=
 via false perspectives.<br>
<br></div><div>so, running through the example... potentials: n, c, u, v, n=
, &gt;, &lt;, +, t, j, r, x, +, v, y, ., l, i, !<br><br></div><div>Note dup=
lications are added for combination potentials, especially useful for acron=
yms or symbolic &#39;compressed&#39; meaning, mirroring of palindromes, etc=
. likewise, punctuation is allowed for its dual-use language capacity, the =
exclamation point rotated into the lowercase letter i, and period useful pe=
rhaps in other ways as well. As with plus sign and the lowercase t.=C2=A0 t=
he issue of archetypal transference alongside transformative mutation, as i=
f organization, allowing for entropic reversal or coherence gains even via =
losses, such is the &quot;calculus&quot; of the signage, as if moving from =
concept 1 (speed) to concept 2 (acceleration) yet within a different concep=
tual realm, wide ranging if not arbitrary<br>
<br></div><div>and thus the issue of *potential*, as with potential energy-=
 *potential meaning* and potential interpretation, framework, structure, th=
at may exist momentarily or collapse given shared or unshared identity, ref=
erent, whatnot. <br>
<br></div><div>so it would be possible to say &#39;cat&#39; is what generat=
ed the original string, the upside-down caret (^) removed of the crossbar a=
 hint or clue to the uppercase A at another scale (uppercase versus lower),=
 and the plus sign functioning as a category-crossing letter t. and that co=
uld be the basis for generating the hash funktion, via this string-- and it=
 may or may not be relevant, it may or may not be used beyond this threshol=
d, it may or may not be the framework once the interior is unpacked, and th=
is depends on the keyspace and how many variables will be referenced on the=
 inside, though could also be on the outside as well, and only [n,v,+] coul=
d be used in their permutations and nested recombinations- meaning differen=
t hashes could be referenced and made active depending either on generating=
 key, as a partial string (thus secret) or it could be entirely open and ye=
t of an unshared POV, bounded and limited in observation via threshold of e=
avesdropper, and thus their biasing could force only some variables and not=
 others, which it is proposed may make it nearly impossible to decipher ext=
ernally without knowing what is being communicated in a given framework or =
context that is only partially observed and evaluated. such that it may not=
 add up the same, just as unpacking the string with different hardware capa=
bilities may generate different random interrelations as noise though also =
structure, if somehow calculations are not tuned A:A and instead it is clos=
er to A1=3DA2, though compensated for. it is as if relativism itself is the=
 encryption envelope, its warping skew distortion where the data can hide w=
ithin and between and the revealed structures *whatever they may be* could =
be one-time pad connections or stable grids or force fields spanning multip=
le such hash universes that interconnect or feed data one into another agai=
n perhaps like wormholes<br>
<br></div><div>further, phonetics could be used for substitutions such that=
 the original lowercase letter &#39;c&#39; and its subset [v, ^, c, n] coul=
d be replaced by &#39;k&#39; such that kat=3Dcat in terms of pronunciation =
yet has no trace of a c from which to decipher via a dictionary search, unl=
ess phonetic. in this way the original string [nv+x!] could instead be: [kv=
+x!] and generate an entirely different inferiority to reference, which may=
 or may not be keyed to &#39;cat&#39; in any given instance, unless it were=
 to be, yet may not reveal anything even if the key is known, given perspec=
tive and variable timing and interpretations. it could be throwaway or only=
 active on occasion or a divining method such as organizing cards out of a =
Tarot deck for reading, a process that establishes interpretation though in=
 a magical context, and thus perhaps more ritual or procedural yet still an=
 important vital step. i.e. if everything is in tune, because the arbitrary=
 could cut either way if not &#39;literate&#39; and capable of handling thi=
s kind of code and interpretation as it were- it could drive you crazy<br>
<br></div><div>of all the myriad possibilities, this is a infinitesimal exa=
mple and it would be in the collection of all various techniques and approa=
