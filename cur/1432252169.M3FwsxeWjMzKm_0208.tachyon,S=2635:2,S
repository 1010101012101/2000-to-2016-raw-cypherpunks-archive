Yes, some National Emergencies are more equal than others.

Seriously, I recollect some studies done of just which National 
Emergencies, National Decision Directives, and Executive Orders were 
declared when, and for how long. My recollection is that the ones 
Lincoln declared remained in force for decades, until the next 
crop...and possibly were never rescinded.

Some of the ones in the 1970s and 80s give the guy in the White House 
the power to seize all radio and television stations, all newspapers, 
and to take control of all factories. Pretty much the whole ball of 
wax, more than any of the fascists like Mussolini, Roosevelt, Tojo, or 
Hitler ever got.
