A randomly setup ssh server without DNS will find itself brute force  
attacked. Darknets are setup specifically for detection of scans. One side 
effect of v6, is determining how best to deploy darknets, as we can't just 
take one or two blocks to do it anymore. We'll need to interweave the 
darknets with the production blocks. I wish it was possible via DHCPv6-PD 
to assign a block minus a sub-block (hey, don't use this /64 in the /48 I 
gave you). It could be that darknets will have to go and flow analysis is 
all we'll be left with.
