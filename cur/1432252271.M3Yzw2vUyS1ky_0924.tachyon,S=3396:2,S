 >>because almost all the libertarians here are anarchists.

I think we are all out of libertarians.(phew!) Fresh air...Aaahh!

 >>(Except, of course, by your peculiar use of the word "anarchist", 
whereby an anarchist is some who supports an all powerful state that rules 
by terror, similar to that which the anarchists of Catalonia wound up 
implementing.)

That is a filthy lie.Last week I urged cypherpunks to compare and contrast 
the noam chomsky article,"Objectivity and liberal scholarship."with the 
material jamesd has on display at his website.Also I just reviewed a book 
on spain at Amazon
called "Durutti: The People Armed.if anyones interested.Jamesd is a proven 
liar on libertarian socialism,communism and anarchism.He seems rational 
enough on all subjects other than those.No anarchist supports a powerful,or 
indeed,any state.Jim Bell seems to be the closest thing to a trad anarchist 
I've seen on this site.The anarcho-capitalists here are fakes,phonies and 
frauds that are running but they cant hide,I can see the whites of their 
eyes.Calling ted turner socialist is not peculiar!?
