Yes, exactly.  If you want stable money then you need either a natural
resource with naturally limited growth (e.g., gold) (and some other
features), or an artificially limited resource (e.g., paper money).
The latter is always susceptible to politically caused inflation.  Any
cryptographic coin based on proof of work is a disaster because of
Moore's law and because the "work" is wasted energy -- and energy,
you'll note, is a very precious resource.  Ergo, a cryptographic coin
needs to be based on trusted issuers (or something else I've not seen
before nor thought of), and that means, effectively, a fiat currency.
Crypto is NOT a solution to political problems; never has been, never
will be.

Here's a thought experiment: if the present value of all actual,
tangible property, things, capital (production and service capacity),
as well as less tangible things such as people, and institutions
-altogether, basically, a nation's patrimony- were far, far exceeded
by nominal value stored in money in banks and mattresses, would that
money really be worth all that much?  I suspect that the answer is
"no".  I suspect that the most valuable feature of money is not to
store value in the long-term, but to lubricate commerce, that is, to
enable transactions on a basis better than barter.

It's always possible to get some people to do things that are not in
their interest.  See various cults.  (Note: I'm not saying bitcoin is
a cult.)
