You could do worse, my entropy is real.
Whatever your take on "memes"
I predict that certain messages play better than others.
Analysis of the opposition's frame of minds are key.

The immediate tool is that of insinuation.
You dismiss some things as chaff or fluff
put you cannot avoid the priming effect
that well crafted misdirection employs.

We protect our selves from disruptive knowledge
We artistically wield our ignorance like a shield
Our creativity hides our blind spots.
Security through certainty is surely vunerable
