The Dixie Chicks catered to the right wing, country music, monster 
truck rally crowd. Not surprising that when they insulted their crowd's 
leader, the crowd reacted.

Being against the war hasn't hurt Michael Moore's popularity in _his_ 
crowd.

It's silly to say that "freedom of speech" implies that people should 
continue to find popular those who have insulted their views or their 
leaders.
