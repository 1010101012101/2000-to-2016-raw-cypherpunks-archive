What you're complaining about is behavior that is typical of
bureaucracies which often do what is easier instead of what is smarter,
better or right. In a bureaucracy your risk is minimized by following
procedure. Minimizing the risk of individuals within the organization is
not equivalent to optimizing the organization's performance. Hardly a
description of a control system that can keep away from the rails.
