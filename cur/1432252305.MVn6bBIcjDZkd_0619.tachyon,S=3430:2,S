Patronizing claptrap, you wouldn't be blocking a thing. For example, the 
Google Archives has dozens of listings of a NSA researcher who openly 
participates in technical conferences, giving his full Ft. Meade address, 
office phone number--and AOL e-mail address. Before you dismiss this as 
just something another dumb fed might do, you might find it relevant that 
he's done a lot of work in IDS, GII security, reliable distributed systems, 
and deception. Who would ever expect anything interesting from an AOL user? 
That's precisely the point. 

That ought to be enough keywords: go dig for it yourself, and if you're 
really lucky, you'll find PDFs of his papers and start learning a little 
bit about why you haven't quite got the feds as outsmarted as you think you 
do.
