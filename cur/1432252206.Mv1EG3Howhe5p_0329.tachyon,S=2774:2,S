On the bright side the Hannsen files are being prepared for online release 
soon and reports of TMs death seem slightly premature.Also as psychiatrists 
tape evidence for clients trials and lawyers give their clients up,its 
comforting to have the
ROCK of journalism to fall back on.(not sure about confessionals but they 
are looking better as an interview space.
