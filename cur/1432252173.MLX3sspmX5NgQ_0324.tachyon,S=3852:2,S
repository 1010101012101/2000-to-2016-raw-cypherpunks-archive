This is very old news.

As I reported at the end of September:

On Sunday, September 30, 2001, at 09:24 PM, Tim May wrote:

I was checking some of my URLs for maps of nuclear power plants, maps

from the U.S.G.

Guess what? Many of them are gone. The Web caches are not fully useful,
as the indexed sites point to the subpages containing the large image
GIFs (and other formats). So Google's cache has the first page, but all
attempts to access the subpages give the same "information no longer
available" sorts of messages.

The main Nuclear Regulatory Commission site no longer allows downloading
of maps, and results in this message:

http://www.nrc.gov/NRC/REACTOR/GEOSPATIAL/lvsites.html
Nuclear Site Locations

This site is no longer available.


For another example,
