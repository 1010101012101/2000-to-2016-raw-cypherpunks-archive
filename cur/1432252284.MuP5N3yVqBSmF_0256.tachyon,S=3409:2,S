And I should have added the obvious: add some Arabic names that are 
relatives of actual Arabs complicit in Washington's police state 
activities....perhaps the name of a college student son or daughter of 
an Ragheadistani assistant embassy official, that sort of thing. These 
names will blend in with the other Arabic-appearing names.

Add your ideas!
