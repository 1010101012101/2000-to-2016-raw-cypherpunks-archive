I guess it is unfortunate that I personally disagree with the article, almost in
its entirety.    I fully support any technological means to prevent the junk
from ever entering my system, using my bandwidth, my productivity and my storage
space, while some "decision" or another is being made.   Sure, to some it seems
arcane to using blocking methods at the server level, but the quantity of the
spew alone justifies the practice.
I have never considered it a form of "freedom" for an advertiser to pummel me
with advertising at my own expense.   While I realize not all advertising should
be considered as spam, most of it is, in my opinion, and consequently I use a
variety of methods to prevent the MTA from even connecting to my mail server.
If the widespread use of this technology hurts email advertising, then so much
the better. I would prefer email systems be able to return to their intended
purpose.  My email hosting service provides the free option of unfiltered and
filtered (spam blacklisting), and it is no surprise that over 98% of my clients
opt for the filtered routing.
I will continue to support legislation and other methods to transfer the cost of
advertising back to the advertiser.  If there are enforceable penalties for
fraudulent message headers and routing, so be it.  If the legislation forces
dissidents and whistleblowers to use postal mail, so much the better.  I do not
agree that these so-called "freedoms" need to be at my expense.

Legitimate email - deliver as intended.   non-legitimate email - block the
connection at the server.

For this to be taken seriously one must be able to -define spam- as if it
were a mathematical entity (eg a 'point'). It must be absolutely
differentiable from -all- other speech.

You can't do that, nobody can.

Anti-spam bills are worse than spam because they put transient feelings of
anger above the principles of freedom.

Freedom is -not- free!
