Saddle up.

Remember, the first Texas "Rangers" were antsy young last-born males
sent out to kill Indians freelance so that Maw and Paw and Junior and
spouse could raise cattle in peace.

The weapons hackers of their time, they were. A couple of them showed
up at Colt's house Back East one day with a few modifications for the
original six-shooter, and a large order for same, as modified.

Colt became profitable.


Turns out that the Commanches were holding their own with bows and
arrows until some rangers figured out that a few guys with a few
Colts apiece could ride up and take out a whole war-party in a few
minutes.

More to the point, once you cleaned out a bunch of injuns, *somebody*
had to ranch the land, right?

:-)

Cheers,
RAH
