"...Intellectual property rights create large patterns of interference in 
the freedom of others because abstract objects are a crucial kind of 
resource. Abstract objects are vital to all kinds of social, cultural and 
economic projects..."

"...private, arbitrary, unchecked, global power will become a part of life 
in the information society. A world in which seed rights, algorithms, DNA 
and chemical formulae are owned by a few, a world in which information 
flows can be coordinated by information-media barons, might indeed be an 
information feudalism."
