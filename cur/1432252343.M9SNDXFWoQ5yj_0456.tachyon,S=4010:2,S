Conqueror of enigma code finally honoured

By Paul Francis

23 June 2001

Alan Turing, the national hero who broke the Nazi's enigma
code and is credited with turning the tide of the World War
Two, is to be honoured with a life-size statue.

The bronze monument, which will be unveiled today, comes
almost 50 years after the brilliant scientist was driven to
suicide by persecution over his homosexuality. Five years after
its inception, the 20,000 pound sterling sculpture of Turing
sitting on a bench holding an apple will be displayed
Manchester's Sackville Park in the city centre.

The mathematical genius became a national hero after his
involvement in World War Two, he also helped invent the
inaugural computer, at Manchester University, but was
persecuted and prosecuted for his homosexuality. He
committed suicide in 1954 by eating a poisoned apple.

Many believe Turing has never been recognised properly for his
outstanding contribution to science. But Glyn Hughes, the
statue's creator, is confident that Turing has finally earned his
rightful place in the history books. Hughes, from Adlington near
Chorley, said: " It's stunningly realistic. I'm sure it will go a dirty
black over time, but it looks wonderful today."
