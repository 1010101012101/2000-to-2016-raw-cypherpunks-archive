Absolutely.  And another application where store and forward message
passing is critical is to allow long, random latency at each stop.
Anonymizing remailers [1] need this to mix messages and thwart traffic
analysis.  Long, random latency is part of the price of anonymity.

Add to that list:

 * Support anonymizing remailers having long, random latency to mix
   messages and thwart traffic analysis.

Send encrypted ACKs via message pools which are broadcast worldwide,
such as Usenet alt.anonymous.messages [2].  Each interested party
checks all pool messages and decrypts her own.

And later in this thread, michiel at unhosted.org (Michiel de Jong)
suggests the good idea of extending Usenet to Freedombox hosts:

"Extending Usenet to a new medium" would be more accurate.  Usenet has
not died.  Probably the NNTP Usenet protocol can be adapted to the
Freedom Protocol.

Moreover, pools can be used for both sides of a dialog, not just the
ACKs.  See stealthmail [3].
