If one wants a globally visible address, like publishing e-mail address on
webbed space, then one will be globally reachable. It's like walking on the
street - everyone sees you, including display ads, which is why they cost so
much in cities.

If you *don't* want to be globally visible, you don't need conmen selecting who
will see you. You simply selectively give your e-mail address to those who you
want to see you.

This is extremely simple concept with zero cost of implementation.
