Whoa there is right!  Yes, you are definitly educating me.  Thank you.
I am now totally confused on a lot of issues.  So far, you have moved
me from thinking TCPA seems like it might be useful to thinking that
it's pretty monstrous.  If you want to be a good teacher, you will have
some patience.  If you are a troll, you will get frustrated and leave
soon.

Agreed.

Maybe that's because I'm not convinced yet.  I've got a thick skull :-)

Hate is too strong a word.  They aren't evil because they want to be,
but because they have to be.  They won't survive if they don't optimize
society to their advantage.

It creates a single point of attack.  It reminds me of key escrow.  Once
you get to the chewy center, you can control everything.  More questions
below.

Because it's hard to think about everything.  Maybe they didn't finish
thinking all the ramifications through.  I would hope we'll be able
to ask enough questions that you'll have a hard time quoting the spec.

Not in a democracy.  All laws are based on belief.  They have nothing to
do with facts.  Facts get in the way and are far too confusing for a
majority of humans.  While understanding the facts is useful to anyone
who wants real power, you can still accomplish a lot in the short run
with a good lie.

But I would like to understand TCPA enough that I can tell which newspaper
article is the lie and which isn't.

Well I deny it.  So far, I am still confused and amazed at how powerful
a device you have described.

OK, so why can't any joe hacker create their own PRIVEK?  _nobody_ knows
it's value?  Then how can anyone know if a chip is "real" or "imitation".
What happens when the motherboard dies again?  PRIVEK was copied out of
the chip to some "fob" right?  I thought you said the manufacturer put
the keys in at the factory.

I'm confused dude, straighten me out.

Patience, persistence, truth,
