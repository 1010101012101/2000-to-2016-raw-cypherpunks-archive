   [1]artemis67 writes "A [2]small Israeli company has [3]developed a
   radar system that uses ultra-wideband technology to produce
   three-dimensional pictures of the space behind a wall from a distance
   of up to 20 meters. The pictures, which reportedly resemble those
   produced by ultrasound, are relatively high-resolution and are
   produced in real time. Wow, it sounds like the potential benefits of
   this device are huge, saving lives of soldiers, firemen, or police;
   the potential for privacy invasion, however, is similarly large."
