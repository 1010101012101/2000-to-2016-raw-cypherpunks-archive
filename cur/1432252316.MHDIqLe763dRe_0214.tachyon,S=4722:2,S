[from memory]

"This whole rigamarole with hidden missile silos and underground train
tracks to ferry missiles from one silo to another?  Arm every American
with an ICBMW - that's an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile Winnebago.

No one would dare try anything, they'd know that every weekend, we would
have a million Americans out on the road with a sixpack and an itchy
button finger, just waiting for something to go wrong...."
