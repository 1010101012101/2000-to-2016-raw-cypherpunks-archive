There is a damn good reason. PDAs, pagers, and cellphones often hold a
great deal of info the owner regards as valuable, and which they don't
want to lose - phone lists, email, addresses, etc. Battery changes are a
potential source of loss, since (until recently) all these devices used
volatile memory. Adding a capacitor to give the user a few minutes grace
to fumble with his AAs is an essential feature.

Most users, for better or worse, aren't cypherpunks or terribly
conscious about personal privacy, and regard preserving their data as a
very high priority.

All the PDAs I've dealt with (and I've written SW for a number of them)
have a 'hard reset' protocol - usually pressing the power button while
engaging the recessed reset button - which clears out all memory.
