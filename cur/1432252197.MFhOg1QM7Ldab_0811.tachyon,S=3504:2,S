No question about it. The term also doesn't mean a whole lot when applied
as-is in the many instances it is on this list. As Tim put it, it pretty
much equates to "cyberpunkish". What little I've grasped of RAH's usage
is that "geodesic" often translates as "distributed", one of the main
features of which is that it "operates based on locally available
information". Hence... Besides, if you know your Einstein (or Riemann, or
Minkowsky) even a little bit you will recognize that one of the prime
reasons for the development of a geometric interpretation of physics is the
need to have a solid theory not reliant on instantaneous transfer of
information ("local"). My interpretation is not unreasonable at all,
considering the alternatives. Wanna drop it?

Ain't everybody?

It's good to know you're hip to this.
