I didn't really interpret Friedman's article to indicate that he himself
has so much come to see technology in a different light following 9/11,
but rather that he noticed that many in the Valley have begun to see
technology in a different light, being now more receptive and
susceptible to governmental suggestions to consider including the Big
Brother Inside.

In as far as Friedman's post is reporting on a change in the mindset of
the technology providers, his article might be represent more of a
statement of fact than an opinion.

Just a thought,
