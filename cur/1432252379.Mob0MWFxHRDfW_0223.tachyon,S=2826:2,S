This is exactly my point.  You and I are saying essentially the same 
things.
Anonymizer cannot be trusted with your life & liberty. It is the 
equivalent of
"kid sister cryptography".  Lance, however, does not seem to view it 
this way.

What I'm blaming Lance for is snake-oil marketing. When someone posted
"Anonymizer revealed the identity of a customer to the FBI", Lance 
posted
"Anonymizer would never do such a thing".  But *of course* he would,
because there's a metaphorical (if not real) gun pointed at his head.

I'm not "pissing and moaning that a single-hop anonymity service doesn't
provide perfect anonymity", I'm calling Lance and Anonymizer on their
false claims.  Lance and Anonymizer should both be upfront and honest
about exactly what level of "anonymity" Anonymizer /can/ provide.

Then I would not have anything to say on this thread.  I agree, the 
service is
certainly useful for some things, and the world is better with it than 
without
it.

*I* did not say anyone needed killing, so I'm assuming this part of 
your rant
was targeted at someone else.
