Ray you bring up a very interesting point.  Does anyone know of a source for

public domain, or open source, writing analysis software that will do just that

?  

Perhaps using such wares for testing purposes one can craft
software to make subtle grammar or spelling or usage alterations 
in text based communications in order to defeat this sort of analysis.

E.G. you've got a remailer or portal of some kind that accepts plain text input,

and according 
to a set of rules makes shifts, sentence length, punctuation usage, spelling

usage, and 
so on, to alter the distinctive signatures associated with the writing patterns

of the person in question.  THEN afterwards this is piped into an encryption

module or just transmitted piecemeal at random timings in order to defeat traffic

analysis.
