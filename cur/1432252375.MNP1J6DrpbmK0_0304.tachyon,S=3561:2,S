Hello, 
    
         I own a design firm with headquarters in NYC, 
I am writing this letter to inquire about any design work
you may have to outsource, Since my designers are 
students & recent grads, as well as  graphic artists from 
all over NYC, I can enter quotes at well below market rate: 
$30 per hour on HTML or JAVA and $30 to $50 per hour 
on Flash depending on the project. If we can  develop a 
relationship,  I can even beat these rates. 
for more info reply to this email with info in the subject field.
