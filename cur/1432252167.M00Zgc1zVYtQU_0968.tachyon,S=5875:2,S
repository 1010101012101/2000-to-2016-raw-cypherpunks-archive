The punishment has been justified but is unjust,
it lacks cognitive coherence.

For all the good deeds taxes are justified to exist,
they are not sustained under close scrutiny;
not the scrutiny under which a court decides over
physical restraint of a "tax evader".

All things being equal, these people are slaves of
a new master, a government with the spirit of a ghost.
