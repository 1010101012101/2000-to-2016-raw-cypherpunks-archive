Right. Terrible customer focus, to use some buzzword phrase. Even putting
political issues aside, I'd have a very tough time recommending their
products to anyone after this week-or-two discontinuation.

It would be like the Well abruptly deciding to kill my well.com address
with a week's notice, after I've had it since 1995, and rely on it for
professional and personal reasons.

have said that the change was in the works before Sep.11. Maybe the attacks
speeded it up.

Some possible good news, for a change. Sen. Judd Gregg, who said he
was introducing legislation to restrict crypto, seems to have a change
of heart. My article will be up at wired.com tomorrow.
