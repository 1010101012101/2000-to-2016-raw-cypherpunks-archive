Actually, it would be far more more informative to get them to explain 
exactly what happened instead of relying on third-party empty hearsay and 
hot air from me, since honestly that's all I've got. But I'm sure there are 
a lot of reasons--some of them contractural--you'll never hear the whole 
story. Especially given that you'll never get anything more than loose talk 
from the other side. 

My personal opinion is that collusion or not, they got taken for a ride. 
And if it's not worth much, so be it.
