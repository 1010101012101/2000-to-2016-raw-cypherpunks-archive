Most Telemarketers use what is called Predictive Dialers, which are PCs 
with software that dials ever number in a phone exchange until it gets 
lucky. Now you can use their own technology against them, and it's legal...

Here is how their system works: the dialer calls your number, you answer, 
and you have probably notice the line appears dead after you said, "Hello". 
What their computer is doing is listening for a short burst of audio, your 
"HELLO", followed by a period of silence. With this heard, it will log your 
phone number as valid and transfer the call to an available telemarketer, 
the reason for the delay before someone comes on line.

Now, if their computer receives a long audio burst (an answering machine) " 
Hello, this is Alan Carlton", then it will disconnect, but it will log you 
phone number as valid, for a later call-back. Oh Lovely! Some are even 
capable of detecting Fax tones and will even transmit a fax trying to sell 
selling something you're probably are not interested in. However, do not 
answer, or when you do answer the phone, or if fax tones are detected, or 
if it detects an answering machine, in all four (4) cases IT LOGS YOUR 
NUMBER AS A GOOD PHONE NUMBER FOR FUTURE CALL- BACK --- PLUS THE COMPANY IS 
ALSO SELLING THESE VERIFIED VALID NUMBERS LIST TO OTHER TELEMARKETERS.

A SIMPLE WAY TO STAY OFF THE LIST IS TO USE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY AGAINST THEM.

The predictive dialer's software also looks for NON-valid phone numbers, 
and there is a simple way you can make your phone number appear invalid to 
the telemarketers' computers, thus they do not call back and accumulate no 
database, at least with your number, to sell other Telemarketers.

Here is how to do it: If you call a number that has been disconnected or is 
no longer in service you will hear 3 short tones, "doo...dah...dee", thanks 
to Ma-Bell. Each time you Refresh this page you should hear, 
"doo...dah...dee". The actual frequency of these tones are 985.2 Hz, 1370.6 
Hz, and 1776.7 Hz. Guess what the telemarketers' software does when it 
detects these 3 tones at the beginning of your outgoing message? It thinks 
it has reached a line that is disconnected or is no longer in service. So, 
it disconnects and does not log your phone number as a working number. BINGO!

NOW record these onto you outgoing message or voice mail announcement, and 
start exterminating telemarketers. Try this example, but use your own name, 
"doo...dah...dee, Hello, This is Tyler Durden". It must be at the beginning 
of your announcement to work. You may have to explain it to you friends, 
but they will soon have it on theirs' too.
