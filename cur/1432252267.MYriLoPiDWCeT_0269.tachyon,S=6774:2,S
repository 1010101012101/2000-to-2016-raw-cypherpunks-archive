I don't use smartphones, and so don't know what works best. Searching on
"detect IMSI catcher" yields hits for Android, but I see no apps for
iOS. AIMSICD looks like a good app. Maybe someone who knows this stuff
well can recommend one.

For the Faraday bag, see
<http://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-Secure-Wallet/>. It's easy to
test. Just put the phone in the bag, and call it. If it rings, there are
leaks.

The hardest aspect is getting good electrical contact on all seams,
including the access flap. The maximum dimension of any hole in the bag
must be small, less than an inch. A gap at the seam that's an inch long,
even if it's very narrow, will leak a lot.

The other thing to keep in mind is that aluminum foil gets brittle with
bending, and will crack. So you need multiple layers, and the layers
must be in electrical contact. Narrow strips of double-stick tape
between layers are OK to provide structural stability. But it's a trade-off.
