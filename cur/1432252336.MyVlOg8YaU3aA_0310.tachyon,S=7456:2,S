To clarify on your "complexity" argument, are you saying that the 
POTUS-parade may be employing technology that detects other devices by 
their output signatures, then fires a noise-beam specifically at them to 
maximise power delivery and minimise energy costs/unnecessary interference?

If that were the case, then a shielded, passive receiver ought to be OK, 
would that not include a HAM radio in listen-only mode? (<- Knows little 
about HAM) ->So, did OP broadcast much prior to the interference, or was 
their rig poorly shielded?

For my part, I just doubt they're using intelligent jamming because cost 
isn't really a factor in their requirements, is it? They can just blare 
out on all the frequencies they care about, and strong-arm providers at 
other spectra to blackzone the region. How much power is needed to jam 
at the frequency band you described? We're talking about a cavalcade 
that could, if they considered it necessary, employ a portable nuke! 
Power ain't a limiting factor! :)
