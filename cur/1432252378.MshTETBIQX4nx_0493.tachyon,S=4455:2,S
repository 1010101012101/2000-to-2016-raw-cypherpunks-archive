     Does OBSD have a kernel optimized for use as a router like linux does?
That's really important if you want a full-time router.
http://master-www.linuxrouter.org:8080/

Likewise, the linux bios would be very useful here -- does obsd have a bios
port?
www.linuxbios.org

     You need to look at the linux cryptoapi, which is fully functional at this
point
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/
 and which can also be used to encrypt both swap *and* boot partition if you
want (using initrd).

     I agree, Plan 9 looks very interesting, but then, so does MOSIX
http://www.mosix.org/ which is also a distributed (kernel implemented) OS based
on linux.
