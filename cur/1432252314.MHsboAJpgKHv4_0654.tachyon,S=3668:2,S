As much as I hate to followup to myself, I can't help this one: I just
fucked up.  In my earnest to provide a timely answer (at a moment when I
am precisely *out* of any time whatsoever), I made the wrong choice by
trying to reply at all.  What came out was a single line of words which
had concepts so compressed that they were lost amongst the very bits
surrounding them: my one line flippant and idiotic looking answer is just
meaningless, and pointless.  I should not have given in to the urge to
reply *now* just because I wanted to put *something* on the record before
I could approach this properly (read: at lengths I didn't have available
at this moment).

I both apologize for this idiocy, and retract that crap answer I just
foisted upon you and the rest of the readers - that I spewed it at all is
embarrasing enough!

I promise to answer this properly, but I'm afraid it'll have to wait till
saturday for me to have the time to do it right (the way I *should* have
done it three minutes ago, or else STFU).

Sorry - you (as in the cosmic "you" as well as in "JAD") deserved better.
Hell, so did I.

Barf...

Did that make any sense to anyone but me?
