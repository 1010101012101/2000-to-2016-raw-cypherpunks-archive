 Democrats Say They Didn't Back Wiretapping


 By KATHERINE SHRADER
 Associated Press Writer
 Dec 20 11:22 AM US/Eastern


 WASHINGTON -  Some Democrats say they never approved a domestic wiretapping
 program, undermining suggestions by President Bush and his senior advisers
 that the plan was fully vetted in a series of congressional briefings. "I
 feel unable to fully evaluate, much less endorse, these activities," West
 Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the Senate Intelligence Committee's top
 Democrat, said in a handwritten letter to Vice President Dick Cheney in
 July 2003. "As you know, I am neither a technician nor an attorney."


  Rockefeller is among a small group of congressional leaders who have
 received briefings on the administration's four-year-old program to
 eavesdrop _ without warrants _ on international calls and e-mails of
 Americans and others inside the United States with suspected ties to
 al-Qaida.

  The government still would seek court approval to snoop on purely domestic
 communications, such as calls between New York and Los Angeles.

  The White House brushed aside Democrats' contention that they weren't
 provided enough information on the program. "They were briefed and
 informed," White House press secretary Scott McClellan said, repeatedly
 refusing to address Democrats' specific complaints. "Congress has an
 important oversight role."

  Some legal experts described the program as groundbreaking. And until the
 highly cl conference that he was assuming unlimited powers.

  "To say 'unchecked power' basically is ascribing some kind of dictatorial
 position to the president, which I strongly reject," he said angrily. "I am
 doing what you expect me to do, and at the same time, safeguarding the
 civil liberties of the country."

  Despite the defense, there was a growing storm of criticism in Congress
 and calls for investigations, from Democrats and Republicans alike. Until
 the past several days, the White House had only informed Congress' top
 political and intelligence committee leadership about the program that Bush
 has reauthorized more than three dozen times.

  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he and other top aides were now
 educating the American people and Congress. "The president has not
 authorized ... blanket surveillance of communications here in the United
 States," he said.

  The spying uproar was the latest controversy about Bush's handling of the
 war on terror. It follows allegations of secret prisons in Eastern Europe
 and of torture and other mistreatment of detainees, and an American death
 toll in Iraq that has exceeded 2,150.

  The eavesdropping program was operated out of the NSA, the nation's
 largest and perhaps most secretive spy operation. Employees there
 appreciate their nicknames: No Such Agency or Never Say Anything.

  Decisions on what conversations to monitor are made at the Fort Meade,
 Md., headquarters, approved by an NSA shift supervisor and carefully
 recorded, said Gen. Michael Hayden, the principal deputy director of
 intelligence.

  "The reason I emphasize that this is done at the operational level is to
 remove any question in your mind that this is in any way politically
 influenced," said Hayden, who was NSA director when the program began.

  Since the program was disclosed last week by The New York Times, current
 and former Congress members have been liberated to weigh in.

  Former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who was part of the Intelligence
 Committee's leadership after the 9/11 attacks, recalled a briefing about
 changes in international electronic surveillance, but does not remember
 being told of a program snooping on individuals in the United States.

  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., received several briefings
 and raised concerns, including in a classified letter, her spokeswoman
 Jennifer Crider said.

  Former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said he, too, was briefed by
 the White House between 2002 and 2004 but was not told key details about
 the scope of the program.

  Daschle's successor, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he received a single
 briefing earlier this year and that important details were withheld. "We
 need to investigate this program and the president's legal authority to
 carry it out," Reid said.

  Republicans, too, were skeptical.

  Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has
 promised hearings next year and said he would ask Bush's Supreme Court
 nominee, Samuel Alito, his views of the president's authority for spying
 without a warrant.
