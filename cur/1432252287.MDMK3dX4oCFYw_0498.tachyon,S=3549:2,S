here is my preference:
- locate a store that provides pre paid mastercard/visa/amex , often
as gift cards or for internet payments.
- have someone buy one for you, buy one yourself incognito, or locate
a kiosk that dispenses and charges them like an ATM in reverse
(coinstar used to do this, though sadly that program was shut down)
- register the card via an anonymous hotspot / through tor? *grin* /
untraceable line (most of the cards work like debit/credit when
swiped, but if you want to use it for online / catalogue purchases or
put more than $500 on them you need to register via phone or website)
- create a pseudonymous identity and remember it, as you will need the
name and address later.
- send donation via the afore mentioned hotspot / untraceable line and enjoy!

P.S.  the lifecycle of these pre-paid card systems has been an
interest of mine since the late 90's.  it's weird how many of them
sprout up, last a year or two, and then disappear just as quickly as
they came.  surely there is a story behind this somewhere.  fraud? 
lack of interest?  the man keeping us down? :P~

P.P.S. using a hotspot anonymously can be a little tricky.  i'll let
you ponder this for a while...

P.P.P.S.  these work well for paying for VoIP service too, which gives
you a hard(er) to trace line, when used in conjunction with
$random_hotspots for situations where a phone is required.  remember
that the transaction for the VoIP gear should be anonymous as well
since the devices are identified by MAC ID.

ok, not simple, but seems to work well enough if you are cautious.  if
you are really paranoid you can layer these services until an adequate
depth of deception is in place.
