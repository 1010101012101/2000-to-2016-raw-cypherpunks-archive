What they're trying for is someone who hears an Osama tape and takes the
initiative, without external connections.  Sorta like the 101st Airborne 
dude
who fragged the invaders, but domestically.  

In fact, they'll soon abuse this to monitor anyone, more so (or more 
"legally")
than they do now.  And antiabortion loonies, PETA, Earthfirst, folks who 
hang No War banners,
folks without flags on their cars, anyone named Akbar or Mohammed, ..

Terrorist is the new root password to the Constitution.
