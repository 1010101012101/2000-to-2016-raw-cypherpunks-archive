tldr; NAND proxy to prevent wipe. Instigate fake phantom wipe to reset 
counter+delay for passcode attempts.

This was published only a few days before the news that the FBI cracked 
the iPhone. So it is highly unlikely that the information disclosed was 
used by their hackers. But based on recent information the attack 
described in that post, in my obviously biased opinion, seems 
increasingly probable.

Also so far I found nothing in the iOS Security documentation that 
indicates this attack will NOT work on most recent iPhones. Though it 
could be that I simply missed an important detail.
