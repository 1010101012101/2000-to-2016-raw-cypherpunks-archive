Respected Sir,

FAQ about deaddiction is attached / available in deaddiction section of our website http://www.selfhelpgroup.inbox.as

Basically the medicine in essence form is obtained by getting the Sparigic Essence of non-poisonous multi herbs by Cohobation Method and treating - exposing this to particular phases of Sun & nature for about 12 months.
