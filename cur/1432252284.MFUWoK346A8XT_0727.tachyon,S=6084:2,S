"If you look at the likely targets of an attack by an adversary against the 
United States, it's not going to be the military computers. It's going to 
be the private sector infrastructure targets, the major telecommunications 
switches, the major public power grids."

"I would implore people to go out and read this document by two Chinese 
colonels called Unrestricted Warfare [see related link below]. It talks 
about the migration of nation-states to tactics such as information 
warfare, or financial sector attacks, or conventional terrorism attacks 
using asymmetrical cells a la Osama bin Laden. So there's definitely this 
fundamental thinking-- a lot of people have referred to it as a revolution 
in military affairs, the Gulf War being the first information war. I think 
it goes above and beyond that, in that the nation-states are now having to 
resort to these sort of unrestricted methods in order to achieve their 
objectives."
