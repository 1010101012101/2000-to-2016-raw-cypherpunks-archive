Well, chicks are gone, there is a risk from fatherland security troopers,

SAN FRANCISCO FLASH CYPHERPUNKS !

Three locations will be given in downtown area this Sat, partitioning to be done
by birthdate (or your PGP key fingerprint's last digit.) In each of these at
exactly 1pm an 802.11b access point will come to life. You'll need to break
40-bit WEP to get in. Once there, attempt to access any http server will result
in page describing the meeting location.
