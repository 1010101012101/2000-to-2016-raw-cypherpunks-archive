It would facilitate the blacklisting and later roundup.  And hmm, where
do academics get their $ from?  Any questions?

Imagine McCarthy with computers.  McCarthy on a paranoid speed binge,
with computers.
Or don't imagine, just visit DC.

Hmm, if it didn't cause problems for the list maintainers I'd post some
technical queries
from a spoofed address from an axis of whatever nation.  Then again,
maybe I'm from
an axis country spoofing the US, and you're all as fucked as a Chinook
with a SAM
locking onto its tail :-)
