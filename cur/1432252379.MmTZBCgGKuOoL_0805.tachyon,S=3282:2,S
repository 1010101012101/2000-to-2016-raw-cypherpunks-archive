Nichols was dumb enough to actually be caught in possession of a card used
in at last part of the conspiracy.

Other cards that seem to be linked to Nichols were used to locate or obtain
ANFO and call the rental agency for the Ryder truck as well as other numbers
linked to the crime.

That is public knowledge at this point.  Clearly, logs are available to law
enforcement vis-a-vis pre-paid calling cards when they wish to use them.
Given the time between the bombing and the capture of at least one of the
cards (3-4 days) I suspect those logs are available for at least a few days.
Given that the prosecutors claim to be able to link the ANFO purchase via
calling cards it is probably a lot longer.

What is confusing are the reports that the calling card (or one of them)
"bore the name Daryl Bridges."  Pre-paid cards don't have names imprinted on
them.  They would have to have a spot to write them in deliberately.  I
haven't seen this on any and why would anyone (particularly as part of a
criminal conspiracy) do such a thing?

Keeping calling cards from leaking information probably isn't possible.

Limiting the information leaked to that which is already known or is useless
is probably the best bet.   Using separate cards for separate operations /
cells and immediate disposal seems pretty critical.

Note something else, however.  I haven't heard of any instances of real time
calling card interception.  One was described here on the list but that
presupposes that a degree of surveillance already exists around the subject.
All bets are pretty much off in that event.  Calling cards are "after the
fact" evidence, not preventative evidence.
