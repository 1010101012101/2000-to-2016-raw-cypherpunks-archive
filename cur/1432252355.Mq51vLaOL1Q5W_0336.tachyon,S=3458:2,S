cryptoanarchist school of thought. So, the answer to your question is that 
it's interesting to me and I'm the one doing the programming. If you can 
come up with something more interesting I'll probably be happy to work on 
it. But I'm not really interested in padding the pockets of the Lime Group, 
LCC. and I'm buzz worded out on P2P. What I like is the idea of trying to 
revitalize the cypherpunk movement - even a very tiny little bit. I'm 
really very disappointed with the Individual Sovereignty/Cryptoanarchy 
subculture lately. It seems to be running out of steam. There seems to be 
very few people working on interesting things. Coderpunks is a ghost town 
with occasional spam rolling through like a tumble weed, and cypherpunks 
seems to be obsessed with Jim Bell like a bunch of little girls over the 
back street boys. <

Cant you be obsessed with JB and Cryptoanarchy/freenet? Like if some 
outlaws dont unite and fight(using AP)with some indians,we'll all be forced 
down the trail of tears to the freenet reservation. Fuck that.
