Finally, Elijah, a voice of sanity among the hysteria about way
over-hypedsmall number of NSA revelations magnifying and
exposing the unexceptional Lavabit scam.

Online insecurity has been well understood since online was invented.
probably the worst ever of any means of technological communication.

Cryptographic protecton for a porous infrastructure appears the most
likely cause of the delusion, a favorite export of this list and other
crypto fora. Only recently has the fundamental weakness of online
communications has this delusion received adequate attention
and for the weakness of NSA infosec can be thanked for that.

Attention is not yet adequate for this commercial exploitation of
what comsec wizards have kept far too quiet about, although this
list raised alarms from the gitgo of encryption boosterism.

Commercial and non-official exploitation of the comsec delusion
remains far greater than that of official spies, including essential
undergirding of official spying.

Privacy policies in particular were invented as a ruse to divert
attention from ubiquitous spying on the public by online services
whether of governmental, commercial, institutional, non-profit,
personal, anonymizing, traffic hiding, the gamut of Internet
opportuniism pretty well demolished by Mozorov and others,
especially on this list, but not so much on other lists and
fora which ban incredulity, doubt, skepticism and "off-topics"
concerning comsec.

Time for more than shutting down enterprises that have
betrayed the public for two decades, that only allows the perps to
escape full accountability by governmental, commercial, institutional,
non-profit, personal, anonymizing, traffic hiding, the gamut of
Internet opportuniism.

Anonymity and leak exploiters deserve special attention for
running bait and switch operations which have led the public
to believe in shitty security for submissions, media coverage,
honesty and nobility of purpose indistinguishable from
the gov-com-org kind of hucksterism pushed as a target.

Greenwald and Assange, what have you done to Manning
and Snowden. For the answer, read cypherpunks archives.
