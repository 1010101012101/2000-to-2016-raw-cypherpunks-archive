Agreed, on this one.

In 10th century Iceland, an ostensible anarcho-capitalist society with
exactly *one* "public" employee(1) *everybody* was a lawyer -- and murder
was a tort. See David Friedman's "The Machinery of Freedom", and any good
Icelandic saga, my favorite being "Njall's Saga", for details

Cheers,

Who especially liked Friedman's "penny game", for a good example of how
government works.

once a year at a summer solstice fair called the Allthing, and if a law
wasn't recited after four years, it was considered rescinded.
