Zem, the editor need not be a single or static entity.  Consider
slashdot,
which uses its readers as ephemeral editors.  Consider the (new)
KaZaa ratings system which does the same.  Consider ebay's user
rating system.

So yes, the editing *function* is valuable, but it needn't be
implemented
by a paid individual.
