No Tim, what is utterly irresponsible is to make bellicose threats on this
list about what your response will be if masked ninjas invade your home.  If
they end up shooting you (and I think their is a significant likelihood that
they will), it will be in large part because of your macho siege mentality.

I "narced out" your behavior of several years ago.  If you are stupid enough
to still be carrying a knife illegally (when there are plenty of legal
options), then there is no helping you.  On your head be it.

More likely they are saying, "Ah fuck, I wish we'd known that before
Sandfort wised Tim up.  Now we'll just have to go with plan B and shoot him
when we raid his house with a trumped up search warrant."

And like Vinnie told you, the ones they send after you will be a LOT better
than he is.
