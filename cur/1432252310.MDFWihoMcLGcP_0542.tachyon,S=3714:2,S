But St. Gaudens coins were readily available during the time when gold 
ownership was banned.

(Let me be overly careful: They were purchasable from coin stores and 
mail order places in the mid-1960s. I know because I used to see them 
listed at a price I clearly remember: $49.50.)

I assume they did not just suddenly become available at the time I 
happened to be paying attention, and that they were purchasable in 1960, 
1950, 1940, etc. The exemption for numismatic value, of course.

Owning coins for collector, or numismatic, value, is of course a 
different kettle of fish than owning gold as bullion.
