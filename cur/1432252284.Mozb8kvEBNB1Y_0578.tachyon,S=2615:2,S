Ramsey Clark is a commie liar, and nothing he says can be
believed.

Saddam was warned that if he took Kuwait, terrible consequences
might well follow.

The USG did not say 'If you invade, we will destroy you', but
it dropped some big hnts.

Similarly the USG has not said that if China invades Taiwan,
the USG will intervene, but it would be as big a lie to claim
that China has been given a green light to invade Taiwan, as it
is for Ramsey to claim that Iraq was given a green light to
invade Kuwait.
