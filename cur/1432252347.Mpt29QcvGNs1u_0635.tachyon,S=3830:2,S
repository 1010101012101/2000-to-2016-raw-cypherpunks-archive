Hypocrite. In 'making your own decision' you in effect remove any moral or
ehtical framework from your decision. In fact you are acting upon
'freedom for me, but not for thee'. Why? Because you have set yourself up
as the decider of another fate. Your feelings about letting others make
those sorts of decisions for you are clear.

Or do you hold that 'self-defence' applies only to libertarians?

No, the only solution in Faustines 'survival situation' is to create a
neutral 3rd party that is responsible to all participants. It is not
ethical, or workable, to allow each and all to go their own way.
