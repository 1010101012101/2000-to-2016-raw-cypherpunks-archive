And if you 'observe' at the other side, you can determine that the first
side was already observed. Apparently.

Which is 1 bit (perhaps 1/2 a bit) of data transfer.

If this is not the case, then the descriptions on this list so far are
ambiguous to the point of not being interpretable... which would be
unfortunate.

I think someone's gonna have to try explaining again..
