Servers probably by default log whetever authentication is required to
access them, ie. an IP address where there's an ACL by IP or a username
where a USERAUTH is required.

The News administrator may log as much or as little as he chooses.  This
is why others have suggested one read read news from a server or one has
control over.  A caching proxy configured correctly would be the next best
thing.

Managing a news feed is neat experience to have done once, but I don't
think I'd want to make a career out of it.  Popular server packages go a
long way toward reducing the administrative burden, including allowing the
administrator to tweak logging up or down as he deems appropriate.
