That datacenter has been open 8 days and already a crisis. I find it hard
to believe they can compare themselves against facilities like Equinix.
Especially if the NSA needs more than 10Mega Watts of power all to
themselves. :)

=93Building C7 in Utah provides our customers with data center designs and
operational mantras that address many concerns the IT buyer has today; such
as low disaster risk, abundant low latency connectivity options, future
proofing power and cooling, and a footprint they can grow in =97 all at a
lower cost. C7 in Utah offers a cost-effective alternative to the Las
Vegas, Phoenix, and Denver markets and is well on par with data centers
from Equinix (EQIX), CyrusOne (CONE), and Digital Realty Trust (DRT). The
customer experience is our focus, and our designs to provide
uninterruptible power and cooling are paramount.=94
