No.  If we had won, (a) new p2p acquaintances would be wary until they
had a opportunity to verify each other's keys out-of-band (having
already exchanged them on first meeting); (b) merchants would proudly
include the Key ID of their signing key in every web page, print ad,
letterhead, and customers would instinctively recognize verification
failure as the sign of an impostor; (c) banks would require customers
to identify themselves by Key ID; (d) Verisign and the other CAs would
no longer exist; (e) thinly disguized government agents like Ted Smith
would be scorned into insignificance.
