Of course they didn't. The bottom line is that their organizations were 
torn apart by operations conducted against them, I'm sure I don't need to 
give you a lecture about all that. Maybe the Panther party is making a 
comeback, but you can't deny they're a long way from where they were before 
the intel community went to work on them. Look what's happening to the 
radical environmentalists today, they're up for exactly the same kind of 
treatment. You declare open war on the state, and the state is going to 
declare open war on YOU as "a threat to public safety."

Maybe, maybe not, but it's a side issue when youre talking about what made 
his tactics a success.

Of course!! Proof that violence only works when it's more than symbolic. I 
should have been more clear about what I meant: if they really engaged in 
an all-out prolonged conflict (the way the original Irish Republican Army 
did)it would have been a totally different issue than a march here, a bomb 
there etc. The government never just "gives in" out of the goodness of its 
heart in recognition of superior "spirits" or something vague like that. 

And at the very least, you have to admit they aren't relying on bloc noirs, 
vinegar hankies and catapults.

But he wasn't an anarchist. My point is if you're out to overthrow the 
state (as opposed to fighting for your rights within the system like the 
causes above) you better have more than turtle suits and golf balls.

I still think it's too complex to boil it down to a single element like 
that. Have you heard the newest batch of Nixon tapes? The Kissinger 
transcripts from the National Archives? Worth a listen.

I can't believe you don't think he had an impact...

How can you even talk about civil rights (or rights at all) when you think 
something like that.

Dream on. This isnt the 60's anymore...read about preparations for urban 
operations (keyword MOUT) and see what you're in for. It's a whole new ball 
game.

But it didn't. These days, people get a little pepper spray in the face and 
the next thing you know they're on TV gasping and whining about those nasty 
old cops. What the hell did they expect? Some revolution, when they think 
it's worth crying around about the terrible injustice of getting non-
vegitarian baloney sandwiches in jail. Ten years from now, those weakminded 
fuckers are probably going to sell out just like their pothead stock-
options smug yuppie parents did.

Everybody pats themselves on the back about how great the 60s were, but 
things didn't fundamentally change all that much. If they were so 
successful, than why is the state more bloated, more repressive and more 
intrusive than ever?  We got out of Vietnam, but turned right around and 
sent the same special ops people into Central America and a hundred other 
places we don't even know much about. And so it goes. 

Committing violence in the US isn't the answer, working within the system 
to change it from the inside is. What came out of the Church Committee in 
terms of congressional oversight, the creation of the Freedom of 
Information Act, writing PGP and developing other privacy enhancing 
technologies--they all made a difference. Wouldn't you rather look back and 
know you spent your time on something real?

Not only is there a big difference between the US and the UK, there's a 
difference between local and federal approaches to handling conflict. And 
given the huge push toward federalizing law enforcement, there's nothing at 
all to rest easy about.
