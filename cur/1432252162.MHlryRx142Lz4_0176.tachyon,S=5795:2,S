Oh? It's not illegal to think about it. No treaty was ever written in stone: in
fact(if I'm not mistaken), since treaties always have an "overriding national
interest" escape clause, IMO it would be highly irresponsible NOT to be
thinking of avenues to eventually explore strategies beyond them.

But it's not just about nukes! Here's an excerpt which outlines the bigger
picture, from the conference report to accompany H.R. 4205:


SEC. 1044. REPORT ON THE DEFEAT OF HARDENED AND DEEPLY BURIED TARGETS.

(a) STUDY.--The Secretary of Defense shall, in conjunction with the Secretary
of Energy, conduct a study relating to the defeat of hardened and deeply buried
targets. Under the study, the Secretaries shall--

(1) review--

(A) the requirements of the United States to defeat hardened and deeply buried
targets and stockpiles of chemical and biological agents and related
capabilities; and

(B) current and future plans to meet those requirements;

(2) determine if those plans adequately address all such requirements;

(3) identify potential future hardened and deeply buried targets and other
related targets;

(4) determine what resources and research and development efforts are needed to
defeat the targets identified under paragraph (3) as well as other requirements
to defeat stockpiles of chemical and biological agents and related capabilities;

(5) assess both current and future options to defeat hardened and deeply buried
targets as well as concepts to defeat stockpiles of chemical and biological
agents and related capabilities; and

(6) determine the capability and cost of each option assessed under paragraph
(5).


What's the problem? I hardly see how figurehead politicians rubberstamping
funds for national security research can be held culpable for anything their
strategists and engineers may happen to think up. Personally, I think if
there's anything to really be nervous about, it's the classified R&D studies
you aren't hearing about. Oh well.

"Critics frequently refer to the icy rationality of the Hudson Institute, the
RAND Corporation and other such organizations. I'm always tempted to ask in
reply, 'Would you prefer a warm, human error? Do you feel better with a nice
emotional mistake?' We cannot expect good discussion of security problems if we
are going to label every attempt at detachment as callous, every attempt at
objectivity as immoral. Technical details are not the only important operative
facts. Human and moral factors...must never be missing from policies and public
discussion. But emotionalism and sentimentality, as opposed to morality and
concern, only confuse the debates. Nor can experts be expected to repeat, 'If,
heavean forbid...", before every sentence."
