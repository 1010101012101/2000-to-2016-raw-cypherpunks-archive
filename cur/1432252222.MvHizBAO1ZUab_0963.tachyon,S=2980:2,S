"A good example of monkeywrenching can be found at the article posted 
earlier, http://www.keepandbeararms.com/angel/articles/consterrorist.htm. 
This shows an apparently legitimate flyer from the "Phoenix FBI Joint 
Terrorism Task Force" telling people whom they should watch out for. It 
includes people who "make numerous references to the US constitution", 
people who are "'defenders' of the US constitution against federal 
government and the UN", people who attempt to "police the police" and so on."


Who reads these days? Comics are the go,if you cant mangarize the infamous 
cia manual comic from nica,just print it off as is.Future generations will 
thank you and the poetic justice aspect of it is exquiste,almost worth 
being tortured and executed for.Dont get caught waxing the 
SUV.kids....and...be careful out there.
