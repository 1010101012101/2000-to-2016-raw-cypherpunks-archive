True, the home.leo.gov referrer could be a spoof, indeed, reads 
more like a spoof than the real thing which used to be partially
camouflaged, except so did Bush, Ashcroft and company 
before 9/11, well, before the Florida and Supreme Court
assault on the assaulting enemies of the state.

Now bald-faced teeth baring, uh, Carnivore, seems silly
compared to outright indiscriminate chomping like locusts.

"We're at war," the locusts chew and puke into the global
terrorism database. Seaching for WMD targets, inventing
them.
