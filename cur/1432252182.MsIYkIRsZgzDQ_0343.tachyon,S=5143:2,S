We have a large unwitting helpmate: the Media. Their primary motivation is 
the eyeballs, the Nielsen ratings; which can be exploited for Spreading 
The Word. Technology, while difficult to understand for mere mortals, 
together with its handlers, has its appeal - not entirely dissimilar to 
witchcraft of the Medieval Times; see the popularity of the topic of 
computer security breaches between journalists.

They will get it wrong. But Jane can be corrected; the important task for 
the Media is to make her aware about the possibility and get her to ask. 
At that stage, the incorrectness in the media reporting can be corrected.

If Jane becomes aware about at least a subset of the possibilities, the 
Media did their job.

It's not as wide as it should be. However, it's far from nonexistant; 
there are eg. alternative firmwares for DVD drives, with stripped zoning, 
firmwares for cellphones with removed operator lock, and many other 
goodies.

I suppose the fundamental problem here is the lack of skilled-enough 
people, combined with closed technology; it's rather difficult to 
disassemble a program from binary, takes a lot of time and in many cases 
is impractical. Another problem is the technology the electronics is being 
manufactured now: everybody can work with 2.54mm DIL chips, not everybody 
can work with 0.125mm SMD chips, and only a selected few have access to 
technology necessary for BGA chips. :(

This could be partially offset by some hypothetical new generation of 
visual disassemblers, showing code not as an endless stream of 
instructions but as a graphical representation of the execution flow, 
perhaps using some tricks from atomic-level visualisation of huge and 
complex biochemical structures, eg. proteins and intracellular structures.

Another hope, closer and more realistic one, is in the emergence of 
smaller manufacturers, voluntarily opening their devices in the hope for 
market advantage (the Linksys box mentioned here may be a good example).

The remaining problem is the hardware level. Hopefully somebody with 
enough skills and a good idea appears (or perhaps already appeared) and 
designs a way how to make work with the tiny chips easier for a garage 
workshop; there are trends along this direction already, I saw a mention 
of a reflow oven for SMD boards, made of a toaster.


Never lose hope, and never stop doing things. If you can't solder, code. 
If you can't code cryptosystems, code tools. If you can't code at all, 
write articles and spread awareness. If you can't even write, talk with 
friends. If you don't have any suitable friends, at least read and learn 
yourself. Even an otherwise meaningless act may mean a lot if it comes at 
the "wrong" place and the "wrong" time.

See the "Patriot Ants" approach I mentioned couple weeks ago in the 
Zombie Patriots thread.
