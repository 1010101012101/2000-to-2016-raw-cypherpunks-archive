   All quite true. I've got a 486X33 w/20meg that runs linux just fine,
commandline only, although I've got gnome working on it, I don't bother. Good
enough for firewall, router, etc. And I had a bunch of P100 w/16meg that I was
running for awhile as remote boot/NFS/NIS workstations. They worked pretty well,
but were slow with KDE or gnome so went with Afterstep. Also loaded StarOffice
very, very slowly, but Word Perfect popped up fairly well. Granted, I'd rather
use at least a 200, but those were good enough for reading email and websurfing.
   Actually I was recently working with a library that had all 486 machines,
486DX-100 w/32 megs -- running W95, and even they were usable for web surfing. 
   On my main home linux box, a 266, adding the second 128 DIMM didn't seem to
help a great deal -- mind you, I don't doubt that people can see clear
differences with benchmarks and all, but I can't recall the last time I ran any.
I've also got a dual-processor 200mhz (604e)  Mac with 512meg, it seems fairly
fast, good enough for watching DVD movies, although one of these days when I've
got a lot of loose change I'll probably stick a pair of G4's in that and add
another 512 of RAM, just for the heck of it. 8-)
