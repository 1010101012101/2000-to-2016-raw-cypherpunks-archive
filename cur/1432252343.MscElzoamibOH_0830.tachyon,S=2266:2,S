When I was in high school, studying programming, a friend who worked at a weapons lab contractor gave me sample FORTRAN code to study for style.  The huge stacks of print out were labled Nuclear Code Library (or something similar).  The code comments contained references to cross sections and reaction rates.  If I still have the stuff, unlikely, I'll OCR and post.
