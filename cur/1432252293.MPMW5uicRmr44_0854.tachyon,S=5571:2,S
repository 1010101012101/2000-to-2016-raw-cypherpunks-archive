This doesn't particularly concern me, because a) you have to get enough
people (or people with enough money) who are willing to fund murder to
actually fund it, and b) someone has to actually do the act. Making a
liquid market for murder means you can overcome the risk only for high
profile targets with a lot of enemies. That means primarily politicians,
asshole celebrities, CEOs of widely hated companies, etc. And on the
other side, you can also crowdsource defense, as has already been
happening with the various legal defense funds.

I fear the interventions governments are likely to engage in far more
than I fear the new markets.
