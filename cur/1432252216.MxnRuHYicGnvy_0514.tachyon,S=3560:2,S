Correcting:

You generate a key-pair, then you decide which half to keep
secret.

You publish the other half, where publish means gives to
known associates.  Or if you like encrypted spam, you
publish to a well-known repository.

You may repeat this and use different key-pairs with different
groups of correspondents.

Yes: encrypt a message using KeyA and decrypt with KeyB.  If it
decrypts, they are matching.  Or you are extraordinarily unlucky :-)
Generally the wrong key will decrypt to noise.

Also is there some tool

Tools might include self-integrity info (CRCs, hashes, etc.) in
their file formats; YMMV.  If any bits in either half of the key
data are changed, you lose.
