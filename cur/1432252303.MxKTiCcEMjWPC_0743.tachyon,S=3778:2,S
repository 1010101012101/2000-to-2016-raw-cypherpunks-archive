Something that just came to mind...

It would make sense for the Zero State to make use of distributed
software engineering tools for its development projects, as it aims
toward a completely decentralized way of going about just about
everything.  This implies at a minimum a revision control system like
Git (http://git-scm.com/), or more ideally a complete solution like
Fossil (https://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki).
 Git only handles revision control and tracking of files checked into
it, but Fossil includes a fully distributed wiki, bug tracker, and
blog.  While a "home base" server could (and should) be set up, each
participating client has a point-in-time snapshot of the whole
shebang, and clients could update one another if necessary; ideally,
multiple home base servers which sync with one another could be
established (with round-robin DNS records) and clients can sync from a
single hostname (home-base.zerostate.net, let's say).

Where I'm going with this is here: pre- and post-commit hooks can be
integrated into the repo to do arbitrary things... like ping a
reputation management system to register the activity carried out by
developers as part of the repnet being discused in this thread.  I
suspect that plug-ins could be developed that also manage a user's
reputation index based upon blog posts, tickets
opened/commented/fixed/closed out, comments left on posts,
documentation written, and so on and so forth.  This would also have
the advantage of being self-documenting, because rep would be based
upon the deliverables checked into the repository and thus visible to
everyone taking part.

This could also be used, now that I think of it, for managing and
developing stuff for the ARG.
