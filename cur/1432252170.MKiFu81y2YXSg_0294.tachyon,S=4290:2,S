I just love these reports!

   [the first]
   computer worm is believed to have been a program created in 1971 for
   air traffic controllers.

   Others followed in the 1980s at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research
   Center that were designed to post announcements and do heavy computing
   tasks at night when computers were idle. However, the worm experiments
   ended and a ``vaccine'' was written after one of the worms
   malfunctioned and crashed the systems.

We have here yet another [new] definition of "worm" - any task that runs
in the background...  Jeeezzz!

To top it off are the insane "damage estimates".  8 *B*illion dollars of
damage???  In what universe?

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
