CNN is reporting that teachers arriving at a pre-school in a heavily 
Democrat region of Miami/Dade found a "padlocked box" in their 
classroom. The pre-school had been used as a polling place. They 
"shook the box" and it "appeared to be full."

So, these votes bought with welfare money will probably go for Gore.

The Dems are also claiming that some or all of Buchanan's votes 
should be allocated to Gore, as many people who wanted to vote for 
Gore are claiming, now, that they must have accidentally punched the 
hole to the right of Gore's name instead of the hole to the _left_ of 
Gore's name.

I expect Al Gore will "find" the extra votes he needs.
