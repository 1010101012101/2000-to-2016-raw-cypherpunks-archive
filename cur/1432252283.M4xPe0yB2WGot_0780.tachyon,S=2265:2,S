Although most of this was way above my head at first reading (subsequent
readings make more sense)...

Thanks!  This was definitely a followup item -- in relation to PGP, why DSA
signatures are always 1024-bit, even if I've got a 4096-bit key.

Again, thanks -- this was yet another followup question.
