Hi! I am Ekaterina. I am a kind, sociable woman.
I have a lot of tenderness inside my soul which waits for somebody to
be given to. I dream someone to steal my heart one day - I want to
love and to be loved! People say I have a strong personality, but I am
weak inside and like every woman I want to be defended by some strong
knight in this world! 
I have some questions for you if you want to get to know me closer: 
1/ Are you interested in serious relations with Russian woman? 
2/ Are you planning to visit Russia? 
3/ Would you like to correspond or to talk by phone? 
4/ Why are you interested in Russian lady? 
5/ Have you ever been to Russia? 
6/ What is important for you in relations and am I right for you? 
I will be waiting for your reply to 
 
admin@1WIFEFORU.INFO 

Would you like to know me better and to meet me?
Waiting for your reply, Ekaterina.
