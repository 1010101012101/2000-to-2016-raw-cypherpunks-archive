>From what I can tell, it is the exact opposite. The ease of use and
persistent connected design of these apps (aka you have these always-on,
long running group chat rooms), and the ability to quickly send voice
messages and video, makes it MORE personal. The users feel a constant
connection to a whole group of friends no matter where they are on the
planet, and can, with a press of a button, reach out and hear their voice.

I am not saying this is a global phenom, applicable to all societies. I
think within this occupied/exile dynamic, and also where standard
telecomms are difficult, the impact of apps like WeChat and WhatsApp is
perhaps greater than places where Skype, Facetime and Hangout work well.
