Perhaps it is a leaked artistic caricature of a fun/educational play
session between consenting parties in something like edukink,
sfcitadel, soj, tes, fetlife and the like. Perhaps it is something else.
As with all art... interpretation, learning, and appreciation or lack
thereof is upon the viewer. No need to click links or start wars over
them if you don't like.

Oh really? Here we thought 'fuck'ing was offensive.

_ I like the double entendre: FreeBSD > Linux :)
_ Accurate and funny. Nice work.

Someone should add a Fawkes mask in the shoetip for
added effect.

Now that everyone's well represented, no further comment.
