Yep, a dead-man switch of some kind is a good idea regardless of what other
techniques you're using.

Sure, but if you have a very long (or effectively infinite) PN sequence,
your carrier needs to be structured enough to recover some large counter.
GPS qualifies, as probably does WWV and its non-US brethren.

Sure, if you don't care about MIMO, there are lots of ways to steer your
beam using relatively cheap circuitry. You can have multiple
transmit/receive antennas and just adjust their relative phase. AIUI this
is how the LoJack locators operate. Switching reflectors on and off
independently as you suggest here would allow multiple beams, though their
relative phase would not be adjustable. It all goes toward the goal of
minimizing the amount of energy you emit that isn't directed toward the
receiver, though.

Thanks for posting the latest version of your slides. I read what I think
was an earlier version previously. I am working on upgrading my amateur
radio license, so soon I will get some experience with some of the weak
signal modes you talk about.
