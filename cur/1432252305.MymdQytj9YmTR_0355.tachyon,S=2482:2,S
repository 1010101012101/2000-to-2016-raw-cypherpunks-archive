Shrubya said "You're either with us, or against us."

Asscruft has been using this as his definition of who is against 
Amerika: anyone not supporting our boys and flying an American flag is 
one of Them.

"We gonna open a can of Texas whoop-ass on them bad boys," as our 
illiterate Maximum Leader puts it.

Since there has been no declaration of war, and since Congress is busy 
distracting itself with important debates about the renewal of the 
bovine ear oil depletion allowance--anything to avoid taking a legal 
stand on the constitutionality of preemptive war--this will have to do 
as the best definition we will have of what an "enemy" is.
