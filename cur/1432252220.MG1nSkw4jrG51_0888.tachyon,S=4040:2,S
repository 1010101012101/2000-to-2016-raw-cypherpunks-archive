While it's of little help to M$ lusers, those of us in the *nix world can
use CDROM based filesystems for all but the user data.  Yes, you may be
compromised, but it won't change any code (which is definitely *not* to
say that you aren't in danger from loss of passphrases, etc.) - at least
on sensitive machines. 

I have been using this technique of FreeBSD systems for a little under two
years now (yes, you need to build several copies of your root system :).

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
