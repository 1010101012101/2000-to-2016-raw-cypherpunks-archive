Nice instigation John, you got him to fold and spill the beans pretty damn
quick. :)  Now you've got plenty of info on him.  The NSA must be very happy
as they can begin the anal probe.  Expect to see him tied to a tree with a
satelite dish (and flames) sticking out of his ass in about a month and he'll
be screaming "Why does everyhing in this conversation have to do with things
going into or coming out of my ass."

I'll rustle up the cows so they can talk to the aliens... :)
