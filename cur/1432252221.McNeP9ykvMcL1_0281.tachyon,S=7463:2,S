	Theoretically my ass.

	The problem is that we've got a bunch of pansy ass fascists running this country, and they are willing to hand large parts of our sovereignty over to a committee made up mostly of other fascists and socialists.

	While I disagree with (what little) philosophy is behind these protestors, I have to agree that what is going on behind those doors is *not* in the best interests of America, nor IMO in the best interest of the "poorer" nations in this world.

	The problem is that *most* of the information is wrong, and the stuff that is accurate says basically "Unless you are *really* lucky, *really* smart, or born rich, you are never going to be in the top 5%, and most likely you don't deserve to be there". This really annoys people who have been raised to think that they are brilliant, and really don't want to settle for working 40+ hours a week, forcing themselves to *not* buy stoopid trendy shit so as to save for their retirement, and then retire when they are too old to really enjoy it. 

	They don't like that. They want to work a "fulfilling" job, make 100k a year, and have the government pay for their retirement when they don't feel like working any more. 

	Life ain't like that. 

	As much as I hate "bumper sticker" Philosophy, I saw one recently that these people need to take to heart: Life is not a beach, it's a mountain. 

	And yes, I realize I'm painting with a broad brush. Many of these protestors simply don't like that their lifestyle/standard of living is changing becuase technology has made it possible for some uneducated (or undereducated) third worlder to do their job at 1/10th the price (or less). Some are genuinely concerned (I'm thinking back to the Seattle Protests) that NAFTA is allowing (supposedly, I don't know the truth) trucks and drivers into the country that have sub-standard safety inspections and sub-standard training (although I know that many of the American Trucks aren't exactly up to code). 
	
	There are a plethora of reasons why people are protesting, and many more reasons that other people who aren't the kind to protest don't like what is going on.

	Come on, "global warming" is a fact. We've gotten about .6 degrees warmer in the last 100 years. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE NEW YORK IS UNDER WATER.
