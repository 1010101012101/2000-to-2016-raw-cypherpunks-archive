There's a continuum between a tree and a high-dimensional grid/mesh/lattice.
A high dimensional grid pressed upon a flat surface looks like a bush at each
node, with decaying connectivity density with the density. I don't have a
sketch at hand, unfortunately, so I can't put both extreme cases next to each
other.

The Internet is a tree, not a mesh.

Computational physics in a relativistic universe imposes very clear
constraints. There's nothing whatsoever hypothetical about these constraints.
There's nothing whatsoever hypothetical that if you want to do relativistic
cut-through switching of serial signals (10 GBit Cu, TBit fiber, LoS laser)
you
have to make a routing decision very, very early. Before the packet header
has left the delay line (and the rest of the packet is streaming at you
through the medium, whether vacuum or glass, or solid-state optical delay
line). Medium is a natural FIFO, which of course only becomes apparent beyond
GBit/s data rates. A photonically switched crossbar making use of it gets rid
of expensive (time, energy) photon-electron-photon conversion, and scarce
resource memory real estate, and memory bandwidth. It doesn't matter that in
the current postdotbomb dark fiber is plentiful, and photonics is notoriously
cash-drained. Traffic is growing, and will absorb those overcapacities
eventually. Intermachine traffic, people will have become irrelevant pretty
soon, if they haven't already (but for multimedia streams, which will
saturate as well, because population grows way too slow to become visible,
only technology deployment rate is visible).

This is the reason why the future asks for specific frame/packet header
layout, specific
wiring of connections, and purely local-knowledge routing (extreme
localization or elimination of admin traffic), with a routing
decision done in ~ns domain (and below).

I'm not going to argue with you. Look up physical plots of connectivity over
Earth surface. Start with GEO/LEO satellite, sea cable, then progress to large
scale
cable layouts, then to grassroot scale (city and neighbourhood and house
level).

Non sequitur.

Dude, hypergrids *are* fractal. Not that it has to do anything with the
current topology.

The geometry on Earth surface is anything but whatever. Way above, with nodes
in mutual plain view, it's plain old Einstein-Minkowski (basically Euclidian,
with relativistic corrections).

Again, how about traffic in US? EU is weird, Asia is yet too new (but
adapting very rapidly).

Again, how about traffic in your above constellation in 2004?

Again, how about physical cable connecting the nodes?

I'm claiming peering arrangement evolve to make optimal use of given physical
cabling. This is quick.

On the longer term, physical and virtual (radio, laser) cabling evolves to
minimize the load on existing links. This is slower, peering arrangements
change in realtime in comparison, very like Franck-Condon principle.

Why do people lay fiber in a specific place?
How do peering arrangements evolve over time?
How is the rate of optimization going to change if agoric load levelling is
implemented at protocol level?

Very interesting. Thanks for this story from the trenches.

A nexus is a classical tree artifact. Once the network progresses along a
meshed grid hugging Earth surface, we're going to see an increase in
crosslinks and exchange points, crosslinking the branches.

I'm stuck with a notbook display and keyboard right now, but it would be fun
to pull up graphs linking topology to geography, and change in such graphs
over time. Informally, I hear topology converging to geography, but it would
be nice to see actual animations showing it happen.

Biology is subject to physics. At all scales. When it comes to communication,
constraints on energy and signalling and shape become especially obvious.

Computational physics is just such a source of constraints. Except, here
energy is not (yet) a constraint (dissipation rate is already), relativistic
singnalling is (in comparison to biology, which is energy constrained, aand
is waaay to slow to be relativistically constrained, only saltatoric spike
propagation, which is arond 100 m/s, so it has to deal with latency as well
when laying out the computational circuits).
