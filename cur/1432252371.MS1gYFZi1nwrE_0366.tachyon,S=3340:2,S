No, this isn't new. You didn't read my earlier message carefully.
Mere possession (not creation) of visual depictions of child
pornography has been a federal felony for at least a decade.
Someone who's a "collector" who did not publish the material would
be a felon.

Note I'm not defending the law, and there are plenty of problems with
the Ohio prosecution, but it is not something that folks here should
be particularly surprised about.
