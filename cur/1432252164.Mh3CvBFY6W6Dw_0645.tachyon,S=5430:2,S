The Heppenheimer book cited here previously posited a catcher fabricated
out of bulletproof material, in lunar orbit.  Of roughly conical form,
and rotating about its axis, material launched via railgun from the
lunar surface would be caught, then ferried to an L4 or L5 construction
point.  Heppenheimer's scenario envisioned using pellet shooters as
reaction mass.  Matter flux in orbit is such that operations could be carried
out for extended periods of time with no perceptable increase in
micrometeorite impacts.

For loosly aggregated masses, possibly even larger:  they'd simply
disintegrate in orbit.  Though try to justify the low odds to the poor
sap who *does* happen to be in the wrong place.

Lunar material has an albedo of about 3%.  Its radar signiture may be
better.  But there isn't currently a tracking system that's designed to
detect large amounts of new orbit insertions.  Yes, we track dead
satellites, lost space hardware, and the odd glove.  Hundreds of
thousands of stone-tossings, I'm not so sure.

Cities can't run.  Their populations can.  But it would take a day or
two for a typical US conurbanation.  The infrastructure remains
particularly vulnerable.

Better yet:  water strike.

If you're particularly devious, aim for an unstable undersea slope
seismic region.

Heinlein's good history here, particularly if you're into harsh
mistresses.

Peace.
