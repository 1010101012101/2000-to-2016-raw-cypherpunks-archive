Back when I was in Telecom we used to talk about how silly most terrorist 
attacks are, at least in terms of real damage: The COs are only barely 
guarded...a few well placed surprises could have an impact that far exceeds 
mere PR.

As for Graph theory that isn't really necessary...most of the big telecom 
Rings have been publically documented. The trick, however, is to ensure you 
hit both sides of the ring. If there's a big-ass 1000-fiber sheath, however, 
you will need a backhoe.

The interesting thing is that packetized traffic (combined with optical 
layer protection) might makes things even less disruptable...
