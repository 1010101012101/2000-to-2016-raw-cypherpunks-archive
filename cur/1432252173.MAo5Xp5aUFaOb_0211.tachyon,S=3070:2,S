Satire imitates life:

I was watching "The Big Comfy Couch" (a children's show on PBS) with my
three year old. Their revision of the fable was to have the ants invite the
grasshopper in to their home for the winter because they realized they had
no music to sing or dances to do.

The moral seemed to be 'We need  the fools who laugh, sing, dance, and play
the summer away, because they are "artists"'.

It pissed me off.

(I think the Ants singing "Nayah-Nayah-Nayah" while dancing on the
Grasshopper's grave would have been sufficient).
