True, true. It's probably not worth our time. It's not that he's not
educable -- although we see no indication of that yet -- it's that
there are better uses of scare resources. Anyone hoping to be taken
seriously should at least have read some of the basic cpunk
literature.

And he has not.

Probably. I remember on Usenet circa '91 we'd see an influx of
freshmen polluting otherwise useful newsgroups. Lots seemed to come
from psu.edu, for some odd reason.

Righto. While anyone who wants to can call themselves a cypherpunk,
anarchic labeling and all that, it's clear that some folks just don't
get it.

It must have something to do with being Canadianized. Only folks from
Alberta seem to get it right.
