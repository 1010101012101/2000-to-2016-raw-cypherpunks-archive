     It is possible for you to receive a freeze order that will compel you
to maintain referenced records. These orders (generally received prior to a
pending subpoena) can be rather general, so this generally serves the
purpose of preventing you from going on a shred/rm/wipe/degauss spree before
the authorities get what they want from you. However, I do know of at least
one case where someone challenged such a document on the basis that it was
obtuse. Can't cite off the top of my head, though. If you would like to see
some copies of documents that are generally used by feds to accomplish these
goals, let me know. I will see if I can neuter some for reference purposes.

ok,
Rush

FindLaw doesn't show anything for 'computer logs'.

Other than destroying them because they are evidence of a crime I am not
aware of anything that might require anyone to keep them. There certainly
wasn't any sort of requirement for folks like myself at the time of the CJ
trial to keep records for any length of time.

The flip side is that if you go around destroying all your logs as they
are made the security of your system comes into question.
