A very good example of a Lie (by Peter Fairbrother) and a further precise
exposure of the contradictions within the Lie (by Zenaan).

P.s
For future attempts by liars:
So apparent contradictions in the lie itself... you know, Peter/mr. X... it
doesn't add too much authenticity to it. However, there is still a chance
that a superficial sheeple will swallow it.
But thanks God, we've got Zenaan :)

I'm not sure how you can say the first part above, in the face of
quoting and saying what you do in the second part.

You quoted the relevant part, thank you. That part does not take much
reading to see how bad it truly is, even though the rest (unquoted) of
the bill may be massively opaque.

So something is good, or potentially good - let's find out what:

In other words, the bill doesn't automatically affect the status quo of
existing websites (website certificates?) because, well who knows,
that's the current interpretation but tomorrow's interpretation can just
as well be "hand over your keys bitch, or you're going to jail" even if
you are Facebook or Google (though the "going to jail" bit, if it were
possible, would be a good outcome for Facebook for example ... alas, I
dream)!

And the determination of who has to hand over keys (i.e. who is a
"relevant operator") is nothing more than whatever the Home Secretary
(currently female it seems) says! Perhaps next week is her bad week of
the month and your free speech website (nicely TLSed with personally
issued and in person verified certificate provider keys etc) happens to
have a discussion which pushes her (the Home Secretary's) trigger word
buttons.

And you say this is GOOD?!

WTF? Am I misunderstanding something here?

Sounds as good as North America's endless extra-judicial drone killings
(that's murder, and despotic, in case it's not otherwise obvious to
you).

> Bad points? It doesn't do anything at all against the clued-up terrorist

You say that as though there are good points, see above.

Thanks for quoting the relevant part of the act, and letting us know
that the definitions for "relevant operator"s will be handed down extra-
judicially by the Home Secretary.

How very, democratic we might as well call it..
