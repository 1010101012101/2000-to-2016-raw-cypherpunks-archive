Again we have one of those few occasions in which Tim and I 
are in perfect agreement.  To require gun ownership just 
because "arms" or "militia" is in the Constitution makes
as much sense as requiring us all to have a press just
because "press" is in the Constitution.

Now to the second point, police power regulation by states,
implicitly cited below.  We settled in the Civil War the question
of whether States get to arm themselves against invasion.  They
don't. I have no doubt the same holds true for municipalities.
The "common defense" is a national defense. A State has no authority
to require you to keep or bear arms.
