I think it would be more sensible to worry that lawyers and judges will 
hear "non-repudiation" and stop paying attention to anything else the 
speaker has to say about law or evidence, as the concept of 
"non-repudiation" as discussed by technologists is fundamentally 
incompatible with the rules of civil & criminal procedure, the 
Constitution, and the rules of evidence, at least in the United States.

If it were possible to reduce questions about facts to the results of math 
problems, we wouldn't need courts at all. That suggests two things to me - 
(a) that's a very, very difficult problem to solve, and we certainly won't 
solve it by handwaving away important questions like security of keying 
material, and (b) even if it were solved, it's very likely the established 
legal system would declare it unsolved in order to protect its continued 
existence.
