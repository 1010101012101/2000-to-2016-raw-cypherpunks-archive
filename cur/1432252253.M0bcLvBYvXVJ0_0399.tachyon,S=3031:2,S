Well, who's there to say you cannot create less potent variants first, which
only make users sicker than normal people. Then, over a couple of decades,
increase the effect subtly. If done in secrecy we can accumulate 'research'
which shows that the drugs indeed do kill, lending popular support to even
stricter control/paternalism.

I know. I think they already have the first prototypes ready, at least for
THC. Of course, it's not very dependable yet. Actually putting the relevant
functionality in a suitably well designed retrovirus could innoculate most
of the population without ever seeking consent. Again, possible to achieve
in secrecy since at least THC is known to be unpleasant to some
people - suddenly the percent would be 90. Biotech certainly opened some
interesting horizons for me... ;)
