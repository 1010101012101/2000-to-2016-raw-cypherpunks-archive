Lawmaker Wants Magic Lantern Information From FBI

By Robert MacMillan, Newsbytes
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A.,
14 Jan 2002, 7:27 PM CST

Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in a letter last week told the FBI that he is
concerned about the bureau's refusal to provide information about the
existence of a computer and e-mail surveillance plan dubbed "Magic Lantern."

In the letter, provided to the Politech mailing list by Paul's legislative
director Norman Singleton, the Congressman asked FBI Director Robert Mueller
to hand over information on the keystroke monitoring program, "or provide me
with written justification for the FBI's refusal to share information on
this crucial issue."

Paul asked for a response within two weeks.

"If ... media reports are accurate, the Magic Lantern project could greatly
impact the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans who communicate via
e-mail," Paul said. "Recently, my legislative director attempted to obtain
information on this project from the FBI and was told such information was
classified. Considering the potential impact of Magic Lantern, I am sure you
can understand why I was disturbed by this refusal."

Media reports have said that the FBI could distribute Magic Lantern the same
way worms thread through the Internet, which would eliminate the need for
law enforcement to physically install monitoring programs on suspect's
computers.

Privacy advocates are concerned that a program such as Magic Lantern could
help the FBI circumvent the normal process of subjecting to a court's
oversight when using surveillance tools.

FBI officials had no immediate comment on the letter.
