accountability i like. there's so much talk about transparency, but none about
accountability. i mean, transparency without accountability is like being
raped, when you have accountability that's like you have a chance to kick the
fucker in the balls. but transparency is like "enjoying" the "act" in the
mirror....

what does that principle tell us, and how is this relevant here?

ah, the stockholm syndrome. i really like some research on psychological
effects on victims of blue collar crimes, and then published widely in msm (i
know another utopia, but then i'm writing mails not code). i have no clue but
if there is a research community around this topic, but it should be goldrush
times for them now. ;/

well i believe this is a reference to maxigas' paper about the political and
social differences between hacklabs, hackerspaces and other
maker/fab/etc-labs. this is a bit in conflict with the opening argument
(medicines sans frontiers not healing the world, but it being a societal
responsibility) and here it the argumentation falls back to the "hackers have
to save us all". i agree with maxigas, hackerspaces should take more
responsibility though.
