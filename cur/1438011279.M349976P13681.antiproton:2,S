Here's my idea for a probe for an RF device. =C2=A0The wavelength of a 2.45=
 GHz signal (WiFi) is about 12 cm. =C2=A0A quarter-wave antenna would be 3 =
cm. =C2=A0Or, that 3 cm could be in the form of a loop, at the end of a pie=
ce of.'hardline', or other coaxial cable. =C2=A0 (hardline would be best, I=
 think, because it is a small diameter. =C2=A0) =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable=C2=A0 =C2=A0So, the diameter of=
 the loop would be a bit more than 1 cm diameter, which is appropriate for =
finding tiny RF sources. =C2=A0One side of the loop would be connected to t=
he center conductor of the coax, and the other side of the loop connected t=
o the shield of the coax.
Note: =C2=A0The coax should probably have many dissipative RF beads strung =
along its length, in order to prevent the cable itself from picking up RF, =
and delivering to the loop on the end, thereby to be detected. =C2=A0http:/=
/www.amidoncorp.com/small-ferrite-beads/=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0There are many =
different kinds of materials that such beads are made from; perhaps we can =
have an RF engineer chime in on the subject. =C2=A0He can also tell us if t=
he loop is too-badly mismatched (RF impedence) to the coax to function well=
