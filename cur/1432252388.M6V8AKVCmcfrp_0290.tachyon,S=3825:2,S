Damn. Souldn't have said that. I was just trying to illustrate the 
fallacy. It only just dawned on me how it might have sounded.

Let's just say I used to believe I was supposed to think like this, but 
have learned or rediscovered otherwise since. So now I have to control 
the zeal of the converted.

No hostility intended. and I hope none taken.

P..S. I do enjoy Brin et al, but I have little time  for recreational 
reading these days.
