So for the well-meaning naif, a literature search should result in "no
news is good news."  Put more plainly, if you looked up hash and didn't
find news of a SHA break, then you should know to use SHA.  That assumes
you've heard of SHA in the first place.

Perhaps a few "best practices" papers are in order.  They might help
the secure (distributed) computing field a great deal.
