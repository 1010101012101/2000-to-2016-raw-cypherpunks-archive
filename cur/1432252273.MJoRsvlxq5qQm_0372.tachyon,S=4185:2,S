Correct.

You might find it interesting that a number of states are considering (or
revisiting) visual recording statutes. One form has a privacy expectation
and exceptions for prisons, security and "law enforcement engaged in
investigation." Some include public CCTV notice requirements and privacy
expectations defined by location.
TX HB 1040 @
http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/billsrch/subject/77r/S2361.HTM

Others are closer to this Arizona bill, addressing visual surveillance in
public places. This is a bare statute with no mention of a privacy interest.
It exempts "professional journalists," seemingly defined so as to exclude
independent journalists. Bills like this could be construed to restrain the
use of visual surveillance at protests, and in other situations that involve
disparate bargaining power and government overreaching.
AZ HB 2470 @ http://www.azleg.state.az.us/legtext/45leg/1r/bills/hb2470p.pdf

Critics of contemporary surveillance law point out that we increasingly live
in a world where THEY can spy on you, but you can't spy on THEM.
Governments, business and employers are like bad parents that say, "*I* can
do it -- but you can't."

Children learn quickly....
