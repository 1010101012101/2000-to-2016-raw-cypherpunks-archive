That was very interesting.  Kind of reminds me of
Cypherpunks Semi-Arch-Nemesis David Brin's "Earth",
where people messing around with small black hole creation
cause the risk of Bad Things happening.
In practice, we're less likely to see black hole computers
developed than Nanotech Grey Goo computers,

Does "LIGO" stand for "Light In, Garbage Out"?  :-)
