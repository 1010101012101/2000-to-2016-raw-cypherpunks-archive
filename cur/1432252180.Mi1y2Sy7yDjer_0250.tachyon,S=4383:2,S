I have to admit I haven't even noticed what Google service was involved. 
Still, what's «bad» about it?

But do they have the legal right not to hold those keys? Or this matter 
is irrelevant to you?

But that's not what they are saying.

Isn't it ironic? So Google SHOULD make things easier for you to tell 
people to use other services? Sounds like the new anti–gay legislation 
in Russia: making it easier for priests to preach homofobia.
