The US government can't find where the billions of dollars
they gave to Halliburton and other contractors in Iraq went -
hundreds of millions at a pop appear to have vanished on handshakes,
and there's been no serious attempt at accounting.

But anybody supporting anybody accused of being
soft on terrorism, well, we can definitely trace their money.

They're saying this, but the examples they give appear to be targets
who are politically incorrect from the standpoint of the
Pakistani Army, not just the US (though it's a bit hard to tell the
players without a program.)

That's the sort of thing that the Bush Administration asserts is perfectly ok,
though it'd be illegal if they did it in the US, at least if they got
caught doing it to white people without having drugs as an excuse.
