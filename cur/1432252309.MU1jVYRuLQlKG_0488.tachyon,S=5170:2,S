Even your first sentence reeks of the Sex Abuse Agenda.  You cannot
distinguish between readers and authors of sexually oriented material, and
you think people should be instantly labeled with whatever any law
enforcement goon or sex whacko chooses to accuse them of, without benefit
of a trial.

Any country goofy enough to tell people what they are and are not allowed
to read, think, write, or display, within the privacy of their own homes,
even if no one but them is aware of it, is goofy enough to fabricate
evidence in pursuit of a moral panic.

Why, of course, the child sex abuse whackos are all mentally well
adjusted, completely professional, and just live for the day they can say
"I'm sorry" for falsely accusing someone.  Uh huh.

I think you have liking pedophiles confused with hating idiots.  I am a
skeptic by nature, and loathe bon-bon munching Holsteins ranting about
children being molested by Bad Clowns in Secret Underground Tunnels with
Giraffes in them.  So sue me.

Any articulate person who criticizes flim-flam and nonsense these days in
the area of child sexual abuse, gets called a pedophile by all the Lying
Feminist Cunts.  They're nuts.  I'm not.  End of story.

Echols put you up to this, didn't he?  I hear Kinkos pulled his Internet
connection and he's now accusing them of supporting "Internet Child Sex
Predators and Child Pornographers."

Oh when will people learn.
