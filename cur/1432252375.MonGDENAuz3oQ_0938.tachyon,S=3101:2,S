Tim; 

One thing to consider is the role of "credit histories", or 
virtually any other identity-linked information, in a milieu  
where the people have access to the necessary techniques and 
programs to do those deals. 

You sell Alice a credit history on Bob; Bob takes a new 
identity; Alice is back to square one.  Why would Alice 
buy credit histories?

For that matter, why would anyone loan money in the first 
place?  What credit histories could there possibly be?
