Another brilliant idea from Tyler Durden.

Has anyone heard of a utility that can search for a WiFi hotspot while 
driving and then launch an email?

In other words, say you want to send out a few anonymous emails, and you 
don't even want to enter a Cyber-cafe or whatever. So you load up the emails 
in your mail tool and drive down Main Street. The launcher utility detects 
the presence of open wi-fi hotspots and belches out a few of the emails 
while the spot's in range....all the while you don't even slow down.

Sounds possible to me. the only problem might be the need for 
authentication, etc...in some hotspots, but given enough hotspots surely 
there are some that don't need it...
