The "conspiracy theory" meme was widely circulated by the CIA in a
1967 memo to its private sector press agents titled “Countering
Criticism of the Warren Commission Report,” advising them in detail on
how to assist in the suppression of independent investigation of the
JFK murder.  This document was released in 1976 in response to a New
York Times FOIA filing, as CIA Document 1035-960.

"Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government.
Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we
contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have
frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this
dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims
of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such
claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a
classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments."

The agency also directed its members “to employ propaganda assets to
[negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and
feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.”

Today, State sponsored propagandists have embraced the cottage
industry promoting "conspiracy theories" on the Internet as an
effective weapon of information warfare.  Although the Internet makes
censorship of unwelcome information difficult or impossible once it is
in circulation, staining such information with the taint of "lunatick
bullshit" is easy:  Find or create false, easily disproven narratives
describing the same subject matter, and assure that they are
prominently featured and vigorously promoted by click bait website
operators whose sites are already loaded with obviously delusional
content.  Social media promotion by a self recruiting army of
volunteer nut jobs does the rest.
