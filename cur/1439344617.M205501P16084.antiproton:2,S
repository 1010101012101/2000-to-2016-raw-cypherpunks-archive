I have no problem with calling bullshit. Not at all. But if nothing is
workable, government criminals have won, and we're fucked.

Methods, exploits, vulnerabilities, account credentials, passwords, etc,
etc, etc. I'm not into that shit, but I know that it's out there.

Yes, the networks are owned by governments and their friends. But that
doesn't mean that they're unusable. Free agents do get pwned, for sure.
But all too often, it's bad OPSEC that gets them. Loose lips, mostly.

And yes, "joe six pack" isn't doing that. But once stuff has been put
online, anyone can check it out.

What were you getting at? We've seen some amazing shit from Snowden.
It's too bad that he was too patriotic to just drop the whole wad
somewhere, however. So it goes.

You gotta take what you can get.

They've been betrayed several times, that we know of. Mostly it's for
money, and we rarely hear about that, even when people get busted. Have
you read James Bamford's books on the NSA?
