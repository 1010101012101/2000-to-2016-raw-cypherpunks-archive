Dear Mr. Seaver:

    The mayor invites you to come forward with proof to support your
allegations of kickbacks at city hall, as posted on your website.
http://www.oshkoshbygosh.org

   You surely can attend the next Common Council meeting, which begins at
6PM on Tuesday, June 12, 2001, in Room 406 of City Hall, 215 Church Avenue.
There is a portion near the meeting's end, entitled Citizen Statements,
during which time you have ample opportunity to substantiate your claims.

   Otherwise, if you do not have such proof, you ought to consult with legal
counsel to determine what appropriate retractions should be published.  You
might be aware that defamation of character, also known as libel, can result
in civil lawsuits against the defamer. In addition, you may wish to ask
about unauthorized use of portions of the City of Oshkosh website.

Please do not misinterpret this as an effort to stifle appropriate public
discussion about municipal issues.  Valid, public opinions ought not lead
one into legal trouble unless intended to do so.

Thank you very much,
Warren P. Kraft
City Attorney's Office
215 Church Ave
P. O. Box 1130
Oshkosh WI  54903-1130
(920) 236-5115
fax: 920-236-5090


PS  Just so there is no misunderstanding, I do not consent to your
publication of these comments in any fashion other than during a
consultation with your legal counsel, should you so choose.  Feel free to
contact me directly about any questions you may have in these areas.

You need to take a look at this guys web site.  I think he has gone to far
and I would like for you to "nail him to the cross" if you can.  My issue is
with his comments of kickbacks at city hall.  This is a serious charge and
he should either come forward with proof,and we should take appropriate
action,  or have to put out a retraction on his site.  That is what I would
like you to go after him about.  

It is one thing for him to blow off steam with his opinions, but this is a
specific charge of illegal doings and I do not think we should let him get
away with it.  I think it is "put up or shut up" time.

If you would like to discuss what we can do or we need a session on it, then
lets have it.
