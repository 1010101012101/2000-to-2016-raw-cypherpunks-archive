Traffic Analysis is A Bitch, boys and girls. At 10:10 PM +0200 on

returns, writing:


> They do fine for ordinary, private
> goods.

A signed, much less encrypted, copy of a piece of digital
information, or even a digital service, for that matter,
(teleoperated machine commands, or a live video feed answering a
question, and, of course, computation and bandwidth) is, in fact, an
"ordinary, private" good.

Go find an economics dictionary, look up "perfect competition", and
come back when you have a clue, please.


You don't need governments to have a market. People have been trading
things with each other since they could make things and carry them
from place to place.

Frankly, if you have enough financial cryptography, and bearer
settled transactions using that cryptography, you don't even need
governments to have an *economy*.


All you have to do is apply the mathematical economics of
cash-settled, fungible, graded commodity markets to information and
digital services and you get the answer. Look ma, no lawyers: The
first copy to hit the network is worth a lot. The last copy is worth
so little that it should be deleted from a hard drive. In the middle
of the cloud, between the two, who ever owns a copy can sell another
one, and they will, if there's any profit at all in it. That leaves
transaction cost, and, frankly, I can do transactions down to a tenth
of a penny, in bearer form cash, with a couple hundred thou in
development costs. Add Moore's Law, and stir, um, liberally.


Cheers,
RAH
