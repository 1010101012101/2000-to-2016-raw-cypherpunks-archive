And which BASIC PRINCIPLE is that?  Where is the law that codifies
that?  I don't see anything in the Bill of Rights that says anything about

  "Do what thou will shall be the whole of the law, so long as it affect
not another."

Only in thelema and wicca is there anything close.

Certainly it is a good principle, but where is it in the law?
