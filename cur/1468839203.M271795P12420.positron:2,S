I guess. But damn, an up-to-date English version makes more sense to me.

My current working hypothesis is that Tor is not broken/breakable by
design. But I've become increasingly concerned by the continuing
emphasis on Tor browser (easy to install but easily compromised) and
omission of Whonix (harder to install but much harder to compromise). It
is arguable that ease of use trumps strong protection, in that there's
greater net benefit. But less charitably, maybe the need for numerous
users to hide among trumps everything else.
