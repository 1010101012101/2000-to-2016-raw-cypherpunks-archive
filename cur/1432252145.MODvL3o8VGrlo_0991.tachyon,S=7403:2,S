NS 2836: Inside Facebook's massive cyber-security system
http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21095-inside-facebooks-massive-cybersecurity-system.html
* 17:20 26 October 2011 by Jim Giles

FACEBOOK has released details of the extraordinary security
infrastructure it uses to fight off spam and other cyber-scams.

Known as the Facebook Immune System (FIS), the massive defence
network appears to be successful: numbers released by the company
this week show that less than 1 per cent of users experience spam.
Yet it's not perfect. Researchers have built a novel attack that
evaded the cyber-defences and extracted private material from real
users' Facebook accounts.

It took just three years for FIS to evolve from basic beginnings
into an all-seeing set of algorithms that monitors every photo
posted to the network, every status update- indeed, every click made
by every one of the 800 million users. There are more than 25
billion of these "read and write actions" every day. At peak
activity the system checks 650,000 actions a second.

"It's a big challenge," says Jim Larus, a Microsoft researcher in
Redmond, Washington, who studies large networks. The only network
bigger, Larus suspects, is the web itself. That makes Facebook's
defence system one of the largest in existence.

It protects against scams by harnessing artificially intelligent
software to detect suspicious patterns of behaviour. The system is
overseen by a team of 30 people, but it can learn in real time and
is able to take action without checking with a human supervisor.

One notable attack took place in April, says [10]Tao Stein, a
Facebook engineer who works on the system. It began when several
users were duped into copying computer code into their browser's
address bar. The code commandeered the person's Facebook account,
and started sending chat messages to their friends saying things
like "I just got a free iPad", along with a link where the friends
could go to get their own. Friends who clicked on the link went to a
site that encouraged them to paste the same code into their
browsers, further spreading the plague. "Attacks like these can
generate millions of messages per minute," says Stein.

Users are less likely to fall for a similar tactic when using email,
because the message would probably be sent by a stranger.

But inside Facebook's network it's much more persuasive. "It's
easier to exploit trust relationships in online social networks,"
says Justin Ma, a computer scientist at the University of
California, Berkeley, who develops methods to combat email spam.

To tackle the attack, FIS generated a signature that it used to
differentiate between spam and legitimate messages. This was based
on the links in the spam messages, keywords like "free" and "iPad",
and the IP addresses of the computers sending the messages.

But spammers can use multiple machines to switch IP addresses, and
link redirection services like [11]bit.ly can change links on the
fly. So FIS checked to see which messages were being flagged as spam
by users and blocked messages with similar keywords in the text.
Together with other features of the message, which Facebook declined
to discuss for fear of aiding spammers, the system was able to begin
developing a signature to identify the spam within seconds of the
attack emerging.

Facebook said this week that, thanks to FIS, less than 4 per cent of
the network's messages are spam and that fewer than 1 in 200 users
experience spam on any given day. "It's pretty good," says Ma, who
has a Facebook account. "I'm pretty happy with the level of
security."

Yet like any defence based on patterns of known behaviour, FIS is
vulnerable to strategies it has not seen before. Yazan Boshmaf and
colleagues at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada, [12]have exploited this and eluded the system by creating
"socialbots"- software that can pose as a human and control a
Facebook account.

[12] http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/264

The bots began by sending friend requests to random users, around 1
in 5 of whom accepted. They then sent requests to the friends of the
people they had connected with, and the acceptance rate jumped to
almost 60 per cent. After seven weeks the team's 102 bots had made a
combined 3000 friends.

Facebook's privacy settings allow users to shield personal
information from public view. But because the socialbots posed as
friends, they were able to extract some 46,500 email addresses and
14,500 physical addresses from users' profiles- information that
could be used to launch phishing attacks or aid in identity theft.

"An attacker could do many things with this data," says Boshmaf, who
will present the team's work at the Annual Computer Security
Applications Conference in Orlando, Florida, next month.

A socialbot attack is yet to happen, but it's only a matter of time.
Socialbots behave differently to humans that enter Facebook for the
first time, in part because they have no real-world friends to
connect with, and their random requests lead to an unusually high
number of rejections. FIS would be able to use this pattern to
recognise and block an attack of socialbots, says Stein. That would
put Facebook back on top- if only until hackers release their next
innovation.
