No, they're not.  See this article in yesterday's Times:

What grounds Ashcroft is using to deny them their civil rights is not
clear.

Quite sad.  There was an article in IP last night about Canada doing
the same thing; defining protesters as terrorists.  (There's a history
here; the RCMP was quite vicious in its post-arrest treatment of
protesters against some Indonesian dictator a few years ago.)

The irony of my longstanding sig may soon be more than I can stand.
