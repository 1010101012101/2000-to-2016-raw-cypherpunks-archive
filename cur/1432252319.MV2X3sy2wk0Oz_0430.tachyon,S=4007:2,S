I wonder how significant such GPS-based levies would influence the basic 
business model and competitiveness of an auto rental company. At first be 
might be used as a tactical revenue source to enable lower basic rates and 
attract new business, with the scofflaws paying for the difference between 
competitor's market rates and the lower rates afforded by the 
levies.  Later, it might evolve into a sustainable advantage as those most 
likely to pay the levies avoid the agency the remaining customers may very 
well be much safer drivers enabling lower insurance premiums and costs of 
operation
