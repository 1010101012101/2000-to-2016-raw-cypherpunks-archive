oh geez.  Why was it necessary to bring in tanks, special forces and
gunships for overflights?  Why, when if all they wanted was koresh,
all they had to do was wait for him to go to town again, and snatch
him off the street as he walked down the sidewalk?

Who benefited from this "necessary" show of how forcefully Reno et al.
could burn wooden buildings with people inside them?  Yeah-yeah, the
evidence is contested, re: who started the fires.  What isn't contested
is the armored vehicles poking gun muzzles through the walls.
