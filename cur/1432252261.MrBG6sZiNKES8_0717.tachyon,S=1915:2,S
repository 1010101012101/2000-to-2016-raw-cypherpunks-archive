"Five" is too short to be copyrightable.  A longer segment would be.
I once asked, can Intel's "ding dong dong-dong-dong" be copyrighted?
The answer is essentially, to be a glib information theoriest, if the
chances of picking that sequence are sufficiently small.  Of course,
given that its humanly perceptable, shifting the whole sequence
by a large number of Hz is also irrelevant, since humans (except
for pitch-perfect folks) will perceive it as the same.  OTOH,
a parodist can use perfect copies if the context distinguishes
the content.
