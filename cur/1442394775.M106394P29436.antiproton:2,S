I don't actually know the answer to this, but in a summary article on 
the JS exploit they opened by saying part of its beauty was how many 
wonderfully peculiar preconditions were required before it became 
possible. Browser model, JS engine, hardware acceleration options, 
possibly firmwares, and DRAM model/generation/clockspeed.

No reason to be complacent, but the gist was "you probably don't need to 
worry about rowhammer-JS".

Rowhammer itself, OTOH, who knows? :)
