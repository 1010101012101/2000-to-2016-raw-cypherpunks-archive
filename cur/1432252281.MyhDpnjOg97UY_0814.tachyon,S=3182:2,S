My impression is that S/MIME sucks big ones, because it commits
one to a certificate system based on verisign or equivalent.

I have been the verisign administrator at several companies, and
there is no way that bird will fly.  The verisign system is just
barely tolerable for identifying authorized web sites and
software.  For identifying individuals, forget it.
