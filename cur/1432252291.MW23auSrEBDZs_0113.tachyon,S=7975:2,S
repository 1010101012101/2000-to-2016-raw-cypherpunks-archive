Believing that evil is a matter of perspective does not necessarily make
one a moral relativist.  I believe that both good and evil do not exist
objectively.  However, I don't kill people because a) I would feel bad
about it and b) I don't want people killing me back, and c) The type of
society I'd like to live in wouldn't function very well if people just went
around killing each other willy nilly.

I fully agree with this definition, yet I don't define anyone to be my
"enemy" except those who deliberately stand in the way of the things I want
to do (nobody right now except maybe the govt).

I'm assuming by murderously you mean arbitrarily, which makes them a danger
to others.

When you call someone evil, you're begging the question of their evilness.
I've heard lots of people (including myself) called evil to further someone
else's aims, that the word no longer has any meaning any more.  I'd rather
hear "he kills arbitrarily" than "he's evil."

I do use the term "evil" occasionally, but it's usually referring to ideas
or nasty hacks, and usually in a jocular fashion.

At first I thought in this section you were arguing against this particular
use of the term 'evil,' and then you go on to say that the use of this term
made it possible for the govt to convince people that bombing Serbia was a
good thing without having to argue about it, and you say that this is good?
How many other groups of people do you think have been convinced to do
violence this way?  I guess it's OK when the US does it, but not OK when
Hitler calls Jews evil?

Evil *is* a subjective concept, and whenever you hear it you should
immediately become *very* suspicious and ask why, regardless of whether you
think it's obvious that someone's evil, because I think sometimes the
answer will surprise you.
