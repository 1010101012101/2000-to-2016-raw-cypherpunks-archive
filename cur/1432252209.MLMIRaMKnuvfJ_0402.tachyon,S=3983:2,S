You're like so duh.
This is confirmation, corroboration?

Rumsfeld naturally neither confirms nor denies what USG will opr will not do in the future but responds using standard operating procedure for a stupid question like that.

1) "Why, yes we have seriously considered tactical nuclear weapons" = worldwide political shitstorm.  

2) "No we have ruled out tactical nuclear weapons" = tallybinladen relaxation pill.

Big Smart Wired Writer of course jumps to the typically Wired Balanced Journalism conclusion that this perfectly reasonably evasiveness probably means the B61-11.

Go back to preschool, or playing Nintendo or whatever you kids do.
