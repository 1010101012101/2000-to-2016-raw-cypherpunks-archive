This is troubling. It implies that there are widely used crypto
accelerators in use at large organizations that intentionally harm
the security of users. Random number generator flaws would seem like
an obvious possibility here.

This is especially disturbing because other actors can now start
doing teardowns on a wide variety of such devices looking to find the
flaws so they can themselves attack the traffic in question.
