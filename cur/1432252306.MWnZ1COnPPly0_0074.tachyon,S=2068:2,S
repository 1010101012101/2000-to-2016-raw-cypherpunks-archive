It has come to our attention that you citizens are being unsoc.
Please turn on your telescreen (eg Fox News) and wait for the next
minute
of hate.  Then call your local Fatherland Security Agency and wait for

Repeat after me: "We have always been at war with Oceania bin Laden"

War is peace.

In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found,
than in the clause which confides the question of war or
peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department.
-James Madison
(congress has not declared war since 1941)
