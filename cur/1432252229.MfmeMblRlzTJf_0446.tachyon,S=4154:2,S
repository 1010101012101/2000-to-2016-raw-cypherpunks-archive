It's still early in the game to be so certain. But if you are right, 
that in it self is an indictment of PKI. If there really is a market 
for trust establishment and a form of PKI is the low cost producer of 
trust, then someone should be able to make money by using their 
expertise to assemble a technology suite and sell trust insurance 
based on the spread between the risk perceived by the market and what 
they know to be a lower risk. If such services never develop, it 
either means there is no market or PKI doesn't have enough economic 
impact to cover the costs of starting such a business.
