I think they may be referring to a random string of _ASCII characters_.
That would be subject to compression because it is not random at the bit

But 100:1? I have no idea how to achieve that.

Rather than make war on the American people and their
liberties, ...Congress should be looking for ways
to empower them to protect themselves when
warranted.

They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. - Benjamin Franklin
