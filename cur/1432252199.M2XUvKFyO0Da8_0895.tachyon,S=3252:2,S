Then, as other people have pointed out, you should evaluate yourself as a 
mass murderer.

I have a theory that when people claim to adhere to moral axioms that 
manifestly they do not hold, they are up to something.  At best, they are 
psychopaths, who lack moral intuition.  At worst, they have done something 
or are about to do something, and are blowing smoke to cover their past 
actions or contemplated actions.

Like I said, psychopathy or evil.

Is thievery.

And in the past governmental theft of this kind has been accompanied by 
governmental murder about as often as private theft has been accompanied by 
private murder.
