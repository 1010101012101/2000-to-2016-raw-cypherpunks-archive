What a disappointment!

On reading that Subject: line, my first thought was "Ah!  NYT have
decided to accept anonymous cash for electronic newspapers!"

But discovering in the first paragraphs that it was a blog about email
privacy, I still hoped that the blogger would conclude by pointing out
that it IS, after all, possible to do secure, even stealthy, email.

But, no.  Instead we find

I guess she never heard of encryption or stealthmail.  How sad.
