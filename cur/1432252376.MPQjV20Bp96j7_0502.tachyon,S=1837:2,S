Together with mechanical (or, even better, chemical) ignitors you can
achieve a timer construction completely without metal parts.

Doesn't have to necessarily serve as a detonator. If used to control some
mechanical setup, can trigger virtually anything that needs gentle pushing
of something.

A bit medievalish technology, but can withstand an EMP hit. Which could
one day become a nicely sized advantage...
