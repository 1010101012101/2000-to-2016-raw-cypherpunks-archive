Of course, this is just part of the continuing trend
in defining "crimes"
by the subjective fantasies of a party claiming to be
aggrieved.

*I'M* afraid, therefore *YOU'RE* stalking.
*I'M* ashamed, therefore *YOU'RE* indecent.
*I'M* poor, therefore *YOU'VE* discriminated.
*I'M* offended, therefore *YOUR* book is pornography.

between NASCAR and the IRS.
Must be some kind of ConsPiracy, or SomeThing, Eh?
