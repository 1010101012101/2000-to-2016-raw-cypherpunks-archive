Well, I missed the golden days of alleged army-grade mules
here, but since summer 94 there's been nobody posting to
cpunks who was intolerable all the time or tolerable all the
time either. There are fewer tolerable than intolerable but
that's the nature of this sulphurous waterhole. You drink
here and you go nuts, thinking you got smarter than the
others, feel the urge to shape up the fools.

You got to expect that the longer you read this list the
more your mind and ethics degrade. But that's better than
those lists where the opposite is futilely promised. The
best lists go downhill without end, abandon all attempts
to improve themselves, accept scum that remain -- all 
too human.

Barroom brawling produces no winners only scars and
cauliflowers. Gentlepersons just watch and tut-tut in lengthy
essays on what the world is descending to, then vote for
more regulation and policing for everyone except them
and their vile secret practices.

Too late to be an outsider, hanging above the fray like an
angel, that option disappeared with the compulsive need for 
appreciation, the snake bit the angel overdosing on conceit 
of knowledge. Omniscient God hates his adoring children
knowing the suck-ups thoroughly as chips off.

One of the godly features of this Styx is the violent reaction 
against manipulative praise, especially if it is not aimed at 
your proffered graven image.

You want to screw someone here just tell them how much
you appreciate their contributions. Lie.
