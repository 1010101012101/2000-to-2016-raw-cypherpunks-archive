I can think of two terrorist attacks on U.S. soil without too much
difficulty: the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City. 

In both cases, computers and "internet" loosely defined played a minor
organizational role. McVeigh used AOL, and the Trade Center 
bombers had some plans on a floppy disk. 

Have we had any instance of "cyber terrorism" -- you know, the kind of
awful scenario which most people reading this could cook up without too
much difficulty. or is the question not well formed since if it was a
successful attack, we wouldn't know?
