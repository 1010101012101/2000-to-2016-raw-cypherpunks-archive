This virus is generated by alt.comp.virus too (I think that's the 
correct list, haven't looked at it in a while). From what I've heard, 
the virus is almost impossible to get off the list as it's programmed 
to repost itself, and also update itself.

Is it possible that cypherpunks is on alt.comp.virus?
