The hearing that was scheduled for tomorrow Tuesday for
Democratic Judge K. Kroll for hearing an individuals
lawsuit to enable the Palm Beach County recount to count
has been moved to today at 4PM, with all the individual
lawsuits consolidated and both presidential candidates'

There will be one media pool camera.

The identity of President Chad hangs in the balance.
