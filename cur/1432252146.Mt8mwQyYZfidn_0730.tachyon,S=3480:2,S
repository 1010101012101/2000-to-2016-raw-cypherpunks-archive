OK, so why don't we pool our funds to encourage the reverse engineering and 
release of source code to a popular PCS/GSM phone which can be readily 
re-flashed and with sufficient resources (or easily augmented) to handle 
this app? I'll donate $100 e-gold to get the fund going.  I'll establish a 
publicly viewable e-gold account to hold other contributions.  The account 
access key can be secret shared among a few fellow CPs.
