Bill Gertz has received an extraordinary number of leaked
documents. Most of those occurred during the Clinton era
when national security mongerers opposed to Clinton's 
policies leaked top secret stuff. Those kinds of leaks seemed
to have diminished now that those anti-Dems are in
power again. They continue to be opposed to carry overs 
from the Clinton team like Tenet and others. There could 
be more leaks or worse crimes against humanity to help 
get rid of those remnants.

However, ex-members of Clinton's administration are
now leaking natsec stuff as Bush's team increases
bashing of the Dem's policies, and counterterrorism claims
are sure to get leaked left and right once the pol's dipshit 
backslapping and airkissing vanish.

Congressional hearings on who knew what and when about
the 911 attacks may not be in the offing any time soon, but
they are needed to determine which war mongerers were 
most in cahoots with their good buddy jihadists to foster
mineral exploitation in the target region and as a sideline
boost the need for strategic Alaskan oil.
