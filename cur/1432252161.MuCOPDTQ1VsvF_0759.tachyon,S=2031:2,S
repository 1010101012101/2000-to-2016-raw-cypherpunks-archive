I agree except to say that there must be a minimal level of freedom and 
security in which to operate. You'd have to be not in a place like Rwanda where the 
Hutu might literally hack you and your hardware with their machetes.  Or be 
in another similar condition where the network lines are pounded into pretty 
jewelry.

Communities like the Amish can only flourish in communities such as the US 
which largely leaves them alone (This is changing unfortunately.)

I do remember we discussed the ridiculous notion of placing machine guns on 
Haven-Co's platform-  As if the Brits would allow such a thing in their 
territorial waters.
