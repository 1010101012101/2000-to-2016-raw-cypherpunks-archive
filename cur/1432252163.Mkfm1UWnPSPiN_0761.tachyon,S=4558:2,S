You blithely say "if we put our minds to it", as if that were a simple thing.
[ Hint: Minds have been "put to it" before. ]

For your amusement, here are a few dates from history:

November 7, 1973
	President Nixon launches Project Independence, with the goal of achieving energy self-sufficiency by 1980.

April 18, 1977
	President Carter announces National Energy Plan in his first major energy speech.
Goal is to reduce oil imports by 65%, and to reduce energy growth to 2%/year.

March 17, 1987
	President Reagan's Energy Security Report outlines the
Nation's increasing dependence on foreign oil.

February 20, 1991
	President Bush presents the Department's National Energy Strategy
to Congress and the American people.
