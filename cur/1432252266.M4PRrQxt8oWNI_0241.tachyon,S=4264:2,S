It tells you the output power, from which one may estimate input power 
requirements.

Beam spread is one of the most significant considerations in delivering 
high energy to distant targets. In general, one wants a large beam size to 
reduce divergence.

The phenomenon of diffraction influences the propagation of Gaussian light 
beams. The output of a laser is generally ''pencil-like'' in nature and has 
a very low divergence, yet is subject to diffraction that causes it to 
spread. Gaussian beam theory deals with this effect.  The Rayleigh range, Z 
sub R, is used as a criterion for determining the spreading of a 
monochromatic Gaussian light beam as it propagates in free space.

In 1987 it was discovered that were ''nondiffracting'' beam types.  The 
zeroth-order Bessel beam is one such solution and results in a beam with a 
narrow central region surrounded by a series of concentric rings.  Ideally 
this beam type exhibits no diffraction or spreading, in practice it is 
possible to obtain Bessel beams of less than 1/10 the divergence of a 
Gaussian beam of otherwise similar properties.  Bessel beams have been the 
subject of intense investigastion for a broad range of optical applications.
