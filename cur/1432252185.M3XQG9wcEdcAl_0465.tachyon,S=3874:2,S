I can see an excellent application for all of our old long-out-of-print
LP's:  Digitize them (assuming we still have an operational turntable!) and
the noise level will be comfortably high.  And, there is no digital
"reference" for this audio anywhere, so comparisons will be virtually
impossible.  (Just re-digitize the same LP for an dramatically-different
dataset, at least in the 6-7 LSB's.)
