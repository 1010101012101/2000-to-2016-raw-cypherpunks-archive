Excuse me; I only skimmed the article and missed the part that described
the original funding arrangements supporting the development of the
initial version.

You'd think that the development of software intended to be used by the
Justice Department, for an application of non-trivial sensitivity, would
be contracted out to a firm with existing connections to the government
law enforcement community.  But at that time, I suppose it could be said
that computer security and trust issues would have little chance of being
understood by largely computer-illiterate prosecutors and administrative
personnel.

Presumably today the award of software development contracts follows a
rigid and formal protocol -- for the protection of both parties.

There are more general principles of information theory that apparently
apply to any instance in which code and a dictionary are used to process
information.  I believe that the extraction of information from such
processes at arbitrary points of access is something of a black art.

So goes the contemporary non-specialist understanding of the field.

Quite.  If you want to get any actual work done, the process exposes you
to the risk of leaking information to third-parties.  Assuming that is not
what is intended, I suppose you can spend a metric shitload of money on
measures designed to mitigate against specific risks, without any
guarantee of success.

In .5M LOC, just about anything is possible.  However, I don't believe
that  back-door code would have had anything to do with enhancing the
vulnerability of the system to TEMPEST attacks.

Indeed.

I've heard rumours suggesting that arbitrary bus signals (SCSI, PCI, FSB)
are radiated with the same promiscuity as are monitor signals.  IIRC, a
sharp right-angle trace on a circuit board will allow the emmission a
detectable RF signal, contingent only on the sensitivity and proximity of
a suitably configured receiver.  Presumably the expense of designing
digital electronics with the criterion of minimising radiated signals is
not worth the bother for the vast majority of devices.  The status quo of
the commodity consumer market for computers and peripherals suggests that
the primary design criterion is the minimisation of manufacturing cost. 
Function and security criterion are necessarily compromised.

Fascinating.

Don't get me started.  Social engineering on a grandiose scale; and that's
just about all anyone (in or out of the entertainment industry) needs to
know about Hollywood:  foresight that can be measured in calendar months;
ethics that make the BATF look good, etc.

As people retire from the DOJ, FBI, and so on, it may happen that people
make mention of him in their biographies.  Assuming that they aren't
intimidated or into silence (or bought).
