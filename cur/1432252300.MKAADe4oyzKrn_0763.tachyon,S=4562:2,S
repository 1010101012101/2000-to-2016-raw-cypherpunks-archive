This is where the "Simplistic Grid" comes in. The momentum of Chinese 
culture will oalways outlive any short-term despotism, and the Chinese on 
many levels know this. When it comes to China, even some of the 
Han-dominated areas are incredibly difficult to get to, and when you start 
talking about Southern parts of Yunnan, most parts of Tibet, and places like 
Qinhai and Xinjiang, the idea of a lightening-fast and efficient despotism 
starts to sound dubious. Indeed, these areas are only barely under Beijing 
control today. It's also a main reason why Burma and the Golden triangle 
find it very easy to ship heroin overland through China to Hong Kong rather 
than go at it via a more direct route.

Anhui and central China suffered far more than other parts of China. I'd 
guess that 70% of the deaths due to starvation during 58 to about 64 
occurred in that part of Central China. The obvious reasons were: 1) 
Proximity and easy communicatuion with Beijing, and 2) Large tracts of 
previously arable land (ie, you don't bother exerting despotism over an area 
that can't do much anyway).

No, I am arguing that Chinese communism was a different thing from Soviet 
commusim, for the precise reason that the weight of Chinese history would be 
fairly quick to erase Chinese commusim. Any China hand could have predicted 
exactly that, and indeed that's precisely what happened. Our decision to 
back the far-more corrupt Chiang regime all the way to 1973 or whenever, was 
a major blunder, if for no other reason then to accelerate the isolation of 
the Soviets. Mao would have been very hip to the manuever, and I bet would 
have welcomed it (The Soviets were never very useful to the Chinese 
communists). In other words, even a smart rabid anti-communist should have 
recognized that backing Mao's "Bandits" was at some point obvious, but most 
were far too blinded by their ideology to see that.

The same thing's happening with Iraq and Iran. Iran's making overtures that 
we consistently ignore because were too darned dumb and power-oriented to 
see the opportunity.
