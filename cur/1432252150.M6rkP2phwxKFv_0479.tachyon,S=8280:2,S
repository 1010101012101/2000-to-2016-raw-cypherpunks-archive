Yea..even the places it's been before are pretty awful, for a human. I 
don't think this is a local unstable point, far from it; our current 
climate seems very stable. But, over those epochs, we've built up a huge 
store of high-energy carbon, and as the CO2 left the atmosphere since 
those epochs, the ecosystems we have right now are not accustomed to 
high-greenhouse climates. So, the fact that we're now suddenly digging 
up what amounts to eons of free solar energy, and are burning them all 
at once, is a problem.

Will the earth burn? No, that's an unlikely outcome. Venus is Venus 
because it never developed life. Will the Earth burn *us*? Maybe. 
Totally plausible possibility, though still unlikely. Will the Earth 
burn the ecosystems that civilisation (rather than humanity, per se) 
depends on? At this rate, probably.

We have fallbacks; go all-in on solar & nuclear for energy and biotech 
for efficient, lower impact food/med production, and use nuclear/biotech 
to cook up some hyperefficient carbon-capture system to try and roll 
back as much as we can.

I'll just point at this, then, as an example of what I find exciting in 
this space: 
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0109935 - 
That's some staple elemental inputs, CO2, and electricity ONLY, and a 
massive sequestration effect per volt/meter using bacteria. Outputs are 
hydrogen and acetate, useful energy/industrial chemicals.

Anyways, just to say doom and gloom is rarely useful, but ostrich-heads 
are worse than useless. Action can be beneficial, and action need not be 
"live like a peasant", it can be "change your tech and culture to live 
comfortably or even abundantly with less impact".

As to on/off topic-ness, it's off topic. But this list has seen people 
bitching about who is and isn't a real native American, so I find this 
at least engaging and interesting.
