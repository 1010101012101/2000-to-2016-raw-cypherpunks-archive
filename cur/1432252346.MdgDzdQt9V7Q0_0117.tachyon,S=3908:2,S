The current administration keeps waffling on if this is a war or not.

When it suits their purposes (getting money out of congress, censoring the 
press, and trampling on the constitution and bill of rights) it is a War.  
When it does not suit their purposes (like how they treat prisoners), it 
is not a War.

Speaking of "Missing In Action"...

Anyone know what Cheany is up to? 

If life imitates the movies, we are either seeing a remake of "Dave" or 
"Weekend At Bernies".
