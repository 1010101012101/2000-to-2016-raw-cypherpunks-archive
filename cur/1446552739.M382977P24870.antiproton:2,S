Convictions of suspects who refuse to hand over their encrypted passwords
have risen sixfold in four years, potentially blocking police from
examining their electronic devices.

The sharp increase has led to fears that criminals are opting to plead
guilty to encryption offences rather than allow detectives to go through
their computers and phones, which could lead to more serious charges and
longer sentences.

Gareth Corfield, editor for The Register, added "On that RIPA stats story,
it's been fed to The Times as part of the Snooper's Charter PR push from
stats not previously made public."
