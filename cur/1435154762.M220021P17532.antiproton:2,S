i've been critical of Jake in the past, and part of that was fueled by
misinformation (character assassination).

in the infosec realm, Jake gets flak for occasionally running rough
shod over fine details. the infosec pedant find this irritating, but
the actual haters (JTRIG lackeys? :) rely on this to attempt to
discredit entirely.  hating on 0day sales and exploit kits also wins
few infosec friends, even though many others in industry also find
this element distasteful.

now that rat fuck hector is out of the game, they've surely turned to others.
 [ how much of Sabu targeting ioerror is at Fed behest? Nadim also by request? ]

---

i repeat my earlier apology, and note that Jake responded to my
personal attacks with respect and civility - this, among other deeds,
demonstrates integrity and effort to improve self.

thank you Jake!

---

FBI closed my FOIA request for use of "disruption strategy" as too
vague; a record denial among my many MuckRocking's, hence i will be
digging more thoroughly in this direction in multiple future FOIAs.

if anyone has other pointers to good examples of this disruption
tactic in action, or other helpful hints, i'd like to hear them! :)


best regards,
