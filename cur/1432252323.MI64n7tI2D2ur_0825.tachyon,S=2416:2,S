   from the get-you-where-you-live dept.
   Badluck writes "Microsoft and the entertainment industry's holy grail
   of controlling copyright through the motherboard has moved a step
   closer with Intel Corp. now embedding [1]digital rights management
   within in its latest dual-core processor Pentium D and accompanying
   945 chipset. Officially launched worldwide on the May 26, the new
   offerings come [2]DRM -enabled and will, at least in theory, allow
   copyright holders to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of
   copyrighted materials from the motherboard rather than through the
   operating system as is currently the case..." [3]The Inquirer has the
   story as well.
