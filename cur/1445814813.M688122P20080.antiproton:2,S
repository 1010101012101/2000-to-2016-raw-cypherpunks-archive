The challenge is how to spread such a meme effectively, powerfully.

Then perhaps there'd be a hope that people would take up arms against
their owners, or at least in defence of their families (I've posted
the post Hurricane Katrina illegal weapons confiscations by federal
military - no one, NO ONE failed to give up their arms (although TBH I
cannot of course speak to those who denied they had any guns in their
respective home - would love to see some true stories of humans with
spines, balls and ovaries!))

And since Credit River Decision, no judge will take up a ruling
against the banks.

And since the machine gun slaughter of the early unionists, as you
hint at above, all unions have fallen to infiltration/ corruption in
relatively short order.

FUCK it's a fucked up world! Juan, PLEASE tell me there's a better one
somewhere, somehow?

up death fest of evil.
