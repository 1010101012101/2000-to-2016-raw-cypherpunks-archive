I wasn't picking on you or your points, that's for sure. In fact, I 
barely noticed whose message I was replying to.

My point was a larger one, that nearly all such debates about privacy 
eventually come round to issues of "what have you got to hide?" and 
issues of truth and lies.

This is why I like the "Congresss shall make no law" and "shall not be 
infringed" absoluteness of the original Constitution. The language does 
not natter about "truthful speaking shall not be infringed."

And this is why more recent legislation allowing government to regulate 
"commercial speech" or to decide which speech is true and which is 
false (as in advertising claims) is so corrosive to liberty.
