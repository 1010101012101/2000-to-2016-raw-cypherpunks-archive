The Brits did a nice PR spin on some of this - BBC reports that
in some town in Southern Iraq, where the secular Baath Party hasn't let the
Shiitte muezzin do the public call to prayer for 15 years,
the British army has set up a PA system, and
made sure they have the religious freedom for the call to prayer again.
In Basra, it's a similar story, though in that case the mosque building
was destroyed in the 1991 bombing, but Shiite prayers have been banned
for more like 30 years, according to the IHT.
