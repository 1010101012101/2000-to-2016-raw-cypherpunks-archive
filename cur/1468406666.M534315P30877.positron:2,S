This is why I install only a limited number of apps from (hopefully non subverted) known good sources on hackintosh & MacBook.  Some UNIX stuff from homebrew, transmission, chrome, iterm and a couple others.. of course even this isn't anywhere near perfect

"Easydoc converter.app" name fucking sounds fishy (and worthless)...

More and more malware finally starting to target osx (err macOS, or whatever it's called these days)..
