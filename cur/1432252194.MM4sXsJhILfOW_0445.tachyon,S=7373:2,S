	There is a defination of what "readily accessible to the general
public" means in section 2510:

	Certainly wardriving for encrypted (WEP) signals is very clearly
illegal (and now a felony by the way - even before the CSEA becomes law).

	And wardriving for any access points provided by common carriers
(becoming more common in some places I understand as carriers go into that
business) would clearly be illegal.

	But the modulation in 802.11 is public... so nothing is wrong
there.   And the frequencies are public (and a ham band to boot)...

	It is quite possible that the frequencies allocated to the amateur
radio service clause would apply and trump everything else - especially
if you are a ham as most of the 2.4 ghz 802.11b band is also allocated
as a ham band.  I know of no court tests of whether the cordless phone
prohibitions (with cordless phones at both 2.4 ghz and 900 mhz which
are both ham bands too) apply to hams intercepting cordless phones that
also operate in those bands... nor how that impacts WEP interception.
