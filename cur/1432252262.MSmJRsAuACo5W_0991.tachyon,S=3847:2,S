I can't speak for any of the other authors, but yes, I am extremely
concerned about the DMCA.  In the case of HDCP, I spent more time speaking
with lawyers than I spent on the cryptographic research itself.  As a
result of this experience, I don't plan to work in the area of copy
protection again so long as this legal shadow hangs over the field.
The costs are simply too high.

For further information, you can read the declaration I submitted
in the Felten case.  It is available online at the URL below.
