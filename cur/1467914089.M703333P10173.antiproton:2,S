How could a thing like this happen?

In recent decades, Mayors are among the very few Amerikans who have
been exposed to accurate information about nuclear weapon targeting,
yields and effects, because U.S. cities still have (archaic, symbolic)
"Civil Defense" staff, assets and plans to manage.

Since mayors have no authority to affect military spending and the
foreign policy that drives it, nobody is bribing and blackmailing them
to be cheerleaders for strategic nucular conflict toe to toe with the
Russkies, already in progress.

Those who believe that nuclear warfare is a game where "the only way
to win is not to play" have not seen the budget figures for Uncle
Sam's latest round of warhead & delivery system development &
deployment.  That money ain't just fed into a shredder ya know.
