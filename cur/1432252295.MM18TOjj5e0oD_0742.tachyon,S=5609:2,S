Aug. 15, 2002 | In July, 2001, a group of retired diplomats from the United 
States, Iran, Pakistan and Russia gathered in Berlin to discuss the future 
of Afghanistan, one of several brainstorming sessions about that troubled 
country sponsored by the United Nations last year. During the days, the men 
met in tony hotel conference rooms. At night, they shared drinks or dinner. 
And during every discussion, the diplomats focused on the Taliban -- how to 
make the radical Muslim group form a broad-based government, and give up 
Osama bin Laden, who was suspected of masterminding several terrorist attacks.
These facts about the Berlin meeting are not in dispute. Everything else 
is. Exactly what was said in Berlin and how it was translated to the 
Taliban has become the centerpiece of a vast dispute about the Bush 
administration, Osama bin Laden and the buildup to the Sept. 11 attacks. On 
the left, it has become an article of faith for many that the 
U.N.-sponsored meetings were part of a concerted Bush administration effort 
to push for an oil and gas pipeline through Afghanistan. When the talks 
fell apart, it's been alleged, the administration used the diplomats to 
issue a military threat, which was carried back to the Taliban. Bin Laden, 
the theory goes, then decided to strike first, making the Sept. 11 attacks 
not a random act of terrorist violence, but rather a pre-emptive strike -- 
a calculated response to the Bush administration's love of oil, and its 
irresponsible sabre-rattling in pursuit of it.
That tangled theory mostly hinges on one source: Niaz Naik,a member of the 
Pakistani delegation to the U.N. talks, who told the British press two 
weeks after Sept. 11 that the United States had issued a military threat at 
the meetings.
SALON you cockteasing butt ugly HO! The taliban were sounding out the west 
prior to s11.In spite of their Saudi like state security and cultural 
vandalism,they might have been approachable.Certainly some money changed 
hands to burn off a little surplus smack.Make up your motherfucking mind 
SALON,do you want to be the grey lady or the downmarket HUSTLER? The way 
your going you'll wind up the grey bag lady who used to be a Hustler cover 
girl.We do not have endless patience,SALON!
