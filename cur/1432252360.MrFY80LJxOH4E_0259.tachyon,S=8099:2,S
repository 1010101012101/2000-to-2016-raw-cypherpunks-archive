4: FUN AND GAMES:  CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN IS BACK!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The heart-stopping follow-up to one of the most revered PC games of all time, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, uncovers Hitler’s horrific obsession with the occult, living dead, and genetic mutations.

As an Army Ranger recruited in the Office of Secret Actions, players infiltrate deep into the twisted bowels of the Third Reich to battle the horrific super-soldiers, zombies, and mutants forged in the unearthly experiments of Heinrich Himmler.

Built on the Quake III engine, Return to Castle Wolfenstein delivers fast-paced action and white-knuckle suspense.  Set to be released later this year, the screen shots so far are amazing, and gamers everywhere are talking about this new release.  Be sure to swing by GameSpot, or your favorite game review website, and check out all the latest.  Or, search on the new Go!Zilla Search for the latest screens, movies, and trailers for the game.
