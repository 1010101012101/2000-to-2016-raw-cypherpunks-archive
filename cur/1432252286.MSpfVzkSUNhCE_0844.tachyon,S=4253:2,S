>> The U.S. National Security Agency knew for at least two years about a flaw in the way that many websites send sensitive information, now dubbed the Heartbleed bug, and regularly used it to gather critical intelligence, two people familiar with the matter said.

NYT (Apr 12) - "Obama Lets N.S.A. Exploit Some Internet Flaws, Officials
Say" by David @SangerNYT:
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/us/politics/after-heartbleed-bug-obama-decides-us-should-reveal-internet-security-flaws.html

> Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said the review of the recommendations [by a presidential advisory committee] was now complete, and it had resulted in a “reinvigorated” process to weigh the value of disclosure when a security flaw is discovered, against the value of keeping the discovery secret for later use by the intelligence community.

> “This process is biased toward responsibly disclosing such vulnerabilities,” she said.
