This is somewhat related to what ZKS did in their version 1 [1,2] mail
system.

They made a transparent local pop proxy (transparent in that it
happened at firewall level, did not have to change your mail client
config).  In this case they would talk to your real pop server,
decrypt the parts (they were reply-block like onions), remove
duplicates (as with mixmaster etc you can send duplicates via separate
remailers to improve reliability).  So the transparent proxy would
leave alone your normal mail that you received in the pop box and
remove duplicates only from the reply-block delivered pseudonymous
mail.

Actually they implemented the reply-block from scratch, it always
seemed to me it would have been less development work to use mixmaster
(it was implemented before I started).  The ZKS reply block did not
even use chunking (ala mixmaster) so traffic analysis would have been
trivial as the message size would show through.

At least that's what I recall, no chunking.  However I am finding the
security issues paper [1] says otherwise.  The 1.0 architecture
document [2] is ambiguous, there is no mention of chunking.

(I've sent mail to one of the original developers to check I have it
right).

It was also unreliable because it did not use SMTP, it used its own
transport AMTP and its own retry-semantics on nodes called
MAIPs. (Mail AIPs, an AIP is an "Anonymous Internet Proxy").


Then we implemented a replacement version 2 mail system that I
designed.  The design is much simpler.  With freedom anonymous
networking you had anyway a anonymous interactive TCP feature.  So we
just ran a standard pop box for your nym.  Mail would be delivered to
it directly (no reply block) for internet senders.  Freedom senders
would send via anonymous IP again to get sender anonymity.  Used qmail
as the mail system.

Unfortunately they closed down the freedom network pretty soon after
psuedonymous mail 2.0 [3] was implemented.

There is an interesting trade-off here.  The interactive
communications are perhaps more vulnerable to real-time powerful
adversary traffic analysis than mixmaster style mixed chunked
delivery.  However they are less vunerable to subpoena because they
are forward-secret on a relativey short time-frame.  (1/2 hr if I
recall; however more recent designs such as chainsaw internal
prototype, and cebolla [4] by ex-ZKSer Zach Brown change keys down to
second level by using a mix of backward-security based on symmetric
key hashing (and deleting previous key) and forward security using DH.)

It would be nice to get both types of anonymity, but I suspect for
most typical users the discovery / subpeona route is the major danger,
and if that is thwarted it is unlikely that their activities would
warrant the effort of real time analysis.  Well we have carnivore now,
so they could potentially do real-time traffic analysis more routinely
if they were to distribute enough collaborating analysis carnivore
plugins.
