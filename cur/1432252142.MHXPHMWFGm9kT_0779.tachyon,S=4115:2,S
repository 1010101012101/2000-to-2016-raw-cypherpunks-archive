I don't need or want to talk to your attorney.  But you should at least read 
and try to understand the statutes that you link to and make reference to.  
The big fucking deal is I have attended four of DPS's intructor classes where 
their attorneys and instructors explain the use of force laws to us in the 
manner they want them passed on to the public.  I do not pass on uninformed 
opinions on topics I am not qualified to comment on.
