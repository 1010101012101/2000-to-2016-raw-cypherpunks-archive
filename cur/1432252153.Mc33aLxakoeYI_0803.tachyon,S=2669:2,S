Gun show denies booth for man selling anthrax recipes
Wed Nov 28 2001 10:20:07 ET

A Phoenix gun show is refusing space to a Nebraska man who sells a 
book that includes directions for making anthrax! Timothy Tobiason 
attended gun shows in Salt Lake City where he hawked 'Advanced 
Biological Weapons Design and Manufacture,' including an anthrax 
recipe.

"We have told him he cannot go, and we have refunded his money," said 
Bob Templeton, owner of the Crossroads of the West gun shows.
