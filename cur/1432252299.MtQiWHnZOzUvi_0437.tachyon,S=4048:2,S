The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has posted on its Web site
<http://www.treas.gov/fincen> a report on  regulatory and law enforcement
issues presented by E-cash, E-banking and Internet gaming.  This appears to
be the document that was leaked to Declan McCullagh and previewed in a
WIRED News article a few weeks ago,
