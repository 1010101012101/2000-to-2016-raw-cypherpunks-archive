Issue: Manipulation technique found in the Diebold central tabulator -- 
1,000 of these systems are in place, and they count up to two million 
votes at a time.

By entering a 2-digit code in a hidden location, a second set of votes is 
created. This set of votes can be changed, so that it no longer matches 
the correct votes. The voting system will then read the totals from the 
bogus vote set. It takes only seconds to change the votes, and to date not 
a single location in the U.S. has implemented security measures to fully 
mitigate the risks.
