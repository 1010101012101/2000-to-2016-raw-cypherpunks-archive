Dan,
The 9 servers are operated by Chaum, and is the software and OS config open
source and 3rd party verifiable as being the same as running on the servers?

9 servers will be operated in 9 different jurisdictions, not by 9 separate
unrelated 'entities'.

'Trust us' is just something we've become accustomed to not needing.
