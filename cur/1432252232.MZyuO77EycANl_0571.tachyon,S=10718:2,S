milestones:

On November 17, 2O04, Yap International revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap International Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending solution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is |imited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a|lows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Personal Gateway from any cellular or |andline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their |aptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partial|y or entire|y the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2OO4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract involving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Central and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second largest carrier in the region for 2OO,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wil| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in genera| programming /data base management and the 
physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
involvement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Mi|liken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the
