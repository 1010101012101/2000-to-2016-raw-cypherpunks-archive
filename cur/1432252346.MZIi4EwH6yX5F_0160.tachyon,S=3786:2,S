Similarly, databases labelled as "relational" never were, and 
databases that actually are relational never bothered to so  
label themselves.

Anti capitalist anarchism, socialist anarchism, died bloodily 
in Catalonia in betrayal, terror, and tyranny.  In 1938 the  
remaining "anarcho" socialists hastily reinterpreted their  
past inconvenient ideology, so that the word "anarchy" was  
reinterpreted to have a meaning indistinguishable from then  
existent socialism, as practiced by Lenin and Stalin.
