Especially with the press constantly telling them "Linux is hard".


Most people know that MS software is buggy and inecure.
But they think that it is normal to have to reboot
your computer daily and to get infected with worms
through your email.  After all, it's the same for
all their friends and co-workers, how can they
even know to expect anything else?

Almost all the press tells them that MS is the only
way to go and that anything else is wierd and hard
to run.  The unreliability and security holes are
just a burden to be borne...  it's remarkable
how much people can tolerate if it's done
to them gradually.

SHA-2?
Still not enough to draw conclusions.
