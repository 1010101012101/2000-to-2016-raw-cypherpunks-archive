Man who videotaped visitors in the nude gets probation, year in jail
	
	
	
	
MILWAUKEE -- A judge placed a man on 10 years probation, but included a 
year in jail, for the secret videotaping of visitors to his home with 
cameras hidden in a bathroom and guest bedroom.
Steven John Hintz, 29, was sentenced Monday by Milwaukee County Circuit 
Judge M. Joseph Donald on four felony counts of recording nudity without 
consent.
The self-employed audiovisual technician pleaded guilty to the charges 
filed under a new state law after he unsuccessfully challenged the 
constitutionality of the statute.
Hintz was charged last December three days after the equipment was found by 
a guest who was visiting the home with his wife and two children.
Detectives said Hintz told them he got the idea by watching television but 
insisted that he did not plant the hidden cameras for sexual gratification.
Instead, he said, he did it merely to see if it could be done.
``Then why not place these cameras in the kitchen and living room?'' 
Milwaukee County Assistant District Attorney Patti Wabitsch asked.
Hintz apologized for his behavior and asked for forgiveness. done.
``I'm confident it will not happen again,'' defense attorney Gerald Boyle 
contended. ``This young man has learned his lesson.''
Hintz said he did not expect to be forgiven overnight.
``If it were not for my foolish actions and childish way of thinking, none 
of us would be here today,'' he said.
