I've been thinking about your project, I like your idea and wish you the
best. I don't think it would be appropriate for the CDR because we have a
specific focus (that does include anonymity) and it doesn't include being
a mule for a stream of anonymous messages of god knows what subject
matter. I will be including information on the SSZ CDR homepage about it,
unless you object.

On the other hand, if you find that your single server can't handle the
load please keep me in mind. I have the resources to support such a
mailing list and especially like the 'distributed' nature you refer to.
Once I get my part of the 'Hangar 18' Plan 9 resource space up and running
I hope to use my 'igor' remailer project for something quite similar. I'm
sure there will be room to collaborate once I get my ducks in a row.
