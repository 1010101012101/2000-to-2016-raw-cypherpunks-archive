Been there, done that, got the credit. I was one of the original developers
of Apple Kermit (in 6502 assembler) at Columbia University. Amongst other
things, I added pseudo lowercase support (Apple ]['s had only capital
letters).
Apple Kermit included a VT52 emulator (on a 24x40 screen :-). If you look in
Frank daCruz's "The Kermit Book" you'll find my name buried in the
acknowledgments.

The Arpanet at 300 baud taught patience.....

Actually, by 86, the Mac was out, as was the PC/AT and (I think) the 
Amiga. These were much more capable machines than the Apple ][.
