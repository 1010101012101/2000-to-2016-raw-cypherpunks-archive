	Um. No, they are serious fighters weapons because they are simple, 
robust and reliable.

	But mostly robust and reliable.

	If you're looking for a firearm, after reliability the most 
important thing is ergonomics. I've owned a Beretta 92, a Tanfoglio (eaa 
witness) .45, and a HK P7. I've fired glocks, Sigs, Browning Hi-powers 
(and clones/redesigns) and a wide variety of 1911s.

	I can't stand the way the glocks and most of the 1911s fit my hand, 
they don't feel "right", while the browning Hi-power, the HK P7, Beretta 
etc. all felt good. The P7 being the best IMO.

	Just about any contemporary pistol is going to be robust and 
reliable as long as you don't make too many modifications to it.

	The real world energy difference between a .40 and a 9mm is not 
worth talking about.

	The most important thing with a pistol is accuracy. There are two 
ways to achieve good accuracy, one is to be born with a natural talent. 
The other is to practice practice, practice. With 9mm being 
significantly cheaper than .40, you can practice a lot more for the same 
dollar.

	9mm has been killing and wounding people for many years.

	Then again, we don't have many scientific studies on the 
effectiveness of the .45 against them either.
