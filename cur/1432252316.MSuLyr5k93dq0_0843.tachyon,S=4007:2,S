I didn't read far enough into BU's piece to see him asking such a silly 
question, or I would have also offered S&P and D&B as examples. 
"Foobarcorp's rating has been lowered from AAA to AA." Like it or not, 
they are in the business of reputation rating.

So is a Notary Public. So is a restaurant reviewer in a newspaper. So 
are Siskel and Ebert, er, Ebert and That New Guy.

So are the kosher meat dudes who stamp "Kosher" on food approved for 
consumption by Jews.

So are the "PC Labs" and other reviewers of new PC hardware.

We are swimming in a sea of such reputation services, just as we are 
swimming in what is basically an anarchic ocean.
