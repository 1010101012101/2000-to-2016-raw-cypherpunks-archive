After several months of exciting development, we are proud to announce the developer release candidate for wider testing of the Serval Mesh 0.90RC1, aka Shiny. It is called Shiny due to the significant and exciting changes we have made.

What we need from you now is people to download, install and test. We need you to really use it, and let us know what you think, good or bad. We want to know about all the bugs and issues, but we also want to know what you like about it. If you donbt discover any show stopping bugs, we hope to release this version into Google Play by the 25th January.

Thank you all for staying on this journey with us!
