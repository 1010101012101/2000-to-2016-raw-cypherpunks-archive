"Then your ears are not golden, period."

Harumph!

But you misunderstand what the phase button does. If the speakers are wired 
out of phase anybody can hear that. Actually, it's a quite interesting thing 
to hear...nothing is really localizable.

But the phase button inverts the absolute phase of the signal coming out of 
both speakers. In other words, with a bass drum hit do the speaker cones 
move outward at the initial strike or inward (as they are not supposed to). 
Supposedly this difference can be heard, but my speakers start rolling off 
below 100Hz, so I suspect that's why I have a very hard time discerning the 
absolute phase difference when I hit the button.
