Democrat spinners are now talking up the idea of using "statistical 
sampling" to assign some fraction of the spoiled ballots to Al Gore.

Not a surprise, given that it was the Democrats who wanted to augment 
the "direct count" of the U.S. Census with "statistical fudge 
factors."

I never thought I'd hear this bizarre notion extended to the vote, though!
