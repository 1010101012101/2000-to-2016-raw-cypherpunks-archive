Jim:

A spammer (or your spammer's proxy) is not going to 
individually encrypt messages to thousands or
millions of end-recipients, each with their own public
key - the time factor makes this uneconomical, and 
the hassle factor of finding all the recipient public 
keys makes it impractical. Thus, only remailers 
which send out plaintext are useful to spammers
as exit remailers.

It is only exit remailers (ie, the remailer which sends
to the final recipient) which get hassled for sending
spam.

The goal is to make remailer operators life easier by
preventing them from being used to spam random
lusers, who may initiate complaints against the
remailer operator.

It is not to prevent spam passing through a remailer
somewhere in mid-cloud. While such encrypted
spam will increase the volume of traffic, for most
remailers that is a Good Thing - more material to
confuse the traffic analysis. As long as it gets 
dropped before leaving the remailer network, no
harm is done.
 
Steve understands this, as does every one else but
you. 

What's the problem?

Any remailer operator can decide not to pass along plaintext. So long as the
message sender is aware of this property, nothing more needs to be
distributed.
There are no increased sysadmin issues.

No, there is not, beyond the fact that the message originator must know the 
final recipient's public key.

Jim, do you really understand how remailer chaining works?
