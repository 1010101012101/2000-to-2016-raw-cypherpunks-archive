The police and fire departments want them so that if there's an
emergency, they can get at them quickly.
The blueprints registered at the town/township/county building department
were probably looked at once and stuck in a box, maybe kept in a warehouse,
and not looked at again once the check cleared (or in the case of
New Jersey, once the required bribe was paid.)
Not something you can get to in a hurry, if it was even kept.
