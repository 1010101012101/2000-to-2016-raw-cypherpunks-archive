Just so. A lot of games are close to being CPU-bound, plus the 
screensavers used as Mersenne prime finders and the like, and there are 
few reports of house fires caused by the CPU being smoked.

When I did reliability stuff for Intel, CPUs failed, but mostly not in 
ways that had them catching on fire, as the stamp guy is suggesting is 
common for stamp generation.
