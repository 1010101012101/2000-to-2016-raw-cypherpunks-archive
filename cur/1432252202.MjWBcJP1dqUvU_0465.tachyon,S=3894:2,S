Blunkett wants ID cards for all
BY MELISSA KITE, STEWART TENDLER AND DANIEL MCGRORY
http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2-2001331435,00.html

RIGID security measures, including compulsory identity cards for all
Britons, are being drawn up by ministers as part of the global war against
terrorism.

David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, confirmed yesterday that tough
legislation, which could breach human rights laws, would be brought before
MPs soon. Britain, he said, must throw down the gauntlet to terrorists as
never before.

The proposed legislation is thought to include increased powers of arrest
for the police to interrogate suspects and moves to abolish some rights of
judicial appeal for immigrants turned back at airports.

Police may be allowed to arrest people suspected of having knowledge about
terrorism, simply to interrogate them. Legislation to allow transcripts of
telephone conversations bugged by MI5 to be used as evidence in court is
also reported to be under consideration.

Mr Blunkett confirmed that identity cards were being considered very
seriously indeed. Asked whether they would be voluntary or compulsory, he
said: I think a voluntary card in the present circumstances would not be
a great deal of help.

Speaking on the BBCs On the Record programme, Mr Blunkett said that at
least three anti-terror Bills would introduce a range of new police
powers, including the increased powers of arrest. Compulsory ID cards
would use the latest technology, by scanning the iris of the eye or using
thumb or finger-printing.
