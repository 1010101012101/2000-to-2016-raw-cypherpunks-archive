BEWARE! You should keep in mind this deals with the problem of well-known 
signatures by making the files globally unique, but it introduces a 
vulnerability by the same mechanism: the files are unique and can be 
linked with you.

You may mitigate this by "reuniquing" the files in every case you are 
giving them away, but you should keep this risk firmly in mind.
