Since Anthrax isn't human to human conatgious, population density
is pretty much irrelevant, at least if you're delivering it by mail.

If they can survive rent control, they can survive anything.

The kind of food irradiators used to make the milk that doesn't spoil
should be able to destroy anthrax spores, I think.  You might have
to cook it a little longer because spores are harder to
kill then wet bacteria, but if your letters are just letters you can get
away with cooking it longer, you don't care if you denature some 
proteins.    I'm guessing if all mail was sterilized at the post office
the cost could be held below 2 cents a letter.

Of course, you'd still have crop dusters to worry about.
