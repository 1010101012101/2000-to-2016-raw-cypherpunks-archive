Thanks for the clarification, Andrew. It's dicey navigating the politics of
grant funding in a quasi-public forum like this one, but thanks for the
sincere effort.

As a disclaimer, I'm completely out of the loop (nor was I ever in it,
actually) but I'd guess the federal government believes organizations like
Wikileaks are not in their long-term interests. Given the
political-economic context this is all happening in, it doesn't seem
entirely implausible that grant committees look more favorably on
non-controversial applicants. Whether or not that's the case here is
probably irrelevant..

By chance, I had the opportunity to read a paper on Cryptome purported to
come from Mr. Assange. He describes a conspiratorial government as a
connected network, with "leaks" (a la Wikileaks) as methods of making links
between the network harder to effectively form and communicate across. I
wonder if anyone has any thoughts on it. It seemed to me that the logical
consequence of this idea is a completely open surveillance of all members
of government, i.e. "sousveillance" (sous- below) as opposed to
"surveillance" (surv- spying from "above"). It's curious that things like
releasing candidates' tax records, and the larger and larger public
scrutiny of politicians generally, shows that this process is happening
naturally regardless.

Here's a link to the Cryptome PDF:
http://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf

Best,
Rohan
