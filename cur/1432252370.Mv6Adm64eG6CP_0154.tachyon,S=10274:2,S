I don't know what they're doing, or even if their companies still exist

Consider these comments to be applicable to companies _like_ these companies.

bits' worth of cryptographic security. (At the time "Islands in the Net"

to my Silicon Valley friends Phil Salin, Marc Stiegler, Randy Farmer, Chip

So it this what Mojo and ZKS will do? Is this what Vince Cate in Anguilla

>>
>>Why is Mojo not becoming the pirate music capital of cyberspace? 

1. Because most music down-loaders (and many others with content to share) 
are lazy and Mojo requires them to take positive action to publish.  2. 
Because Mojo is sensitive to networks effects (when there are less than 
a hundred or so users on-line the reliability data retrieval quickly diminishes) 
and because of factor 1 there is less interesting data being shared.

The members of this list with always-on connections could easily put Mojo 
right by running a client configured to offer most or all of Mojo's services 
(block server, content tracker, publishing tracker and relay server).  This 
one small thing could provide the needed infrastructure to bootstrap.  Come 
on guys, it can't be that painful to participate, can it?

Look, I'm not loaded but if I can get a few dozen list members running the 
client (BTW, its small and easy to run, doesn't patch the OS, etc.) and 
stabilize the system, I'm willing to start converting Mojo currency out 
of my own pocket and pay those offering services.

>>Why is ZKS not advertising its software to those interested in nude photos

>>
>>
>>Because each is readily locatable and targettable. These are at least 
part of the reasons. (I admit that other reasons may be "Because Jim is 
not interested in being the pirate music capital, because the shareholders 
of ZKS choose not be child pornographers, because Vince doesn't want to 
be the credit rating center of the world.")

True, but he was/is interested in seeing the technology and the public Mojo 
service become generally useful.

>>
>>Jim McCoy understands this quite well...and yet he located his operation

Cost, priorities and a bit of laziness.  But all is not lost.  The public 
code includes almost all of the system and the parts which are missing I 
have on good assurance aren't that hard to reverse engineer.
