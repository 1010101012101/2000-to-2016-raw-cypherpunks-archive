hi,

thanx a lot,there is one more doubt.

>The rules of physics are those that don't change
> from time to time, or
> place to place

i tend to disagree with this.

the hierarchy goes like

okay let us say that two bodies with mass attract each
other.

it was an observation of a physical body,then we make
a mathametical model of the phenomenon.
Based on the mathametical model we make laws of
physics.

The mathametical observations rely on the parameters
that are taken to make the mathametical model.
if the parameters changes,the mathametical model will
have to be changed and new laws have to be brought.

with what certainy can we say that additional
parameters will not be added or removed and that the
laws of physics will stay true for ever?
If a new parameter ever gets added may be two bodies
with mass may repell each other.
can we say that these parameters will never change?

Regards Data.
