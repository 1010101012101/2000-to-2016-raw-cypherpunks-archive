I'm just deliberately trying to avoid donning a tin foil hat.  YPMV (Your
Paranoia May Vary.)  Somehow I think a lack of tin surrounding my head
makes it less dense though.

No, I'm do not have any investments or any relations with Microsoft -
other than I think all their software sucks.  Nor am I defending Anon's
arguements, nor TCPA, nor Palladium.  I'm only taking exception at your
silly and impossible to prove request that Anonymous decloak.

Not to detract from my own arguement, but to entertain you a bit further,
style can be forged.  There are even "Best of Bad Hemmingway" contests and
books for example.  Style means nothing.  It's as easy to copy as posting
mp3's on a p2p network.


Collusions happen, conspiracies happen.  Hey, I've got a suspicious
feeling that George Bush is Maxwell Smart, since they look alike.  Or
alternatively the chimp in Bedtime for Bonzo... But you don't see me
emailing george@whitehouse.gov and asking if their Cone of Silence is out
of order, or if he would like some bannanas.


And might I presume to ask, who are you referring to when you say "deep
paranoia cryptoanarchy freaks?"


After all, if that anon (or groups of anons) that you have a gripe with
happen to work for MSFT, I would hardly label it/them as cryptoanarchy
freaks.  More like greedy evil pro-microsoft buttmonkies.  If you're
referring to others such as me and yourself, who despise Palladium, TCPA,
and Microsoft, calling us paranoid cryptoanarchic freaks isn't going to
get you any free rounds of beers at the next meet... except maybe poured
on your head...
 

Look, if you want to keep it a useful and interesting conversation, by all
means refrain from conjecture and ad homeneims.  If you want to don the
tin foil hat, be my guest... procmail filters are standing by... act now,
don't delay, into the spam folder you shall go.
