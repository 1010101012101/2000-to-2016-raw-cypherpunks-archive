   from the beaming-it-out-there dept.
   [1]Dozix007 (Kurt Kaylor) writes "Daniel Sweeney, a technical writer,
   business reporter, and industry analyst is coming full circle in his
   series of wireless related writings with his latest book WiMax
   Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks. Sweeney brings
   the WiMax 802.16 standard into the context of a ISP solution for the
   masses. WiMax is a recent standard from the IEEE that is similar to
   conventional wireless technology, however WiMax supports higher data
   rates and longer distance transmissions than other standards from the
   IEEE. This book drifts away from the recent flood of wireless books by
   conveying all needed knowledge to establish, understand, operate and
   potentially profit from an 802.16 wireless network, rather than a
   specific look at one aspect of the technology. This book is not only
   for the business minded, but for a consumer looking to establish a
   quality long-distance wireless network of their own." Read on for the
   rest of Kaylor's review.

   WiMax Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks is
   primarily a utilitarian book rather than conceptual. It provides a
   background in broadband wireless fundamentals, packet data, and
   overall network operation and management to enable a network operator
   to set up a network with standards-based equipment and to run it
   profitably thereafter. Sweeney notes early in the book : "Nothing is
   particularly admirable about purism in terms of wireless technology,
   and if wire line technologies serve the same purpose better over some
   portion of the network footprint, then wise network operators will
   avail themselves of them." This theme of realism in relation to the
   application of a wireless network is prevalent though out the book.

   Wired networks in the same footprint will almost always beat a
   wireless network in speed, reliability, and cost. This is primarily
   due to the previously created infrastructure available to Internet
   carriers. The goal that Sweeney promotes is to find an ideal region
   that has not yet been exploited by a wired service provider. These
   regions are ideal due to the low-cost setup for a wireless network
   compared to the cost of a wired network. Sweeney describes and informs
   the user of ways to find and establish these networks in an efficient
   manner to maximize profitability.

   Sweeney also discusses network security in the later chapters of his
   book. He acknowledges the increasing need to secure the network's own
   infrastructure, the safety of its customers, and a nation itself. In
   relation to wireless networks, Sweeney notes "[Security] is becoming
   increasingly important in network operations today and cannot be
   considered optional at this point." To this end, the network security
   section is devoted to security policies, secure electrical systems,
   cyber warfare, and other information on safeguarding your network.
   Another concern also addressed is the Communications Assistance for
   Law Enforcement Act. CALEA is a complex piece of federal legislation
   that expands law enforcement's authority to conduct electronic
   surveillance, including surveillance over public networks. Sadly, as
   of yet there is no real way to combat this intrusive act.

   WiMax Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks is a great
   resource for businesses and individuals looking to establish their own
   802.16 network. I enjoyed the foresight provided in this book for
   potential problems faced by network operators. The honesty in the
   practicality of an 802.16 network as a realistic network solution also
   made the book a great resource. There was no fantasy scenario or white
   lies to convince a user of the merit of a 802.16 network beyond what
   it can do.

   The gripe I do have with this book is its complete utilitarian nature.
   A little more theory and insight into the standard itself would have
   been great. This book stands purely as an Operator's Manual, and not
   an exploration of WiMax as a standard, but rather a tool. Otherwise,
   this book was highly enjoyable and well written. I would recommend
   this book to anyone looking to establish a network beyond the
   standards commonly available (e.g. 802.11a - 802.11g). This book is
   unique in its topic and sheer honesty, and is one of the few
   references available on the specific subject.
