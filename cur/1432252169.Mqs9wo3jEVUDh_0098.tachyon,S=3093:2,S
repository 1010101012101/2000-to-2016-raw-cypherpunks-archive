 Express Scripts offers $1 million award to nab extortionist in data 
breach case
Pharmacy benefits management company's clients now getting extortionist 
letters, too.

Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits management company which recently 
disclosed an extortionist is demanding money by threatening to expose 
millions of patient records the company holds, Wednesday said it has 
decided to offer $1 million to nab the perpetrator.

.We.re going on the offense with this reward,. says Steve Littlejohn, 
Express Scripts spokesman and vice president of public affairs. The $1 
million will be paid to anyone who provides information leading to the 
capture and conviction of the extortionist who sent a letter to Express 
Scripts in early October that contained personal information on 75 people, 
considered members, who use the company.s pharmacy-benefits services. The 
extortionist claims to have information on millions more Express Scripts 
members and wants money to not reveal it.

Express Scripts has refused to cave in to the extortionist.s demand. But 
Littlejohn said that now a small number of its clients, such as companies 
offering healthcare plans to employees, are also now receiving extortion 
threats with personal information about members. .The letters are similar 
enough that we are inclined to think it.s the same person,. says 
Littlejohn.

He says Express Scripts and its clients are agreeing not cave in to the 
extortionist.s demand for money.
