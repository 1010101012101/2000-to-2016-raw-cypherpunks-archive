its in the 6.5 Command Line Guide, but as "identifies the input file as
a text file"
The CLG is the best reference for this though - as it explictly lists
sta as the correct option in section
Ch2>Common PGP Functions>Signing Messages>Sign a plaintext ASCII file.
I could email you a copy of the PDF of that (its about 500K) if you
wish.

its canonicalization - again according to the CLG (CH3>Sending ASCII
text files to different machine environments)

its just an evolution. IIRC the command line tool was based at least
partially on the unix version of pgp, which always had different command
line switches. It would be nice if behaviour was more backwards
compatable, but they *did* document it in the official M that you should
RTF :)
