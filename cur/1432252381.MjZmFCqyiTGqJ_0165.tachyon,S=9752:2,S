Apologize for cross posting

4th International Conference on Global E-Security (ICGeS408)
23-25 June 2008
London, England
http://www.uel.ac.uk/icges

The conference proceedings will be published as a volume of
LNCS series from Springer.

Following the successful, ICGeS-07 in April 2007, we have much
pleasure in announcing the 4th International Conference on Global
E-Security (ICGeS-08).

The Annual International Conference on Global e-Security (ICGeS)
is an established platform in which security issues can be examined
from several global perspectives through dialogue between
academics, students, government representatives, chief executives,
security professonals, and research scientists from the United
Kingdom and from around the globe.

ICGeS provides an ideal and unique venue for researchers and
practitioners to engage in debate on variuos security related issues,
including the measures governments must take to protect the
security of information on the Internet, the implications of cyber-
crime in large corporations and individuals, and how cyber-crime can
be addressed.

The widespread use of the Internet has created a global platform for
the exchange of ideas, goods and services; the benefits of which are
enormous. However, it has also created boundless opportunities for
cyber-crime. As an increasing number of large organisations and
individuals use the Internet and its satelite mobile technologies, they
are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-crime threats. It is therefore
paramount that the security industry raise its game to combat these
threats. This is an issue of global importance as law enforcement
agencies all over the world are struggling to cope.

This conference aims to attract an International audience to provide
a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and
promote interaction and collaboration between the researchers and
practitioners in the security field; to meet and discuss current and
future e-security needs and issues.

Refereed full papers will be considered for publication in the new
international Journal of Electronic Security and Digital
Forensics, IJESDF published by Inderscience,
