Perhaps...

Still what of this?

And of what form?  Persephone, Demeter?

And would she be so fortunate to find herself an initiant
into the Eleusinian mysteries...?  There are only three modern
cults of Demeter which remain and two of them have quickly
become Dionysian.  Of the remaining one:

Are we to believe we have found amongst
ourselves a member thereof?

...she showed the conduct of her rites and taught them
all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also
- -- awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress
or pry into or utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. 

Surely she must then be a long standing mystes.  For Boedromion
is long past, I fear.  

Surely then also she must recite for us the synthema.
We await it eagerly.

No shame in not knowing.  Could mayhap she be an
Academic?  An academic _ and_ a lawyer?

Perhaps a classicist, of the scholarly variety- or merely armchair?

Then mayhap merely a romantic.  Failed Classicists are often the
best romantics.

Still, if not-

I, Dionysos, son of Zeus, am back in Thebes.
I was born here, of Semele, daughter of Cadmus,
blasted from her womb by a bolt of blazing thunder.
