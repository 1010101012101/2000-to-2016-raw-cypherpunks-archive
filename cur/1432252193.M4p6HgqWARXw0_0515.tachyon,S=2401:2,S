You have failed to read the article -- he tells us when he 
wrote it. Read his article, and fit the timeline of the events 
he describes, against the timeline of events the other article 
describes.  The time at which he claims to have visited the 
airport in his account was an hour or two before the attack 
began in the mainstream account.

If he was merely telling us the US had not taken, or was not 
attacking, the airport, that would be no problem, but his claim 
was that the US was nowhere near the airport, the airport was 
in no imminent danger of falling, or even of being attacked, 
that in the unlikely event that the US had reached the 
outskirts, they had fled or been driven back.   He claimed to
have confirmed Baghdad Bob's account.
