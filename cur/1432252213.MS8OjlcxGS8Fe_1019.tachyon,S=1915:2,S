While legislators in Washington work to outlaw peer-to-peer networks, one 
website is turning the peer-to-peer technology back on Washington to expose 
its inner, secretive workings.

But <http://outragedmoderates.org/>outragedmoderates.org isn't offering 
copyright music and videos for download. The site, launched two weeks ago, 
has aggregated more than 600 government and court documents to make them 
available for download through the Kazaa, LimeWire and Soulseek P2P 
networks in the interest of making government more transparent and accountable.
