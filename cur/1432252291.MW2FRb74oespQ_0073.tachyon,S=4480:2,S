I'd like to voice my agreement on this. Here in Massachusetts, the state
is considered such a Democrat stronghold that we've seen almost
zero campaigning by either major party (while this is usually considered a
godsend, I'm starting to feel ignored :-). 

At the local level, Senator Ted Kennedy's seat is up for re-election, but
Ted has such a lock on it that he isn't bothering to campaign. The
state's Republicans have managed to self-destruct (their initial candidate 
withdrew, and Jack Robinson, the replacement who popped up at the last 
minute, has proved utterly without merit - the state party no longer
supports
him, and he's out of money).

All indications are that Carla Howell, the Libertarian challenger for
Kennedy's Senate seat, will handily out-poll the Republicans this year.

As a result, my vote is immaterial to either major party, and I can happily
vote my conscience without any fear that I'm helping throw the election to
either Gush or Bore - both of whom I find utterly odious for intersecting
sets
of reasons.

(Just in case you were wondering, I'm voting Libertarian).

Peter Trei
