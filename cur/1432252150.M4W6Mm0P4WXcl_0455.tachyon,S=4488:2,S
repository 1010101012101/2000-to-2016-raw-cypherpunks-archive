I thought you needed to de-correlate the anonymous data sets. Say that the
database entries of a medical record are nym, age, location, type_of_disease.
For e.g. Mickey, 43, Madison area, chance_for_don't_insure_him_disease. Now,
it doesn't matter they may not find your actual name or address-they can
correlate across databases to put up a red flag when someone matching the
remaining fields except for the first one(nym)requests a health insurance
policy.
Note: The nym can be anything-in the above case it is just a nickname.

Sarad.
