You're on the right track.  Take several encryption
algorithms
of your choice, then use a fixed IV, and the same sets
of keys,
and encrypt blocks of 0's.  For each algorithm,
compute several sets of
staticstics (a la NIST or DIEHARD).  With 100 blocks
of 10 Megabytes
(100 different keys) you should see some interesting
differences.

Remember, your question originally was "how can you
tell which 
algorithm",
not "how do you find the key".  Let us know what you
find out :-)

--yes :)

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
