IQT aren't a charity. If they are not taking equity or profits, then
they are wanting something else. From more reading, it looks like what
they do is provide funding to companies that have interesting products,
and pay to re-purpose for in-house use.

In other words, they are more like a high-valued customer that want for
heavy customisation. Perhaps this is an easier way to get shit done
rather than go through the request for tenders route.

I'm not sure which VCs you're talking about. Besides a seed round, most
VCs will want at least one seats on the board for control. Definitely
not hands-off.

And I'm all for that too. That's why I made the comment.
