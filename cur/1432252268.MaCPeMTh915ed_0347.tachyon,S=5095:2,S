This is exactly the right approach!

I would say that even some fairly slight changes to the incentive
structure may help a lot.  The less desirable Tor is for problem users,
the more they will shift to traditional broken open proxies.  We can
play whack-a-mole with these as we do now, while at the same time
leaving Tor more open.

Yes, but I don't really mind them moving to other avenues.  That's the
point.  If I didn't love Tor, I wouldn't care about blocking Tor either.
 Let them abuse broken proxy servers, let them do whatever, that's fine,
we can deal with it.  We just want to open up to Tor.

Let me see if I can explain a bit more of the math behind this.  I'm
just going to make up a hypothetical example.

Suppose 100 out of every 1,000,000 edits to Wikipedia is malicious.  And
suppose we study them and discover, hmm, 25 of them come from Tor, which
is easily blockable.  50 of them come from static ips or dynamic ips
that are expensive for users to get new.  25 of them are from broken
proxies.

Now, our present solution is to block Tor, do various things in other
situations, and this works reasonably well.  Of the 25 bad edits we
block from Tor, some portion of them surely shift to other means, but
not all of them.  So we find it to be a net win.

Except.  Except we don't really like to block Tor.

Now, fast forward, and imagine that the "expensive ip" situation goes
away in a few years, either due to widespread onion routing, or whatever
you may want to dream up that makes our temporary kludge of using ips no
longer functional.

Then we'll still only have 100 out of every 1,000,000 edits to Wikipedia
as being malicious.  How we'll deal with that is how we'll deal with
that, but that's fine.  We'll manage.

For now the key thing to do is to shift the incentives on the bad users
so that Tor is less desirable for them than playing with the broken
proxies or just doing whatever with a dialup account or aol addresses or
whatever.
