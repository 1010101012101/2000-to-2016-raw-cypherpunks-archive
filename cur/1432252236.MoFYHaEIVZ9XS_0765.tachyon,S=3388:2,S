I don't know of any other real-world examples.  Rescorla mentions the
technique on pp. 316-319 of "SSL and TLS".  Certainly Thawte isn't going to
issue such wildcard certs, for exactly the reasons you mention.  That's why
you (or your government, or company, or whoever keeps an eye on you) create
your *own* CA and tell your browser to trust it.  Then it'll accept the
wildcard certs without complaint.
