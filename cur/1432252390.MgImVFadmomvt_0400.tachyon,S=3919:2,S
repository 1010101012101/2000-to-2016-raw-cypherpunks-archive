  ________________________________________________ On December 1 2001, two 
anarchists were taken by the
police in Usak (a city in Mid-West Anatolia) with the
claim of distributing illegal leaflets in a meeting
organized by trade-unions. Later on, 3 other were
taken, and all (5) of them were arrested with the
claim of "being members of an illegal terrorist
organization" namely Usak Anarchist Autonom.
Although they did nothing more than distributing their
own materials/leaflets, for this terrorist state it
was enough to judge them with the claim of organizing
in such a way "to destroy or to divide" it. They did
not even find any (in their own words) "violent" or
"terrorist" clues related with the group.
The trail will be held in Izmir DGM (SSC-State
Security Court) on 13th of February. At the moment
they are in Usak Prison; each of them in seperate
cells. This week they'll be sent to Izmir F-type
prison. They were beaten badly and tortured by Usak
police and refused the lawyers offered by the state.
For the first time Turkish anarchists will be judged
by Turkish State as an "illegal organization" and this
trail will show the attitude of the state against
anarchists and anarchist organizations. Anar~ist Kara Ay - Ankara
Anarchist Black Crescent - Ankara

Also 'Ruckus' an anarchist prisoner has been transfered. Cali.
