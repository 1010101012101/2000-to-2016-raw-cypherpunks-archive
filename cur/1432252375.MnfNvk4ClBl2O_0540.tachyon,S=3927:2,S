How? Saying it over and over like a Buddhist mantra won't make it so.

A privately run mailing list is not equivalent to USENET where there is no
subcription or other 'access' process. The same can't be said about a
mailing list where one must 'subscribe' using a valid email address for
receipt. Access to USENET does not require any special action on the part 
of the reader or poster.

No, I haven't. In fact nobody on this list has, implied or otherwise.

Actually under current law, if the article included more than about 200
lines of my posts then I'd have a very strong case.
