And shooting innocent people too. And anyone who opposes those in power
whether they're innocent or not. 

I think the United States Constitution was the biggest blessing ever cast on
mankind. Not a blessing from "on high", but from men who had the courage of
their convictions.

Fuck that. You ought to be be grateful: if it weren't for the Constitution, the
US would have taken over your little country and the rest of the world
with it a long, long time ago. That kind of gross totalitarian imperialism is
all anyone has to look forward to in a US without what's left of the
Constitution.

Something to think about.

***

[The prosperity of the United States] is not the result of accident. It has a
philosophic cause. Without the Constitution and the Union, we could not have
attained the result; but even these are not the primary cause of our great
prosperity. There is something back of these, entwining itself more closely
about the human heart. That something, is the principle of "Liberty to all" --
the principle that clears the path for all -- gives hope to all -- and, by
consequence, enterprise and industry to all.

The expression of that principle, in our Declaration of Independence, was most
happy, and fortunate. Without this, as well as with it, we could have declared
our independence of Great Britain; but without it, we could not, I think, have
secured our free government and consequent prosperity. The assertion of that
principle, at that time, was the word "fitly spoken" which has proven an "apple
of gold" to us. The Union, and the Constitution, are the picture of silver,
subsequently framed around it. The picture was made, not to conceal, or destroy
the apple; but to adorn and preserve it. The picture was made for the apple --
not the apple for the picture.

So let us act, that neither picture, or apple shall ever be blurred, bruised or
broken.

That we may so act, we must study, and understand the points of danger.
