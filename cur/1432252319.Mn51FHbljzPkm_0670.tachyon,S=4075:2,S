I agree with Ed - let us not confuse our goals with our means. The goal is
to
have a door which is transparent - it lets those in look out (and, perhaps
only
coincidentally) those outside look in. It also acts as a window, letting
letting
light into the house, and at night illuminating the door area from the
inside.

The goal is *not* to secure a door made out of glass. The goal is a
transparent
door. Go with Lexan.

I often find stepping back and saying 'exactly what are we actually trying
to
acheive here?' is a powerful tool for solving problems. Its all too easy to
try to 
add fixes to a bad solution, rather than find a different one.
