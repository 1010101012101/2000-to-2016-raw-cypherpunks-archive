i must amend this prior advice.

in addition to legal protections, educational support, and competitive programs,

also provide:
- direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target.  this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
spectrum.


a side benefit of implementing these reforms would be the de-facto
de-funding of offensive network operations by third parties or
governments. the cost to keep ahead of such a widespread, popular, and
distributed effort would be enormous, and provide continually
decreasing returns.


...  getting there is much more complicated of course.   *grin*
