Subject: theft

I'm in search for one of your representatives, or National Security.  I hav=
e been able to read Thommy Thompson III's mind.  I showed up at Jaguar Glas=
s, in Eugene, Oregon and let him know about the money that he stole from go=
vernment agencies, including the FBI, which ironically protects him.  He th=
ought I was undercover or believed I was a human computer; which he still m=
ay believe. He witnesses that his computers talk to me, as if I were one of=
 them.  I can tell what program his computers are on and what they are inte=
rlocking with most of the time.  He gave me a 400 million dollar check that=
 day, as I sat there reading his mind explaining to him what I knew.  At th=
at point he had 8-10 billion dollars of government money/funding hidden awa=
y.  But after the planes went down he stole over a 100 billion. He used Mik=
e's pin#  and password to get into National Security.  He helped himself in=
to instruments and institutions, and began using them incorrectly and illeg=
ally. I am offering National Security or any Representative a lot of my mon=
ey to help me put this man away.  It seems he is being protected by the for=
ces I need.  He is station #3 of the HAARP Project and I'm in search for an=
yone ready to earn a lot of money; for actually representing the United Sta=
tes of America the Right Way.
He's been looking into the minds of his people and brainwashing them, so he=
 will not be seen.  I can read his mind faster than any instrument, and iro=
nically he seems he has to answer my questions like I was a machine. When I=
 listen, I can hear him telling people he's playing God and to digest this =
information; or to Change their mind. Another one he uses, line one--, line=
 two--, line three--, Lock and Load, which also seems to convince people th=
at he is innocent.  He changes the information nightly so he won't be seen,=
 for he is a computer programmer as you will soon see.  I've even tried try=
 to get the HAARP to tune into me, so they could see me which would see him=
=2E=20
This is just the beginning of what I know.  Eugene, Oregon's FBI seem to be=
 full of idiots or his "Change Your mind Method" is working pretty damn goo=
d.  Right now I get denied as they listen to him and not me. But COME ON PE=
OPLE, He wrote me a $400 Million dollar check. (SO, WAKE UP!  FBI, because =
you are obviously, virtually blind),. This Nation seems to be lacking peopl=
e like me.  That can discover people like Thommy Thompson III and his black=
 market industry.=20
