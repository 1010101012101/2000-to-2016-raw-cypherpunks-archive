Well, perhaps, but Mr Donaldson's brain has been turned into a host/vector 
for a very powerful set of memes. In a sense, one can't blame him: He has an 
answer for everything, and his answers emanate from a set of beliefs that 
feel quite consistent in his mind, or at least that can be derived from a 
fairly elementary set of principals. That's a hell of a lot more than I can 
say for most of the rest of us Cypherpunks, for whom the world is a lot more 
complex.

Sometimes, I suspect it would be kind of comfy living in Mr Donald's world: 
Good and Evil are very distinct entities, and you know who they are. 
Unfortunately for me the world looks a hell of a lot more complex and 
shadowy, shades of gray.

Ah well. Pass that crack pipe of absolute certainty over here Mr Donald...
