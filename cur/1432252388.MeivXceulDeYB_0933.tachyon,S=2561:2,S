I've come to see that it was the kink of the hockey stick that
became evident, and a lot of mutually reinforcing factors were involved
--including a more mature Mac IP environment, adding a browser to the
email/usenet/ftp/wais net tools, eliminating TCP/IP stack install for
the majority, general exponential deployment of computers, faster comm,
changed NSF policy.  Though it seems individual estimates of each factor's
importance varies with experience.
