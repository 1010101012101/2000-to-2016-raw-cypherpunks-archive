Subject: [gsc] Loom folder interface now supports arbitrary asset types

The Loom folder interface now supports arbitrary asset types.  Just
click the "Types" link in your folder to add, edit, and delete asset
types at will.

Issue digital doughnuts if you like.  I did this as a fun exercise.

This is by far the most important milestone in Loom to date.  It makes
Loom a powerful and completely generic accounting utility.

P.S. This is version 43 of the Loom code.
