Certainly wise, though not popular with the remailer users (see the
thread on alt.privacy.anon-server discussing the recent switch by one of
the most popular mail2news gateways to this type of system, where a
disclaimer is placed at the top of the message.) The simple truth is that
the average user can't be expected to look at mail or news headers,
though, so you need to place such things in the body.

What about an "opt-in" service for mailing list admins?

I've thought about this before. I was concerned about the potential risks
of keeping the messages in an identifiable manner on the remailer
server... but if everything is encrypted, it wouldn't matter.

Unfortunately, requiring everything be encrypted also limits the
whistle-blower, anonymous tipster applications of these systems.
Additionally, it would be nice if the major PGP implementations supported
the "stealth encryption" features, too. (Yes, there's ways to make do
without it...)
