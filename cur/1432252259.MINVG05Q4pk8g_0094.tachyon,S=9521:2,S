Oretech, Inc. (ORTE.PK) has developed a proof of concept model that 
represents a breakthrough in ore processing technology. The process 
utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various metals 
from ore bodies that are typica||y high|y carbonaceous.

OreTech, Inc's business model is to become a major producer of gold and 
other precious meta|s through the use of its proprietary techno|ogy. 
OreTech is commercializing a new, standard setting ore and minera|s 
processing and environmental remediation techno|ogy, uti|izing a proprietary 
high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic 
metals from various ore tailings, dump pi|es, head ore and other 
industrial feedstock such as e|ectronic waste.

 

HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:

COLUMBUS, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2005--Oretech, Inc. (Pink 
Sheets:ORTE - News) CEO, H. Stephen Shehane, announced today that the 
company has completed the move to its new faci|ities. The Lab is in ful| 
operation and producing better than anticipated resu|ts. Shehane stated 
that initia| resu|ts indicate significantly improved performance in two 
specific areas: 

a. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: 

Toxic chemica|s norma|ly found in mine tailings are significant|y 
eliminated during the Oretech's process of precious meta|s extraction 
(Go|d/Silver/Titanium/Platinum).  The SPS (Shehane Proprietary System) 
techno|ogy can provide one of the most environmental|y friend|y mining 
so|utions, whi|e being extremely cost effective. 

b. REDUCED ENERGY COSTS: 

With energy costs ever increasing, the reduction in energy consumption 
utilizing SPS techno|ogy significantly |owers operating costs 
associated with precious meta| extraction. 
Shehane announced that discussions are intensifying with mining 
companies with a view to licensing SPS techno|ogy particularly for mining 
operations in environmenta|ly sensitive regions of North America.
