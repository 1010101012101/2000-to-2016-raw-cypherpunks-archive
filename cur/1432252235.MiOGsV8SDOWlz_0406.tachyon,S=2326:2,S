   from the among-other-things dept.
   flip-flop writes "In the wake of recent terrorist attacks, police here
   in the UK [1]have asked for sweeping new powers they claim will help
   them counter the threat. Among these is making it a criminal offense
   for people to refuse disclosing their encryption keys when the police
   want to access someone's files." From the article: "The most
   controversial of the police proposals is the demand to be able to hold
   without charge a terrorist suspect for three months instead of 14
   days. An Acpo spokesman said the complexity and scale of
   counter-terrorist operations means the 14-day maximum is often
   insufficient."
