Interestingly, I have a friend who did a year at antarctica (at a station 
roughly 300 miles from McMurdo). Cash moeny isn't even available :-(

Pity.

As for "growth", or "increase in value", these are concepts not totally 
out of place in the vaccum of what amounts to self-imposed isolation for 
your *own* research goals.  The closest thing to money down there is time, 
which is traded much as we trade the tokens of bills and coin.  And time 
is fixed in quantity: everyone has the same fraction of the total to start 
with, the total cannot grow or shrink, but it can (and does) rise in value 
as the distance from the start of the "shift" gets longer.
