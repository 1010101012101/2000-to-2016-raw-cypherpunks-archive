How do you get owned by a browser bug on a server? I mean, HB is huge,=20=

because:
 - it affects servers;
 - potentially allows access to private keys and passwords;
 - this, in case of forward-secrecy-less setups allows the bad guys to
   decrypt all saved traffic.

It's as bad as any root-level remote exploit on a server. And because, =
you=20
know, "everybody uses OpenSSL", and because it was unknown but in the c=
ode for=20
2+ years, the attack surface was (and is) huge.

No idea, but we're considering revoking ours.
