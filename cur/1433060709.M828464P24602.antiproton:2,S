This is correct.

It could be any number of things. Some ISPs even sell access packages
with "family-friendly" filtering built in. Spyware or logging of sites
accessed wouldn't be too far of a leap from this.

By their nature, I would expect most garden variety anti-spyware
packages to not consider "parental control" type tools as spyware and
not detect them. They certainly aren't viruses. I think most
anti-spyware tools on Windows require administrator access to run.

There's no easy way to detect screenshots being taken. You would need to
check the local hard disk for copies of the screenshots, and outbound
network traffic for something that could be a screenshot being uploaded.
This is difficult at best without administrator access.

It would be best, but it may not be possible if the computer is secured
correctly. The parent threat model (as a minor child) is a particularly
tough nut to crack. Even if you subvert the technical spying measures,
there could be consequences for doing so. At least where I live in the
US, minors can't own property legally, so parents can spy on a computer
that  "belongs to" their kids.

If your friend's parents feel the need to spy on his/her Internet
access, there are issues beyond the technological ones. There is a basic
lack of trust on the part of the parents, possibly caused by their poor
parenting of your friend when he/she was younger, that needs to be
addressed. In other words, find out why they feel spying is necessary.
In the meantime, your friend may want to do the majority of his/her
Internet access from the local library; it may not be completely
uncensored but there is a much lower chance of being individually spied
on there.
