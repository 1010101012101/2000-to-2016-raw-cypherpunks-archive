Dave,
The former Disruptive Technology Office has been merged into the  
newly formed IARPA -- Intelligence Advanced Research Projects  
Activity. We've also just released (via AFRL) updated language for  
the NICECAP BAA:
A revision of the National Intelligence Community Enterprise Cyber  
Assurance Program (NICECAP) BAA (AFRL BAA-06-11-IFKA) has been  
released and is available at:
http://tinyurl.com/yw7k9s

A new focus area soliciting research on Privacy Protecting  
Technologies is added under the Accountable Information Flow thrust.  
White papers are due to AFRL November 2, 2007.


Regards,
--Carl
