URL? We don't need no stinking URL. (it was on /.)

You take a toothpick and place it on a holder. Light it. Place a large
glass bowl (a fishbowl is acceptable) over the burning toothpick with
something holding the bowl off the floor of the microwave (so the
toothpick stays lit). Crank up the microwave on high for about 10 seconds.
Walah.

I don't mind receiving inquiries for help from individuals on specific
topics or goals. What I specifically object to is people trying to take my
public discussion private. From my perspective such discussion is useless
for giving ideas public exposure and wastes a lot of my time that I'd
rather spend doing other things. In short, don't expect to get into long
drawn out discussions in private email unless I've known you for quite a
while.

Enjoy the plasma ball...(hint: try a screen)
