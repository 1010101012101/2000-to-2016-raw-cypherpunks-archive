Speaking of malfeasance in handling the mailed ballots, I heard a 
Democrat spinmeister saying last night that foreign consulates can 
advise their local Americans that they can "sign an affidavit saying 
they tried to get a November 7th postmark but were unable to do so." 
He said: "Americans in other countries can still send in their 
ballots with a signed affidavit attesting that they had been unable 
to get a November 7th postmark."

So, those FedExed ballots from Kosovo or Israel or China may not have 
been sent until...today.

Hilarious. Things are falling apart better and with more acrimony 
than I'd hoped.

Republicans are threatening to demand a recount of 22,000 (yes, more 
than in Palm Beach County) uncounted/spoiled ballots in a northern 
Florida county which went 60,000-to-40,000 for Bush over Gore. They 
expect that if these odds hold up, as expected, that Bush could pick 
up thousands of votes in this heavily Republican county.

And so it goes, with recounts, judicial adjustments, do overs, and 
other such things requested in dozens, then hundreds, then thousands 
of counties.
