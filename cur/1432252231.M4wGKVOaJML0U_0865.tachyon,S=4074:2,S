    A magic one, of course.

     Why? A female spirit appears to you, that's a "Good Thing", eh?

      Only one way to find out, but probably if she's appearing to you nude,
it's obvious.

      Wouldn't she have the capability of appearing just right for you?

       Good grief, why not? Are you afraid of the dark too? I prefer being
in the woods alone, or perhaps with my dog. And She Who Speaks often
whispers in my ear at such times, which probably won't happen if others are
near, unless they happen to be tuned in to the same frequency at the moment.

       Both of the above, or perhaps the reverse -- take the apple and bite
the woman.

           I'm always looking for encounters with female spirits.
