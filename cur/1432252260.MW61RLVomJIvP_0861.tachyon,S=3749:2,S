The leftist Z-mag had an interesting article about Chavez last month. 
Although most of Z-mag's articles are fairly silly leftwing ranting, you 
defiintely have a few in-the-trenches-type articles that show up every now 
and then. The article on Chavez is most interesting and strongly suggests 
that what Chavez is actually doing is trying to drive up the price Venezuela 
gets per barrel. Apparently, he's been successful, and most major oil 
companies (with the notable exception of Exxon) have recently signed very 
favorable contracts with his government. Also of interest is the 
proliferation of Chinese and other oil companies edging in next to the big 
US & UK oil firms that have traditionally dominated such deals.

Maybe not quite bullshit after all...the major barrier to doing this (ie, 
shipping low cost oil to some contries and communities) was that the oil was 
in a form that required processing before it could be used (when I get home 
I'll try to look up the specifics). Only a few companies could do this and 
he now has such companies signed (one is Chinese, I think).

Well, that's always the catch. Mao and (to a much lesser extent) Castro were 
effective guerilla warriors, but Mao had to die of old age in order for 
China to start developing itself (Cuba speaks for itself). Chavez seems to 
be spending a lot of the oil wealth on lots of social services which, though 
perhaps noble, is not sustainable. If Chavez were bright enough to use this 
$$$ to kick-start a modern economy his rhetoric would then prove to be much 
more than hot air.

In short, I'm not convinced Chavez is an idiot. From this vantage point I'd 
argue it's way too early to tell.
