Since you have done so now, it shouldn't be an issue: thanks - that was 
driving me *wild*!

Well....

We (you personally) and I (me personally) have slightly different 
listrunner philosophies (I like reply-to to point to list, I like to see 
[C-Punks] headers for sorting, etc.), why don't we re-setup the 
distributed nodes?  I have actual hardware, and a 100mb coloed rack of 
gear (read: lots of free cycles and bandwidth), so if you'd like, I can 
run the @aq over there ?  Or I can set up a secondary @ of my own, doesn't 
matter: either way, I'd like to distribute again - game?
