Depending on how trivial the violation was, it may be worth checking the 
FTP server logs, identifying the bad ones and collecting the evidence, and 
eventually, preferably after consultation with a lawyer, nail the admin 
with hacking charges. (Alternatively just threat with the same, with a 
remark that you hope he likes lawyers. I suppose you're located in the 
Land of Lawyers.)

If it is better to play a repentant sinner, or go to a confrontation, 
depends on many more factors unknown to us, including the exact text of 
the network AUPs, the personality profile of the admin (he may be just 
power-tripping at you, but the severity of his threats depends on the 
exact content of your disk which you didn't specify), and other factors 
like if you are an employee or a student and how much risk you want to go 
through.

Violating AUPs with cleartext protocols isn't a good idea, especially with 
nazi admins. Next time you may like to prefer ssh/scp, or WebDAV over 
HTTPS, or a simple password-protected upload/download interface written in 
PHP or as a CGI script, again over HTTPS (you may like to use one-time 
passwords for added security).

If the admin in question can have physical access to your machine, put the 
sensitive/objectionable data on an encrypted partition.

That depends a lot. If you're in a suitable uni campus, you may try to 
consult with local law students. This question is something a mere 
technician can't reliably answer.

Yes. Depends on what you want to do; if you want to be independent on any 
special software installed on the computers you're operating from, I 
suggest a HTTPS server, with a self-signed certificate (cheaper), and 
manually check its fingerprint when connecting. For upload you may use a 
web file upload form. Don't neglect the certificate check; the admin may 
like to start playing games with you and launch MITM attack at your 
connections. Do the fingerprint check even when the browser claims all is 
OK.
