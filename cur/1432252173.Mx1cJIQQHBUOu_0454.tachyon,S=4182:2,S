	Huh?

	Did you read what he said? As much as I hate to stand up for 
Choate, you seem to be reiterating his point--that Eugenics is 
management of reproductive choice by the state.

	Normally enough, Merriam-Webster and dictionary.com both 
disagree. I tried the OED, but they want $550 a year for access. 
Sorry guys.

It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so
afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent. To have such
knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
