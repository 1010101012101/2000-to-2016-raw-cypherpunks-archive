Peter Neumann proposes killing computers and the Internet to start over
and build something far worse to meticulously track every nano-bite of digital
communications with unrevocable, implanted encrypted ID in every device to
authenticate ID of users.

DARPA, who else, is funding the work to kill anonymity and privacy for,
ta da, national security racketeering.

The bountiful cyberwar mongerers are delirious with support for their
job security of predicting evermore Pearl Harbors, amply protected by
secrecy of "defensive" USG cyber aggression.

Dr. Neumann is a great generation advocate to bless this takeover
makeover. He was there at the beginning of the last one which
never, quote, offered security, thus leading to a multi-billion
dollar industry of snake oil. No, not national security oil, its
bastard children of cyber oilers.

None of those deliberately-deceptive-comsec creeps have ever been
here, whew, only on RISKS.
