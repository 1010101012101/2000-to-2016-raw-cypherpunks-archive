"The pre-microprocessor
automation of telephony (pulse and then touchtone dialing) put
expensive automation at the top of the hierarchy, and, as costs fell,
moved down from there."

Well, from the little I can understand of what you're saying, there seems to 
be some stuff worthy of at least cursory consideration there. However, the 
analogy to switching systems is a little off.

For one, a telephony switch isn't really something that can be measured on 
one axis (ie, throughput). There are two (or perhaps 3) axes that really 
describe the family of telephony switches: throughput and granularity. Back 
in my telecom days I used to joke that "In my pocket I have a switch matrix 
capable of 100 Terabits of throughput"...whereupon I'd whip out a (fiber) 
jumper, and point out that this jumper could "switch" 100Tb "from this port 
to this port". (This is an exageration of claims made about the throughput 
of OXCs, or optical cross connects.)

This is important because it is indicative of the fact that there is no 
hierarchy of switches as you describe in a telephony switch. A Broadband DCS 
doesn't somehow control the network. In fact, you could argue that the 
'little' 5ESS switches out on the edge ultimately control the network, 
though even that would be inaccurate.

No, the entire phone network is "governed" externally by an OSS. I don't 
really see how this is describable by a hierarchy per se, and certainly not 
a hierarchy that can somehow be traced to a linear measure of switching 
capability.

As for the tem "geodesic", I have to admit it's cool sounding in this 
context.
