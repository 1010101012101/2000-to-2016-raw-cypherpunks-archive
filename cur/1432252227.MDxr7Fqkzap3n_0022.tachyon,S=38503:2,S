1. German data retention act challenged
============================================================

Just five days after the German President Horst Kvhler approved the German
data retention law that entered into force on 1 January 2008, the German
Working group on data retention (Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung)
challenged the law in the Federal German Constitutional Court.

The complaint was filed with the Court on 31 December 2007 and, for the
first time in the German history, it was backed by 30 000 complainants. The
150-page notice of appeal requested an immediate suspension of the law on
the grounds of "apparent unconstitutionality".

The Working Group explains that the appeal is substantiated by the fear that
general data retention might severely disrupt free communication in Germany
by treating each and every citizen as a potential delinquent.

"According to the complaint, the pervasive logging of communication patterns
without reasonable suspicion resembled a serious encroachment upon the basic
values of constitutional legality. On the other hand, it would compromise
the working basis of professionals such as journalists and criminal
prosecutors as well as that of charitable services like crisis lines - all
of which relied greatly on the anonymity of both whistle-blowers and people
in need. In the future, sensitive contacts and communication would either
have to be conducted in person and face-to-face or would have to be
abandoned altogether."

The Group is also publishing guidelines and recommendations for safeguarding
individuals against the obligatory logging of all telecommunications
effective as of 2008.

The constitutional action was backed by protests in several cities in
Germany on 31 December 2007 against the new data retention legislation. In
Hamburg the critics held a mock funeral for "the death of privacy."

Some of the German ISPs that need to comply with the law by 2009, are also
relying of the constitutional challenge to succeed. Frank Simon, managing
director of Oldburg-based Ecce Terram explained to Heise: "I reckon the
Federal Constitutional Court will overturn the law this year or ask the
criminal prosecution authority to suspend it because the music and film
industries will overload them with so many complaints that the hunt for
terrorists and child pornographers will be seriously hampered."

2. EC public consultation of Creative Content Online
============================================================

On 3 January 2008, the European Commission (EC) launched a public
consultation for the preparation of a recommendation on Creative Content
Online to be adopted by the European Parliament and Council that calls
for a common legal environment for online content, proposing multi-territory
licences.

In the opinion of the European Commission, EU policies should support the
rapid implementation of "new services and related business models for the
creation and circulation of European content and knowledge online."

As a result of the public consultation on "Content Online in the Single
Market" launched by the EC in July 2006, there were several calls for the
encouragement of the cooperation between industry, right holders and
consumers on issues such as DRMs or Content Online as well as for financial
support and promotion of DRMs interoperability standards. An independent
study "Interactive Content and Convergence" that followed the consultation
in 2006 gave an overview of the issues to be addressed for the development
of new content services in the EU.

Based on the results of the consultation and of the study, the Commission
proposes in the newly launched consultation four main horizontal
directions of action at EU-level: availability of creative content;
multi-territory licensing for creative content; interoperability and
transparency of DRMs; and legal offers and piracy.

Some concerns have been expressed by digital media rights activists such as
the EDRI-member Open Rights Group (ORG) who believe that the EC plan goes
beyond copyright, and that consumer rights could be affected by it. "Looking
at some of the details of the European Commission consultation document it
seems to be that they are proposing a lot more than just a cross Europe
licensing scheme. (...) There is stuff here about transparency and
interoperability in digital rights management systems, there is stuff about
codes of conduct between internet service providers and rights holders to
encourage legal access and discourage unauthorised file sharing." stated
Becky Hogg, executive director of ORG.

However, the EC opinion is that all the different national copyright laws
and other intellectual property rights are holding back the film, music and
game industries. "Europe's content sector is suffering under its regulatory
fragmentation, under its lack of clear, consumer-friendly rules for
accessing copyright-protected online content, and serious disagreements
between stakeholders about fundamental issues such as levies and private
copying," was the EU Commissioner for the Information Society and
Media,Viviane Reding's statement.

DRM seems to fade out, after Sony BMG announced at the beginning of 2008
that it plans to give up to DRM for its music, thus becoming the last of the
top four music labels to throw the towel on this subject. But the EC
consultation paper wants to put it back in business, planning "a framework
for DRM transparency concerning, amongst others, the interoperability of
different DRMs, and ensuring that consumers are properly informed of any
usage restrictions placed on downloaded content, as well as of the
interoperability of related online services."

The consultation closes on 29 February 2008 following which, by the middle
of 2008, Reding will make formal recommendations on new ways to achieve a
single online content market for 500 million potential consumers, predicted
to be worth 8.3 billion euros by 2010 by the study on "Interactive content
and convergence" commissioned by Information Society and Media
Directorate-General of the European Commission and published on 25 January
2007.

3. European Data Protection Supervisor's opinion on RFID
============================================================

In the context of increasing debates in the European Union over the RFID
policy, Peter Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supevisor (EDPS),
published on 20 December 2007 his opinion on the growing use of RFID chips
in consumer products and other new applications affecting individuals.

EDPS published this opinion as a response to the European Commission's
communication on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Europe that was
released in March 2007, but taking into consideration other actions, such as
the creation by the EC of the RFID expert group, where EDRi is a member.

Peter Hustinx, explained the role of RFID and its relation with the
privacy issues: "RFID systems could play a key role in the development of
the European Information Society but the wide acceptance of RFID
technologies should be facilitated by the benefits of consistent data
protection safeguards. Self-regulation alone may not be enough to meet the
challenge. Legal instruments may therefore be required to guarantee that the
technical solutions to minimise the risks for data protection and privacy
are in place."

EDPS confirms that the wide use of RFID-technology is fundamentally
new and may have a fundamental impact on our society and on the protection
of fundamental rights in our society, such as privacy and data protection.
He underlined the basic five privacy and security issues that can be
distinguished in this respect: the identification of the data subject, the
identification of the data controller, the decrease meaning of the
traditional distinction between the personal and the public sphere, the
consequences of the size and physical properties of RFID-tags and the
lack of transparency of the processing.

The Opinion has highlighted several direct recommendations to the Commission
including the provision of a clear guidance on how to apply the current
legal framework to the RFID environment and the identification of "Best
Available Techniques" which will play a decisive role in the early adoption
of the privacy-by-design principle.

EDPS also tackled the issue of a specific legislation for the main issues of
RFID-usage in relevant sectors and considered that such legislation would be
needed if the proper implementation of the existing legal framework failed.
Such a legislation "must be considered as a 'lex specialis' vis-a-vis
the general data protection framework. This legislative measure should also
address the privacy and data protection concerns that arise in certain RFID
applications, such as item level tagging before the point of sale, which may
not necessarily involve the processing of personal data."

In any event, EDPS emphasised the need to lay down "the opt-in principle at
the point of sale as a precise and undeniable legal obligation, also for
RFID applications that fall outside of the scope of the Data protection
Directive and to ensure the mandatory deployment of RFID applications with
the appropriate technical features or 'privacy by design'."

4. New data protection rules asked by UK MPs
============================================================

The Justice Committee of the UK House of Commons issued on 3 January 2008 a
report on public data protection summarising the status and development of
the topic, especially since the November 2007 Chancellor's announcement to
the Parliament related to the loss of confidential data records of 25
million people by HM Revenue and Customs.

The report that recommends a data breach notification law, criminal
penalties for data controllers that are found responsible for breaching
security, greater powers and financing for the Information Commissioner's
Office, follows the line of the recommendations made by the House of Lords
Science and Technology Committee in August 2007 that were rejected at that
time by the government.

The present report emphasises the risk involved by large databases that are
accessible by many licensed users, making particular reference to
ContactPoint, the children's database that will come into being this year
and the National Identity Register, also planned to be gathered in 2008. It
also draws the attention on the risk related to the obligation to share data
with the other EU member states. "If data held by the Government is
available for inspection outside the jurisdiction, then the importance of
restricting the amount of data held, as well as proper policing of who had
access to it, takes on even greater importance." reads the report.

The report recommends that personal data should be held only where there are
proper safeguards for the protection of the respective data, which, in the
Justice Committee's opinion will become ever more difficult as data can be
easily shared within the country as well as between countries.

A greater role in the data protection should be played by the Information
Commissioner who should receive adequate support in this sense. "We note
that he already considers that his resources are at a minimum" is the
report statement.

It also calls for a legal obligation to notify the Commissioner as well as
the affected parties on significant data losses and for penalties for those
who disclose personal data.

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "Parliament is currently considering
proposals to amend section 60 of the Data Protection Act through the
Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill (...) This will provide a custodial
sanction as well as the existing fines for those found guilty of unlawfully
obtaining or disclosing personal data."

5. PI: Leading surveillance societies in the EU and the World 2007
============================================================

UK-based human rights group Privacy International (PI) published at the
end of last year the 2007 ranking assessment of the state of privacy in 47
countries, including all European Union member states.

The raking is based on the Privacy & Human Rights reports produced since
1997 by PI together with US-based Electronic Privacy Information Center and
is taking into consideration several criteria such as constitutional &
statutory protection and privacy enforcement, biometric ID
cards, data-sharing, video surveillance, communication interceptions and
data retention.

According to the authors, the project wants to "recognize countries in which
privacy protection and respect for privacy is nurtured. This is done in the
hope that others can learn from their example" but also "to identify
countries in which governments and privacy regulators have failed to create
a healthy privacy environment. The aim is not to humiliate the worst ranking
nations, but to demonstrate that it is possible to maintain a healthy
respect for privacy within a secure and fully functional democracy."

The main findings of the study that includes a world map of the
surveillance societies, show an overall worsening of privacy protection
across the world, reflecting an increase in surveillance and a declining
performance of privacy safeguards.

The rankings for 2007 prove a disturbing and increasing trend amongst
governments to archive data on the geographic, communications and financial
records of all their citizens and residents. This trend leads to the
conclusion that all citizens, regardless of their legal status, are under
suspicion.

The privacy trends have been fueled by the emergence of a profitable
surveillance industry dominated by global IT companies and the creation of
numerous international treaties that frequently operate outside judicial or
democratic processes.

PI also claims that "surveillance initiatives initiated by Brussels have
caused a substantial decline in privacy across Europe, eroding protections
even in those countries that have shown a traditionally high regard for
privacy." The general trend is the failure of the privacy performance for
older democracies in Europe, while the performance of newer democracies is
becoming generally stronger.

It is worth noting also that the worst ranking EU country is the United
Kingdom, which again fell into the "black" category along with Russia and
Singapore. However for the first time Scotland has been given its own
ranking score and performed significantly better than England & Wales.

The 2006 leader, Germany, slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings,
dropping from 1st to 7th place behind Portugal and Slovenia.

6. Inclusive E-government in Western Balkans
============================================================

Most of the participants in the workshops on inclusive e-government that
took place in the capitals of six Western Balkan countries, considered that
their countries have established very few mechanisms for e-inclusion and
interoperability, even though the interest in e-Government development is
high.

The workshops took place within the framework of the project "Western
Balkans Network for Inclusive e-Government" and were meant to present the
draft research on the levels of sophistication and inclusiveness of e-gov
services conducted by project partners using the EU-level Capgemini
methodology, with a goal to develop Regional eGovernment Roadmap to
facilitate joint efforts by the countries aspiring to soon join the EU.

The six workshops on inclusive e-government were organized by national
project partners, and had as targets the review of draft research results,
awareness raising and networking between stakeholders including government
officials, IT and human rights experts, as well as representatives of NGOs
dealing with issues of inclusion of disadvantaged groups such as people with
disabilities from both the host countries and the neighborhood.

Each workshop was organized by project partners from the respective
countries, and they took place in:
a. Skopje, Macedonia (23 November 2007) - organized by EDRi-member
Metamorphosis Foundation
b. Tirana, Albania (26 November 2007) - organized by Comport
c. Belgrade, Serbia (11 December 2007) - organized by Belgrade Open
School
d. Zagreb, Croatia (13 December 2007) - organized by ZaMirNet
e. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (13 December 2007) - organized by
OneWorld SEE
f. Podgorica, Montenegro (20 December 2007) - organized by the Institute
for Strategic Studies and Projections


The level of online sophistication of e-government services in all countries
where research has been completed so far are similar (Albania 33%, Serbia
40%, Montenegro 45%, Macedonia 50%, Croatia 57%) and most of them need to
develop under similar circumstances and face similar obstacles, lagging 5-7
years behind the levels of EU. The potential benefit from mutual cooperation
is great, both to the states-which have so far mostly invested in
revenue-generating services such as e-taxes-and their citizens who need more
efficient and transparent governance.

The "Western Balkans Network for Inclusive e-Government" project is
supported by the East East: Partnership Beyond Borders Program of the Open
Society Institute and led by the Metamorphosis Foundation. Alongside the
workshops, the project activities included the Third International
Conference e-Society.Mk (29-30 November 2007 in Skopje) which facilitated
exchange
of know-how and experiences both between stakeholders from the region and
from the European Union.

7. UK Government continues to pressure ISPs for Internet filtering
============================================================

On 8 January 2008, at the launching of the government consultation on new
copyright exceptions, Lord Triesman, the UK minister for intellectual
property, threatened the ISPs with the introduction of new legislation to
force them to block illegal filesharing in case they cannot find a voluntary
agreement together with the music and film industries by the end of summer.

Referring to the Government's attitude towards illegal filesharing, Triesman
said "We're not prepared to see the kinds of damage that will be done to the
creative economy," and regarding the ISPs he added in an interview for The
Register "There is no objective reason why they (rights holders and ISPs)
cannot arrive at an agreement. Whether they have the will to do so is
another matter."

According to a spokesman for ISPA, the Internet providers' trade
association, some "good meetings" have taken place between the association
and film rights owners, but he did not give any specific details on the
results.

Triesman also declared that the UK government was collaborating with the
French Government on the anti-infringement legislation that proposes the
creation of an enforcement body to which the French ISPs will hand over
filesharing data. "The French are plainly very serious about this, it's
really interesting. We will actually do quite a lot of work alongside them -
not necessarily to reach exactly the same objective, but I think we've got
a desire to share evidence and analyses. There's no point repeating each
other's research." said the minister.

The consultation launched on 8 January introduced five recommendations
proposing a relaxing copyright enforcement for research and education
purposes, to enable distance learning and whiteboard tuition, to allow
libraries to make a copy for archive purposes where the copyright holder
can't be found and to allow an exemption for the purposes of "caricature,
parody or pastiche".

The UK Government also proposes a "format shifting right" meaning that the
consumers should be allowed to make copies of copyright material they've
already bought, but puts a limit to DRM circumvention which should be
permitted only for academic and research purposes, but not for the general
public for entertainment.

Among other comments during the launching, a member of the International
Music Managers Forum emphasised the fact that DRM on music is almost dead
and is hated by consumers.

The first stage of the consultation is open until 8 April 2008.

8. ELOI - a French database to manage the expulsion of illegal migrants
============================================================

On 26 December 2007, the French government published a decree creating the
ELOI file, a database aimed at facilitating the expulsion of illegal
migrants. In March 2007, the French highest administrative court cancelled a
first attempt by the government to create this file, after 4 French NGOs,
among which EDRI member IRIS, filed a case against the Interior ministry.

While the March text was cancelled by the Conseil d'Etat for procedural
reasons only, the new version shows some important progress related to
concerns raised by the NGOS. The main changes are that no data will be kept
on visitors of illegal migrants in retention centres, and that personal data
of citizens with which illegal immigrants are staying, when not in retention
centres are kept for 3 months rather than 3 years.

While this step backwards from the government side is a direct result
of the French NGOs action, the ELOI database remains unacceptable,
according to the authors of the former complaint, with regards to the
migrants themselves and their families. The duration of the retention
of their data remains 3 years for most of the data, and data on their
children are still kept in the ELOI file. Last but not least, the
database still contains data on "the need for specific surveillance
(of the migrant) with regards to the public order'. According to the
NGOs, this demonstrates that the government makes a direct
association between immigration and criminality.

Moreover, the decree contains new provisions, adding to the ELOI
database an impressive amount of administrative and judicial data
dealing with all aspects of the expulsion process, most of them to be
retained for 3 years. In addition, a new purpose has been set to this file,
which is to produce statistics on expulsion decisions and their actual
executions.

These problems, as well as the Sarkozy administration setting up
quantitative objectives - a minimum of 25000 expulsions targeted in 2008 -
have made the French NGOs declare that the actual meaning of this file is
the government willingness to manage the expulsion of migrants at an
unprecedented level. They consider that with the ELOI database, this
expulsion policy has reached an industrial level.

9. European Commission closes enquiry on Apple
============================================================

The European Commission (EC) has closed the enquiry against Apple for
charging more UK users than other EU users for downloads of its iTunes
music, following the company announcement on 9 January 2008 that it will
reduce download prices for UK within 6 months to align them with prices in
continental Europe.

A formal investigation had been opened by the EC against Apple after
'Which?', a UK consumer protection organisation, filed a complaint in
September 2004 against the company who was applying 20% higher prices to
British users than for the other European users. The difference has
decreased in time reaching down to 6% and, following discussions between
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes and Apple chief executive Steve Jobs,
the company decided to equalise the prices within a 6-month period.

"The Commission is very much in favour of solutions which allow consumers to
benefit from a truly Single Market for music downloads." was the Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes's statement.

"This is an important step towards a pan-European marketplace for music,"
said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO adding: "We hope every major record label will
take a pan-European view of pricing".

The issue that remains under discussion is that of the geographical
restriction; Apple does not allow purchases on iTunes digital stores from a
different country than the residence one. A user from France for instance
cannot buy from the German iTunes and Apple verifies the user's residence by
means of the credit card during the transaction.

Apple states that this policy is due to the different music copyright laws
and rules of the European countries. The EC agrees with this position
stating that the contracts between Apple and the major record companies
are not in breach of the current EU legislation. "..the fact that the same
content is not available on a pan-European basis is not the result of
restrictive business practices between Apple and major record companies.
Rather it is the result of the existing state of copyright legislation (...)
Some record companies choose not to make available their content on a
pan-European basis. They do so in full respect of copyright regulation.
There is no violation of antitrust regulation" stated Kroes' spokesman
Jonathan Todd, at the daily Commission briefing on 8 January 2008.

Unfortunately, the European Commission did not consider the other
Apple-related topics revealed by the consumers association in EU: its
dominant position in the EU online music market, its DRM-related practises
or its lock down problems. But some of these aspects are still under
investigation in several European countries by the national Consumer
Ombudsman.
