--- overview ---

the potential for a linguistic component in models of and approaches to
encryption has been introduced, perhaps beyond the normal boundaries of
consideration as this relates to sign-based relations and dynamics.

the context for this perhaps also correlates with a recent article on
Google and its geometric approach to language translation...

How Google Converted Language Translation Into a Problem of Vector Space
Mathematics
http://www.technologyreview.com/view/519581/how-google-converted-language-t=
ranslation-into-a-problem-of-vector-space-mathematics/


...in that pattern matching has a primary role in establishing structures,
taking note of the algebraic relations of [sign] - [sign] =3D [sign]

again, it does matter how accurate this representative signage is, in terms
of what it is referencing and in what frameworks. and thus pattern matching
that is ungrounded could tend towards a false perspective, whereas pattern
matching that is grounded could tend towards realism. a boundary condition
exists, and it could like the manual settings on a camera establish how a
situation is viewed, given light, f-stop, and focus and distance, etc

the potential exists for a quadratic equation-like review of data sets in
nonlinear contexts, churning through variables upon variables and searching
out equations. this can happen in terms of numbers and their conceptual
frameworks, like physics or other formulae, though it could also exist at a
more abstract level of pattern matching of various subsign components and
elemental structures.

thus, symbolic processing and symbolic computation could take place in such
a scenario if accurately modeled, the variables conceptually understood. in
their truth this is about the grounding of signage in its truth, and this
evaluation could exist below the level of the word, letter, or even number
or could exist in terms of images and what signs exists within the images,
in terms of their nested and-or dynamic relations. it is perhaps a future
test of such an approach, can a computer interpret a painting in terms of
its content, based on its perspective, or does it only pattern match what
others perceive about it, and thus mimics observation and knowledge. it
would seem the former is an ungrounded evaluation of signs, matching the
sign with the sign for its model of truth, whereas the latter would be a
grounded evaluation of signs, in an empirical model of truth, bounded by
computer observation in that it may not 'like' or love or hate the artwork,
though through diagnostics could statistically pinpoint its location
amongst various mapped qualities of other such works and ideas, and gauge
its like and unlike characteristics, evaluating against a human viewpoint

and while this mapping or correlation could occur between [signs] that are
computationally processed in this way, via geometry, as with language in
the above example-- the question in this instance is what might be possible
if this geometric evaluation broke the barrier of the sign itself, and thus
the geometry of the signage was broken down into its component parts and
evaluate for its dynamic relations, as if DNA of alphanumeric characters
that compose both math and linguistic units and algorithms (equations if
not words, sentences) such that further mapping could take place beyond the
given boundary, and be used computationally and for empirical structuring,
and that this additional data may not relate to the word itself because it
is only partial, as different languages have their own words, perspectives,
though in identifying these structures, could perhaps function as another
level of language that could universalize different characters into a
meta-characters that like QR-codes or some fractal language, exist in a
context of an alphanumeric master code, reverse engineering the context for
an original alphanumeric system (which HIOX is for western civilization)

what if the quadratic pattern matching occurred as an aspect of machine
translation at the level of computation, and perhaps only machine readable
in some layers or levels, that could move into N-dimensional frameworks,
and how this could relate to cryptology and modeling of information in
various ways. it is easy to conjure up What Ifs, though in considering the
impact of transcending given boundaries of data modeling, it does appear to
go beyond the existing conceptualization, into another territory entirely
than what the tools and software and ideology allows to be considered, and
thus interpretation is bounded and limited by a particle fixed viewpoint or
forced perspective that such inquiries are in direct challenge of, as to
what exactly these issues involved consist of, in terms of their truth

and it is this truth of matching patterns and A=3DA and A=3DB evaluation an=
d
differentiation, that subsign indicators or components and elements could
be considered to have computational characteristics that could be a realm
for the application of algebraic, geometric, and various calculus-based
approaches to transforming and relating words, structures, ideas, content,
in the very way that cryptographic equations do for the signs themselves,
when _contained inside or within a crypto model, though bound or inviolate
as data itself, which then establishes the "THIS IS SECRET DATA" scenario
that is a strange confession, when everything is to avoid the easy reveal

so these boundaries and the way signs are interpreted effect where the
algebra and geometry and transmutation of data begins and ends, in terms of
what is transformed and how, in what dimensionality, parameters, and
terms.

and thus by opening up the sign itself to consideration, in terms of its
patterning and various structuring, its subsign scaffolding and likewise,
the /superposition/ of various shared and unshared elements within its
particular or unique design, as could be empirically modeled and evaluated,
it would then be possible to establish 'many truths' about the sign that is
beyond just its meaning or its pattern match at the macro-level of the sign
and into its range of interconnections and the frameworks it shares with
other concepts and words, including across various language systems and
character sets, as these may be bridged by geometric or other trusswork

perhaps there are new mathematics involved or that this is mathesis in a
realm of signs and symbols that function as an alchemical model that goes
beyond the normal rules for the molecular, conceptual ~forms into other
esoteric dimensions, wild abstractions or unknowns, seeking out or finding
and testing hypotheses to establish what is possible and potential within
the gap, and the distance between conceptualizations in their otherness

the ruin of description here is detached abstraction that is easy to get
lost in and yet it is also necessary to provide context, which in this
moment involves a chasm or void that would be encountered beyond the given
boundary of alphanumeric computation, into a flatland-like extradimensional
realm that perhaps could not be visualized except by a quantum computer,
due it its massive linearity combined with infinite connectivities that
would likely involve change as a variable, or weather systems for the data
that like leaves on a tree move in response, or become wet when it rains,
or fall away in autumn and regrow in spring. so too, conceptualization as
it may be born and be sustained and then, parts decay while others survive,
and so to consider starting such an evaluation, as it may involve a process
that is equivalent with nature to a degree more than the filesystems and
architectures of computers today, seemingly. in that the data model this
involves would be the foundation for a shared empirical model referenced
and observed and contributed to from multiple perspectives simultaneously
and thus an expansiveness that involves bit sets and their permutation,
though also the components of these [bits] as signs, deconstructing the
elements and considering the myriad connectivities of subsign relations and
dynamics, in their linguistic and mathematical importance, which could be
relevant in terms of encryption, translation, data modeling, for instance


--- typology ---

so there is a theme of typography connected to this symbolic processing of
information via computation, and it is proposed this is a model or approach
more like that that humans rely upon for advanced awareness, fundamental
knowledge, and heuristic reasoning, yet is unaccounted for in technology
and tools of today, turning highly literate people into illiterates in the
binary context, for the dissonance that a false perspective brings in terms
of thinking, making it seem irrational in the limited, warped biased view.

so typography has letters and numbers that are represented as signs and
this goes from printing era blocks of type and machinery into the present
day era of electronic pre-press and desktop publishing, from dot matrix to
ink jet, laser printers, page layout tools (Quark Express), vector and
bitmap graphics software (Illustrator, Photoshop) and specific software for
typography (Fontographer, other) -- and this is not Mathematica territory
in terms of the manipulations of signage, as ideas or concepts, it would
seem, and instead upholds a particular boundary or conceptualization of
what type is, what images are, and the meaning of fonts and representation
of words and letters and numbers appears to occupy a narrow interpretation
that is mainly visual, about its geometry and usability for communication,
and enhancing this with stylistic refinements, a range of type expressions

and pretty much none of this relates to what i am attempting to evaluate.
none of it accesses the dimensions, exception perhaps if modeling text
within a 3D program and spinning and mirroring it, yet that is an insane
approach, more of a one-off Kryptos sculpture than a way of exchanging
information. the graphics program 'rotate' and horizontal and vertical
mirroring are another very basic aspect of this, though again it involves
the [sign] or text as an image, to be manipulated at its macroscopic level
and not to allow different dynamics to occur within a given word, whereby
some letters may have one function and others others, as this involves a
larger document of, say, twenty different co-existing variables, changing
the text from one document into another series of parallel perspectives.

typology is not typography, yet it is a vital concept in this situation
because [signs] are essentially sets, and subsign characteristics are the
variabilities nested within the set, in various subset dynamics, 'pattern
recognition all the way down' to zeros and ones.

typology, in the terms i relate to it, is easy to understand in terms of
infrastructure and building types. a TV station is a type of building that
is like a component on a circuit-board. a nuclear power station. gas
station. and these have various programming that is unique and overlaps
with other buildings, such as a home dwelling or school. telephones for
instance or network connections. and likewise, [signs], [words] as they
consist of substructural patterns, including geometric characteristics
though also correspondence with other letters and numbers, as part of this
overlapping of functionality and meaning: 5 and 2, S and Z. it may be seen
as irrelevant in terms of a discrete letter or number, yet within a shared
context it can bring additional meaning or reveal interconnected patterning
that could be useful or applied in a calculative schema. such that data can
be hidden or revealed via such means, potentially, yet appear as noise
otherwise. or only /fragments/ or parts of the characters may appear yet in
their statistical or probabilistic frequency, may tend towards a particular
viewpoint or interpretation versus another, or could remain ambiguous and
hidden, unless having the missing key to know which tumblers to turn, etc

so while typology is not describing fonts or "type" on a computer display,
it has some relevance to typography in its set-theory evaluation, as this
relates to signs and symbols and transformative relations, their potential
alchemical connections, as this perhaps even moves between stereotype and
archetypes, as concepts are removed of grounded truth and copied over and
over, where this truth is replaced by its sign, increasingly ungrounded,
and thus 'vision' and IMAGE replace and stand-in for understanding, and so
too in this way, pattern matching is removed from its logical foundation
(A=3DA) where this can be about matching signs with themselves as if truth,
yet this is only pseudo (pT) and when standardized, moves towards falsity
as a shared framework, the false perspective at this layer of evaluation

image versus idea, the disconnect between forms of signage and content,
everything foregrounded and the empirical background removed, thus perhaps
an early cosmos condition, from order into chaos, from one view into many
as the limits of an older viewpoint could not withstand and keep up with
the changes, then only now to realize the consequences of lost modeling,
lost grounding, lost conceptualization, lost reasoning, lost communication,
lost sensibility, lost relations, lost truth, lost principles, everything

thus the situation that now exists is basically opposed to evaluating these
ideas due to proscribed boundaries and fixed interpretations, and thus a
lot of writing is necessary to build up a structural framework to share
this other viewpoint within, to seek to describe the situation, model it to
some extent, and offer an alternative approach into another realm which is
seemingly another territory for language, appearing largely unexplored, as
if a hidden potential of or within language, as if it were to be unlocked
and made nonlinear by default of such restructuring, recontextualization,
as this changes perspective, going from unconnected linear viewpoints in
serial progression to massively connected parallelism of shared views

in some sense the 'type' (non-font version, as in typical or repeated unit)
is to consider the various ecology of the sign-ecostem in terms of a
breakdown of these various repeated yet also unique structural relations,
across various classes, categories, and groups that map to meaning though
also to geometric and or other principles. for me Plato's mention of this
knowledge of language when mirrored in water is a form of calculus, and
thus figuring out what sets belong to what characteristics would be to then
group or identify them according to type, function, programmatic qualities,
potential or variable meaning -- yet here is where it is like an orbital
cloud,.. because this involves *potentials* for these set relations, the
dynamics are about superpositions that may be nested within a structure and
not visible immediately else could emerge or hide upon consecutive changes
and thus, there could be a flurry of potentials in any given bit set, both
in itself as a compact sign, such that [dob] which could be 'date of birth'
could transform into [pod] given particular instructions. and what does
that mean or what does that mutative characteristic make possible? well, in
a crypto context, you could hide instructions that reveal that data, and it
could involve several layers based on multiple or single keys that unlock
such a hidden perspective within a text, even while in plain text mode. yet
it could go much further than this, into questions of universal language
and unification of all data in a single model of grounded empirical truth,
as patterns map back to A=3DA (1) or remain in a realm of ambiguity (A=3DB)

so again, the questions involved seem to be about the unit of measure,
where is the boundary for considering what a pattern is and what parameters
are evaluated, in what frameworks, dimensionality, conceptual terms. a way
of encapsulating a small aspect would be that the entirety of linguistic
conceptualization could be tied to the scaffolding of language, worldwide,
in this way, via particular approaches to abstraction. and other models
could tie into particular concepts, say [economics] branches out to all
other data sets in various ways, and interconnects in that pattern-based
infrastructural conduit, though in its own dimensionality which may or may
not overlap with hypotheses of other signage. and thus like protocols and
layering, perhaps there is a particular layer this is occurring on, and who
knows, perhaps crypto is its own layer within this model of knowledge, such
that its truth is reflected in how it is represented and modeled as an idea
and that this information shapes the perspective from the ground up- so if
the purpose is protecting or securing communications (truth), how might
this fit into the various contexts that are embattled or under siege or
boundaries need to be created or data needs to be hidden, as this can be
evaluated in terms of truth, firstly, and not applied crypto systems that
may rely upon false perspectives and assumptions of unaccounted variability
that may largely undermine or exploit this purpose or outright prevent it

if you have ungrounded observations, ungrounded mathematics, ungrounded
language, ungrounded communications, ungrounded relations, ungrounded
reasoning, ungrounded beliefs, ungrounded ideas - and then expect that some
software and hardware solution and encryption model is going to deal with
all the security exploits inherent in those, do to protecting [signs] in
their inviolable state, it would be perhaps to limit questioning to a much
smaller set of criteria than what the situation actually exists in, and
thus a false sense of security, knowing, secrecy, privacy, that may rely
more on belief if not ideological compliance, to not destroy the model and
allow it to persist, as if this validates the process, than to rigorously
question the frameworks in their depth beyond issues of representation that
exist in biased and institutionalized agendas, driven toward certain ends.
and while most probably find themselves situated in something preexisting,
and few probably have chosen these parameters from the start, it is very
difficult if not impossible to do anything else, given the fixed idea of
what cryptography involves, if the tools themselves are bounded and limit
what can be considered or evaluated- which is a perspective forced also by
indoctrination into an orthodoxy of patterning, "received ideas" that are
foundational yet flawed, and instead of theory and law should be brought
back into a realm of falsification and hypotheses instead, because perhaps
people are trading in dead and rotten fish, skeletons of previous solutions
that are by now carcasses or firmly established yet potentially ungrounded
in what is actually going on as it is exists, versus as it is believed to

maybe the truth of this is that security is not possible, and not allowed
if there were a dictatorial framework, and thus a limit allows a false
sense of security by going along with the charade. maybe it is purposive to
not allow tools to serve ideas - think: the internet has no model for ideas
and yet is chock full of data and information, yet no conceptualization
that builds upon itself beyond the relation between [signs] as if "search"
is the biggest idea to emerge from 21st civilization. seriously- WTF.
exactly how stupid have we become, the Google billboard hiding yahoo-like
organization of categories no one can access to actually find anything via
structural knowledge. how helpful is that for everyone, actually. how
onesided. is there not some symbiotic relation there, or is it parasitic,
asymmetric, a siphoning occuring for a hidden, protected, privatized agenda

what if the unit of measure is not the [word] and instead the [idea], the
concept. where is the internet or software tools to navigate or explore
those dimensions and dynamics. nowhere you say? exactly. it is absent,
missing information, once the core of culture, now relativism, viewpoints
disjoined from every other, sects of ideology, the interdisciplinary yet
without a shared truth, a structural limit to this being able to happen,
the span needing to go beyond private views and skews, binary onesidedness
and back into truth, back to logic, underneath the skein of civilization,
to question what is beneath this scrim the movie image is projected onto

the nature of reality. yet there is nothing documented in culture or in the
academy or educational system about the existence of electromagnetism in
relation to these events. the paradigm is 300 years outdated, from the
first industrial revolution onward, though moreso than that, if taking into
account metaphysics and cultural beliefs prior to this, when unified and
allowed beyond the confines of a 'public methodology' of science that is as
biased as religion once was to external data beyond the given modeling

so basically it is hopeless, there is no way, populations are illiterate,
relations are animalistic now, like dealing with deranged jungle animals in
terms of 'reasoning ideas', the poison of the snake delivered by pills, or
violence of predator via hidden toxins attacking from every angle instead

unless that is, someone, somewhere else out there also relates to truth as
the primary condition for evaluating events. which is what the internet is
all about, connecting people in their various contexts and perspectives and
building a reality up and out of that shared context, as it may or may not
scale beyond a certain point. and thus the collapse of literate email list
culture into the politics of commercialization as this educational venue
is  socialized and commoditized and turned into a scene of endless groups
and groupies, even the unpopular now have their own support groups online-
everyone is cool and everyone is a celebrity in their own way. egotastic.
who needs TV cameras when there are webcams and the internet, each person a
star in their own movie even, situation comedies, varied lifestyles mapped
into contrasting frameworks - notice ensuing antics, protesters kill off
opponents, latest rape video online, see cannibalism tomorrow, live! how
much of what is engineered into this state of failure is purposeful for the
underlying agenda and politics of subversion and subservience to lesser
views and lesser ideals, brought about by the incapacitation of reason, its
absence in the culture, public debate, virtues, principles, goals, ideals

where is it. it is not at this superficial level of reading, referencing,
repeating, and regurgitating dumb [signs] as if truth itself. it is not
simply the act of communicating information or sharing and storing data. it
involves conceptualization that is accurate, grounded in a larger truth,
and that becomes the basis for shared awareness. consciousness. a modeling
of reality that at its core is based on verisimilitude, *insight*, and a
way of existing, surviving, being, though growing, developing, moving
through the world in a more optimal and purposeful way. and that involves
getting at the concepts in their truth, accessing it, questioning it, and
then having this be the basis for relations, for actions, governance. thus
what if the technology and tools limit this possibility to such an extent
that it is not even possible to communicate, the tools are purposefully
degraded, the equipment made to break and forced to break by attackers, and
thus the very interaction in this truth is in jeopardy via this condition

'the computers' a forced perspective. the software. the processors. the
hardware. what is made and how it is made and thought about. to varying
degrees, mostly JUNK. mostly inadequate. mostly off-course, limiting. to
such a degree as to force incapacitation by the very use of these tools.
programming and reinforcing a captive mindset, subservient to this agenda.

in this way -- breaking the illusion that is sustained, cracking the mirror
that this establishes in civilization, would remap categories and concepts
beyond their existing connections, short-circuiting and rewiring the way
these interactions can and cannot take place, tearing down boundaries and
erecting others that keep unbelievers and those who do not serve 'truth' in
a different contained realm, for they cannot be reasoned with and rely on
lies and manipulations to force dynamics as they exist, and should not be
allowed to continue this practice, a protected boundary must be established
to differentiate those who serve truth and those who exploit it so as to
serve themselves instead. survival of the fittest, finally grounded by
actual capacity versus conformity, actual accounting for value instead of
standardizing high and low capacity to the same bell curve median scale,
though far lower as mimicry and imitation and acting go, pretending to be,
manipulating signs to appear as something yet not do the actual work, etc

accounting is core to truth. without it, enronomics, in whatever theorized
confection it may appear as, resolving all scenarios in a single relativism
that is binarily N=3DP complete. everything is resolved, solvable this way,
just believe, follow, indoctrinate, be the religion, the brick in the wall

so what if the bricks are de|con-structed, the wall dismantled. the [signs]
accounted for in their truth, what does it involve- what limits exist to
making this new interpretative context a possibility. and it is proposed it
exists going beyond the normal conception of the alphabet, language in its
existing boundaries, and breaking apart the signage, to get at the concepts
and start talking about them in structural terms, of logic and their truth.
and to do this would require stopping the flow of time in sentences and in
reading and writing, and moving to a nonlinear approach, as previously
mentioned in terms of conceptual models as molecules, a diagramming and
testing of ideas and beliefs as hypotheses.

yet to get there, it is necessary to break the IMAGE of the sign, a ruling
illusion about the inviolability of words as if truth itself, inherently.
to shatter the illusion of perfection, especially within language as if a
perfect perspective if unerring, yet not accounting for error in thought
and framework, which is the core failure, this incapacity to reference
truth removed of falsity. so how to get to empirical truth when these same
SIGNS are by default only pseudo-truth, partially or minimally accessing it
in local distributed contexts, and it would seem that overcoding or
under-coding or various other approaches to language beyond existing
boundaries could open up further interpretation via the inherent
/superposition/ of letters, words, and numbers, such that [sign] could have
a range or cloud of variable meaning, that may be multiple, and could be
written and read this way, potentially, though likely starting off in very
small code-like fragments though building to words or sentences
potentially, another form of language that is based in a grounded
superposition, as if ideograms

so, this is to propose a potential communication capacity exists that could
develop to break the illusion of linear, serial relativism based in binary
ideology, and instead operate within a many-viewed parallel perspective
that has a range of meanings within the [sign] as de|con-structed into
various subsign scaffolding, as it becomes a component of this language.
and from this, so too, hidden communication that could occur by way of a
limited observer where those who do not share the same parameters or logic
would be bounded in what they can interpret, and that this interpretation
would default to an ungrounded or forced rationalization in a biased binary
viewpoint, due to limits upon its meaning, thus perhaps inventing views
that do not exist yet fulfill the limited model. this could be useful in an
illegal surveillence society if the oppressive generates false positives by
their mistaken analyses, skewing models, forcing extreme decision-making
out of line with the actual condition, thus increasing polarization the
side-effect in the unshared evaluation, which can be very telling and
provide an offset by which to distinguish those skewed and hostile from
those aligned in shared modeling of reality. anxiety of the "irrational"


that was a best attempt at a recap of the issues and a setup for a way into
this situation given what exists in typographic and linguistic structuring
of alphabets as [signage]. it should be insanely obvious i am unknowing of
most of what this involves, beyond the given conceptualization, though the
goal here is to tap into ideas that others know about in their depth that
could break this fixed structural condition wide-open across a wide range
of parameters beyond the few exampled here and there in the text. so too,
there are probably many errors in my own observations, so that should be
part of the evaluation, if assumptions or language or conceptualization is
wrong or missing or inaccurate or false. consider it a working hypothesis,
open to additional addition, able to be corrected, improved upon, part of a
larger collaborative model, this just an introduction to be expanded upon
if and as others relate to the concepts. these are ideas, not just my view
is valid or right or correct, so what follows and what precedes are based
on questions and considerations over a long period and this is where it
arrives today, mostly, in terms of making sense of the totality involved.

and thus, from this limited perspective, the way into it, as far as i can
perceive given a particular experience of these issues, is with structural
relations between [signs] themselves at the scale of individual letters


--- importance of ligature ---

a key idea is how to establish geometric relations between signs based on
their visual ordering, which directly involves how they are patterned and
what is like and unlike, over a range of criteria and analyses (phonetic,
anagrams, mirroring, &c.)

i did not know this before, though the ampersand (&) is a ligature, a
combination of letters E and t, from Latin. the dollar sign ($) also..

Typographic ligature
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature

the way i arrived at the concept of ligature was with a thesis combining
two seemingly disparate concepts, [architecture] and [electricity]. and
strangely found a symbol that had 'ae' - that combined these two letters
into a single character (=C3=A6)

Foucault had a book 'the Archaeology of Knowledge' which conceptualized
across a similar gap between concepts [archaeology] and [knowledge] and i
think it was through that reading and a given interpretation that it was
clear a progression existed from A & E as two concepts that relate to their
fusion in a shared structure, which the ligature to me represents. in that
discovery it was realized the concepts of architecture map directly onto
electromagnetic infrastructure, and thus circuitboard city planning is not
just a metaphor, typology of components, nor is building programming, etc.

so this is just a backgrounder on a visual equivalence of the structure
between two letters, the middle horizontal line in a capital A and capital
E, and how they combined into a single character (=C3=86) via shared struct=
ure.
it seems innocuous or without meaning, potentially, unless having meaning.
and thus when 'the =C3=A6ther' or 'arch=C3=A6ology' is rendered with or wit=
hout the
ligature it indicates something about its nature even, perhaps.

so there seem to be a a few ligatures for the American English alphabet
that get little or no use except perhaps in specialized domains. while the
ampersand is normalized, and dollar sign, the =C3=A6 ligature is not. perha=
ps it
went out with the era of the classics (texts of western civilization). to
give a sense of the chaos, it is unknown if the character will reliably
render because via email software because there is no special character
input, so simply trying to document the language itself is bounded and made
into a technical feat, to try to access a deeper level of its operation
than the readily available graphic emoticons, including steaming pile of
shit with animated flies that Google provides in its place.

so language is debased, shallow, image-focused on recognition of signs and
responding to these patterns. and it is in is warped and twisted realm that
ideas must function, yet when competing with idiocy, it does not good to
reference or rely upon truth beyond the shallowness and the choose your own
adventure style of navigating the situation, that relativism best allows.
do your own thing, everyone is legitimate in their viewpoints, etc. and
this ability to write and convey things, ideas, makes it so, apparently.
functionally. willing into being a perspective that can be reinforced and
defaults to true and believable by mere fact of sharing it, making it real
via language, shared viewpoints, even if they are fundamentally ungrounded

so it is incredibly easy to string together letters into words via typing
them out on a computer and sharing them worldwide with others, finding that
others exist elsewhere in a similar dimensionality and establishing those
synaptic and neuronal connections that establish a noospheric condition,
whereby awareness and atmosphere, local and global, syncronize in a new and
different way, via this remote connectivity as it defines, establishes a
shared reality - at the level of perception and communication of viewpoints

and yet the language itself could be superficial in contrast to the ideas
involved, so a lot could be communicated - information exchanged - and yet
very little said. or that the needle of truth remains in the haystack of
false and faulty frameworks, and thus it is about concentrating what this
minor truth is, establishing it, while not having a model of the whole that
this truth exists in, as a shared reality, only the partial details of it,
here to there, still all disconnected for lack of a larger framework and
the capacity to link together ideas beyond their isolated observations

as mentioned, this involves logical accounting for concepts in their truth
and connection of concepts beyond the context of pseudo-truth, which can be
a realm of conflict, a showdown of ideological vested interest and bullying
for authoritarian control over what is true, the valid perspective, etc, so
it is not just an issue of locating truth, it is also often unwanted or not
allowed, censored even, if not about destroying the messengers with ideas,
so to keep the paradigm on its existing downward course, into oblivion

thus to get into the concepts, it is to evaluate [signs] in terms of units
and the letter is one of these first steps. a single letter can have its
own meaning, such that the letter A may signify a mountain peak, to some
people or in a given context. the letter S evaluated as a snake. note how
children's books establish literacy in these same terms, where an image of
an illustrated green snake with googly eyes will be in the shape of an 'S',
though this extends into a realm of advanced cultural literacy as well

so there are lowercase and capital letters, which have their own dynamics
that could be evaluated. and while some concepts are single letter, such as
'I' that represents a first-person perspective of an observing self, most
letters unless defined mathematic or scientific variables (a, c, E, e, f,
F, M, W, etc) are instead likely involved in 'boundary crossing' via their
sounds, into a realm of other signage they can still refer to. for instance
the letter 'b' when sounded out equates with 'be' the two letter word, and
'bee' the three letter word. thus these dynamics could be mapped letter by
letter likewise, in their discrete existence as isolated units, prior to
visible or geometric connectivity though this hidden relation exists as a
structure and likewise could and probably has been mapped out extensively

so moving from single letters of the alphabet into two letter combinations
it is a realm of the ligature, where two letters can become one again by
their recombination, which involves a new character that replaces them

consider the idea that every word in this conveyance has adjacent letters
with a hidden potential to be combined in a compact ligature format, such
that a text could be reduced by a certain percentage yet still feasibly be
readable as the same text, only in a smaller space, and perhaps reading the
information would be more or less efficient, more or less detached from
issues of signage and help or hinder consideration of underlying concepts
in terms of how this could effect pattern matching and interpretation

for example, a word like HEIGHT could potentially have a ligature for [HE]
and [HT] such that [HE]IG[HT] would go from six characters to four. and
thus if still legible could compress or compact words and sentences this
way. so for instance, the ligatures for AE and OE could example across the
entire alphabet of two letter or more relations.

potential 2 letter ligatures // text version
https://www.dropbox.com/s/c1jhz61ddtvmzff/alphabet2.pdf

(note: graphic version attached for list archive)

consider that there is an array of 26 letters whereby A-Z, each letter is
recombined with every other letter, which arrives at 676 combinations that
can be evaluated for potential ligature connections. it need not arrive out
of Olde English or some historical context to be legitimate, or so it is
proposed that this technique has other applications than pronunciation or
cross-language word migrations.

thus looking at the table, the matrix can be navigated via X,Y coordinates
such that (1,1) would be AA and (5,8) would be HE for example.

the first pair of letters may be difficult to make a ligature of in some
situations  due to issues of fonts and spacing with adjacent letters on
either side, though imagine that software model could have multiple options
for how a ligature exists and is rendered, given its context, and thus a
single character perhaps somewhat like an M with a horizontal bar may in
some instance be legible as a double A ligature and thus if utilized could
compress whatever word it appears in, if any.

(it should be noted that these two letters combinations are still not in a
full context of communicating language though could have a symbolic or
other sign-based relevance, such as acronyms. and thus while not yet in a
normal realm of language evaluation for long form communication, meaning
can be compacted into these two character letters, prior to evaluating them
as potential ligature candidates. for instance: GE in terms of mythology
and also General Electric corporation, larger than many nation-states. that
is a lot of concept in a two-letter compressed word. and thus another such
connected structuring exists in this realm of abbreviation and acronyms
that can be another structure to consider when mapping out such dynamics)

to return to the table, a second example of HE would easily combine across
the center horizontal and allow a shared edge between the two letters. and
so evaluating candidates or approaches for ligature combinations involves
looking at their structure and considering geometric relations between the
graphic forms - which can be widely variable give existing fonts/type.

thus, the preference for the 16 segment LED display that has segments that
turn on and off for various parts of these letter structures, albeit not to
the degree needed for different fonts, though a matrix LED display could.
in other words, 16 segment displays are not chained together, do not share
common edges between characters and thus do not allow such ligatures, yet
demonstrate the need for a standardization of structure to enable common
geometric relations to exist, likewise. as if properties that vary given
how they are approached.

it should be noted that typical software allowing ligatures appears to be a
copy-paste scenario unless somehow macro-keyed. in that it is referenced,
as if looking up a thesaurus or doing a key-combo, to access the special
character, and that such translation of adjacent letters a and e (ae) do
not automatically translate into the ligature '=C3=A6'. this is a vital gap=
 and
involves usability issues as the approach or limits define the interaction.

now what if a keyboard existed that had its own fonts and controlled the
output, such that it could take a text like this, and automatically when
writing translate the variable letter combinations into a running ligature
framework via real-time or post processing, thus compressing the data yet
retaining its readability. and what if reading consisted of interpreting
such texts and where an anomaly may exist in legibility, the letters in the
word could be expanded to their full scale, removed from their ligature
connection. further, beyond just 2 letters or 3 letters, what if entire
words could be compacted down this way.

what this is to say is that the table above defines the 26x26 A-Z letter
combinations, and yet that is just one level of many. a word such as
'house' could be evaluated in terms of ligature, here capitalized to relate
it to the capital letter combinations...


     [H][O][U][S][E]


in terms of *potential* ligature combinations, there could be two letter
evaluation for every adjacent pair: HO, OU, US, SE.

each of these pair could have multiple potential versions, based on the
optimal relation to adjacent other letters. in this way, a span across
multiple ligatures could exist, such that [HO] and [OU] combine into a
single fused 3 letter ligature, while [US] and [SE] combine into another:


     [HOU][SE]


and thus, given variability, the letter 'U' could tend towards a particle
optimal state either to co-exist with the adjacent letter 'S' or to attempt
to combine with it in an optimal, balanced way, based on its legibility...


     [HO|U|SE]


this is to propose that *superposition* of variables could occur in the
word as a bit set, which may seem meaningless.  though the language itself,
the sign itself, would be calculating its own rendering as a sign, and not
just a passive issue of someone tapping a key for letters H O U S E and
having that be the result- instead, various modeling would be activated and
word combinations would be processed in real time in terms of ligatures and
other structural data based on how the situation is modeled (which could go
beyond visual structure, several examples mentioned earlier).

so this is to propose that any given word could potentially be mapped into
and out of this interstructural connection, based on its unit of measure as
the letter as a combinable entity. it is not yet about cracking them open,
yet it prepares the framework for doing so, by seeing how language works in
terms of communication techniques using existing software and equipment.


     [15,8|21|5,19]


thus, coordinates can map into these ligature frameworks, and three value
ligatures would have their own chart, which potentially would resolve many
three letter words or [signs] in terms of ligatures, and then potentially
many four letter ligatures could exist, and massive data charts would be
needed to chart these out, though it is entirely possible with computers.

now for instance if the original word used in the example (HOUSE) were to
be evaluated differently, it would have different variability in terms of
how the sign is rendered...


     [H][OU][SE]


in this case, the letter 'H' is non-ligatured or combined with an adjacent
letter, say due to readability issues, and the other two ligatures remain
separate...


     [8][21,15][5,19]


note the letter 'H' is the eighth letter in the alphabet, as a single
number input. now what if the [OU] and [SE] could were suddenly realized to
exist in another chart of four letter ligatures, and thus the coordinates
for these two ligature resolutions were replaced by another matrix value,
here fictional, equaling


     [H][OUSE]  ...

     [8][3.2.122,0.299.9]


what this suggests is that every letter and would could potentially be
fragmented and reunited in a similar structural framework that operates
well beyond ligatures, into an N-dimensional modeling of word and language
relations in a computational context, whereby the [signs] themselves are
not just inert static entities with no connection to truth, and instead
could map into different variabilities, ligatures or not, as a form or
approach to reading/writing.


--- other potential views ---

thus, extrapolated into this other abstract variability and the issues of
superposition, a text could be typed that automatically is transposed into
another framework via its software, though this would need to be a model
that is geometrically controlled, within a particular non-arbitrary shared
framework based on a common empirical model that can be developed via many
parallel interactions referencing and improving upon the same rulesets.

in such a way, an interface could exist along with a physical or software
keyboard that could offer optional structuring or [sign] relations, such
that another approach could involve a non-ligature evaluation of all the
available ASCII letters A and other special characters in their graphic
potential, and having this be an option for typing a concrete-poetry-like
message akin to SMS abbreviation though into the signage, deepening the
meaning, not just compacting it, instead making it multivariate. such that
a word or short communication could convey a prose like awareness, and
stand in and of itself as a perspective, in place of a paragraph, for
instance, due to its capacity and its depth of meaning. what are the
parameters that could be accessed, what are the existing limits of
parameter sets that *break* upon use or going beyond a given boundary, such
as characters in email, or limits within software, that instead could be
made accessible and reliable in use, for such symbolic communication, as it
may involve transformation of text or other approaches and issues, such as
one-time pads or encryption perhaps if a key infrastructure was involved
and meaning was bounded by interpreter

another consideration is to alter the rules of evaluation, such that the
text could be flipped or twisted within ready-made software made for such
communications, or other such dynamics, like turning everything 90 degrees
that may reveal a hidden pattern or transform certain words and not others
or reveal a portal to gain access to another level of the text or to move
through several as the data is rearranged via a given planned sequence. for
instance, what if the axis of left to right is reversed, right to left, for
the display of information. such that [axis] is variable. or mirroring, or
other pattern dynamics, say structural substitutions or additions whether
graphic or phonetic or acronyms or whatnot.

in ways it may be reminiscent of invisible ink, even, if a strange text
were to arrive that may be formatted beyond a legible threshold due to
unknown or unknowable rules (if bit set permutations to subsign structures)
and thus a threshold condition existed requiring deciphering or decrypting
or translation of the text or abstracted data.

with no such key to unlock the cryptic patterning, an AI device could
search for patterns in the existing structure, looking for clues, of which
there could be infinite many, given several approaches that appear likely.
yet which one to investigate may not be determinable, and the number of
choices could limit what kind of analyses are allowed, as if a barrier or
boundary, related to the way data is processed yet also truth modeled. in
other words it is speculated that beyond a certain threshold it could be
too difficult to compute or analyze such formatted communications because
they are equivalent to NOISE and display inherent structure that leads to
automatic meaning that is multiple and spread out in different directions
and thus the originating perspective remains unknown, potentially even to a
surveiller who may observe its decryption yet still not be capable of
comprehending its meaning, in terms of the information that is accessed, or
where the message begins or ends, potentially, depending on the framework

if a receiver of the message did have the key to unlock the meaning, it
could potentially exist as if a CSS/XML layer or transparency that appears
over the original text, as if the word-correction underlining on word
processor and text editors, though instead could highlight sections and
reference particular models or approaches for this data, to evaluate its
meaning in terms of sign/symbol relations. thus, as if an additional layer
of highlighting upon an underlying page, the message could appear garbled
or abstracted by default, yet with the translucent additional layer,
various structures or patterns could emerge, as if masking out some or
revealing other data. this could also involve nested sets organized by
different rules in combination with layers, such that /sequencing/ data in
a particular step-by-step approach or ruleset, perhaps based on a private
and-or shared public key, could then open up or allow access to a hidden
message nested within a larger ~variable context. what happens if you start
to spin the third page of the fifth chapter of a given book, which may not
be encoded this way, yet could reveal a hint or clue that then references
what is on the page, recontextualizing it, creating a path via one-time pad
that may disappear and be irrelevant both before and after yet not during
that moment, when it is instead decisive and allows certain functioning in
the given parameters. and yet what if the words cannot spin, the software
does not exist or the concepts are not realizable, what if the threshold is
too high or the ideas too controversial, such that it is made illegal to
have such considerations or develop such tools as if *against culture*, in
that the binary ideologues realize the threat to their false perspective
and grip on interpretation, the inanity of SMS becoming deadly serious in
its repercussions as the language is forked into an unreadable realm.

n-based relations and dynamics. <br>

<br>the context for this perhaps also correlates with a recent article on G=
oogle and its geometric approach to language translation... <br><br>How Goo=
gle Converted Language Translation Into a Problem of Vector Space Mathemati=
cs<br>

<br><br>...in that pattern matching has a primary role in establishing stru=
ctures, taking note of the algebraic relations of [sign] - [sign] =3D [sign=
]<br><br>again, it does matter how accurate this representative signage is,=
 in terms of what it is referencing and in what frameworks. and thus patter=
n matching that is ungrounded could tend towards a false perspective, where=
as pattern matching that is grounded could tend towards realism. a boundary=
 condition exists, and it could like the manual settings on a camera establ=
ish how a situation is viewed, given light, f-stop, and focus and distance,=
 etc<br>

<br>the potential exists for a quadratic equation-like review of data sets =
in nonlinear contexts, churning through variables upon variables and search=
ing out equations. this can happen in terms of numbers and their conceptual=
 frameworks, like physics or other formulae, though it could also exist at =
a more abstract level of pattern matching of various subsign components and=
 elemental structures.<br>

<br>thus, symbolic processing and symbolic computation could take place in =
such a scenario if accurately modeled, the variables conceptually understoo=
d. in their truth this is about the grounding of signage in its truth, and =
this evaluation could exist below the level of the word, letter, or even nu=
mber or could exist in terms of images and what signs exists within the ima=
ges, in terms of their nested and-or dynamic relations. it is perhaps a fut=
ure test of such an approach, can a computer interpret a painting in terms =
of its content, based on its perspective, or does it only pattern match wha=
t others perceive about it, and thus mimics observation and knowledge. it w=
ould seem the former is an ungrounded evaluation of signs, matching the sig=
n with the sign for its model of truth, whereas the latter would be a groun=
ded evaluation of signs, in an empirical model of truth, bounded by compute=
r observation in that it may not &#39;like&#39; or love or hate the artwork=
, though through diagnostics could statistically pinpoint its location amon=
gst various mapped qualities of other such works and ideas, and gauge its l=
ike and unlike characteristics, evaluating against a human viewpoint<br>

<br>and while this mapping or correlation could occur between [signs] that =
are computationally processed in this way, via geometry, as with language i=
n the above example-- the question in this instance is what might be possib=
le if this geometric evaluation broke the barrier of the sign itself, and t=
hus the geometry of the signage was broken down into its component parts an=
d evaluate for its dynamic relations, as if DNA of alphanumeric characters =
that compose both math and linguistic units and algorithms (equations if no=
t words, sentences) such that further mapping could take place beyond the g=
iven boundary, and be used computationally and for empirical structuring, a=
nd that this additional data may not relate to the word itself because it i=
s only partial, as different languages have their own words, perspectives, =
though in identifying these structures, could perhaps function as another l=
evel of language that could universalize different characters into a meta-c=
haracters that like QR-codes or some fractal language, exist in a context o=
f an alphanumeric master code, reverse engineering the context for an origi=
nal alphanumeric system (which HIOX is for western civilization)<br>

<br>what if the quadratic pattern matching occurred as an aspect of machine=
 translation at the level of computation, and perhaps only machine readable=
 in some layers or levels, that could move into N-dimensional frameworks, a=
nd how this could relate to cryptology and modeling of information in vario=
us ways. it is easy to conjure up What Ifs, though in considering the impac=
t of transcending given boundaries of data modeling, it does appear to go b=
eyond the existing conceptualization, into another territory entirely than =
what the tools and software and ideology allows to be considered, and thus =
interpretation is bounded and limited by a particle fixed viewpoint or forc=
ed perspective that such inquiries are in direct challenge of, as to what e=
xactly these issues involved consist of, in terms of their truth<br>

<br>and it is this truth of matching patterns and A=3DA and A=3DB evaluatio=
n and differentiation, that subsign indicators or components and elements c=
ould be considered to have computational characteristics that could be a re=
alm for the application of algebraic, geometric, and various calculus-based=
 approaches to transforming and relating words, structures, ideas, content,=
 in the very way that cryptographic equations do for the signs themselves, =
when _contained inside or within a crypto model, though bound or inviolate =
as data itself, which then establishes the &quot;THIS IS SECRET DATA&quot; =
scenario that is a strange confession, when everything is to avoid the easy=
 reveal<br>

<br>so these boundaries and the way signs are interpreted effect where the =
algebra and geometry and transmutation of data begins and ends, in terms of=
 what is transformed and how, in what dimensionality, parameters, and terms=
.=C2=A0 <br>

<br>and thus by opening up the sign itself to consideration, in terms of it=
s patterning and various structuring, its subsign scaffolding and likewise,=
 the /superposition/ of various shared and unshared elements within its par=
ticular or unique design, as could be empirically modeled and evaluated, it=
 would then be possible to establish &#39;many truths&#39; about the sign t=
hat is beyond just its meaning or its pattern match at the macro-level of t=
he sign and into its range of interconnections and the frameworks it shares=
 with other concepts and words, including across various language systems a=
nd character sets, as these may be bridged by geometric or other trusswork<=
br>

<br>perhaps there are new mathematics involved or that this is mathesis in =
a realm of signs and symbols that function as an alchemical model that goes=
 beyond the normal rules for the molecular, conceptual ~forms into other es=
oteric dimensions, wild abstractions or unknowns, seeking out or finding an=
d testing hypotheses to establish what is possible and potential within the=
 gap, and the distance between conceptualizations in their otherness<br>

<br>the ruin of description here is detached abstraction that is easy to ge=
t lost in and yet it is also necessary to provide context, which in this mo=
ment involves a chasm or void that would be encountered beyond the given bo=
undary of alphanumeric computation, into a flatland-like extradimensional r=
ealm that perhaps could not be visualized except by a quantum computer, due=
 it its massive linearity combined with infinite connectivities that would =
likely involve change as a variable, or weather systems for the data that l=
ike leaves on a tree move in response, or become wet when it rains, or fall=
 away in autumn and regrow in spring. so too, conceptualization as it may b=
e born and be sustained and then, parts decay while others survive, and so =
to consider starting such an evaluation, as it may involve a process that i=
s equivalent with nature to a degree more than the filesystems and architec=
tures of computers today, seemingly. in that the data model this involves w=
ould be the foundation for a shared empirical model referenced and observed=
 and contributed to from multiple perspectives simultaneously and thus an e=
xpansiveness that involves bit sets and their permutation, though also the =
components of these [bits] as signs, deconstructing the elements and consid=
ering the myriad connectivities of subsign relations and dynamics, in their=
 linguistic and mathematical importance, which could be relevant in terms o=
f encryption, translation, data modeling, for instance<br>

<br><br>--- typology ---<br><br>so there is a theme of typography connected=
 to this symbolic processing of information via computation, and it is prop=
osed this is a model or approach more like that that humans rely upon for a=
dvanced awareness, fundamental knowledge, and heuristic reasoning, yet is u=
naccounted for in technology and tools of today, turning highly literate pe=
ople into illiterates in the binary context, for the dissonance that a fals=
e perspective brings in terms of thinking, making it seem irrational in the=
 limited, warped biased view.<br>

<br>so typography has letters and numbers that are represented as signs and=
 this goes from printing era blocks of type and machinery into the present =
day era of electronic pre-press and desktop publishing, from dot matrix to =
ink jet, laser printers, page layout tools (Quark Express), vector and bitm=
ap graphics software (Illustrator, Photoshop) and specific software for typ=
ography (Fontographer, other) -- and this is not Mathematica territory in t=
erms of the manipulations of signage, as ideas or concepts, it would seem, =
and instead upholds a particular boundary or conceptualization of what type=
 is, what images are, and the meaning of fonts and representation of words =
and letters and numbers appears to occupy a narrow interpretation that is m=
ainly visual, about its geometry and usability for communication, and enhan=
cing this with stylistic refinements, a range of type expressions<br>

<br>and pretty much none of this relates to what i am attempting to evaluat=
e. none of it accesses the dimensions, exception perhaps if modeling text w=
ithin a 3D program and spinning and mirroring it, yet that is an insane app=
roach, more of a one-off Kryptos sculpture than a way of exchanging informa=
tion. the graphics program &#39;rotate&#39; and horizontal and vertical mir=
roring are another very basic aspect of this, though again it involves the =
[sign] or text as an image, to be manipulated at its macroscopic level and =
not to allow different dynamics to occur within a given word, whereby some =
letters may have one function and others others, as this involves a larger =
document of, say, twenty different co-existing variables, changing the text=
 from one document into another series of parallel perspectives.<br>

<br>typology is not typography, yet it is a vital concept in this situation=
 because [signs] are essentially sets, and subsign characteristics are the =
variabilities nested within the set, in various subset dynamics, &#39;patte=
rn recognition all the way down&#39; to zeros and ones. <br>

<br>typology, in the terms i relate to it, is easy to understand in terms o=
f infrastructure and building types. a TV station is a type of building tha=
t is like a component on a circuit-board. a nuclear power station. gas stat=
ion. and these have various programming that is unique and overlaps with ot=
her buildings, such as a home dwelling or school. telephones for instance o=
r network connections. and likewise, [signs], [words] as they consist of su=
bstructural patterns, including geometric characteristics though also corre=
spondence with other letters and numbers, as part of this overlapping of fu=
nctionality and meaning: 5 and 2, S and Z. it may be seen as irrelevant in =
terms of a discrete letter or number, yet within a shared context it can br=
ing additional meaning or reveal interconnected patterning that could be us=
eful or applied in a calculative schema. such that data can be hidden or re=
vealed via such means, potentially, yet appear as noise otherwise. or only =
/fragments/ or parts of the characters may appear yet in their statistical =
or probabilistic frequency, may tend towards a particular viewpoint or inte=
rpretation versus another, or could remain ambiguous and hidden, unless hav=
ing the missing key to know which tumblers to turn, etc<br>

<br>so while typology is not describing fonts or &quot;type&quot; on a comp=
uter display, it has some relevance to typography in its set-theory evaluat=
ion, as this relates to signs and symbols and transformative relations, the=
ir potential alchemical connections, as this perhaps even moves between ste=
reotype and archetypes, as concepts are removed of grounded truth and copie=
d over and over, where this truth is replaced by its sign, increasingly ung=
rounded, and thus &#39;vision&#39; and IMAGE replace and stand-in for under=
standing, and so too in this way, pattern matching is removed from its logi=
cal foundation (A=3DA) where this can be about matching signs with themselv=
es as if truth, yet this is only pseudo (pT) and when standardized, moves t=
owards falsity as a shared framework, the false perspective at this layer o=
f evaluation<br>

<br>image versus idea, the disconnect between forms of signage and content,=
 everything foregrounded and the empirical background removed, thus perhaps=
 an early cosmos condition, from order into chaos, from one view into many =
as the limits of an older viewpoint could not withstand and keep up with th=
e changes, then only now to realize the consequences of lost modeling, lost=
 grounding, lost conceptualization, lost reasoning, lost communication, los=
t sensibility, lost relations, lost truth, lost principles, everything<br>

<br>thus the situation that now exists is basically opposed to evaluating t=
hese ideas due to proscribed boundaries and fixed interpretations, and thus=
 a lot of writing is necessary to build up a structural framework to share =
this other viewpoint within, to seek to describe the situation, model it to=
 some extent, and offer an alternative approach into another realm which is=
 seemingly another territory for language, appearing largely unexplored, as=
 if a hidden potential of or within language, as if it were to be unlocked =
and made nonlinear by default of such restructuring, recontextualization, a=
s this changes perspective, going from unconnected linear viewpoints in ser=
ial progression to massively connected parallelism of shared views<br>

<br>in some sense the &#39;type&#39; (non-font version, as in typical or re=
peated unit) is to consider the various ecology of the sign-ecostem in term=
s of a breakdown of these various repeated yet also unique structural relat=
ions, across various classes, categories, and groups that map to meaning th=
ough also to geometric and or other principles. for me Plato&#39;s mention =
of this knowledge of language when mirrored in water is a form of calculus,=
 and thus figuring out what sets belong to what characteristics would be to=
 then group or identify them according to type, function, programmatic qual=
ities, potential or variable meaning -- yet here is where it is like an orb=
ital cloud,.. because this involves *potentials* for these set relations, t=
he dynamics are about superpositions that may be nested within a structure =
and not visible immediately else could emerge or hide upon consecutive chan=
ges and thus, there could be a flurry of potentials in any given bit set, b=
oth in itself as a compact sign, such that [dob] which could be &#39;date o=
f birth&#39; could transform into [pod] given particular instructions. and =
what does that mean or what does that mutative characteristic make possible=
? well, in a crypto context, you could hide instructions that reveal that d=
ata, and it could involve several layers based on multiple or single keys t=
hat unlock such a hidden perspective within a text, even while in plain tex=
t mode. yet it could go much further than this, into questions of universal=
 language and unification of all data in a single model of grounded empiric=
al truth, as patterns map back to A=3DA (1) or remain in a realm of ambigui=
ty (A=3DB)<br>

<br>so again, the questions involved seem to be about the unit of measure, =
where is the boundary for considering what a pattern is and what parameters=
 are evaluated, in what frameworks, dimensionality, conceptual terms. a way=
 of encapsulating a small aspect would be that the entirety of linguistic c=
onceptualization could be tied to the scaffolding of language, worldwide, i=
n this way, via particular approaches to abstraction. and other models coul=
d tie into particular concepts, say [economics] branches out to all other d=
ata sets in various ways, and interconnects in that pattern-based infrastru=
ctural conduit, though in its own dimensionality which may or may not overl=
ap with hypotheses of other signage. and thus like protocols and layering, =
perhaps there is a particular layer this is occurring on, and who knows, pe=
rhaps crypto is its own layer within this model of knowledge, such that its=
 truth is reflected in how it is represented and modeled as an idea and tha=
t this information shapes the perspective from the ground up- so if the pur=
pose is protecting or securing communications (truth), how might this fit i=
nto the various contexts that are embattled or under siege or boundaries ne=
ed to be created or data needs to be hidden, as this can be evaluated in te=
rms of truth, firstly, and not applied crypto systems that may rely upon fa=
lse perspectives and assumptions of unaccounted variability that may largel=
y undermine or exploit this purpose or outright prevent it <br>

<br>if you have ungrounded observations, ungrounded mathematics, ungrounded=
 language, ungrounded communications, ungrounded relations, ungrounded reas=
oning, ungrounded beliefs, ungrounded ideas - and then expect that some sof=
tware and hardware solution and encryption model is going to deal with all =
the security exploits inherent in those, do to protecting [signs] in their =
inviolable state, it would be perhaps to limit questioning to a much smalle=
r set of criteria than what the situation actually exists in, and thus a fa=
lse sense of security, knowing, secrecy, privacy, that may rely more on bel=
ief if not ideological compliance, to not destroy the model and allow it to=
 persist, as if this validates the process, than to rigorously question the=
 frameworks in their depth beyond issues of representation that exist in bi=
ased and institutionalized agendas, driven toward certain ends. and while m=
ost probably find themselves situated in something preexisting, and few pro=
bably have chosen these parameters from the start, it is very difficult if =
not impossible to do anything else, given the fixed idea of what cryptograp=
hy involves, if the tools themselves are bounded and limit what can be cons=
idered or evaluated- which is a perspective forced also by indoctrination i=
nto an orthodoxy of patterning, &quot;received ideas&quot; that are foundat=
ional yet flawed, and instead of theory and law should be brought back into=
 a realm of falsification and hypotheses instead, because perhaps people ar=
e trading in dead and rotten fish, skeletons of previous solutions that are=
 by now carcasses or firmly established yet potentially ungrounded in what =
is actually going on as it is exists, versus as it is believed to<br>

<br>maybe the truth of this is that security is not possible, and not allow=
ed if there were a dictatorial framework, and thus a limit allows a false s=
ense of security by going along with the charade. maybe it is purposive to =
not allow tools to serve ideas - think: the internet has no model for ideas=
 and yet is chock full of data and information, yet no conceptualization th=
at builds upon itself beyond the relation between [signs] as if &quot;searc=

<br>what if the unit of measure is not the [word] and instead the [idea], t=

<br>unless that is, someone, somewhere else out there also relates to truth=

<br>accounting is core to truth. without it, enronomics, in whatever theori=

vism that is binarily N=3DP complete. everything is resolved, solvable this=
 way, just believe, follow, indoctrinate, be the religion, the brick in the=
 wall<br>

<br>so what if the bricks are de|con-structed, the wall dismantled. the [si=
gns] accounted for in their truth, what does it involve- what limits exist =
to making this new interpretative context a possibility. and it is proposed=
 it exists going beyond the normal conception of the alphabet, language in =
its existing boundaries, and breaking apart the signage, to get at the conc=
epts and start talking about them in structural terms, of logic and their t=
ruth. and to do this would require stopping the flow of time in sentences a=
nd in reading and writing, and moving to a nonlinear approach, as previousl=
y mentioned in terms of conceptual models as molecules, a diagramming and t=
esting of ideas and beliefs as hypotheses. <br>

<br>yet to get there, it is necessary to break the IMAGE of the sign, a rul=
ing=C2=A0 illusion about the inviolability of words as if truth itself, inh=
erently. to shatter the illusion of perfection, especially within language =
as if a perfect perspective if unerring, yet not accounting for error in th=
ought and framework, which is the core failure, this incapacity to referenc=
e truth removed of falsity. so how to get to empirical truth when these sam=
e SIGNS are by default only pseudo-truth, partially or minimally accessing =
it in local distributed contexts, and it would seem that overcoding or unde=
r-coding or various other approaches to language beyond existing boundaries=
 could open up further interpretation via the inherent /superposition/ of l=
etters, words, and numbers, such that [sign] could have a range or cloud of=
 variable meaning, that may be multiple, and could be written and read this=
 way, potentially, though likely starting off in very small code-like fragm=
ents though building to words or sentences potentially, another form of lan=
guage that is based in a grounded superposition, as if ideograms<br>

<br>so, this is to propose a potential communication capacity exists that c=
ould develop to break the illusion of linear, serial relativism based in bi=
nary ideology, and instead operate within a many-viewed parallel perspectiv=
e that has a range of meanings within the [sign] as de|con-structed into va=
rious subsign scaffolding, as it becomes a component of this language. and =
from this, so too, hidden communication that could occur by way of a limite=
d observer where those who do not share the same parameters or logic would =
be bounded in what they can interpret, and that this interpretation would d=
efault to an ungrounded or forced rationalization in a biased binary viewpo=
int, due to limits upon its meaning, thus perhaps inventing views that do n=
ot exist yet fulfill the limited model. this could be useful in an illegal =
surveillence society if the oppressive generates false positives by their m=
istaken analyses, skewing models, forcing extreme decision-making out of li=
ne with the actual condition, thus increasing polarization the side-effect =
in the unshared evaluation, which can be very telling and provide an offset=
 by which to distinguish those skewed and hostile from those aligned in sha=
red modeling of reality. anxiety of the &quot;irrational&quot;<br>

<br><br>that was a best attempt at a recap of the issues and a setup for a =
way into this situation given what exists in typographic and linguistic str=
ucturing of alphabets as [signage]. it should be insanely obvious i am unkn=
owing of most of what this involves, beyond the given conceptualization, th=
ough the goal here is to tap into ideas that others know about in their dep=
th that could break this fixed structural condition wide-open across a wide=
 range of parameters beyond the few exampled here and there in the text. so=
 too, there are probably many errors in my own observations, so that should=
 be part of the evaluation, if assumptions or language or conceptualization=
 is wrong or missing or inaccurate or false. consider it a working hypothes=
is, open to additional addition, able to be corrected, improved upon, part =
of a larger collaborative model, this just an introduction to be expanded u=
pon if and as others relate to the concepts. these are ideas, not just my v=
iew is valid or right or correct, so what follows and what precedes are bas=
ed on questions and considerations over a long period and this is where it =
arrives today, mostly, in terms of making sense of the totality involved. <=
br>

<br>and thus, from this limited perspective, the way into it, as far as i c=
an perceive given a particular experience of these issues, is with structur=
al relations between [signs] themselves at the scale of individual letters<=
br>

<br><br>--- importance of ligature ---<br><br>a key idea is how to establis=
h geometric relations between signs based on their visual ordering, which d=
irectly involves how they are patterned and what is like and unlike, over a=
 range of criteria and analyses (phonetic, anagrams, mirroring, &amp;c.)<br=
>

<br>i did not know this before, though the ampersand (&amp;) is a ligature,=
 a combination of letters E and t, from Latin. the dollar sign ($) also..<b=
r><br>Typographic ligature<br><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typog=
raphic_ligature" target=3D"_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic=
_ligature</a><br>

<br>the way i arrived at the concept of ligature was with a thesis combinin=
g two seemingly disparate concepts, [architecture] and [electricity]. and s=
trangely found a symbol that had &#39;ae&#39; - that combined these two let=
ters into a single character (=C3=A6)<br>

<br>Foucault had a book &#39;the Archaeology of Knowledge&#39; which concep=
tualized across a similar gap between concepts [archaeology] and [knowledge=
] and i think it was through that reading and a given interpretation that i=
t was clear a progression existed from A &amp; E as two concepts that relat=
e to their fusion in a shared structure, which the ligature to me represent=
s. in that discovery it was realized the concepts of architecture map direc=
tly onto electromagnetic infrastructure, and thus circuitboard city plannin=
g is not just a metaphor, typology of components, nor is building programmi=
ng, etc.<br>

<br>so this is just a backgrounder on a visual equivalence of the structure=
 between two letters, the middle horizontal line in a capital A and capital=
 E, and how they combined into a single character (=C3=86) via shared struc=
ture. it seems innocuous or without meaning, potentially, unless having mea=
ning. and thus when &#39;the =C3=A6ther&#39; or &#39;arch=C3=A6ology&#39; i=
s rendered with or without the ligature it indicates something about its na=
ture even, perhaps.<br>

<br>so there seem to be a a few ligatures for the American English alphabet=
 that get little or no use except perhaps in specialized domains. while the=
 ampersand is normalized, and dollar sign, the =C3=A6 ligature is not. perh=
aps it went out with the era of the classics (texts of western civilization=
). to give a sense of the chaos, it is unknown if the character will reliab=
ly render because via email software because there is no special character =
input, so simply trying to document the language itself is bounded and made=
 into a technical feat, to try to access a deeper level of its operation th=
an the readily available graphic emoticons, including steaming pile of <br>

shit with animated flies that Google provides in its place.<br><br>so langu=
age is debased, shallow, image-focused on recognition of signs and respondi=
ng to these patterns. and it is in is warped and twisted realm that ideas m=
ust function, yet when competing with idiocy, it does not good to reference=
 or rely upon truth beyond the shallowness and the choose your own adventur=
e style of navigating the situation, that relativism best allows. do your o=
wn thing, everyone is legitimate in their viewpoints, etc. and this ability=
 to write and convey things, ideas, makes it so, apparently. functionally. =
willing into being a perspective that can be reinforced and defaults to tru=
e and believable by mere fact of sharing it, making it real via language, s=
hared viewpoints, even if they are fundamentally ungrounded<br>

<br>so it is incredibly easy to string together letters into words via typi=
ng them out on a computer and sharing them worldwide with others, finding t=
hat others exist elsewhere in a similar dimensionality and establishing tho=
se synaptic and neuronal connections that establish a noospheric condition,=
 whereby awareness and atmosphere, local and global, syncronize in a new an=
d different way, via this remote connectivity as it defines, establishes a =
shared reality - at the level of perception and communication of viewpoints=
<br>

<br>and yet the language itself could be superficial in contrast to the ide=
as involved, so a lot could be communicated - information exchanged - and y=
et very little said. or that the needle of truth remains in the haystack of=
 false and faulty frameworks, and thus it is about concentrating what this =
minor truth is, establishing it, while not having a model of the whole that=
 this truth exists in, as a shared reality, only the partial details of it,=
 here to there, still all disconnected for lack of a larger framework and t=
he capacity to link together ideas beyond their isolated observations<br>

<br>as mentioned, this involves logical accounting for concepts in their tr=
uth and connection of concepts beyond the context of pseudo-truth, which ca=
n be a realm of conflict, a showdown of ideological vested interest and bul=
lying for authoritarian control over what is true, the valid perspective, e=
tc, so it is not just an issue of locating truth, it is also often unwanted=
 or not allowed, censored even, if not about destroying the messengers with=
 ideas, so to keep the paradigm on its existing downward course, into obliv=
ion<br>

<br>thus to get into the concepts, it is to evaluate [signs] in terms of un=
its and the letter is one of these first steps. a single letter can have it=
s own meaning, such that the letter A may signify a mountain peak, to some =
people or in a given context. the letter S evaluated as a snake. note how c=
hildren&#39;s books establish literacy in these same terms, where an image =
of an illustrated green snake with googly eyes will be in the shape of an &=
#39;S&#39;, though this extends into a realm of advanced cultural literacy =
as well<br>

<br>so there are lowercase and capital letters, which have their own dynami=
cs that could be evaluated. and while some concepts are single letter, such=
 as &#39;I&#39; that represents a first-person perspective of an observing =
self, most letters unless defined mathematic or scientific variables (a, c,=
 E, e, f, F, M, W, etc) are instead likely involved in &#39;boundary crossi=
ng&#39; via their sounds, into a realm of other signage they can still refe=
r to. for instance the letter &#39;b&#39; when sounded out equates with &#3=
9;be&#39; the two letter word, and &#39;bee&#39; the three letter word. thu=
s these dynamics could be mapped letter by letter likewise, in their discre=
te existence as isolated units, prior to visible or geometric connectivity =
though this hidden relation exists as a structure and likewise could and pr=
obably has been mapped out extensively<br>

<br>so moving from single letters of the alphabet into two letter combinati=
ons it is a realm of the ligature, where two letters can become one again b=
y their recombination, which involves a new character that replaces them<br=
>

<br>consider the idea that every word in this conveyance has adjacent lette=
rs with a hidden potential to be combined in a compact ligature format, suc=
h that a text could be reduced by a certain percentage yet still feasibly b=
e readable as the same text, only in a smaller space, and perhaps reading t=
he information would be more or less efficient, more or less detached from =
issues of signage and help or hinder consideration of underlying concepts i=
n terms of how this could effect pattern matching and interpretation<br>

<br>for example, a word like HEIGHT could potentially have a ligature for [=
HE] and [HT] such that [HE]IG[HT] would go from six characters to four. and=
 thus if still legible could compress or compact words and sentences this w=
ay. so for instance, the ligatures for AE and OE could example across the e=
ntire alphabet of two letter or more relations. <br>

<br>potential 2 letter ligatures // text version<br><a href=3D"https://www.=
dropbox.com/s/c1jhz61ddtvmzff/alphabet2.pdf" target=3D"_blank">https://www.=
dropbox.com/s/c1jhz61ddtvmzff/alphabet2.pdf</a><br><br>(note: graphic versi=
on attached for list archive)<br>

<br>consider that there is an array of 26 letters whereby A-Z, each letter =
is recombined with every other letter, which arrives at 676 combinations th=
at can be evaluated for potential ligature connections. it need not arrive =
out of Olde English or some historical context to be legitimate, or so it i=
s proposed that this technique has other applications than pronunciation or=
 cross-language word migrations. <br>

<br>thus looking at the table, the matrix can be navigated via X,Y coordina=
tes such that (1,1) would be AA and (5,8) would be HE for example. <br><br>=
the first pair of letters may be difficult to make a ligature of in some si=
tuations=C2=A0 due to issues of fonts and spacing with adjacent letters on =
either side, though imagine that software model could have multiple options=
 for how a ligature exists and is rendered, given its context, and thus a s=
ingle character perhaps somewhat like an M with a horizontal bar may in som=
e instance be legible as a double A ligature and thus if utilized could com=
press whatever word it appears in, if any.<br>

<br>(it should be noted that these two letters combinations are still not i=
n a full context of communicating language though could have a symbolic or =
other sign-based relevance, such as acronyms. and thus while not yet in a n=
ormal realm of language evaluation for long form communication, meaning can=
 be compacted into these two character letters, prior to evaluating them as=
 potential ligature candidates. for instance: GE in terms of mythology and =
also General Electric corporation, larger than many nation-states. that is =
a lot of concept in a two-letter compressed word. and thus another such con=
nected structuring exists in this realm of abbreviation and acronyms that c=
an be another structure to consider when mapping out such dynamics)<br>

<br>to return to the table, a second example of HE would easily combine acr=
oss the center horizontal and allow a shared edge between the two letters. =
and so evaluating candidates or approaches for ligature combinations involv=
es looking at their structure and considering geometric relations between t=
he graphic forms - which can be widely variable give existing fonts/type.<b=
r>

<br>thus, the preference for the 16 segment LED display that has segments t=
hat turn on and off for various parts of these letter structures, albeit no=
t to the degree needed for different fonts, though a matrix LED display cou=
ld. in other words, 16 segment displays are not chained together, do not sh=
are common edges between characters and thus do not allow such ligatures, y=
et demonstrate the need for a standardization of structure to enable common=
 geometric relations to exist, likewise. as if properties that vary given h=
ow they are approached.<br>

<br>it should be noted that typical software allowing ligatures appears to =
be a copy-paste scenario unless somehow macro-keyed. in that it is referenc=
ed, as if looking up a thesaurus or doing a key-combo, to access the specia=
l character, and that such translation of adjacent letters a and e (ae) do =
not automatically translate into the ligature &#39;=C3=A6&#39;. this is a v=
ital gap and involves usability issues as the approach or limits define the=
 interaction. <br>

<br>now what if a keyboard existed that had its own fonts and controlled th=
e output, such that it could take a text like this, and automatically when =
writing translate the variable letter combinations into a running ligature =
framework via real-time or post processing, thus compressing the data yet r=
etaining its readability. and what if reading consisted of interpreting suc=
h texts and where an anomaly may exist in legibility, the letters in the wo=
rd could be expanded to their full scale, removed from their ligature conne=
ction. further, beyond just 2 letters or 3 letters, what if entire words co=
uld be compacted down this way. <br>

<br>what this is to say is that the table above defines the 26x26 A-Z lette=
r combinations, and yet that is just one level of many. a word such as &#39=
;house&#39; could be evaluated in terms of ligature, here capitalized to re=
late it to the capital letter combinations...<br>

<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [H][O][U][S][E]<br><br><br>in terms of *po=
tential* ligature combinations, there could be two letter evaluation for ev=
ery adjacent pair: HO, OU, US, SE.=C2=A0 <br><br>each of these pair could h=
ave multiple potential versions, based on the optimal relation to adjacent =
other letters. in this way, a span across multiple ligatures could exist, s=
uch that [HO] and [OU] combine into a single fused 3 letter ligature, while=
 [US] and [SE] combine into another:<br>

<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [HOU][SE]<br><br><br>and thus, given varia=
bility, the letter &#39;U&#39; could tend towards a particle optimal state =
either to co-exist with the adjacent letter &#39;S&#39; or to attempt to co=
mbine with it in an optimal, balanced way, based on its legibility...<br>

<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [HO|U|SE]<br><br><br>this is to propose th=
at *superposition* of variables could occur in the word as a bit set, which=
 may seem meaningless.=C2=A0 though the language itself, the sign itself, w=
ould be calculating its own rendering as a sign, and not just a passive iss=
ue of someone tapping a key for letters H O U S E and having that be the re=
sult- instead, various modeling would be activated and word combinations wo=
uld be processed in real time in terms of ligatures and other structural da=
ta based on how the situation is modeled (which could go beyond visual stru=
cture, several examples mentioned earlier). <br>

<br>so this is to propose that any given word could potentially be mapped i=
nto and out of this interstructural connection, based on its unit of measur=
e as the letter as a combinable entity. it is not yet about cracking them o=
pen, yet it prepares the framework for doing so, by seeing how language wor=
ks in terms of communication techniques using existing software and equipme=
nt.<br>

<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [15,8|21|5,19]<br><br><br>thus, coordinate=
s can map into these ligature frameworks, and three value ligatures would h=
ave their own chart, which potentially would resolve many three letter word=
s or [signs] in terms of ligatures, and then potentially many four letter l=
igatures could exist, and massive data charts would be needed to chart thes=
e out, though it is entirely possible with computers.<br>

<br>now for instance if the original word used in the example (HOUSE) were =
to be evaluated differently, it would have different variability in terms o=
f how the sign is rendered...<br><br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [H][OU][S=
E]<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 <br>

in this case, the letter &#39;H&#39; is non-ligatured or combined with an a=
djacent letter, say due to readability issues, and the other two ligatures =
remain separate...<br><br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [8][21,15][5,19]<br>=
<br><br>note the letter &#39;H&#39; is the eighth letter in the alphabet, a=
s a single number input. now what if the [OU] and [SE] could were suddenly =
realized to exist in another chart of four letter ligatures, and thus the c=
oordinates for these two ligature resolutions were replaced by another matr=
ix value, here fictional, equaling<br>

<br><br>=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [H][OUSE]=C2=A0 ...=C2=A0=C2=A0 <br><br>=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 [8][3.2.122,0.299.9] <br><br><br>what this suggest=
s is that every letter and would could potentially be fragmented and reunit=
ed in a similar structural framework that operates well beyond ligatures, i=
nto an N-dimensional modeling of word and language relations in a computati=
onal context, whereby the [signs] themselves are not just inert static enti=
ties with no connection to truth, and instead could map into different vari=
abilities, ligatures or not, as a form or approach to reading/writing.<br>

<br><br>--- other potential views ---<br><br>thus, extrapolated into this o=
ther abstract variability and the issues of superposition, a text could be =
typed that automatically is transposed into another framework via its softw=
are, though this would need to be a model that is geometrically controlled,=
 within a particular non-arbitrary shared framework based on a common empir=
ical model that can be developed via many parallel interactions referencing=
 and improving upon the same rulesets.<br>

<br>in such a way, an interface could exist along with a physical or softwa=
re keyboard that could offer optional structuring or [sign] relations, such=
 that another approach could involve a non-ligature evaluation of all the a=
vailable ASCII letters A and other special characters in their graphic pote=
ntial, and having this be an option for typing a concrete-poetry-like messa=
ge akin to SMS abbreviation though into the signage, deepening the meaning,=
 not just compacting it, instead making it multivariate. such that a word o=
r short communication could convey a prose like awareness, and stand in and=
 of itself as a perspective, in place of a paragraph, for instance, due to =
its capacity and its depth of meaning. what are the parameters that could b=
e accessed, what are the existing limits of parameter sets that *break* upo=
n use or going beyond a given boundary, such as characters in email, or lim=
its within software, that instead could be made accessible and reliable in =
use, for such symbolic communication, as it may involve transformation of t=
ext or other approaches and issues, such as one-time pads or encryption per=
haps if a key infrastructure was involved and meaning was bounded by interp=
reter<br>

<br>another consideration is to alter the rules of evaluation, such that th=
e text could be flipped or twisted within ready-made software made for such=
 communications, or other such dynamics, like turning everything 90 degrees=
 that may reveal a hidden pattern or transform certain words and not others=
 or reveal a portal to gain access to another level of the text or to move =
through several as the data is rearranged via a given planned sequence. for=
 instance, what if the axis of left to right is reversed, right to left, fo=
r the display of information. such that [axis] is variable. or mirroring, o=
r other pattern dynamics, say structural substitutions or additions whether=
 graphic or phonetic or acronyms or whatnot. <br>

<br>in ways it may be reminiscent of invisible ink, even, if a strange text=
 were to arrive that may be formatted beyond a legible threshold due to unk=
nown or unknowable rules (if bit set permutations to subsign structures) an=
d thus a threshold condition existed requiring deciphering or decrypting or=
 translation of the text or abstracted data.<br>

<br>with no such key to unlock the cryptic patterning, an AI device could s=
earch for patterns in the existing structure, looking for clues, of which t=
here could be infinite many, given several approaches that appear likely. y=
et which one to investigate may not be determinable, and the number of choi=
ces could limit what kind of analyses are allowed, as if a barrier or bound=
ary, related to the way data is processed yet also truth modeled. in other =
words it is speculated that beyond a certain threshold it could be too diff=
icult to compute or analyze such formatted communications because they are =
equivalent to NOISE and display inherent structure that leads to automatic =
meaning that is multiple and spread out in different directions and thus th=
e originating perspective remains unknown, potentially even to a surveiller=
 who may observe its decryption yet still not be capable of comprehending i=
ts meaning, in terms of the information that is accessed, or where the mess=
age begins or ends, potentially, depending on the framework<br>

<br>if a receiver of the message did have the key to unlock the meaning, it=
 could potentially exist as if a CSS/XML layer or transparency that appears=
 over the original text, as if the word-correction underlining on word proc=
essor and text editors, though instead could highlight sections and referen=
ce particular models or approaches for this data, to evaluate its meaning i=
n terms of sign/symbol relations. thus, as if an additional layer of highli=
ghting upon an underlying page, the message could appear garbled or abstrac=
ted by default, yet with the translucent additional layer, various structur=
es or patterns could emerge, as if masking out some or revealing other data=
. this could also involve nested sets organized by different rules in combi=
nation with layers, such that /sequencing/ data in a particular step-by-ste=
p approach or ruleset, perhaps based on a private and-or shared public key,=
 could then open up or allow access to a hidden message nested within a lar=
ger ~variable context. what happens if you start to spin the third page of =
the fifth chapter of a given book, which may not be encoded this way, yet c=
ould reveal a hint or clue that then references what is on the page, recont=
extualizing it, creating a path via one-time pad that may disappear and be =
irrelevant both before and after yet not during that moment, when it is ins=
tead decisive and allows certain functioning in the given parameters. and y=
et what if the words cannot spin, the software does not exist or the concep=
ts are not realizable, what if the threshold is too high or the ideas too c=
ontroversial, such that it is made illegal to have such considerations or d=
evelop such tools as if *against culture*, in that the binary ideologues re=
alize the threat to their false perspective and grip on interpretation, the=
 inanity of SMS becoming deadly serious in its repercussions as the languag=
e is forked into an unreadable realm.<br>
