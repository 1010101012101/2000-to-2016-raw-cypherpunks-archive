I think my analogy is good.  I think your error is displayed by your
analogy.  In your example, both groups are astronomers.

In the current situation on this list, both groups are _not_ cypherpunks, if
you accept the definition of cypherpunks as "people who use encryption 
technology to make statism impossible."  If you don't accept that
definition, that's fine, but I think my definition is consistent with
the history of the list, and my guess is that Tim would agree.  And he's
the one who asked the question in the first place.  I think it's a good
question, and I'm curious to hear the answer from one of the folks it's
aimed at.

You left statists out of your list, unless you were including them when
you said "cranks" and "gun control nuts".  The original question was about
statists.

Some interesting people have left.  Other interesting people have
joined and are contributing.
