   Investing in anything with a non-intrinsic value, i.e., art, coins, antiques,
stocks, etc., is possibly worthwhile in good times, money can be made. The
collection can become almost worthless overnight, however, and even
life-threatening, say, should the situation become so dangerous that flight is
the best chance, but one can't bear to leave the fortune in antique furniture. A
collection of rare antique Colts might be quite pleasurable (and profitable) to
own, but cases of AK-47s hidden away in a remote bunker a better investment.
    If whatever you invest in depends upon a goodly supply of well-to-do buyers
to maintain it's worth, you could become destitute overnight. Or, as the
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers always said, "Dope will get you thru times of no
money better than money will get you thru times of no dope."
