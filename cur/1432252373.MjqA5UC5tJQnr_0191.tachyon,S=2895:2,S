Either Shockley or Jensen (I always get those two confused) came up with a
purely PHYSICAL IQ test the had a very high correlation with standard IQ
tests.  It involved a reaction speed test that had to do with pushing
buttons when lights flashed or some such.  It contained no possible cultural
bias, yet support the findings of standard tests in that it showed a
statistical difference in IQ between different racial groups.  (I.e., the
average scores for Asians was higher than that of Caucasians which was
higher than for Blacks.)  Predictably, the test was denounced by the
Politically Correct, but without any substantive critique of the test
itself.
