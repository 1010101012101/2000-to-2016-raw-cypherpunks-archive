Yes, Boeing is a partner, as is Kraevner a Norweigan company that supplied a refurbished semisubmersible drilling rig.  They use Russian Zenit rockets which are loaded on the platform in Long Beach then the launch platform and command and support ships move to equatorial waters for the launch.  And you're absolutely right, SeaLand can't support that sort of operation, nor does it provide an equatorial launch site.
