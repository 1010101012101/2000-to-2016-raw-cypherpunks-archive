Most U.S. Troops to Leave Saudi Arabia
PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia - In a major shift in American
focus in the Persian Gulf, the United States is all but ending its
military
presence in Saudi Arabia, abandoning this remote desert air base that
was
built in the 1990s and made the site of a high-tech air operations
center in
2001.

And the Minister of Fatherland Security shows his bravery:

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tom Rich planned a family vacation to Britain but
changed his mind after the deadly poison ricin turned up in a London
apartment during the arrest of terrorist suspects.

"I just don't think it's the right time to go," says Rich, of Duxbury,
Mass. "I don't think we'll do anything this summer."

                             Father and I went down to camp,
                                  Along with Colin Powell;
                               And there we saw the men and boys,
                                   As thick as oil most foul.

                                   Sheik Osama, keep it up,
                                    Sheik Osama dandy;
                                  Mind the music and the step,
                                  And with the planes be handy.

                                 There was Gen'l Tommy Franks
                                    Upon a slapping stallion,
                                   A-giving orders to his men,
                                   I guess there was a million.

                                 And then the feathers on his hat,
                                  They looked so' tarnal fin-a,
                                    I wanted pockily to get
                                    To give to my Jemima.

                                And then we saw a tomahawk,
                                    Large as a log of maple;
                                   Upon a deuced little cart,
                                    A load for father's cattle.

                                 And every time they shoot it off,
                                   It takes a horn of powder;
                                It makes a noise like father's gun,
                                     Only a nation louder.

                                  I went as nigh to one myself,
                                    As' Siah's underpinning;
                                  And father went as nigh agin,
                                 I thought the deuce was in him.

                                   We saw a little barrel, too,
                                 The heads were made of leather;
                               They knocked upon it with little clubs,
                                  And called the folks together.

                                And there they'd fife away like fun,
                                  And play on cornstalk fiddles,
                               And some had ribbons red as blood,
                                 All bound around their middles.

                                The rangers, too, would gallop up
                                   And fire right in our faces;
                                  It scared me almost to death
                                  To see them run such races.

                                Uncle Sam came there to change
                                Some noni  and some onions,
                                 For' lasses cake to carry home
                                 To give his wife and young ones.

                                    But I can't tell half I see
                                  They kept up such a smother;
                                So I took my hat off, made a bow,
                                And scampered home to mother.

                                  Cousin Rumsfeld grew so bold,
                                I thought he would have cocked it;
                                 It scared me so I streaked it off,
                                  And hung by father's pocket.

                                And there I saw a pumpkin shell,
                                   As big as mother's basin;
                                And every time they touched it off,
                                 They scampered like the nation.

                                   Sheik Osama, keep it up,
                                    Sheik Osama dandy;
                                  Mind the music and the step,
                                   And with the girls be handy
