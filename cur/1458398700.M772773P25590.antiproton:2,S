Marc Zwillinger, top tech lawyer for Apple in several cases, is an 
ex-DoJ top tech lawyer.

Several of the Apple and amici lawyers are ex-USG, a stepping onto 
the golden stone -- a la Snowden  Inc. -- to higher public service of 
just-us legally empowered spy-technoids rewards.

All sharks are dual-hatted officers of the court, government agents 
and spies, with privileged access to ex parte, sealed, classified, in 
camera, judge's chambers, bar associations, commissions, panels, 
perks-comped and liquid-and-teen-sex fueled retreats and sojourns 
(flyaways from top law perches to hottie climates), ghost-writing, 
talking-heads, media advisors, why, momma mia, jumping the sharks is 
the lawful spying profession's motto.

Engineers are not only dual-hatted, but verily Methusalaic with 
cascading, fast-changing head gear to fit the opportunities to 
engineer the fuck out of the public with godawful PR-slathered 
technology, science, math, human experiments, climate trashing, 
harmful environmental remediation, and, ah ha, literally 
grandmotherfucking encryption and cybersecurity not worth shit. 
Pardon our don't give a fuck for Job's protege >1% Tim Cook is so 
cocksure mouthing in chorus with his duplicitously greedy sharks, 
venal managerial engineers and advertising geniuses are glossing "on 
behalf of the public's right to privacy" (except from predatory USG, 
Apple and amici conspiring to keep secrets and sealings from the iYokels).
