Not necessarily.  A bad implementation of a block cipher will be
probably spotted quickly if you need it to interoperate with a good
implementation; a bad implementation of a public key cipher might
interoperate just fine with good implementations.  Public key systems
often have parameters or requirements that affect security without
affecting the correctness of encryption or decryption.  ElGamal
encryption might appear to work even though you are using a group where
the DDH assumption does not hold.  Elliptic curve systems have even more
parameters that need to be set correctly for security.

I am not saying that we should abandon public key cryptography, I am
just saying that there a number of ways for public key systems to go
wrong that do not apply to symmetric ciphers.

Just my 2 cents,
Ben
