Intelligence from DSBL indicated that there were _at least_ 350k
compromised machines in the USA Roadrunner network alone at one stage.

They are currently tracking around 1.5 million compromised machines.

The Swen and blaster worms install various spamware and backdoors. These
have been estimated to have infected millions of machines worldwide and
later versions removed characteristics which removed tellltale
compromise signs when scanned - now they mostly "phone home", instead of
listening for commands.

The pool of infected machines is huge. I just hope you're right about
the CPUs burning up - it doesn't happen when machines are running OGR
calculations, so I suspect that you just ran into a particularly badly
built example.
