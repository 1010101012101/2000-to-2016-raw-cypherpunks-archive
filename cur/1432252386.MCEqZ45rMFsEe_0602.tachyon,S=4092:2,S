You're on crack.  The anti-eavsdropping laws don't have 
exemptions for agents of foreign governments, the suggestion is 
absurd.

Except that it doesn't.  It's not a violation of US law for US agents 
to spy on people in Australia, but it's almost certainly a violation
of Australian law.  Similarly, it's probably not a violation of 
Australian law for Australian agents to eavsdrop on people in 
California, but it's clearly a violation of California law.
