While this is something that could be possible, it is unlikely to have 
actually occurred. In reality, there is some security in ensuring that 
there is only one opportunity for an adversary to compromise 
communication. If they miss that opportunity, the adversary's game is over.

So, unless either 1) you are already of particular interest to the NSA, 
or 2) the NSA makes a habit of performing MitM attacks on people who 
email their public key, this protocol is probably safe for you. Not 
"256-bit equivalent" (or even "40-bit equivalent") safe, but probably safe.
