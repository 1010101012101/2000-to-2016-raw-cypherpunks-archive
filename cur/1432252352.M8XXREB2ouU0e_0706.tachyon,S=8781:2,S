Well, actually, you haven't really stated anything. You just said "grar=
pamp,=20
you're wrong", without saying anything about in what manner he supposed=
ly is=20
wrong, and why you think he is wrong.

See, the problem is not that we disagree, the problem is that so far yo=
u=20
haven't really said anything. grarpamp stipulated that "X" works, or so=
 he has=20
heard, you said "nope" and neither of you offered any support.

I can find some support for grarpamp's stipulation in my own practice a=
nd=20
history, and while I appreciate your smirk cynicism, saying "read polit=
ical=20
theory" is simply not enough of an argument.

Not to mention, neither I nor grarpamp said anything on what is the exa=
ct=20
mechanism of how civil participation works. For instance, I would be th=
e first=20
to admit that it's not a silver bullet and I'm far from the na=EFve, id=
ealistic=20
view of "politicians really listen to what we write"; rather, usually, =
it's a=20
game of interests, and sometimes -- like during the ACTA crisis in EU -=
=2D=20
public involvement can be just the straw that's needed to change someth=
ing.

And your solution instead is what exactly? "Nah, sit on yer arse, nothi=
ng's=20
gonna change"? That sounds familiar:
http://rys.io/en/112

I am really curious as to what exactly is your reason to even write suc=
h e-
mails? If you know of a better solution, why not share? If there is no=20=

solution you can see, at all, why not get on with your life of bliss an=
d not-

this list can do even less!
