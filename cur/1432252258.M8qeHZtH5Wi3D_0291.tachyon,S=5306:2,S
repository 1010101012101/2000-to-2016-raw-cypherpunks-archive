Looks like it is the position of the Department of Justice of the United 
States of America that the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution conveys 
rights, as against potential Government powers to the contrary, for an 
Individual not in the military to keep and bear arms, albeit subject to 
reasonable regulation thereof.

The Justice Department's urging of continued prosecution of the men looks 
like DOJ views a blanket proscription of an individual's possessing or 
bearing a firearm to be a reasonable regulation of firearms.

Assuming that the current position of the DOJ is that it believes the 
Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess firearms, then 
if a municipality can prevail in requiring that only police officers may 
posses guns, and pass Constitutional muster, can that municipality prevail 
in requiring that only police officers may enjoy free speech? Or petition 
the Government for redress of grievances? Or refuse to testify against 
themselves? Why not?

Cases in which the United States Governmnent has found an individual's 
rights found in the United States Constitution essentially voidable by a 
city council are rare, I hope? Unusual? So pre-9/11?
