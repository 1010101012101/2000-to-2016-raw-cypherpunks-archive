of course, there is a cynical side of me which says...hey, let 'em legalize 
it.  i mean, come on...do you really think the law against assassinations 
has ever stopped them?  did you know that gullible is not even in the 
dictionary?  at least if they legalize it we won't have to listen to the 
news and KNOW that a patsy was shamelessly used by those in power.  we won't 
have to sit by and watch the government execute "justice" on those who have 
been used.
