Of course.

Unless you live in an apartment, and they have the permission of the
landlord...

Actually, in that case, could they not get the landlord to unlock the
apartment door for them, if "permission to enter" is granted in your
lease? What are the warrant requirements for this?

Having a garage attached to your house would be very convenient. I'm
thinking of the majority of cases where the citizen doesn't have a
convenient method of leaving his home without interacting with "visitors."

Several years ago, I would probably point out that such actions would be
likely to cause you more difficulty if and when you have to interact with
the feds. Knowing what I do now about such things, however, I'd fairly
certain there's little to lose.

Bollocks. The problem is that Happy Fun Court is never amused.
