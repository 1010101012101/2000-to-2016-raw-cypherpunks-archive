  Guys,

  Phil Zimmermann just called me from Romania; he's speaking there at
  Bucharest, and his schedule will also take him to Athens, Greece, in the
  next few days.

  Some of his potential investors were concerned that as he was requesting
  e-gold and PayPal donations, that his encrypted zfone project could be
  construed as "mickey mouse", so he has temporarily removed the e-gold
  and PayPal links from his site, until he evaluates the options.
  (Investors make the rules, right? LOL)

  For details on his latest zfone project, see
