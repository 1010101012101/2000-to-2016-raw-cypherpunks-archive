(AP) - Four Army wives at Fort Bragg have been killed over the past six
weeks,
allegedly by their husbands, prompting the Army to announce Friday it
will
re-evaluate the base's family counseling program. Two Fort Bragg
soldiers killed their
wives in murder-suicides, and two others were charged with murdering
their wives.
Three of the soldiers were from the Army's Special Operations and had
just returned
from Afghanistan; the fourth was from an airborne unit and had not been
sent into
action.
