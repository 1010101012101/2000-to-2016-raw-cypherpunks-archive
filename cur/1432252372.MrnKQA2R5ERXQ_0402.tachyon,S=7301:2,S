I'm disappointed but not surprised that the PeerPoint project is viewed 
with scorn by old-guard digital libertarians and anarchists. 

I am accused of being naive--they've seen everything and done everything 
and they have a superior, smug outlook. They argue that what works is more 
of what they are accustomed to.

But it is exactly that approach that resulted in the present state of 
affairs in which the internet is colonized and dominated by large corporate 
actors.

Anarchists and libertarians are the unwitting pawns of the powerful actors 
they mean to resist.

I've been around IT since long before the internet, since it was called 
data processing. Since before email and electronic bulletin boards and 
USENET. And I've been involved in every aspect of it since we operated 
mainframes with teletype terminals and punched tape right through until 
today. I was old guard once, very old guard. 

I've also been a political, social, and environmental activist since the 
sixties, witnessing the horrifying failure of almost all our movements from 
the inside.

But recently I woke up to the fact that it was on our watch--MY watch--that 
the world went to hell in a handbasket. My confederates and I all screwed 
up. We all get a big-assed #FAIL.

Einstein's definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and 
expecting different results. By that definition anybody who thinks that 
libertarian and anarchist business-as-usual is going to pull us through the 
crises and threats we now face is not just naive--they are burried inside a 
mystery wrapped in a conundrum, locked within an enigma. They are lost in 
space.

The threats to privacy, liberty, democracy, and equality have steadily 
grown despite all our BRILLIANT efforts up to now, so only a new strategy 
can be expected to reverse that trend.

That strategy is not a continued, exclusive reliance on slef-organizing, 
emergent systems. That by itself has not worked. We need to try something 
else. That something else might even be something that was tried in the 
past and discredited because it was impractical then. It might be 
large-scale collective organization and design.

In the past large-scale collective design failed because it was forced to 
adopt centralized, top-down planning and organization. Now we can do it in 
a much more distributed, horizontal, and agile manner.

It failed because it adopted organizational structures and created designs 
that were monolithic. Now we can do organizations and designs that are 
modular and composable. 

*Wikipedia: Composability* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability> is 
a system design <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_design> principle that 
deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable 
system provides recombinant components that can be selected and assembled 
in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements. In 
information systems, the essential features that make a component 
composable are that it be:

   - self-contained (modular<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming>): 
   it can be deployed independently - note that it may cooperate with other 
   components, but dependent components are replaceable
   - stateless <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_server>: it treats 
   each request as an independent transaction, unrelated to any previous 
   request. *Stateless* is just one technique; *managed state* and *
   transactional* systems can also be composable, but with greater 
   difficulty.

Finally, many past revolutions have failed or succeeded upon their access 
to technology. Somehow ignoring the story of "guns, germs, and steel" the 
old guard now wants to say that revolutions are not about tools or 
technology, they are just about people and social relations. They 
pontificate that technology doesn't make revolutions, people make 
revolutions. Tell that to an Afghan tribesman and see if he will discard 
his AK-47 or his satellite phone.

As I wrote in PeerPoint, I thought quite plainly and clearly, PeerPoint is 
a non-violent weapon of revolution.

Let those who don't think we need a revolution shut the hell up and get out 
of the way.
