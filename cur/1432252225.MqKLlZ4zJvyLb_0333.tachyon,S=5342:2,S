Hm.

No, I don't claim that meatspace identity is necessary, and I have read some
"smart contract" theory. (I was dealing with the diplomatic and licensure
peculiarities of my hypothetical, and agency theory, but that is a
discussion for elsewhere.)

Nevertheless,.... my hypothetical principals say that reputational system
accountability and escrow concepts alone are highly inadequate in the
proposed transactional environment. Because of the unique injuries which
could result, in certain circumstances any adequate remedy necessarily
involves unmasking the "bad infomerchant." Additionally, within this
"unique" transactional environment, participants must know that should
circumstances warrant, there is accountability beyond the reputational
system.

In regard to your Rabbi polycentric governance, I guess you could allow for
unmasking by the use of an anonymous (possibly elected by lot) tribunal,
allowing for the extreme situation where a participating info merchant could
be unmasked. Of course, identity could not be knowable/vulnerable to
discovery at any other time, or in any other circumstance. Nevermind how you
would do it, what do you call it? (I realize most of you would call it
stupid.) Identity escrow?
