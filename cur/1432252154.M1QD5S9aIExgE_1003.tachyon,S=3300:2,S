Network feed problem for lne.

My network provider has some flaky gear, but they don't
resrict what packets I send and when I call up
their tech support I get someone who's got a clue.

BTW now that winter is coming on, lne will get a little flakier-- we're
in a rural area and sometimes have power outages when trees fall on the
power lines.  I've got a generator but it takes some time to set up and
I don't like to run it at night.  For short outages I don't bother to
set it up, and when there is a long outage I'll run the generator during
the day only.

So what I'm saying here is don't worry if there's nothing from
the list for a few hours.

BTW, if you want to do a test, try sending an info request to majordomo@
the site you're testing.  That way you don't have to post to the whole
list.  Also, I leave the ICMP port to mail.lne.com open so you can try
pinging it to see if we're connected.
