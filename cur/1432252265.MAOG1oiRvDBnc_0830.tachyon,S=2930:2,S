1. yes, contract law always holds; however govt-backed (eminent-domain,
spectral allocation) based monopolies should be as open as possible (cf ATT
cable in SF)

2. no one has a 'right to income' only the terms of contracts

 The only(!!!) way that I can see building your own descrambler

Generally a bit provider requires that you have some
equiptment to make use of their bits, however you have no obligation to 
use their equiptment.  Bit provider = ISP | DVD producer.  
Equiptment = cable modem | DVD-licensed player
