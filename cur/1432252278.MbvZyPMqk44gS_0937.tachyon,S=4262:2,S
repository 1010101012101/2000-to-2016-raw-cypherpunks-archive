I'd add one more reason to yours, which is especially
relevant in the crypto world:

d)  Use of standard components.

If it costs nothing more to use Rijndael to encrypt all your
data than to use FEAL-8, then why not go ahead and use
Rijndael, which is widely available in crypto libraries and
such?  Okay, so your system doesn't even provide FEAL-8
level security, but there's no reason to go out of your way
to use a bad cipher, along with all the other problems,
right?  (I've often suspected that if all fielded encryption
in use today were replaced by FEAL-8X (FEAL-8 with 128-bit
keys), there would be virtually no impact on practical
security.  I think the best know attack requires 2^{25}
known plaintexts, which are almost never available in
practice.)

This is the situation that we would have if all-but-
unpickable locks cost exactly the same amount as the crappy
toy locks they usually sell with luggage.

I agree in principle, but in practice, some of these
measures are a lot easier to figure out than others.  Like,
it's easy to see determine that you're using a cipher with a
sufficiently long key and a good pedigree.  It's harder to
determine whether your PRNG always gets as much entropy as
it needs to generate unguessable keys.  It's still harder to
determine whether anyone your CA ever hires will be willing
to generate a few new keys that are supposed to be in your
hierarchy, and use them to run some kind of fraud on your
system.  Or that there are no software flaws that make it
easy to defeat the system, despite the use of first-rate
components.  Or....
