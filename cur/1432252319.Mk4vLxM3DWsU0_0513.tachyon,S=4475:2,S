Someone pointed me to some Usenet posts containing "encrypted gibberish".
Doing a deja search on the words "Alejandro transports" from this
post shows that there's thousands of these posted to all kinds of
Usenet newsgroups.  It looks like some sort of stego text system.
Judging from the words whoever wrote it knows cpunk issues ("PGP",
"mixmaster", "Blowfish", etc).

I think I have seen examples of this before, but I can't remember
where.  Does anyone know who or what generates it?


Here's an example:

Who will you insulate the solid bizarre tablets before Grover does?  Other 
sharp weak connectors will authenticate finally beside Usenets.  
Don't even try to cause the firewalls familiarly, create them 
stupidly.  It spools, you disconnect, yet Rose never monthly 
types for the quiche.  What did Lydia produce the package throughout the 
tall network?  Better get discs now or Samuel will strangely 
flow them for you.  My violent condor won't disrupt before I 
question it.  Try not to proliferate compleatly while you're 
excludeing alongside a disgusting CDROM.  Will you take against the 
node, if Ken superbly gives the newbie?  Who did Toni moan around all the 
engineers?  We can't stop printers unless Dolf will incredibly 
corrupt afterwards.  As quickly as Alejandro transports, you can 
defeat the UDP much more happily.  Otherwise the router in Walt's 
advertisement might obscure some offensive noises.  Well, Jimmie never 
bursts until Edward inflates the weird ROM freely.  What Carol's 
secure robot reloads, Karl generates at old, sticky /dev/nulls.  
Why will we interface after Alexandra annoys the wet highway's 
mixmaster?  The moronic dry ADSL manages administrators inside 
Dick's outer postmaster.  Go recycle a Pascal!  Dave wants to 
bind badly, unless Geoff kills Blowfishs throughout Ben's IPaddr.  
Occasionally Austin will persevere the investigator, and if Evan 
actually beats it too, the fraud will propagate throughout the 
soft underground.
