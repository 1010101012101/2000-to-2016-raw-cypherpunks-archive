Not that I am aware of, and if they did, I would by definition not trust
them.  I want my time-limited key to be some natural phenomenon that
cannot be recreated after it "dies", but which is "readable" (for keying)
and stable for a known time interval.

Is there radioactive material which has has a known property that can be
reliably and repetitively measured, that is useful as either a key or a
seed, and that is guaranteed to change on a known schedule in a
significant (i.e., keying data no longer relevant) way?

The idea being something like msg xor radioseed "keys" = plaintext, but
after 30 days, radioseed is different (and the original not knowable), and
therefore message is dead.
