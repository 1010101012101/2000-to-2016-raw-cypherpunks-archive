Declan McCullagh has been producing a one-sided series about a child
pornographer's supposedly unjust indictment,
http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,49132,00.html.  Of course
everything the pornographer says is taken as gospel, while the police
are filthy liars.  In fact they have gone so far as to plant child porn
onto the computer in order to gain a conviction, in McCullagh's twisted
narrative.  Missing from this tidy story is the cost-benefit analysis from
the part of the evil policeman.  He has supposedly committed a felony
that could lead to decades in prison, just to avoid the difficulty of
handing the computer back with an apology, which happens all the time
in police work.

The real issue for cypherpunks is of course whether there is any connection
between the child pornographer, Larry Benedict, and the local cypherpunk
pedophile who uses the pseudonym Eric Michael Cordian.  Is it possible
that Cordian and Benedict are one and the same?  And that Benedict would
use his cypherpunk connections as Cordian to get McCullagh to produce this
whitewash?  How else did McCullagh get drawn into the seedy world of child
pornography trading rings?

Enquiring minds want to know!
