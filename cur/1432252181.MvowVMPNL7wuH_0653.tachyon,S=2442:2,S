All depends on what you want. YYYY-MM-DD (or variations, including YYMMDD)
are good when there is a chance it could be needed to be sorted.

However, not all data are to be sorted. There are some applications where
friendliness to non-geeks is more important than sortability (eg, when
showing only one value anyway). Sometimes we have to sacrifice something
to the users to get them out of our hair.

The logs are usually intended to be human-readable. However, as long as it
is reasonably trivial to write a program to process the timestamps, it's
merely annoying.
