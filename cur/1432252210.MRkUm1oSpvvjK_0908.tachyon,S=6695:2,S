"Nowhere in Tim's spew is the recognition that the largest
beneficiaries of government favoritism are corporations and
wealthy individuals like himself, especially those associated with
the greeders of the defense industry, rather the national
security state."

Yes...that's the thing I don't fully get. If we assume that Mr May made a 
big chunk of $$$ at Intel, isn't it rather naive of him to assume that the 
same system that helped make Intel the global $$$-generator it is isn't the 
same system that keeps black folks quiescent and so on? I think it's 
doubtful that Intel could have become what it is in any other country in the 
world.

Add to that the fact that Mr May seems to lead a fairly bucolic life (from 
his accounts)...working in his gardens, installing tripwires and landmines 
and so forth, apparently without worrying about cash or physical needs. So 
this system has served him pretty well, insofar as there was a place for him 
to apply his skills in order to make his $$$. That system was payed for by 
somebody else's taxes, and now it's asking (well, demanding from) him for 
some $$$ that he apparently can easily afford.

This doesn't necessarily annhilate his "arguments" or main thesis, but in 
this light the call for the killing of millions so that he can afford a few 
more landmines seems perplexing.

As for the middle east and US foreign policy, I'd be more convinced if Mr 
May and others pointed to that as a main reason to stop paying taxes and 
back out of the system. In other words, that there may or may not be any 
'inherent' flaw to a fairly light form of "statism", but that it's defacto 
application (in the case of the US) is creating a seriously destabilized 
global political environment, while decreasingly serving (though a piss-poor 
education system) those that ought to benefit from taxes and spending. (This 
was why I became interested in "Crypto-Anarchy".)


Of course, I'll add the usual boiler-plate notion invoked by physicists, 
mathematicians, and hard-scientists almost universally, in their heart of 
hearts: Only mathematics and experimental physics (as a thought system or 
philisophy) are truly reliable and able to make definitive conclusions about 
the world...all other so-called systems of thought (including sociology, 
political 'science', economics and so on) are half-baked hodge podges at 
best. Therefore, any thought system that has as a corrollary "...and 40 
million negros should die..." should immediately be suspect of having been 
based on a foundation of non-mathematical muck, likely relating to penis 
envy and getting rejected by some hot black chick Mr May tried to date back 
in 1957 or whatever.
