I dunno...I'm thinking that optical tempest is probably bullshit 99% of the 
time, but what do I know? My Optical specialities are ultrafast and optical 
networking.

But I still don't believe that specular reflection of smallish type from a 
monitor will have anything that is recoverable. Of course, this is going to 
be dependent on the quality of the wall material, but for most not-so-even 
plaster/drywall painted surfaces, I just can't believe the appopriate 
spacial frequencies of the image are not scattered after that kind of 
reflection.

The conspiracy theorist is telling me there's some reason they floated the 
optical tempest story, though I can't quite figure out what that reason 
is...
