True but not for long. When AMD or Google buy out MIPS, there will
be a global monopoly on processors. I need to purchase a MIPS as
soon as possible! See: "AMD and Google in Race to Buy Out MIPS"

MIPS.html?cp=2

Tim Schmidt, I think the entire Ben Nanonote is manufactured in
China, not just the Ingenic JZ4720 processor. You are correct there
is not much documentation from Ingenic. Ingenic has not responded
to my two emails. The Qi forum is practically dead. No responses to
my posts.

There is another open hardware project I just read about today,
OpenHardware.org. I will check them out.

There are a few SoC without a visual processor serial number. Great
news: DreamPlug is one of them.

ARM Forum answered: "The ARM CPU itself doesn't have a unique
identifier, although someone building an SoC using an ARM CPU could
add one at the system level." http://forums.arm.com

Yuri at Freescale technical support, support@freescale.com,
answered that devices of i.MXS or i.MXL series do not have PSN.

On June 29, 2012, Globalscale Technologies answered my question
whether the DreamPlug has a visual PSN.
Sales@globalscaletechnologies.com wrote: "For our current
production, we do not burn device ID in OTP memory, this ID is not
visible to
the internet."

I just Globalscale whether DreamPlug has ARM FreeZone or out of
band monitoring.
