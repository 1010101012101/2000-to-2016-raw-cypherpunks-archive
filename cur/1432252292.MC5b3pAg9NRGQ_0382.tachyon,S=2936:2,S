Sometimes you don't have an effective choice. According to a friend, there
are still areas (especially rural) in the US where AOL is the virtually
only game in town.

There is an emerging potential problem linked to continuing privatization
of virtually everything, and - the most important - to consolidation of
owners. You can easily end up with the situation when everything around is
owned by one of a handful of Big Corps, all with virtually the same
restrictions, if the Market allows them that (eg, there will be enough
consumers that won't care, and the rest will be the commercially
uninteresting fringe). Then - tough luck.

Now this is an interesting question. Can AOL really sue the one who tells
their customers the truth about the drawbacks of AOL's service? Isn't the
existence of those drawbacks - including their refusal to correct them -
ultimately THEIR OWN fault?
