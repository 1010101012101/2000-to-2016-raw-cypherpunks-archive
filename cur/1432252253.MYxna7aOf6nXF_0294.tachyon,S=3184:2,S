Material Contribution

 o FastTrack [XEROX] creates and licenses software primarily used for
the reproduction
   and distribution of copyrighted works.

 o FastTrack [ADOBE] created and controls encryption that ensures that
the network
   remains closed and insulated from outside monitoring.

 o [YAHOO] Provides a dynamic list of available supernodes where content
can be
   exchanged (possibly through the .38 server).

 o [YAHOO/GOOGLE] Continually updates the list of available supernodes
and communicates that
   information to users (likely through the .34 server).

 o [YAHOO] FastTrack, MusicCity and Grockster maintain log-in servers.
