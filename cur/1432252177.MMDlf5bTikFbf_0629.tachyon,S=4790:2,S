Secret nerve gas project
By COLIN JAMES
31dec01
AUSTRALIAN defence scientists conducted top-secret experiments with nerve 
gas during the British atomic tests in the 1950s, classified documents show.
The chemical warfare program included Maralinga, where investigations were 
undertaken on the contamination of water supplies by nerve gas and nuclear 
explosions.
Documents also show Australian scientists closely monitored a US project in 
which human volunteers were used to test a pill to treat the effects of 
radiation.
The US scientists earlier developed a kit they claimed would make water 
contaminated with radiation safe for drinking within 15 minutes.
The top-secret memorandums reveal the Australian Army wanted scientists to 
investigate how water supplies could be decontaminated during nuclear and 
chemical warfare.
Nuclear test veterans seeking compensation said yesterday the documents 
raised new questions about the nature of the British nuclear tests in 
Australia.
Long-term campaigner Avon Hudson, of Balaklava in South Australia, said the 
documents proved the tests went beyond the explosion of nuclear devices at 
Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands off Western Australia.
"These documents are the only ones we have ever seen which show that 
chemical warfare was part of the whole program," he said.
"This has never come out before and the question has to be asked about what 
else they (the British and Australian governments) have been hiding for all 
these years.
"There must be other files somewhere which would reveal exactly what was 
going on in terms of chemical and biological warfare, but where they are 
now is anybody's guess."
The memorandums issued from the Defence Standards Laboratories detail how 
the Victorian facility began experiments with nerve gas in 1957, with 
further work on the decontamination of water supplies beginning in 1959.
One document says the nerve gas experiments were overseen by a Dr J. 
Tregellas-Williams, whose "initial work is being concentrated on a study of 
the hydrolysis of nerve gas GB at various PH".
The memorandum says scientist Dr P.W. Bowe began work on the contamination 
of water supplies by nerve gas and nuclear devices in May, 1959. He had 
"discussions with various army personnel and has visited Maralinga" to 
"gain an appreciation of the problem".END.
