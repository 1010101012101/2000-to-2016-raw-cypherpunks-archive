You have 2 options here,
Option 1 -  You can put ANY text you want in here.  
            
Option 2 -  We will fill it in with the text only portion of the 
            html message if you put the macro Have baby ? or preparing Get a 1 year supply of absolutely free diapers , =
jhonson baby kit and plenty of other stuff from our ngo check out now   =

            in here.  

            NOTE: Some email clients don't disply html data.  In that case what you
            put here will be seen by the recipient.  If the email client does             
            display html data then this will NOT be seen by the recipient.   
            Based on this you may wish to put a text version of your add here; 
            however, you can also put some macros here to make the message 
            more random.
