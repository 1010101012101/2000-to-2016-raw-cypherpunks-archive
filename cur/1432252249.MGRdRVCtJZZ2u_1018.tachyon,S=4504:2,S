We run a private Tor-based network.  Email Steve (sms@) or I for questions.

What we have contemplated is operating the exit nodes, and mixing into the public Tor network for either the middle or both middle and entry nodes.  You could select high bandwidth middle-nodes for this, which would give you reasonably high performance, yet you would have 1-2-or more public nodes in between the user and the exit node.  This would provide increased anonymity, while preserving performance and security of the exit nodes (protecting against mal-nodes).

The thought was also to select those middle nodes based on measured performance.

Thoughts?

DJ

If you limit yourself to a small set of nodes, you
will definitely compromise your anonymity against a powerful attacker. But
what if you're not worried about a powerful attacker, or serious anonymity?
What if you just want a casual observer to think you're using Tor, and leave
it at that?

You could run two relays on each node you control. One relay would be part
of the public tor network, and limit the bandwidth to a (large) fraction of
what you have available. One relay would be part of your private tor network
and use the rest of the available bandwidth. You'd have to bootstrap your
tor network from scratch, and set up an authority, and so on. Then you could
run your local tor client on your private network, and have a small set of
fast nodes available to you. A casual observer at either end (you-hop1 or
hop3-internet) would see the traffic from/to a tor node, and assume that it
was truly torified. Depending what you personally think the threat profile
is - and I'd suggest reading some of the research to find out what threats
to consider - you might want to use an entry point or exit node on the
regular network, or do other circuit manipulation.

Note that trying to take advantage of your own resources inevitably limits
your anonymity potential. Customizing your network also means that you won't
benefit as much, or at all, from upgrades to Tor. However, if all you want
is casually anonymous browsing at high speed, this may be useful to you.
Nonetheless, I make no guarantees that the system you set up will be
sufficiently anonymous for you.
