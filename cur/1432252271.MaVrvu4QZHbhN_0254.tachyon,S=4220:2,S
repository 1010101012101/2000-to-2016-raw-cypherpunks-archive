As I said in an earlier posting, doing the software right is
not easy.  It is the upper edge of what can be done by the
lone enthusiast, and he has to be both enthusiastic -- (it is
a big project) and also pretty good.  There are lots of
moving parts, and they have to connect together in a way that
is handy and usable for the end user.

The controls on the flow of money have been tightening.  Ten
years ago the patents were the big problem.  Now the
"abusive" uses of digital money are a far more serious
problem.  With the patent close to running out, and the war
on terrorism being used for war on movement of money, war on
drugs, war on movement of people, patents are now a problem
scarcely worth thinking about.
