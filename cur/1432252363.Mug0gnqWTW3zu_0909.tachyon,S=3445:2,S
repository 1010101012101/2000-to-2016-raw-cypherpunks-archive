Never assume your opponent is a fool, even if they are. Always try to make
your opponent think you are.

They are not stupid. They are motivated and believe in what they are
doing. These are the kinds of people that believe you made a mistake and
they're willing to spend whatever it takes to find it. [1]

If you want to understand a system, follow the money.

[1] A recent rapist was caught here in Austin after years of work simply
    because he spit on the sidewalk in public and was under surveillance.
    They grabbed a sample of the spit and matched it to evidence at a
    previous rape.
