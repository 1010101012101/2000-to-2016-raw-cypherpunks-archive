Jackson, who probably is not still alive, would laugh uproariously at 
Choate's notion that a photon which strikes/scatters off of a surface 
loses some of its energy through some kind of ohmic dissipation of 
energy in the target.

See my other article, a few minutes earlier than this one.

This "drs" character has apparently learned in his kolletch classes 
that saying "You're both wrong" is the path toward harmony.

Fucking twit.
