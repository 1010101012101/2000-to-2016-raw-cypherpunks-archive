Ive gone on record at indymedia when the tampa facescan story broke that I 
suspect the whole star wars thing is about placing lasers next to the 
hi-res optics (a la 'patriot games',remember the shot looking down on 
cleavage from outer space?) The laser will be able to fry individual 
citizen-units.What else would they waste all that money on?If they want to 
shoot down rougue ICBMs ,then they could scale up the new aussi gun that 
was featured in wired recently.As im cherrypicking the archives I came 
across jims likening of Dotty to the wicked witch of the west,peter F 
macDoran might be her latest flying monkee.
