The importance of having a large number of remailer users is made even
greater by this system. While it might be easy for a TLA to monitor all
network traffic and compile a list of all remailer users, having a bank
make that list for them in an easily subpoena-able form saves them some
work.

Not to say that you should not implement hashcash in remailers, but is it
really necessary that these two features be linked? Thinking about this
further, could you not implement the tracking system using random
client-generated tokens that the user generated, the remailer published,
and were meaningless to anyone else?

One problem with this sort of system that springs to mind immediately is
the need for user assurance that the tracking tokens are not being used as
a covert channel.
