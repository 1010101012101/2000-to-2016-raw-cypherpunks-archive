Time is running out before the Electoral College meets.
This link

http://www.votewithamerica.com/

contains email lists of the Electors, a form for sending email to them, a phone contact list, etc.  Perhaps people can be persuaded to contact the Electors and encourage them to vote the popular count and circumvent the hijacking of the Florida vote.
