The DNS has redundancy designed into it; there is no real advantage to
having a disjoint set of servers for the two domains. You may as well
have the widest possible set of servers for both.

That doesn't seem right; traceroutes to both servers indicate that
they are likely topologically distant. One appears to be around
Washington, DC, and the other somewhere on the west coast.
