Now James, you've been hanging around libertarians enough to know that 
their extreme notion of freedom includes property rights which involve the 
right to exclude anyone without a pre-existing contract right to use or be 
on the property.  Thus a stadium owner excluding lesbians or a lesbian bar 
excluding men are both perfect examples of liberty.

To hold otherwise would mean that property didn't exist.  I want the right 
to exclude anyone from my property (government agents for example).
