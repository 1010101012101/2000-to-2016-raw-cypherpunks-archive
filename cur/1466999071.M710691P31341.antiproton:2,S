I shouldn't have to. That's what community standards of decent behavior
are for. That's what moderation is for.

As part of the community, it is your call. A simple "no, I consider this
unacceptable" would have sufficed.

That's a complete non-solution, as it means I lose all of the quality
messages along with the crap. It is throwing the proverbial baby out
with the bathwater.

Standing up for someone's right to pollute the list with messages that,
in all honesty, contribute nothing to civil discussion, is bad enough.
Your suggestion that I unsubscribe is many times worse than that.

Maybe circa 2003-2006 or so, it used to not be like this. At least, I
don't remember it being anywhere near this bad, even when there was the
occasional flaming going on. I've never seen someone spew one attack
after another after another.

Getting banned from a mailing list, in general, should serve as a
warning that one's conduct is unacceptable. If this describes you,
recently, please heed that warning.
