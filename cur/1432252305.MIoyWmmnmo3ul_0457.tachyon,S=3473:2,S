I think a reasonable "quartering troops" (Third) case could be made, 
as requiring a government box to be quartered on one's property is 
certainly exactly what the Founders were worried about when they 
included the Third.

Generally, I hope CALEA/Carnivore gets challenged all the way to the 
Supreme Court.

Requiring someone to have a government machine on their property, 
recording _all_ traffic, is fully comparable to a requirement that 
t.v. cameras or microphones be permanently installed on private 
property. Violates the Fourth, for sure, and probably the Third, and 
possibly the First, and perhaps others parts of the Constitution.

I want Bush to become President so I can see at least a few years of 
another party in power before going ahead and advocating that they 
ALL be killed and that Weapons of Mass Destruction be used to 
eliminate the nest of vipers on the Potomac.
