And importantly, _suspicion_ is not enough for conviction or even search 
warrants. (In most cases.)


Remember that when the Church of Scientology got the Finnish courts to 
force Julf to reveal the nym that was bothering the Church, the trail 
led back to a conventional CP remailer at C2Net, which kept no records. 
The trail went ice cold there.

We can all get paranoid and say that our use of remailers puts us into 
the "Group Under Suspicion," but, as James says, even the existing 
network of remailers does a good job of killing traceability.
