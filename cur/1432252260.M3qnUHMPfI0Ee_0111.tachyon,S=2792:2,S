Ex-MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson's book, "The Big Breach:
>From Top Secret To Maximum Security," is available for
order on a Russian Web site:

   http://www.thebigbreach.com

Tomlinson has been hounded by MI6 for several years, 
after being jailed for allegedly revealing official secrets,
rather than embarrassing cockups and criminal acts which
his book describes.

Tomlinson was then booted from a half dozen countries 
where he sought refuge by the spook mafia -- including
the US. A major push is on in the UK to prevent his book 
appearing there by honking Official Secrets skyfall.

MI6 is yelping that the publisher of the book is a firm set 
by Russian spooks. Checkov the site design.
