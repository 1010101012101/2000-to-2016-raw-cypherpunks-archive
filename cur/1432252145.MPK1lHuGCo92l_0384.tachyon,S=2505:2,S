Do you filter on the same header that you build the white-list from?

Ie I forge all of my mail, it's really coming from ABack@ex.ac.uk; but
I want replies to adam@cypherspace.org.

I've encountered other "subscribers only" situations where my mail
gets bounced because they look too deeply at the headers and see the
received line or Sender so something is ABack@ex.ac.uk and block it
even though the From line is adam@cypherspace.org, and I subscribed as
adam@cypherspace.org
