I just talked to Morales in la.

His relative was murdered.

Bullet through the heart.

Morales is from a totally different culture than I am.

We talked about his.  Morales said he is entering the anglo culture.

What is fun about this is me entering the hispanic culture.  BE
CAREFUL.  DON'T PISS THEM OFF!

So we are on the legal attack.
