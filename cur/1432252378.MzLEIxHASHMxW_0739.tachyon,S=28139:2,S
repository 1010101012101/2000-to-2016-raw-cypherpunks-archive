bethany you are obviously NOT a journalist... its called exploitation

i dont remember the images of the baby at hiroshima or the girl burned
naked running in vietnam having the journalists fat head in the frame

guess who gets their picture took with dead bodies? smiling american
soldiers have in afghanistan and nazi's - i am sure you can look those
images up for yourself i wont be a party to it

just because you dont understand ethics doesnt mean they dont exist

being filmed with dead bodies is absolutely a breech of journalistic ethics

++++++++++++++++++

thanks alexis for your analysis of tor i heartily agree with your
conclusion

look into a blow up of @emptywheel had regarding her protections of @pierre
when the whole ukranian thing was revealed she has to do a lot of dancing
to dodge the bullets coming her way ...

when i get time later i will look it up for you

      definitely proven capability of adversaries.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 I really can&#39;t help thinking this is a deliberat=
e desire
      of keeping Tor at government&#39;s reach because the eternal argument
      they oppose do not stand. They say that randomized wait times at
      each relay would make the traffic too slow. But I remember using
      Tor 8 years ago when it took forever to load a Web page, and still
      did I use it in spite of this major extra effort, because
      anonymous surfing was such a blast.<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 Today the network is fast enough to be able to swap =
25%
      speed for a massive increase of anonymity.<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 The other solution, randomized length of packets wit=
h
      dummy padding discarded at each relay would impact even less on
      responsiveness.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 I honestly can&#39;t see why they legitimately refus=
e to
      implement this.<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 They seem to think that the need to observe both end=
s is
      too hard. Did they hear about the BGP routing attack that targeted
      Iceland? Funny how the Silk Road server was found a month later
      in... Oh shit, Iceland.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 When you claim to protect activists with government
      money, you&#39;d better not show dubious intentions if people trust
      are what you depend on. Because that&#39;s why Tor was opened at
      first. The government officials needed to hide among civilian
      traffic. They do need the people to run nodes.<br>

      &gt; Please be a little more critical and back up for claims
