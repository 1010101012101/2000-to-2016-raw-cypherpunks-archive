"""
The team also added some DNA segments to the genome to serve as
"watermarks," allowing scientists to distinguish the synthetic genome
from the natural one.

That raises new possibilities of using microbes as a method of
communication. Dr. Venter said the watermarks contain coded messages.
Sleuths will have to determine the amino acid sequence coded for by
the watermarks, in order to decipher the message. "It's a fun thing
that has a practical application," he said.
