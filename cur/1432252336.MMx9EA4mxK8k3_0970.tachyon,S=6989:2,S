It'd be hard to hide an insertion if the devs all dig into the hashes of commits of their own local repos and compare, right? Even a broken hash would require changing input, so they could go an extra step and verify each commit using another hash algo, if they were feeling super-paranoid.

I'm still on the fence: this is the kind of error C is infamous for after all.
