Ok, you can say that, but I said I really wanted you to speak to the
president. I'm probably not the best source about e-gold compared
to the guy who invented it, after all, and he's really most concerned
about a terribly-misleading headline (which finally was changed as
the lawyer began to send nastygrams) and not really what I say, 
especially about this case, since it's about another company, but I 
can't hide that I think that this is outrageous. 

You could have had our Bill Gates and got me (yech!) but the good
news is that this likely isn't the end of the Gold-Age story, so you'll
probably have another chance to talk to him if you keep covering it,
but the story there isn't even e-gold, it's credit card fraud committed
(IMO -- personal opinion) by someone besides Parker Bradley.
