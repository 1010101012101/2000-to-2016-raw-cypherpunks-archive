Priorities at the moment seem to be 'the base' and any 
taliban/women/children that get in the way.
Then saddam,Then yassar,Then muammar,Then Iran if they so much as 
blink,Then all the ELF folks they can dragnet
with all their new surv powers.This has already started in long island with 
a teenage activist charged with terrorism.
So cypherpunks are low down there with nazi militias,etc...Your well 
surveilled now,most of you in shock and low low rating threats.Best case 
scenario;.If the superpowers war machine gets chewed up like the last one 
did.C/punks with spunk get an offshore AP website up and softdrill any ugly 
mother that raises its ugly head.All things should be considered now down 
to flint knives.all the best from your cyberterrorist mate matthew Taylor.
