	Well, I would reply "right back at you" =)

	Sorry, what you just said is absurd =) 

	http://www.dictionary.com/browse/absurd?s=t
	"utterly or obviously senseless, illogical, or untrue"

	Now, joking aside, I don't think you get to redefine words at
	will. That is not the meaning of 'absurd'. See above.

	The question is valid and not absurd. And the answer is,
	there's no square root for -1.

	So if you then make up a different number system(two
	dimensional), you can define some 'numbers'(actually points in a
	plane) to be the 'square root' of 'negative' numbers, but it's a
	matter of convention. Still, there are no absurdities in sight.

	Fine. So your assertion that 'dice are actually played' is just
	an unproven assertion. The party line of the statistical
	mechanics establishment.

	Yes, exactly. It cuts both ways.

	Yes, but I don't know what it refers to, exactly. However, I do
	know that mathematical abstractions and physical reality are
	different things despite the fact that maths is used to
	partially describe aspects of reality. 

	Anyway, let's say it can be infinite.

	That may be true in general, but I don't think it's valid here.
	What I'm getting at is, whether *in principle* information can
	be transmitted. 

	The either is a working setup that can at least transmit 1 bit,
	or not. It doesn't matter if at the moment you can't stream HD
	video...

	Thanks for the hint. I already knew the story of the danish

	How do you know it is at all possible? The only way for you to

	I'm pretty sure schroedinger's cat happens to be a **reductio
	ad absurdum** though I admit I never looked into the original
	soource 

	 Schrödinger, Erwin (November 1935). "Die gegenwärtige
	 Situation in der Quantenmechanik" 

	Does any body have a copy? 

	At any rate : 

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum

	if you assume bullshit at 'microscopic' level then you end up
	with bullshit at 'macroscopic' level.  If you start with a
	certain premise and you end up with an ABSURD conclusion then
	you know the premise is false. Basic logic. 		

	There are no dead-and-live cats, and so it follows there's no
	'magical' bullshit at microscopic level either.
