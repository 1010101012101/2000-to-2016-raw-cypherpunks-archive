Actually, he won (and it was against a steam drill, not a nailer).  He
just died from the exertion.

  "And they told the results to captain Tommy. Captain Tommy said,
  'I'll be, mmm mmm mmm. Listen here folks. John Henry and the
  machine. The machine made eleven feet, four inches, the men
  shoulder's sagged. John Henry made fourteen feet, seven inches. The
  men whooped and hollered and Captain Tommy went over to congratulate
  John Henry. But John Henry didn't see his outstretched hand. John
  Henry fell over in the dust. John Henry had hammered on the
  mountain, and his hammer was strike and fire but he drove so hard
  that he broke his poor heart, that he laid down his hammer and he
  died."
