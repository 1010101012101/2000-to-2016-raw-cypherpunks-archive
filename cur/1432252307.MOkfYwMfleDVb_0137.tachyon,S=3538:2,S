Maybe his use of Mapquest and other commonly available tools to 
identify those CIA safe houses in Oregon are the issue. As with the 
"Ilegal to Possess Hacking or Reverse Engineering Tools" laws, 
perhaps Mapquest is now on the contraband list.

Or maybe John Young's spook father-in-law has finally decided that 
enough is enough and that it's time to crack down on all of these 
liberty-spouting radicals.

In any case, which of us will be next?
