Your boss tells you not to do something and you do it anyway, and then get 
fired? Maybe your boss was stupid, but sheesh, this isn't the same thing as 
getting tortured, your family imprisoned and raped, and executed.

to start a flamewar. Keep it up and you'll be the third candidate for my 
killfile! :)
