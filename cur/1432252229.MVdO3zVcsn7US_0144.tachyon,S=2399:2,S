Amazon's official statement,
	http://aws.amazon.com/message/65348/
claims that the DDOS wasn't an issue.

	"
        There have also been reports that it was prompted by
        massive DDOS attacks. That too is inaccurate. There were
        indeed large-scale DDOS attacks, but they were successfully
        defended against.
	"

Of course, they're also claiming that the gubmint had nothing to do with
the takedown, so salt to taste.

Relatedly, Wikileaks is asking for mirrors:

Of course, you can also help by seeding the relevant torrents.
