BERLIN (Reuters) - Organizers of a Web site launched on
     Tuesday aimed at offering tips on how to combat racist and neo-Nazi
violence in
     Germany said it had attracted hundreds of visitors within hours of
going live.
...
The site, www.verfassungsschutzgegenrechtsextremismus.de, was launched
     following huge public demand for information on Germany's far-right
problem and
     how to combat it, Hesse said.


1. Gotta love those german urls...
2. This url contains the substring "sex" and I bet some
censored folks won't be able to get to it... in addition the site
contains 'hate words' if the url slipped through..
