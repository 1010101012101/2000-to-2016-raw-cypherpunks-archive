                        Thieves using stolen windshield toll
                        transponders have charged about $4,000
                        worth of food at McDonald's, where the
                        devices have been accepted as debit cards
                        since April 2000, according to a
                        Transportation Corridor Agencies
                        spokeswoman.

                        The transponders, which operate with a radio
                        signal that credits tolls--and now
                        cheeseburgers--to motorists' accounts,
                        allows users to skip toll plazas. The agency
                        receives 20 cents each time a McDonald's
                        purchase is made with a FasTrak.

                        Spokeswoman Clare Climaco said people
                        should treat a transponder like a credit or
                        debit card. "They should take it out of their
                        windshield and put it in a glove compartment or
purse when they're not
                        using it," she said.
