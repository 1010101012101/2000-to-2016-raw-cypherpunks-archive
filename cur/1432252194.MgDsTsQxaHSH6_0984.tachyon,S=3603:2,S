Our resident snitch and shill has this to say...

 >>... this to say about our Resident
Author: "Timothy May, who is perhaps best
known for his ranting posts ...<<
Extract:
Our resident author? Whats this "our" whiteman! Tim may be rsa approved and 
good for Bidnoz,but he is an author like the shrub is a president.He has 
thrown together some stuff like the cyphernomencon,eons ago that is a mile 
wide and a fraction of an inch thick.He writes the odd good review or put 
down or blast or even joke,but AUTHOR!? PLEASE.He may join the list of 
thinnest books of the world one day but I fear he's getting senile.How many 
dud predictions can you make in one forum? How many times can you bitch 
about your Home State for over 5 years and not just MOVE? And how many 
times can you call for the nuclear destruction of the innocent majority of 
a terminally corrupt city? Also how often can you call for an untested pipe 
dream of "anarcho-capitalism"? And duck debate on proven 
anarcho-syndicalist alternatives? How often can you repel minorities,steal 
and distort ideas,twist the meaning of concepts 180' while collecting arms 
and laying in supplies like Kurt Saxon? Lastly how long can you stem the 
slide of the terminally egocentric into a west coast Bill White?

Tim?
