   You would find it illuminating to acquaint yourself with the Judy
Barri case. The FBI was conducting actual pipe-bomb making classes
for the local police, including setting them off in a nearby quarry.
This was just prior to the bombing of Judy's car. Interesting too
that they were on the scene within minutes of the explosion, to
arrest Judy and Darryl for bombing themselves. There's a current
suit in fed court about it -- look it up. The guy who was head of
COINTELPRO was involved in this.
