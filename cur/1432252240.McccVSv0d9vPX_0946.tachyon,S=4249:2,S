Have to reply to this - the outcome of this is great...

Flantastic! What possible reason could the FBI have come up with (and I 
would love to see a copy of the request for MonkeyBrain's database) for 
obtaining such confidential data, even if/especially when illegally 
obtained in the first place... The only disheartening side of this is 
that 99% of the people who *should* be querying that list won't ever 
hear of it... Ah yes, the media loves to report the gory stuff, yet 
seems all too ready to ignore the /useful/ bits...

Of course, if report mails form the virus were sent to another 
dozen-and-a-half addresses too, what's the FBI doing about *those* 
accounts? Did Yahoo et al. just hand over the data as requested? I find 
it hard to believe that the FBI chased up just one avenue...

Furthermore, under the second phase of the UK Data Protection Act 
[http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/], if the forthcoming Hague Convention 
on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters
[http://www.hcch.net/e/workprog/jdgm.html] were to come into force, 
would I be allowed to ask the Feds for my account details if I lost them?...
