These are engineering problems, and I'll handwave the term "distributed"
for now.

When I wrote "truly anonymous" I meant those systems where no one's
ass is endangered.  If there's an ass to fry its not anonymous.

Sure, it would be entirely limited by cost, as is everything traded in such a
future. I think the argument is that anyone who pissed off a lot of people
would be culled more quickly than others, and civil servants tend to be in
that category.

For instance, an obnoxious neighbor offends a dozen people.  A politician
who passes laws restricting freedom offends many orders of magnitude more.
Assassination won't get cheaper because the detection hazards remain in an
AP future.

They go into politics, which Mr. Bell has addressed.

Nice Gibson effect there.  

There's a bit of a problem with obvious motive, that mass-offenders don't
present.  In fact, since AP says that everyone will have 'means'
and 'opportunity' the only barrier is sufficient motivation.  One could
fear that motivation alone might be enough to convict in future courts.

You know, a number of Intel engineers die, and AMD execs are
nearly-automatically jailed.

Still, AP is an observation about what is possible.  It doesn't have
to be pleasant.

You could say the same about gunpowder or Napster... or any tech
whose components appear in the memepool at the same time.. yielding ideas
which *will* be used, *orthogonal* to whether they are *good* or *fair*..

>Just because you can do something, does not mean that you should.

Alfred Nobel spent the rest of his life getting over his guilt about
stabilizing nitro. He shouldn't have.  Realizing that something is possible
--or even advocating it-- is not the same as doing wrong with it.  WRT AP,
assasination is obviously a good thing at times.
