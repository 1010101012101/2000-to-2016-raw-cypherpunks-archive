Sell these meatmeisters on 'digital bearer bonds,' and we are home and hosed.

"Adult stopped being a dirty little secret and became part and parcel of 
the entertainment mainstream when Frank Sinatra unspooled Deep Throat 
(starring Linda Lovelace and Harry Reems) for Vice President Agnew at 
Sinatra's residence, Johnny Carson joked about the film on The Tonight Show 
in the early '70s, and reporters Woodward and Bernstein dubbed their 
informant "Deep Throat."

Fuck me dead,has it been that long? Well dog my cats!
