I'm not a lawyer, but my guess is that, unless there is a very compelling
argument from expert witness which "proves" to the judge or jury that
the emails in a particular case are forged, emails would be accepted in
pretty much any (US) court.  I beleive that's how written evidence is
treated now, even though handwriting and signatures can be forged.  If a
handwriting expert is brought in and "proves" that there's a forgery, the
evidence is thrown out or the judge or jury disregard it as appropriate.

In this regard, security experts will be the handwriting experts of
the future.

(Greg, have there been any cases where email evidence has been shown
in a court to be forged?  Has this even been attempted, other than
Bell's case?)
