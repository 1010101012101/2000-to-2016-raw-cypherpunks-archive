First, much thanks to  Howie Goodell for his reply.
 (Note that printing stuff on transparencies was proposed
(by Shamir?) some time ago, perhaps for quorum-required info.)

Yeah, so?  I've voted from home for a decade.  Nothing stops me from
showing Vinny (Vinny the votebuyer, he's Eve's cousin on Mallory's side)

my ballot before I mail it.  Or registering my cat to vote.  They are
illegal,
and detectable, that suffices.  [Note to furriners: in the US you don't
need
"ID" to register or to vote, just a signature, and for that an X
suffices.]

Although I *do* agree with you --resistance to votebuying is a desirable
feature
if you can have it.  (Insert cellphone-with-camera-in-voting-booth
discussion here.)

(And yes, voting at home is succeptible to spousal coercion.  Better
than queueing
up with the sheeple!  Which is also a form of *meteorological* coercion,
folks
don't go out in crappy weather.  Also snipers and bombs, in places with
that kind
of weather, will deter centralized voting.)

That's a good idea.   I don't think Chaum's transparency-printing scheme

does this.

Its also possible to write-in candidates for elections you don't care
about
as "tracers" to make sure your ballot (albeit not other votes in the
same
bundle) made it.  I voted for Monica Lewinsky a few times that way.

Too expensive.

Well, lotteries are evil in my book, but they certainly do inspire the
innumerate sheeple.
I doubt it would work unless the "prizes" were huge --I only get DoS'ed
by queues at 7-11s
when the prizes orders of magnitude larger than 1e6.

Have a hollywood actor run.  Or have recalls every year.  Worked in
Calif!

On the other hand, perhaps it should be made harder to vote.  Democracy
is mob rule, after all.  Testing citizens on the Bill of Rights would be
a good start.
