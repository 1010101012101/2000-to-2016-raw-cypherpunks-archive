History is littered with people who did remarkable things only to abuse the
trust people placed in them to do horrible things. Writing some cool ECC
crypto code does not preclude you from criticism when you show yourself to
be someone who fantasizes about killing people. (Just look at all the
creative ways he killed off people in the last thread! There was way too
much imagination involved to be channeling anyone.)

James already proved himself a racist earlier in the discussion when he
mentioned that he could only find "a number of black felons who should have
been killed off long ago" while googling a person's name. "Black" was, of
course, completely irrelevant, but he nevertheless found it important to
add.

If you're puzzled as to why he acts this way, his website might shine a
little light on the issue: http://jim.com/.

Clearly, the best solution is to ignore him. But let's not try to excuse
what could best be described as the musings of a bitter old man because he
wrote some code a decade ago.
