The phone SW world is nowhere near as closed as you think. 

* Thousands of developers are writing Java applets for Japanese iMode
phones. 
* Hundreds are developing applets for the Blackberry 5810 and 5820 phones 
  (free Java-based IDS from RIM). 
* Similarly, the high end Pocket PC and Palm phones both have free or
inexpensive 
  development environments (C/C++)
* Finally, Qualcomm phones support BREW (free SDK, expensive training).

My take on the situation is that the platform vendors are so anxious to get 
developer mindshare, and new apps, that they are for the most part giving
away the development environments and specs.
