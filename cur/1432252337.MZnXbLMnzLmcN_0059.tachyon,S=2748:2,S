Steve Gibson: MS WMF is a  Backdoor, Not a Coding Mistake

 Those of you using Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP will want to follow
this story:  Steve Gibson has examined  WMF  and he now believes it
was  deliberately coded.   It looks to him that Microsoft put a
backdoor into Windows, which can be triggered even if Active X is
turned off and security is at high.
