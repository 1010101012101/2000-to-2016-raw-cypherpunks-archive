Moore's law has unfortunately recently ran into financial scaling limits,
which are slowing doubling times (estimate from 18 months to three years
at the moment) with physical scaling limits close to follow (somewhen
shortly below 5 nm).

Of course current ASICs are far removed from cutting edge. Another
issue is blockchain storage (NOR flash is also pretty finished, HDD
area density has stalled recently, but might resume scaling, at least
for a while) and availability of network bandwidth. You can buy 10 Gbit/s
close to the backbone, but it's beyond affordability for most people.
