In the UK, do they enforced front-plate requirements a lot?
How do they track them Irish otherwise?

Police Catch Drivers Without Front Plate


  Traffic police caught 202 drivers without front license plates on
 their cars Tuesday at a San Fernando Valley intersection, authorities
said.
The Los Angeles Police Department conducted the three-hour check
because too many people without front license plates were getting away
with running red lights, said Sgt. Dale Turner of the LAPD's Valley
Traffic Division.

                                                        Cameras mounted
at intersections to catch red-light violators are
                                                   designed to take
photographs of a car's front license plate and the
                                                   driver's face, but up
to 25% of violators caught on film are whizzing
                                                   away unticketed
because the front plate is missing, Turner said.
                                                        "The fine is
under $20," Turner said. "A lot of people I'm sure feel
                                                   that they'd rather
pay the fine than put a license plate on and get a $271
                                                   [red-light violation]
ticket."
