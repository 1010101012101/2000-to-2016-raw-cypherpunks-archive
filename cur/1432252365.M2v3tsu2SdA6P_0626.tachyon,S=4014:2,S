Interesting. Something I came up with may be relevant -

http://gawth.com/bram/essays/unrelated_xors.html

I explained this to Ian Goldberg, who agreed that both conjectures are
completely obvious, and also couldn't see a way of proving them.

If anyone could forward this around I'd much appreciate it - it seems like
worthwile work, but I haven't figured out how to even try to get it
published anywhere - even the front outright ignores submissions from
people with no academic affiliation.
