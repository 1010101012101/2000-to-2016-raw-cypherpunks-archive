Often true, but new technologies can necessitate new interpretations of 
laws which were not written well enough to translate smoothly to the newest 
"flavour or the week" technology.

>What exactly is it that you think is new about the Internet, legally speaking?

I would have thought that new interpretations of things like federal and 
state jurisdictions would be needed. Given the arguments over the recent 
decision on Yahoo from France, I'd say there are questions to be answered. 
Is a company under your jurisdiction as soon as you can see its servers? 
Are ISPs carriers, or providers? What about their webservers, which store 
and provide, as opposed to simply carrying?

Tell me if I'm wildly off base - I don't mind, but it seems to me that at 
the moment, these issues are not obvious and written in stone.

Actually, I stand corrected - it's no more than your average technical 
training course (Sun, etc). Given that it's something I'd have to pay for, 
instead of my employer, it seemed expensive. Things always look more 
affordable when you can get your manager to sign them off.
