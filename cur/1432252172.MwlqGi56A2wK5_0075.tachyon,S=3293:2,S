There is a tiny bit of room for negotiations. You could agree to do the
interview on condition that they read you back the quotes (or email you
back the quotes) that they're going to use in the article.

Note I'm not saying you should give interviews to the press -- none
of my business, really -- but there is a way to do it and avoid being
misquoted.

Or people could contact me for tcmay "quotes" and I could respond
with a digitially signed tmcay@got.net 'quote'...
