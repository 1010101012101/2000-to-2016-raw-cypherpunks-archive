Fortunately the public key can be stored using steganography, or on some
medium that can be physically destroyed, or whatever.  Another option would
be to use an elliptic curve scheme that generates the private key on the
fly from a passphrase.  Fortunately they can't read your mind yet, though
keystroke readers could prove you knew the passphrase, but then again you
might claim that since the cops (and anyone else reading your keystrokes)
also knew the passphrase, that they had your private key as much as you
did.  And then there are ways to avoid having your keystrokes read.
