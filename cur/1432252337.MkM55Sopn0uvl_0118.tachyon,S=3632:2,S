The dual-use feature of information is a given. Information
system designers and operators play a dual role in every
field from religion to education to government to FOI to
security and to law, the latter two in particular.

Open source has always been dual-use, and the usage of
the term is a sure sign of duplicity, indeed in most cases
asymmetrically so. The DNI is one of the few who has admitted
that is how spy agencies use the term, but looking at other
uses it seems clear that it is a cloak for deception to a greater
or lesser degree, primarily to get information swapping going
in a particular direction to favor the initiator.

Early adopters commonly promise high ROI then gradually
shift to less return and more profits as confidence in the
product grows and the opportunity for exploiting that
confidence attracts shrewder investors. Vulture capitalists,
as if there are any other kind, are especially adept at this.

Informants, insiders, administrators, judges, arbiters, trusted
grammarians, language police, third parties, confessors, lovers, 
teenagers luring Breibarts to smear congresscritters, bitcoiners, 
digital moneymakers, security do-gooders and evildoers,  and 
skeptics of all these, is there any question of their pervasive 
dual-usage to tip the rewards toward themselves? Put them
on a pinhead to see them bleat.

This is not about the major religions and governments only, 
but any initiative to induce confidence in one belief and 
suspicion about others. Without that duality there would
no pro- and anti-thinkers and tinkerers always working in 
cahoots as if an irrefutable scientific proof of the absence
of god. They too two-dance pinheadedly.

Informing is ordinary behavior, and its takes little inducement
to open source the spigot. Mild disagreement will usually work.
Even better is dinging the tip jar.
