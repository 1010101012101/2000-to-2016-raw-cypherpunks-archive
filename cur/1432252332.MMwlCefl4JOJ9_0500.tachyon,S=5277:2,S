Standard libraries for encoding, compression, and encryption have
existed for decades. In addition to plain text or block data, stego
and a diversity of other encoding methods exist. JS, ecmascript,
javascript, flash, as3-5, swf, all have standard libraries available
for most if not all functions.

Unless everyone has been killed again, it is impossible to claim that
noone can produce a tutorial to explain general encodings and
operational demonstration in any diversity of easily accessible
methods.

Additional to bouncy-castle or gnu libs, there are varieties of
functions and state machine with validation for every standard
encoding method.

HTML5 includes typed arrays in addition to html standard text boxes or
canvas, there are public tools to package JS w/ html into phone apps
in addition to http access.

There is need to explain the reasons for the efficiency and
effectiveness of certain functions, and the general concepts of
multiple factors, nested encoding or wrapping, and use of multiple
disparate routes for both raw data and encoding data.

Any idiot can fabricate a wrapper function in html5 javascript using
standard published libraries in a matter of minutes.

Please someone provide an educational demonstration of the viability
and efficiency of all combinations of encoding which includes all
functions for public demonstration. Text boxes with javascript were
common over a decade ago before Y2K, where are they now?

All this situation really needs is the standard libraries to be
packaged with a wrapper function and placed on an appropriate publicly
accessible server with the demonstrations and access instructions. One
should note diversities of data transport methods, including visual
image, audio and video encoding via air, especially for private factor
based encoding methods.

Who can bother with 5 minutes to save the poor little world and teach
them to save themselves?
