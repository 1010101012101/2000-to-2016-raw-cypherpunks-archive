The New Rulers of the World <br>
John Pilger <br>
$19/=A310 Verso <br>
ASSUMING US propaganda is accurate, President George W. Bush is intending
to bomb Iraq as part of his war on terrorism. If you want to know just
how big a mistake that would be, read John Pilger's latest tour de
force.<br>
Iraq's 22 million people are already the victims of a 12-year
&quot;medieval blockade&quot; imposed by the US and British governments,
argues the campaigning journalist. The UN Children's Fund says that these
sanctions are the main reason why up to 6000 Iraqi children die every
month.<br>
And the justification put about by US intelligence for an attack on Iraq
is a myth: there is no evidence that it has any weapons of mass
destruction. According to Scott Ritter, a former UN weapons inspector in
Iraq, the threat the country poses is &quot;zero&quot;.<br>
Pilger also condemns the US bombing of Afghanistan, which one study said
killed 3800 civilians between 7 October and 10 December last year. The

The amount of time that corpses are hung out in public, for example, has
reduced from four days to 15 minutes.<br>
As well as essays on Iraq and Afghanistan, <i>The New Rulers of the
World</i> includes writing based on Pilger's TV documentaries about
corporate power carving up Indonesia and the apartheid suffered by
Aborigines in Australia. They are all empirical, angry and
well-referenced; they illustrate his essential argument that the imperial
power wielded by rich states and multinational corporations, led by the
US, is far more destructive than any terrorist organisation.<br>
