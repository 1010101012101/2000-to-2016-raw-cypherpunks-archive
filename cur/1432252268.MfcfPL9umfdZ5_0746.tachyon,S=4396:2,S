Any time you post to a list of a bunch of people you don't know,
you might be posting to a list of a bunch of people you don't like.
Reading the archives sometimes helps.

It's certainly likely to clarify whether everybody on the list
agrees with everybody else on everything, unless you think that
the arguments here are robo-generated to make it _look_ like
we're not all really just different tentacles of Tim May,
the Medusa of Crime.  (Or was Tim really a tentacle of Eric?
At this point I've forgotten :-)
