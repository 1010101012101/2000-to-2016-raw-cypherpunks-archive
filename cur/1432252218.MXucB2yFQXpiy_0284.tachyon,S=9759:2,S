in 2001 - when i think the whitepaper was presented in 2008 - he says he
was working on developing something else at that time

i think you are right - i know from dealing with ppl who have signed

he may have been referencing that instead

journalist can be totally fraudulent for sure but others in the article
seemed to blab a lot - people are strange theres like a switch that gets
turned on when they talk to interviewers a =B4stupid switch=B4
