There are already carriers doing SS7 over IP via gateways.  Over the public
Internet is not a stretch from a technical standpoint but, in practice,=20
I'd find it hard to believe too many LECs or IXCs going this route.  Private
IP networks, yes already in production even.  The public IP network, nobody=
=20
serious is doing it.  Wait, well, if you just mean VoIP there are VoIP=20
companies that are attempting things like this by partnering with regional=
=20
and local ISPs to place voice gateways.  If you're talking governmental=20
moves, there are easier ways.  The SS7 network isn't exactly encrypted..=20

How does this improve eavesdropping?  SS7 is only signaling.  There is no
voice payload on the SS7 network.  SS7 simply passes signaling information
around.  Perhaps the knowledge of calling and called party since those
digits are passed via SS7 but the converstation is entirely distinct.
