Bear in mind that we could probably find plenty of victims of the Bush 
administration who would be willing to provide this variety of justice to 
America's dictator and a couple dozen of his closest Neocon advisors.

Invading a country, and then turning its leader over to his political 
enemies for a quick show trial and execution, while singing the "tried by 
his own people" propaganda tune, hardly qualifies as justice.
