So there can't be any metal objects between it and the sky.  That means
it's unlikely for it to be on the underside of the car.  Possible installation
places would be under the "skin" above the dashboard, any place that has
line of sight to the windshield or back window.  If the car is a vinyl top,
under the roof would be good hiding place.

Of course the main body of the "bug" can be hidden anywhere inside the car, but
the antena needs to see sky.

These things are usually cellphone enabled, so that way they don't constantly
transmit, and won't be easily caught by sweeps.

Defenses would include GPS and cell phone jammers, but these would have to
be on 24/7, thus draining the car's battery.  GPS jammer would be more
desireable, since the cell phone side is just used to download the logs
of where the car has been, and the logs can be recovered by physically
recovering the bug.

One thing I don't know about in relation to GPS: are the military bits
sent on different frequencies than the civilian bits?  Or are they just
encrypted?  If they're different frequencies, then, you'd have to know
these to build an effective jammer.

I of course have no information on what was actually installed in Jim
Bell's car, where, how, or by whom, except as emails have described
here, and I take this with a grain of salt.
