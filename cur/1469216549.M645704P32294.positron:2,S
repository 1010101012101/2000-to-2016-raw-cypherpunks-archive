It's an android app (and Windows/OS X/Linux), the successor to Xbmc. it's actually really fucking impressive, after you've installed the right 3rd party plugins.

None of the Amazon shit really comes into it, besides paying $40 for something that probably cost $50 to manufacture.

Actually, people were building raspberry pi Kodi boxes (and surely still are) before this super cheap and simple solution arrived.
