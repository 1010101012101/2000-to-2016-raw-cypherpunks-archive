That's because Real Americans don't drink tea - 
we have electric coffeemakers.  The Mr. Coffee machine got
most people to switch over from percolators to drip-filter coffee, 
though some people still drink (yecch!) instant coffee.
Other than tea and instant soups or similar things, 
most foods that require boiling water involve cooking them in pots,
which you do on the stovetop.
