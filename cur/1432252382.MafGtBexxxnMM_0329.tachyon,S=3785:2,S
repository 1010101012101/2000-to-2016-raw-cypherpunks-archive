US Patent 4759063 "Blind Signature Systems" will expire on July 19,
2005. Given that this is a Tuesday and taking into account that whoever
may own the patents at that time is not about to file a patent
infringement suit on Monday, the last day the patent is valid, I hereby
announce a patent expiration party at my place on Saturday, July 16
2005.

The day will come,
--Lucky
