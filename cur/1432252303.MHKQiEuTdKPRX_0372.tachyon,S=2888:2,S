Good Morning! 

I am Barry Nixon, Executive Director, The National Institute for the 
Prevention of Workplace Violence and am creating a workplace violence 
superstore on line with the intent to have a wide array of workplace violence 
prevention products for sale.  Your video series would be an excellent 
addition to the online superstore so could you  please send me information 
about the steps necessary to make this happen.

I can be contacted via email at WBNixon@AOL.com, telephone at 949-770-5264 
and fax 949-597-0977.
