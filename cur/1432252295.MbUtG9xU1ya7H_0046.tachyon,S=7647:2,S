Eschew grandiloquence.

You'll need to translate this into straightforward English, please.

What you were "looking for" is irrelevant to what I wrote about. You 
can try hiring me as your personal consultant, at my usual daily 
rate, and I will try to put something together that is closer to what 
you're "looking for."

In any case, the straightforward moving of credit ratings to a place 
where the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other such statist measures 
cannot reach is a much, much better example of the regulatory 
arbitrage issues of interest here than some nebulous "open source 
intelligence" project such as Robert Steele and OSS have been 
advocating. More power to him if he pulls off something interesting 
and important, but so far it is smoke and mirrors and vague claims.

"I wonder, I wonder, I wonder..."

Do some background reading, think about the issues, and actually 
begin participating in a meaningful way in the debate and then maybe 
you won't appear to be such an airhead.

English, please. Or at least Ebonics.

I never claimed it was a cure-all. None of us has. It's part of an 
overall approach, outlook, worldview.

As for it being "necessary for a highly sensitive information 
marketplace," it depends. No doubt within the CIA it is not needed, 
though the equivalent of cash is still used (CPU hours allottable to 
various users, signatures to gain access to data, etc.)

As for outsiders, imagine buying "sensitive information" without 
untraceable cash...whoops, it's a sting, and the Saudi Royal Guard is 
on its way. Or Jeff Gordon is about to raid your house.

You seem not to have thought about these issues. You need to do some 
reading before you make a fool of yourself further.

I can't understand your writing. I'd normally say "So sue me," except 
lawyers like you typically try this.

* P L O N K *, again, and this time, I expect for good.

People who can't write clearly and yet who use such language as you 
use above do not deserve to be taken seriously.

I thought I'd seen it all. At least now I can "Aimee" to the 
pantheon: Detweiler, Vulis, Cohen, Toto, and Aimee.
