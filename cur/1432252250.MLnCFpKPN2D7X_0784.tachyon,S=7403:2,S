I recall a few years back, a single satellite lost stability, and it pretty 
much wiped out everyone's pagers, for
a few days. Just my way of saying that I don't have any clue as to how much 
point-to-point traffic may get
relayed by a bird at some point. I seem to recall that, years ago, the 
Transatlantic copper traffic entering and
leaving the US was shot via microwave link to/from the US terminus, over a 
bay, and allegedly there was a NSA
farmhouse on the line-of-site path of the link. The implication being that, 
yes, they "could" have just wired
around the bay, but instead there was an intentional opportunity for 
interception.

And I'll point out that long-haul comms to submarines are done with RF 
basically at audio frequencies, via
buried antennas....yeah, they DO use very high power, but aircraft are 
close and don't have salt-water and
thick earth to penetrate.

And if any of the copper is carrying digital data, square waves are hugely 
rich in harmonics well up into the
MHz bands, and would therefore tend to radiate better from any above-ground 
wires between poles, possibly
even roadside pedestals.

And I've seen alot of RF off of traditional CATV coax; don't know if 
fiber-optic cable systems might ultimately
have any tie-in to the coaxial feed to/from the headend.
