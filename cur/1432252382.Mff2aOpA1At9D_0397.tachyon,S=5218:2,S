People do break cyphers, by finding weaknesses in them. Are you saying
that you think that current cyphers are unbreakable?

Also, what about using biological systems to create strong cyphers,
not to break them?

It seems that all of these analyses assume that an instruction is a
single mathematical operation in a turing machine. What if each
operation was something else? I refuse to believe that the human mind
is just a turing machine.
