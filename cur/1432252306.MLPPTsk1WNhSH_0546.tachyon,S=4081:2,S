I'm not surprised that the Russian government is seemingly oblivious. 
Unless some crisis crosses a threshold to "infamy," like the arrest 
of Wen Ho Lee or the kid accused of being a spy in Russia, it's just 
"business as usual."

(Though I was struck by how close the arrest of the "Russian hacker" 
was to the plot line of "Swordfish," where a Finnish hacker (who just 
happens to be named Torvalds) is arrested when he deplanes at LAX. 
Now if the Adobe hacker turns up dead and a microchip has been cut 
out of his arm, we'll know we're in a John Travolta movie.)


Finally, it may be that the Russians just don't care. More arrests by 
the U.S. authorities means more chance of shaking down the Russian 
software industry for protection money. "You don't pay us, look what 
happens to you, comrade!"
