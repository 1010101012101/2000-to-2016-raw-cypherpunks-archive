Hi Declan,

I know you're aware of the case of Curley v. NAMBLA, which has very
serious First Amendment implications. Jeffrey Curley was a 10-year-old
who was murdered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in October of 1997. The
parents are alleging that the murderers were driven by NAMBLA literature
in general and specifically by the contents of NAMBLA's web site. After
the suit was filed in May of this year, the current NAMBLA web site was
taken down.

Frisoli, the Curley lawyer, has been making very outrageous and false
statements about what was on the web site. Because the media has no
access to the site, no one can contradict him. A vicious media war is
now being waged against the ACLU and other free-expression advocates for
defending freedom of expression in this case. Few reporters seem even
interested in finding out the contents of NAMBLA literature or the
contents of the web site as of 10/97. But even if a fair-minded reporter
did have this interest, he or she would be out of luck. Printed material
from NAMBLA is difficult to find. Members of NAMBLA will speak to the
press only under conditions of strict anonymity because they fear for
their lives. And the web site is not accessible.

I am not a NAMBLA member, but I believe that the First Amendment applies
to them. I have obtained the web files as of 10/97. I don't wish to put
them up myself for a variety of reasons. First of all, my ISP might make
me take them down. Also, I am involved in another case which I don't
want tarred with the NAMBLA brush. There is no court injunction against
the publication of the materials. But a site outside the US might be
best in any case.

Anyway, if you can help me find someone to take the files and put them
up, please let me know.
