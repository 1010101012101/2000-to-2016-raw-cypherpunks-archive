...in cahoots with the "authorities"?

In other words, lets say I leave my house for an extended period of time, 
and "they" tell the Alarm Monitoring company to shut down for a while so 
they can protect our freedoms. (I assume this is the way they would go about 
installing various things in one's house while away...wrong?)

How can I tell if my alarm has been "down" for a period of time, assuming I 
don't believe the records of the alarm company in such cases?
