what happens if you say that you are not good at drawing and end up drawing
wire-frames of the descriptions asked. it may also be true that the person is
no good at drawing.

you can say 'speak' and with a good probability the person can speak. the same
doesn't hold true when you say 'draw'. people who are bad at drawing doesn't
have much clue as to put visualizations on 2D. I definitely suspect that they
will get distances, angles or ratio's right when they attempt to put it on
2D.

Cheers,
Sarad.
