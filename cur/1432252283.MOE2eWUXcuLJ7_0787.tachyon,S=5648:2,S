You have received this e-mail because our records indicate that you
are a registered user of www.nbci.com.  The purpose of this e-mail
is to provide you with an update about upcoming changes.

A. In the coming days, the NBCi site will have a new look.  We hope
   you like the updated styling and the increased NBC content.

B. In conjunction with the launch of the new design, the following
   services will be discontinued:
-       NBC TV Clubs
-       The NBCi Stock Portfolio (but please check out the one
        offered on www.CNBC.com)

C.  We expect to provide personalization features on the new site.
    However, while we update our system, your current NBCi member
    name and password will not work.  We expect to have the system
    updated in the coming weeks.  If you would like to use the
    personalization features right away, then you can sign up for a
    new member name and password . If you would like to continue
    using your current member name and password, then please try to
    sign in a few weeks after the new design launches.
    
NOTE:  Your existing member name and password will continue to work 
       for your e-mail account, even during the transition period. 
       To access your e-mail account, you may use links on the NBCi 
       site OR go directly to www.email.com and sign in.

   responses to e-mails will no longer be provided.  To submit
   feedback about NBC Television shows, please send an e-mail to:

And here are a few quick reminders from previous e-mails:

   e-mail account, you may use links on the NBCi site OR go directly
   to www.email.com and sign in.

   mail.com (a separate company) directly  support@email.com
