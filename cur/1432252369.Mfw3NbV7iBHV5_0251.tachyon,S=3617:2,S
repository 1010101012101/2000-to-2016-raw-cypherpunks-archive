Of course, if someone can modify your private keyring, I'd suspect your
TCB is toast.  (Unless you're in the habit of shipping your private keyring
around the Internet.)

For the interested, this is my guess at the attack.

Modify the encrypted value of p, somewhere near the middle.
When decrypted, depending on the chaining mode, it's possible that
only a couple of blocks of p will be mangled, and the remainder
of the private key file will decrypt successfully.  Here's where
PGP fails to do a MAC to verify integrity of the data.

Then, it behaves just like DFA (Differential Fault Analysis).
The idea is that to calculate a signature M^d mod n, we calculate
M^d mod p and M^d mod q, and use the CRT to combine them to S = M^d mod n.

If p is wrong, the result S' will be correct mod q but incorrect mod p.
so S' ^ e mod q = M mod q, but S' ^ e mod p != M mod p.

Therefore GCD(S' ^ e mod n, M) = q, and we're done.
