>Who is to blame for hurricanes?

	"God", but so far he seems rather judgement proof.

>Haiti, for not stopping them before they reach Florida?

>Who is to blame for a bee flying into your mouth while you are driving?
>(which, if you've never had it happen, leads quickly to a car crash)

	If you are driving with your head out the window, you are.

	And yes, I know someone who had something similar happen 
(wasn't a bee), and he all but crashed.

A quote from Petro's Archives:   **********************************************
Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government 
of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? 
Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let 
history answer this question. -- Thomas Jefferson, 1st Inaugural
