This nosebleed is the world's first electronically-guided catoroach.
The catoroach, surgically implanted with a micro-robotic backpack that 
allows researchers to control its movements, is known as Robo-roach, whose 
implications "for mankind could be immense", said Isao Shimoyama, an 
assistant proffr heading the university's bio-robot research team.
Within a few years, predicted Dr Shimoyama, similarly controlled insects 
will be carrying mini-cameras or other sensory devices to be used for a 
variety of sensitive missions - like crawling through earthquake rubble to 
search for victims or slipping under doors on espionage.

Jim Bell editorial from the Baltimore City Paper
No doubt about it, Jim Bell disliked the government. As far as this 
Vancouver, Wash., resident was concerned, there isn't any problem with 
Congress that $60 worth of bullets couldn't solve. And he let his opinion 
be known in newsgroups, mailing lists, and, perhaps most notoriously, 
through an essay he wrote and promoted on the Internet called 
"Assassination Politics".
But did Bell-who, federal authorities discovered, had an arsenal of deadly 
chemicals and firearms and the home addresses of more than 100 government 
workers-have a plan to murder public employees?
"What was interesting is that the whole case was based on whether he'd be 
harmful in the future. He hadn't actually hurt anyone, but he was talking 
about some scary stuff," John Branton, a reporter who covered the Bell case 
for the southern Washington newspaper The Columbian (The Jim Bell Story), 
told me by phone.
On Dec. 12, Bell, 39, was sentenced to 11 months in prison and three years 
of supervised probation after pleading guilty to using false Social 
Security numbers and setting a stink bomb off at a local Internal Revenue 
Service office. But authorities acknowledge those charges weren't what his 
arrest was really about.
"We chose not to wait until he followed through on what we believe were 
plans to assassinate government employees," Jeffrey Gordon, an IRS 
inspector, told the Portland, Ore., daily The Oregonian. Gordon likened 
Bell to convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and Unabomber 
suspect Theodore Kaczynski. The federal government's court filing against 
Bell stated the belief that the defendant had a plan to "overthrow the U.S. 
government." Proof of his motivation, the government asserted, was found in 
Bell's Internet writings: "Bell has spelled out parts of his overall plan 
in his 'Assassination Politics' essay."
Bell wasn't lacking for firepower. On April 1, 20 armed federal agents 
raided Bell's home, where he lived with his parents. According to U.S. News 
& World Report ("Terrorism's Next Wave") the feds found three semiautomatic 
assault rifles; a handgun; a copy of the book The Terrorist's Handbook; the 
home addresses of more than 100 government workers; and a garage full of 
potentially deadly chemicals. Authorities had long known that Bell was a 
spokesperson for a local libertarian militia and was involved in a 
so-called "common-law court" that planned "trials" of IRS employees.
Given what the feds found at the house, in retrospect the raid seems 
prudent-as Leroy Loiselle of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told 
U.S. News, "You don't need nitric acid to keep aphids off your flowers." 
It's easy to forget the troubling fact that the government's initial reason 
for raiding Bell's residence was "Assassination Politics," which they found 
in Bell's car when the IRS seized it back in February. (Bell owed some 
$30,000 in back taxes.) Will others who make public their wrath for 
government and owe some taxes to Uncle Sam be paid similar visits?
What's perhaps more troubling still is the way the feds held up Bell's 
essay as evidence of his violent intent. Reading "Assassination Politics" 
makes clear that it is no more a workable blueprint for overthrowing the 
government than Frank Herbert's Dune is a realistic plan for urban renewal. 
For about two years prior to Bell's arrest, "Assassination Politics" 
floated around the Internet. Bell, for instance, sent this essay out on the 
cypherpunks mailing list, where scenarios for the future, based on new 
technology and libertarian principles, are frequently discussed. None of 
the cypherpunks took his "plan" seriously then.
The core of "Assassination Politics" is a plan to establish an anonymous 
electronic market wherein people could "wager" money on when public 
individuals, be they world leaders or corrupt tax collectors, will die. A 
person (say, for instance, an assassin) who correctly "predicts" the day of 
a death could anonymously collect the "winnings." Far from being a direct 
call to arms, Bell's essay is largely hypothetical, at least until 
encryption, traceless digital cash, and mass homicidal hatred of world 
leaders becomes widespread. Ugly yes; realistic no.
"I've told Jim Bell on any number of occasions that it would never work," 
Robert East, a friend of Bell's, tells me by e-mail. "If Jim had properly 
titled this as a fictional piece of literature he'd have been far more 
accurate."
In April, when the Jim Bell story broke, both The Columbian and Time 
Warner's Netly News portrayed Bell as a victim whose free-speech rights 
were violated. But as evidence against Bell piled up, the sympathy muted 
considerably. U.S. News' recent cover story on domestic terrorism, 
"Terrorism's Next Wave," opened with the Bell case.
Perhaps Bell was prosecuted for what he wrote rather than what he might do. 
(Both friends and family have repeatedly said Bell, though a big talker, 
isn't much of a doer. "Jim is a harmless academic [n]erd," East insists. 
"I've known him for years and he's harmless.") Perhaps the IRS was spooked 
by little more than idle speculation of its demise. But the evidence seems 
to have dealt the feds the better hand, and lends credence to the idea 
that, for all the protest of free-speech advocates, words are not always 
separable from actions.

Declans words to the cato institute interest me,care to scanem in Mr Mac? 
Your words should be compartmentalized if your a real punk.
