Sure. But to what extent can you collaborate without a)approaching full-
blown collusion or b) getting taken for a ride in spite of your best 
efforts? Either way, it's hard to justify trading in on the old "staunch 
and true defender of privacy" cachet. That is, unless you overestimate your 
own product, underestimate the skill of those who would break it, and 
thereby delude yourself into feeling on top of the world.  Hint: nobody at 
the NSA or in any way concerned with "national security" has the slightest 
incentive to get you to feel otherwise. Depressing.

Yep. Empty symbolic gestures are always expensive. You made a lot of 
interesting and thoughtful points about DGU too, thanks.
