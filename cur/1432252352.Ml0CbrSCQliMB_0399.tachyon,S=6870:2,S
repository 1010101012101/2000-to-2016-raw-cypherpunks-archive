****** SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO AUGUST 11, 2003******

The phenomenal success of the Internet at the application level may
perhaps primarily be attributed to a few simple but powerful ideas: a
client-server computing model, stateless (or partially stateful)
protocols (such as SMTP, HTTP, Instant Messaging and Presence
Protocols), the separation of transport from content, etc.  Fundamental
limitations of these ideas are already being addressed by the
development of middleware platforms for distributed applications (e.g.,
J2EE, Groove, Jini, .Net).  In the future, experience with large-scale
distributed applications may result in well-understood computational
models that are enshrined in programming languages with support for
uniform naming, reflexive operation, fault tolerance, distribution,
locality, partially disconnected operation, persistence, mobility,
autonomic operation, spatial aggregation, continuous streaming, etc.

SCOPE
The theme of this conference is PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES and DISTRIBUTED
COMPUTATION.  Papers are invited on all aspects of theory, practice and
applications related to this theme.  Papers targeting lessons learnt
from the development of large-scale application frameworks (e.g.,
Internet applications, distributed sensor networks) that may serve as
the basis for the development of programming languages are particularly
welcome.

  - Programming languages for distributed computation
  - Distributed capability-based computing
  - Grid computing
  - Peer-to-peer computing
  - Static analysis and type systems
  - Provably secure distributed computing
  - Proof-carrying code
  - Persistence in distributed computation
  - Language implications for
        Trust management / Reputation management /
        Public-key infrastructure
  - Language aspects of Internet middleware
  - Web services
  - Programming models for:
        Distributed sensor networks / Epidemic algorithms /
        Real-time streaming and querying
  - Model-based methods for distributed systems
  - Modeling of distributed systems
  - Large-scale distributed applications:
        Distributed MUDs / Distributed gaming environments /
        Electronic communities / Distributed collaboration environments

BACKGROUND
  The series of annual Asian Computing Science Conferences (ASIAN) was
  initiated in 1995 by AIT, INRIA and UNU/IIST to provide a forum for
  researchers in computer science from the Asian region and to promote
  interaction with researchers from other regions. The first seven
  conferences were held, respectively, in Bangkok, Singapore,
  Kathmandu, Manila, Phuket, Penang, and Hanoi. In addition to support
  from the host countries, they have also been sponsored by INRIA,
  France, UNU/IIST, Macau and NUS, Singapore. The proceedings have
  been published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science by
  Springer-Verlag.
