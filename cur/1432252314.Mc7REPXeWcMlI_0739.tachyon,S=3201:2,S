Probably.  Given how researchers could uniquely re-identify a third of
nameless Twitter and Flickr users based on the social graph alone [0],
you might either want to avoid key signing or avoid any overlapping
(reference) social interaction.

Also, how'd we get back to "web-of-trust" vs. "web-of-verified-identity"
again?  Given all the different social understandings of the issues in
different contexts, the relevant interpretation seems User * Context
based (e.g., 5 users * 6 contexts = 30 interpretations).  As Jonas
mentioned, social standards can offer direction but the choice and
interpretation still seems based, ultimately, on the user and signing
statement.
