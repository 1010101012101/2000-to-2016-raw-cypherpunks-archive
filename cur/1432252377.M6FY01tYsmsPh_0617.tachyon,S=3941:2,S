  IDF brass angered by phone logs check


  By Amos Harel


  Senior Israel Defense Forces officers expressed dissatisfaction yesterday
  with the announcement by Chief of Staff Dan Halutz that he had recently
  instructed the Field Security Directorate at the General Staff to keep
  track of their telephone conversations.

  According to a report in Haaretz yesterday, Halutz instructed the Field
  Security Directorate to provide him with the telephone logs of the
  generals, their department heads and their secretaries, in order to
  crosscheck whether they have had contacts with journalists.

  Even though the chief of staff made it clear that there were no plans to
  tap telephones and listen in on conversations, or adopt a policy of
  punishing those who did talk with journalists without explicit permission,
  his decision triggered sharp criticism.

  According to the disgruntled officers , the chief of staff's action "stinks
  of McCarthyism" and reflects "pressure on the part of the head of the army
  who feels under siege and is focusing on minor details."

  The same sources noted that there was hardly a senior officer who avoided
  talking with journalists or who did so only with the explicit permission of
  the IDF Spokesman's Office and the chief of staff. They also expressed
  doubts that Halutz himself had abided by any such restrictions in his
  previous senior positions.

  There have been past Field Security investigations in which officers took
  lie detection tests, but these were never in reaction to criticism of
  General Staff conduct or management of a war.
