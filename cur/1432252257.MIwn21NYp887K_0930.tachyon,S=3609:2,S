they'll most likely try to, if only to avoid some left-wing magazine
headline along the lines of "german government allows nazi propaganda to
remain online".

there will be NO prosecution for "viewing" it. almost everyone over 60
may have read the damn book, and lots of copies are still around (many
people got one for their marriage or other events, and keep them as
memoralia(sp?)). this ain't thought-police. you are perfectly free to
read this thing. AFAIK you aren't allowed to sell it, but that's it.
