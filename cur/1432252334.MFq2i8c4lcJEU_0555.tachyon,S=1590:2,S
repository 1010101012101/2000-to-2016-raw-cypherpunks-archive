Hello, Marko

Man of my desire is strong and tough.  He is worth thousands of others, he 
is confident and intelligent and he indeed knows how to rule.  I dream of a 
man who would be elder than me, thus wiser and much more experienced.  I am 
a weak woman and I need gentleman's shoulders to lean on.  You are a man of 
my choice and it would be great if you react to my interest towards you 
http://yourukrainebridesonline.info/?idAff=101].  I really wish you can be a real husband, a real man, 
and on my side I can be a real woman in all meanings, a wonderful wife, 
patient and soft mother to our children and good hostess to our house. 
Please don't make me wait any longer, tell me your feelings:

Waiting for your mail

July
