As I understand it, things like this are part of the Great Big Settlement
the tobacco corps made with a whole lot of Attorneys General (30-some-odd
states, IIRC). Every few months, PM sends me a big pack of coupons
(usually in the $5-$10 off a carton range) and asks for a fresh copy of my
ID. Brown & Williamson does the same thing.

Also, if you find a bar/nightclub that's hosting an event sponsored by one
of those same corps, they usually have a scanner or copier present as
well, with similar gimmicks (give us a Xerox of your ID, get free stuff).

Thus far, the only things that have come from it is an increase in *weird*
junk mail (Marlboro's sponsoring some kind of nationwide chili cook-off,
so they sent me a spoon) and cigarette coupons. The standard "having your
name in a database" caveats apply, though PM at least seems mostly
interested in verifying that you're over 21. (All the paper forms I've
seen expressly tell you to blackout your SSN/DL.)
