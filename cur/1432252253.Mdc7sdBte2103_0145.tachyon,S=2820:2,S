BESS's Secret LOOPHOLE (censorware vs. privacy & anonymity)

Abstract: This report examines a secret category in N2H2's censorware,
a product often sold under the name "BESS, The Internet Retriever".
This category turns out to be for sites which must be uniformly
prohibited, because they constitute a LOOPHOLE in the necessary
control of censorware. The category contains sites which provide
services of anonymity, privacy, language translation, humorous text
transformations, even web page feature testing, and more.
