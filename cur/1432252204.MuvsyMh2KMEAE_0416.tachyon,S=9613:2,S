proudon who was the first to call himself an anarchist in like 1850 was not
aligned with marx - they knew one another but... he was not a socialist and
certainly not a marxist he worked on mutualism which is structurally
incredibly different and majorly egalitarian (no state rule whatsoever
autocratic or otherwise)

i dont think in a dualist manner either communism or capitalism there are
different ways

proudon dealt a lot with the issue of property which is an incredibly
difficult issue to deal with and some say if the french during the
revolution would have dealt solidly with the issue of property (a giant
problem because of the elite) there would have been a much more transformed
world after and a 'real' revolution

he had some things in common with diderot as he dealt with intellectual
property a lot - educating the masses... information flow for the people

i will read your link of course - thanks
