You mean acts which consenting adults perform voluntarily?
In most off-camera cases, acts which signify love and trust 
with a life partner? Acts on some of which the continuation 
of the species depends?

The idea that such acts are somehow "wrong" or "criminal" is 
ridiculous.  And you are asking us to believe that the 
images or descriptions of such acts are heinous because they 
inherit wrongness or criminality from the acts themselves?

Go soak your head.
