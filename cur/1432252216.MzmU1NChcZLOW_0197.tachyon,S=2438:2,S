Tim is referring to Edward Lawson, arrested repeatedly and convicted
once in the late 1970s for walking around without ID. The appeal made it
to the Supreme Court, as Kolender v Lawson, 461 US 352 (1983). Lawson's
conviction was overturned on grounds that the "identify yourself" law
was too vague. Not surprisingly, Justice "Actual Innocence" Rehnquist
felt that the law was good and Lawson's conviction was righteous.

The opinion, with some introductory material, can be found at
