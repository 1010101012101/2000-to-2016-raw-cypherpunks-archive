            Dmitri Sklyarov has traded his testimony for his freedom to
return home, exactly what the
            man he will soon be testifying against had hoped for.

            And so, charges will be dropped against the Russian computer
programmer accused of
            violating electronic-book copyrights, ending part of a case
that has generated worldwide
            protests.

However check out this excerpt:

            "Mr. Sklyarov will be permitted to return to Russia in the
meantime, but will be subject to
            the Court's supervision, including regularly reporting by
telephone to the Pretrial Services
            Department. Mr. Sklyarov will be prohibited from violating
any laws during the year,
            including copyright laws. The United States agreed that, if
Mr. Sklyarov successfully
            completes the obligations in the agreement, it will dismiss
the charges pending against
            him at the end of the year or when the case against
Elcomsoft is complete," according to
            the Department of Justice's statement.

Yeah, if I were jailed, hassled, and kept from my family by a repressive
foreign regime
after speaking there, I'd certainly cooperate with them after I got back
home.
Yeah right; Fsck That Sheet.  When Osama dresses as Santa, maybe.
