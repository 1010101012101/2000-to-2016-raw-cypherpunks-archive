New Penalties for Upskirt
A videocamera can now be counted
as a criminal tool

                   Video Peeping
                   Ohio Hikes Jail Time and Fine for High-Tech Toms 

                   Oct. 10, 2000 

                                    COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Gina Bell
                                    was waiting for a carnival ride at a
                                    church festival with her baby daughter
                                    when she became spooked by the
                                    man behind her. When she shifted in
                                    line, he would move with her. 

                   "As I crouched down to put the baby in my stroller, I saw a
                   video camera sticking out of his bag, taping up my dress," the
                   34-year-old former kindergarten teacher recalled Monday. 

                   "It rocked my whole sense of security." 

                   Ban secret taping in public 

                   Beginning today, Ohio law increases
                   the penalties for secretly taking
                   pictures up a womans skirt or down
                   her shirt, called "upskirting" and
                   "downblousing." 

                   Most states have laws that prohibit
                   taking pictures of people in private
                   places such as dressing rooms or
                   restrooms, but only Ohio and
                   California specifically ban the
                   practice of secretly filming someone
                   under their clothing in public places
                   for sexual gratification, according to
                   the National Conference of State
                   Legislatures. Similar legislation is
                   pending in New York. 

                   Web sites promote voyeurism 

                   The Internet has made the practice
                   more common, with Web sites
                   posting images, buying pictures from
                   high-tech Peeping Toms and telling
                   users where to buy hidden cameras,
                   the laws supporters say. 

                   "These Web sites basically promote the practice and
                   encourage people to go out and try to do this to as many
                   women as possible -- kind of like a mission impossible
                   challenge," said state Rep. Ed Jerse, who sponsored the
                   Ohio legislation after hearing Bells story. 

                   The man who photographed Bell, David Bartolucci, pleaded
                   no contest to voyeurism and possession of criminal tools and
                   served 10 days in jail. He was also ordered to spend 30 days
                   in home detention, serve 200 hours of community service
                   and enroll in a therapy program. 

                   Suspect photographed himself 

                   Bartolucci had secretly photographed 13 women that day and
                   had unknowingly filmed his own face, which police used to
                   identify him, police said. 

                   Bartoluccis attorney, John Luskin, says his client was under
                   the influence of alcohol. 

                   California lawmakers banned upskirting and downblousing
                   after police discovered hidden cameras had filmed women at
                   Disneyland, the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival and an
                   Orange County, Calif., beach. 

                   Many of those images were transmitted on the Internet, but
                   police couldnt file charges against the photographers
                   because there was no specific law against the activity. 

                   The new Ohio law increases penalties to six months in jail
                   and a $1,000 fine, from the current 30 days and $500 fine.
                   California, where the law went into effect Jan. 1, has the same
                   punishment.
