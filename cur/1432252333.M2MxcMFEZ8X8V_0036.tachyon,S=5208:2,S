Nobody doubts that!
Sept. 11 merely provided the opportunity for the slimy power-hungry
control freaks to take advantage of the unprincipled and weak-willed.
No surprises here; Sept. 11 has been a wet dream for the Fibbies.

In other words: "Baby, this won't hurt that much if you'll just lay
back and quit fighting it."  So it turns out that Kapor's just another
fucking toady, ready to suck his thumb and let Big Brother take care
of him.

I'm really sick of hearing all these digerati -- that used to [claim
to] support civil liberties -- now ready to bend over and spread 'em
for the Feds.  This simply goes to show that they Never Had Any
Fucking Principles To Begin With.  They were just playing the part,
trying to look cool and hang out with the other trendy celebrities
espousing trendy liberal positions.

If one actually had principles, one would have thought about the
possibility of a large scale terrorist attack long before it
happened, and have allowed for it in their world view and their
political philosophy.

At least you know where Baker stands.  And it ain't on the side of
liberty!  (I *would* like to know why an ISP would hire Baker to
represent them when FBI is asking them to conduct electronic
surveillance; that seems a bit like asking the fox to help guard the
henhouse.)
