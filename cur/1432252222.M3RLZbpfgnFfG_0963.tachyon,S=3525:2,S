	It's his sloppiness that's unforgivable.

	His targets weren't even in the building.

>Tim McVeigh's legacy is that it's going to be a *real* long time before
>the Federal Government again attacks its citizens with tanks and snipers
>for simply saying "no" to a government official, and the term "collateral
>damage" is never going to be smugly used again to describe dead children

	Must be nice to have that kind of faith.

>I can forgive him for that too.

	You're a nice guy. Forgiving people like that.

knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense.
