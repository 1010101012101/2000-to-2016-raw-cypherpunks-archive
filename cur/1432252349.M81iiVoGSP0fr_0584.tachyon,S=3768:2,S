Similar to DeCSS, only one Palladium chip needs to be reverse engineered and
it's key(s) broken to virtualize the machine.  Simulate a Pentium VI in Java and
all extant code could be accessed.  Similarly, is Microsoft's signing keys were
cracked  then any code could be signed.

If the software needs a real-time connection to the internet though, then
protection could be built into it.  Laptop applications would be vulnerable
until we have pervasive wireless connection.

How many bits do you think MS will use for the keys?

Albion.
