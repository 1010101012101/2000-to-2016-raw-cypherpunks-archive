Again you show yourself to be uncritical of these claims. You don't "get it."

The solution is not a regimen of data privacy laws but tecnologies to 
enable consumers to remain private. Those who "give permission" for 
their refrigerator to contact some outside party have made their 
choice. (They can block in many ways: don't buy the refrigerator, 
don't hook it up to phone lines or the Internet, insert a firewall 
product which others are likely to provide, hack the system to not 
provide this information, and so on.)

Anyone who complains about this net-enabled fridge has only themself to blame.

What we don't need are "data privacy laws.'

There are deeper principles here, discussed many times. If Alice 
observes something Bill has said, or done, or whatever, it is not 
_Bill_ who owns these observations.
