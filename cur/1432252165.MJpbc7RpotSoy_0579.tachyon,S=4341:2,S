I've never said that people should be legally punished for tinkering
with the stuff they've bought, nor do I think they should.

Well I guess that's tough, isn't it?

There simply isn't much of a market for open, fully-documented products.

Of course, you are free to make your own fully-documented, open-source
products, or encourage those companies to make documentation available
to implementers and administrators.

I didn't say anything about killing technicians. I _did_ say things about
killing people who would murder others for keeping secrets.

While protecting IP is a duly authorized power of the US government,
the way it extends protection for periods of time sometimes spanning
the entire course of an average human lifespan, is far beyond any
reasonable interpretation of the "limited Times" proviso in Article
I, Section 8, and such excessively long periods of protection should
be ruled unconstitutional. As for the DMCA, it is simply an atrocity.
Obviously unconstitutional.

I defend the right of EVERYONE to try and keep stuff secret that they
want to keep secret. Of course, tough shit if somebody discovers this
secret in a non-coercive fashion.

If you attempt to shoot people for the "crime" of keeping something
secret, I will ally with them in efforts to liquidate you.

This may be acceptable. Actually, the members of Congress who enabled
these sorts of lawsuits should be liquidated.
