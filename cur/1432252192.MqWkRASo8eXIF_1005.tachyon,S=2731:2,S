Another useful stopgap is the dynamic DNS providers,
such as dyndns.org, which give you a third-level domain
and convenient tools for updating your information.
They're oriented towards the dial/dsl/cablemodem users
who want to run web sites and other servers from
machines that have dynamic IP addresses -
your machine keeps them updated with your current address,
so people who connect to yourmachine.theirservice.net
get to wherever you are now.
