Theres no reason personalized information cant arrive at your TV, 
cellular telephone, or microwave oven for that matter. Microprocessors 
embedded in objects and connected to networks open up a world of new 
opportunitiesa world where information is easily customized for each 
users needs."
 Paul Allen
Theres no reason paul allen couldnt be nominated by me for assasination 
politics.He still has time to divest and join the crypto-anarchist 
revolution though.Nothing personal paul,its business,thats all.
