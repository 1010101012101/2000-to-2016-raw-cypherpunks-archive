Maybe harsher than what I wrote above, but, as you allude to, not 
necessarily harsher than what I think.

Fact is, government criminals are almost never held accountable for 
their crimes. Order the killings of innocents...get a transfer and 
promotion. Write assassination manuals for third world police 
forces...get a medal. Illegally use FBI files to attack one's 
political opponents...be told not to do it again. Shoot an unarmed 
man 31 times in a hail of gunfire...be found innocent.

And the gubment types and their court lackeys have written things so 
that "suing the government" is nearly impossible.

Meanwhile, "double jeopardy" is being rolled-back on almost a daily 
basis. Prosecutors are congratulating themselves when they find 
loopholes and new laws which allow them to "take a second bite of the 
apple."

Fucking creeps.
