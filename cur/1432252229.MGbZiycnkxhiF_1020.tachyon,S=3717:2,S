The affidavit/complaint we link to at cluebot.com contains an
allegation from the Feds that Bell only 'fessed up to (in previous
interviews with l.e.)  authoring the AP essays.

I do not recall reading about, or writing about, Bell being charged
with deploying a working AP system. No, they've been prosecuting him
using far more mundane allegations of SSN misuse, stinkbombs, and
stalking. AP just gives it all spice, I suppose.
