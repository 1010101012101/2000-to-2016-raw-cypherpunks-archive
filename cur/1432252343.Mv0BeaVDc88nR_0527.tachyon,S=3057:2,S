Depends on exactly what you mean by "taken down forcefully".
If you just mean forced to cease operations without additional
repercussions, I think it's more likely that more would pop up.

Just speculation, or course, but I suspect there are quite a few
people out there who would be willing and able to run remailers but
don't bother doing it because there's no perceived need
and no real payoff.  

I believe in principle a mixmaster network really only needs
two remailers to exist to function properly.
