Agreed; contract law always applies.  In fact, there may well be
engineering reasons for doing certain things only with known
cartridges.  At the same time, when you buy a device, you expect
it to interoperate as best it can.   The reputation of a company
making gear which doesn't, rightfully suffers.

Tell me about it!  Still, that's what the market has evolved.  Detroit
could make cars that lasted 200,000 miles (reliably; the spec calls
for 100,000), but most folks wouldn't pay the extra cost.  Sometimes
the 'give the razors for free, sell the blades' bizplan is the optimal.
