Tim is incorrect here, unless he's implicitly narrowing his argument to the case
where the eavesdropper has no better model of noise than the sender,
or if he's only concerned about the eavesdropper reading the message,
not about the attacker detecting its presence.
The problem is that a good stream of cyphertext will have a 50% ones density
with no apparent correlation patterns, while the real noise may look
much different, and XORing the two gives 50% uncorrelated.

For two simple cases, consider "LSB is always 0" and "LSB has 75% of the bits = 1"; 
Tim's stegotext would be detected in both these cases.  
Real cases are more likely to resemble "noise limited to X kHz, Y dB",
though they're of course much more computational effort to test for,
and therefore less likely to be tested for.

Peter Wayner's work on Mimic Functions provides some good methods
for transforming messages into stegotext that meets arbitrary grammars,
so you can pass automated tests for stego.  That doesn't mean a
human reader won't be able to detect that something's wrong,
but if you've got human eavesdroppers trying to read every message you send or
receive, you're probably under suspicion already.

Audio is tough to use as stego cover, because it's usually compressed,
removing much of the available noise and redundancy,
either with a human speech model (cellphones, VOIP, etc.)
or with MP3s for music, so hiding messages in it is likely to have
a major impact on the sound.  Doesn't mean you can't do it,
or can't start your messages with "Hi, Bob, I'm calling from the subway" or
label your music file "Live Phish concert, 1/1/01, audience tape from nosebleed seats",
and you're better off using less aggressive compression (e.g. 32kbps ADPCM
instead of  6.5kbps cellphone algorithms.)
