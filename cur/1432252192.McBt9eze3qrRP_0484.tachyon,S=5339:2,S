"Anything displayed on your screen is visible to the guy across the street
with a TEMPEST detector unless you work in a Faraday cage. "

No, no you have the whole thing wrong. As May recently stated, "crypto is 
economics". It's one thing for "them" to set up a camera to look at some 
Arab guy's computer down on Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn. It's an entirely 
different thing if, by using a virtual keyboard, "they" have to do the same 
thing for millions of people. (And in case it's not obvious, the cost 
probably won' be in the hardware but in the installation costs, and the fact 
that the probability of detection of such efforts is nonzero, thus 
nullifying their "investment".) If I have a plan to smash a plane into the 
Empire State building, I'll probably work harder to hide it. If I'm sharing 
mp3's on Kazaa or whatever and I don't want to have RIAA make an example out 
of me, that virtual keyboard may be just right.

The real danger of crypto and, I'd argue, a virtual keyboard in this case, 
is that by spending tiny fractions of money we can make it prohibitively 
costly for "them" to monitor a large number of transactions. Forget 
unbreakability. Forget Faraday cages (you don't have anything that important 
to hide anyway). Cheap, easy and scalable is the only way to bumrush this 
show.
