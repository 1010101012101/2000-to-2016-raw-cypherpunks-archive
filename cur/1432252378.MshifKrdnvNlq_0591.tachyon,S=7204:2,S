well, there are the following (from
http://www.britishairways.com/travel/genconcarr/public/en_gb ):
-------------------------------------------------
Our right to refuse to carry you or to ban you from travel
a) Our right to refuse to carry you

We may decide to refuse to carry you or your baggage if one or more of the
following has happened or we reasonably believe may happen.

1) If carrying you or your baggage may put the safety of the aircraft or
the safety or health of any person in the aircraft in danger.

2) If carrying you or your baggage may affect the comfort of any person in
the aircraft.

3) If you are drunk or under the influence of drink or drugs.

4) If you are, or we reasonably believe you are, in unlawful possession of
drugs.

5) If your mental or physical state is a danger or risk to you, the
aircraft or any person in it.

6) If you have refused to allow a security check to be carried out on you
or your baggage.

7) If you have not obeyed the instructions of our ground staff or a member
of the crew of the aircraft relating to safety or security.

8) If you have used threatening, abusive or insulting words towards our
ground staff or a member of the crew of the aircraft.

9) If you have behaved in a threatening, abusive, insulting or disorderly
way towards a member of our ground staff or a member of the crew of the
aircraft.

10) If you have deliberately interfered with a member of the crew of the
aircraft carrying out their duties.

11) If you have put the safety of either the aircraft or any person in it
in danger.

12) If you have made a hoax bomb threat.

13) If you have committed a criminal offence during the check-in or
boarding processes or on board the aircraft.

14) If you have not, or do not appear to have, valid travel documents.

15) If you try to enter a country for which your travel documents are not
valid.

16) If the immigration authority for the country you are travelling to, or
for a country in which you have a stopover, has told us (either orally or
in writing) that it has decided not to allow you to enter that country,
even if you have, or appear to have, valid travel documents.

17) If you destroy your travel documents during the flight.

18) If you have refused to allow us to photocopy your travel documents.

19) If you have refused to give your travel documents to a member of the
crew of the aircraft, when we have asked you to do so.

20) If you ask the relevant government authorities for permission to enter
a country in which you have landed as a transit passenger.

21) If carrying you would break government laws, regulations, or orders.

22) If you have refused to give us information which a government
authority has asked us to provide about you.

23) If you have not presented a valid ticket.

24) If you have not paid the fare (including any taxes, fees or charges)
for your journey.

25) If you have presented a ticket acquired illegally.

26) bIf you have presented a ticket which you did not buy from us or our
authorised agents.

27) If you have presented a ticket which was not issued by us or our
authorised agents.

28) If you have presented a ticket which has been reported as being lost
or stolen.

29) If you have presented a counterfeit ticket.

30) If you have presented a ticket with an alteration made neither by us
nor our authorised agents.

31) If you have presented a spoiled, torn or damaged ticket or a ticket
which has been tampered with.

32) If you cannot prove you are the person named in the ticket.

33) If you have changed your transportation without our agreement as set
out in clause 3c.

34) If you have failed to present your ticket or your boarding pass or
your travel documents to us when reasonably asked to do so.

35) If you have failed to complete the check-in process by the check-in
deadline.

36) If you have failed to arrive at the boarding gate on time.

37) If you have behaved in a way mentioned above on or in connection with
a previous flight and we believe you may repeat this behaviour.

b) Our right to refuse to carry you when we have banned you from our route
network

1) We will be entitled to refuse to carry you or your baggage if we have
given you a banning notice and you have bought your ticket while the ban
applies.

2) By a banning notice we mean a written notice we have given to you
informing you that you are banned from being carried on our route network.
(This means you are banned from travelling on all flights we operate.)
This notice will give the date when the ban comes into force and the
period for which it applies. A banning notice will also ask you not to buy
a ticket or ask or allow anyone to do so for you.

3) If you try to travel while a banning notice is in force, we will refuse
to carry you and you will be entitled to an involuntary fare refund.

--------------------------------------------------------
There are no obvious grounds for discressionary removal based on wearing a
badge (or being married to a habitual badge-wearer) but the "banning
notice" thing looks to be a blanket refusal option written up to look like
something else - I don't read this as saying you have to have met the
section (a) criteria for them to issue a banning notice, in which case
they can refuse you for no reason at all provided they put it in writing.
