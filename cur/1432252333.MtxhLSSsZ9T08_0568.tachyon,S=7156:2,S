It takes an inventor's time (thus money) to invent it, you can patent it.
Since these people invented a special test, the testing of that sequence for
mutations, akin to testing metal integrity sonically, patenting it makes
perfect sense.
More sense than patenting mathematical operations at the very least. About
as much sense as many software patents. How much sense we're talking about
here isn't actually relevant, it's international law mixed with so much
money that it's not going to change without a fight.

> WASHINGTON -- An appeals court here has ruled that a company that makes
> tests for breast and ovarian cancer can patent breast cancer gene
> sequences, in effect ruling that human genes can be patented.
>
> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit -- a court that
> specializes in patent cases -- ruled that when a gene is isolated from the
> human body, it is "markedly different" and has a "distinctive chemical
> identify and nature" compared with the way it is found in nature.
>
> Friday's 2-1 decision overturns parts of earlier decisions by a U.S.
> District Court judge in New York City who ruled that patents on the BRCA 1
> and 2 gene sequences -- and by extension all other human genes -- are
> invalid.
>
> The company that holds the patents, Utah-based Myriad Genetics, sells
> tests that assess a woman's risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer
