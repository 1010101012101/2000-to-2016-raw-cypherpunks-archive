Hi there,

The secret is out!

Here's the mail we've all been waiting for! Read carefully
and take immediate action on it!

I've discovered an amazing formula that will give your
MLM an enormous enrollers explosion. You'll benefit
hugely if you use it with YOUR primary MLM!

-THE ULTIMATE RECRUITMENT FORMULA-

So if you are already in MLM or about to get into one
this will be the most important mail you will ever read.

Right now I know people who enroll dozens in their
downlines WEEKLY using the formula I'm about to
reveal.

Fred Stege, Founder of MLMDynamite, Inc enrolled
127 people within 7 day's after launching! One of his
enrollees from this batch has become top recruiter in
his company within 90 days after using this incredible
easy-to-use concept.

The NEW Formula is meant as a Front End Program to
enhance "YOUR" MLM. I'm NOT pitching you in any
MLM.

We've discovered that the majority of Qualified MLM
Leads (Prospects) all have 1 thing in common...

They all are looking for 3 things they desperately want
