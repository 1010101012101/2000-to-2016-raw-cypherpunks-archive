Nice to see the phone company (read: government) is tracking us all in 
real time to ~3m. Damn good thing they can't find their ass with both 
hands, since their leader is severely retarded, or I'd be worried. Hell 
they can't find 15m+ illegals, so we should be safe.

I wonder how long it takes between saying "stem cell evolution" on a 
phone call and the SWAT team showing up? Hmmmm...
