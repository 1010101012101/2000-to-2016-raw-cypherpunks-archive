Clicks from a Geiger Counter, Johnson noise, etc. are quantum-based 
events. Feed them into a file to be used for PGP, and voila.

Set up a script to copy the private part of the PGP key onto a diskette 
or whatever. Erase the private key from the computer.

Or move the entire computer into the box in #3.

Lock the above diskette in the box. Or the computer in the box.

I don't know about this. Others can say whether today's CPUs can do key 
signings in 0.1 mS.

Less doable. Fakery is easy. Even if they personally witnessed the 
above procedures, all sorts of subliminal channels or other sleight of 
hand tricks could be done.

Backup in the same box? Easy for someone to sabotage or destroy. Or 
steal.

Good luck.
