Probably people just need two email clients: One for non-secure email, another that only sends secure messages.  They can both use 
imap for the same account.  Bonus: spam might potentially have a hard time getting accepted as a secure sender, leaving secure email 
spam free.

Alternately, do it on viewing / editing via plugins that are less invasive and more secure.

There are several problems:

Choosing an ID system: email address + key ID of some kind.
Key exchange / trust system: Hierarchical (do you trust some or all CAs?  Their signup policies?), web of trust (GPG or similar), 
personal signing, etc.

Visibility and understanding: Current systems are annoying even for experts.  No hope of a normal user looking at or understanding 
ID/cert/key trust situation.  Make it specific and simple: CA is safe but could be coopted by TLA or mistakes, signup was weak 
(could have been a stolen credit card), password could have been stolen, mitm exposure, etc.  Just draw the trust / exploit tree. 
Factor in multi-factor, alternate channel checking, etc.

Ease of selecting, enabling, and using read/write interfaces.

Solve the problems of control, time available, ability to save for later safely.

Stephen

If you can’t send encrypted email, sending email in the first place is probably too difficult, just txt everyone on your fone.

Life is full of levels of grey, and so is security. That password you use on new sites you don’t trust vs your gpg/pgp passphrase. The sheeple don’t have levels of grey with regards to security, either take it to their grave or everyone can see.

Chatting with someone who was looking to start his own desktop Linux distro. I suggested an encrypted messaging platform over the security-hole-riddled platform he was using and he told me he had nothing to hide. I told him he wasn’t the kind of person who should be developing anything security related.

Security takes effort that people are not will to expend.
