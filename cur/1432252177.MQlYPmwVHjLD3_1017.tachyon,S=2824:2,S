This also is not new.

We were discussing this in relation to millidollar streaming cash at least
5 years ago. We've discussed this privately, and on public mail lists, with
the likes of Nicko van Someren, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Mark Manasse.

Even the delineation between universally-checked blind-signature "notes",
and stochastically tested "coins" is at least five years old and has been
discussed on most of the usual email lists.

Cheers,
RAH
