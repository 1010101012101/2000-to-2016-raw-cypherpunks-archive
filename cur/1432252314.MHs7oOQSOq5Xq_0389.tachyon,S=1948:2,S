Sniper weapons should be restricted
   A .50-caliber BMG sniper rifle, in the wrong hands, would be terrorism 
unleashed. The gun is powerful enough to punch a hole in an oil tank or 
take down a civilian airplane. Its 5 1/2-inch long bullets can pierce an 
inch of armor 40 yards away and hit a target a mile away. A massive weapon, 
with some models weighing in at 28 pounds, it's ill-suited for hunters -- 
it would take out a deer and the tree behind it -- but ideal for assassins.
