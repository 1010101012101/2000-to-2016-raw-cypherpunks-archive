Having read Tim's reply already,  I'll confine myself to a point he
didn't address.

Note,  however,  that this IS a question of design,  not merely one 
of marketing. 

The system doesn't know "terrorists" from "freedom fighters".  The
system doesn't know pornographers from Falun Gongers.  

A system does (or at least could) know clients who want to send 
megabytes of data from ones who only want top send a few bits.  It 
does know clients who insist on real-time or near real-time 
transmission from ones who would accept substantial transmission 
delay times.  It knows clients who insist their system be free and 
trivial to use from those willing to spend a fair amount and go to a 
certain degree of effort to make damn sure they're doing things 
right.
It knows the difference between broadcasting and person-to-person 
communication.  And it knows whether clients are willing to accept 
the idea that some "trusted third party" could compromise their
identity,  or whether they trust no one.

Certainly they should be "discussed", if only to point out what's
wrong with them,  or speculate how the escrow mechanism
might be defeated or compromised.

Long-term consequences are notoriously hard to predict.  For 
example, it's quite possible somebody who develops
and implements a digital cash system with some sort of
key escrow mechanism might be doing the world a big favor,
since cloning it and cutting out the escrow part might be a lot
easier than developing a similar system from scratch.  Or maybe 
not,  as I said, hard to say.

OK.  Freedom=good.  Tyranny=bad.  Now that we've agreed on 
moral principles, time to move on.
