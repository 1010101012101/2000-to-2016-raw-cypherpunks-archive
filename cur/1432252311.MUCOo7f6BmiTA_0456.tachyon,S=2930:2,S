Obviously this catastrophe could not have taken place without the
unauthorized use of paper.   Paper allows people to communicate
dangerous ideas and secret messages.

With paper, anyone can communicate to large numbers of people at
once, even if they are not properly authorized or in authority.

The solution is clear.  Paper must be a government monopoly .
Paper should only be used for government forms and official
government statements.
