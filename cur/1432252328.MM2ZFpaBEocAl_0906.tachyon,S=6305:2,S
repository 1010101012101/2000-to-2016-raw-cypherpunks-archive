"""
New York Film Festival director Kent Jones said today that the Film
Society of Lincoln Center has added the world premiere of Laura
Poitras’ CITIZENFOUR to its Main Slate lineup. The presentation will
run Friday, October 10 at 6 PM at Alice Tully Hall. Poitras will also
participate in a free HBO Directors Dialogues the following day at 4
PM, at the Walter Reade Theater. The film, from RADiUS in association
with Participant Media and HBO Documentary Films, opens theatrically
October 24.

According to the festival: In January 2013, Poitras was several years
into the making of a film about abuses of national security in
post-9/11 America when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from
someone identifying himself as “citizen four,” who was ready to blow
the whistle on the massive covert surveillance programs run by the NSA
and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, she and reporter Glenn
Greenwald flew to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with the
man who turned out to be Snowden. She brought her camera with her. The
film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely
sui generis in the history of cinema: a 100% real-life thriller
unfolding minute by minute before our eyes.
