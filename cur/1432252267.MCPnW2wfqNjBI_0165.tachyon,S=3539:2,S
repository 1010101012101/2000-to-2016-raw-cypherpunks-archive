Corporations never saw Linux coming. Now that FOSS is on the radar
screen, you'll see lots of very obvious ramming through of IP protection in
software.

You haven't noticed the software patent charade happening in EU
right now? It is not at all obvious who's going to win.

You're misinterpreting the events. Industry has so far been fighting with
propagada only. Outside of FOSS IP wars are the rule.

What a nice boolean universe you live in. Fact is that FOSS can be easily
DoSed by lawyers of a party with deeper pockets (basically, any party with
deeper pocket than a couple of bearded hackers).

Excellent strawman. Where are you getting these? I need to order a couple.

Again, neither state nor the corporate has your wellbeing as optimization
criterium. It does frequently happen that superpersonal organization units
result in a better world than the alternatives. Then, quite often not.

We need smarter agents.
