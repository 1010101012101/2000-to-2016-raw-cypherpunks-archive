Mathematically I think that's correct.

Isn't the blockage the idea that a structure ( the economic network )

Just the thing to keep the softening economy afloat. 

Pass it on to the new prez, he'll like it and it will the communication
of his ideas to the citizens more effective.

Paradigm shifts are very real. Every time I spend 20 cents. Isn't the
"synergy" on this list encouraging?
