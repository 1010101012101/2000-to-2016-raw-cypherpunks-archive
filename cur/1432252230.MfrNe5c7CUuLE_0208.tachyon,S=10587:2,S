It's finally here again and like all of us here at eHuntingCentral, =
we're sure everyone's making plans and getting ready for a successful =
hunting season!  If you haven't had the opportunity to take advantage of =
the tools our hunting site offers, now would be a great time to check us =
out!

What makes our site different from other hunting sites?
eHuntingCentral is designed and written by hunters, for hunters for the =
sole purpose of providing hunting information and tools that were once =
so difficult for hunters like ourselves to locate.  Through this site, =
hunters can now access the most up-to-date hunting information available =
on the web in one easy convenient location. Based on our own hunting =
experiences, we have gathered information and provided tools that we =
feel will be a valuable asset to hunters of all game!  To help make this =
year's hunts a success, eHuntingCentral has enhanced and added several =
new features to benefit all hunters.

These features include:
Trophy Gallery - A fun feature that allows members to share their =
hunting photos with others on the site.  Simply upload your digital =
pictures into the proper categories so everyone can enjoy them.

My Journal - It's your own personal journal that allows you to record =
hunting dates, weather conditions, game, equipment and other information =
about each of your hunts.  You can store landowner information as well =
as hunting locations with latitude and longitude coordinates.  There are =
also links to provide aerial photos of your hunting locations.

My Calendar - This feature is especially beneficial to guides to help =
you keep track of all your scheduled hunts.  It's designed to schedule =
hunting trips online and to eliminate the need for paper calendars.  We =
will keep 3 years of history for you to review and you can schedule as =
far in the future as you would like.

*The last two features are strictly private and accessible only to you =
when you logon with your email address and password.  Even better, it's =
accessible by you from any location that has Internet access.

Take the opportunity now to list any items you have for sale in our =
Classified or Auction sections, advertise your hunting related web sites =
in our Links section and gain exposure for your business by sending us =
your (468 X 60) banner ad so that we can display it throughout our site.

For all you Guides, remember to list your service in both the Links =
section and the Guides section and post any hunting pictures in our =
Trophy Gallery.  The Guide Search now contains a link to view all your =
photos from your guide listing.

As our policy has always been, membership to this site, including the =
updated and added features, is absolutely FREE!

Take a look at some of the other features currently offered:

* Customizable Home Page (Your Weather and Your Links)
* Field Reports
* Classifieds
* Discussions/Forums
* Links
* Auctions
* Hunt Swaps
* Guide/Outfitter Search
* Recipes
