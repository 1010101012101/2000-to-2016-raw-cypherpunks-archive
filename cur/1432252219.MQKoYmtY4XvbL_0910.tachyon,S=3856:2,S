"An inspector at the No. 502 Power Plant in the southwestern province of 
Sichuan discovered 63 pieces of Cobalt-60 and 14 empty lead casings missing 
in late February, the semi-official China News Service said in a report 
seen by Reuters on Sunday"
"Cobalt-60 produces gamma rays that increase the chances of cancer in those 
exposed to it, but it can also be used as a medical tracer and to treat 
various types of cancer and irradiate food.
As one of several radioactive materials less closely guarded than uranium 
or plutonium, experts say it could be used in a so-called "dirty bomb" - a 
conventional explosive combined with a radioactive material that could 
spread the harmful material over a wide area."
