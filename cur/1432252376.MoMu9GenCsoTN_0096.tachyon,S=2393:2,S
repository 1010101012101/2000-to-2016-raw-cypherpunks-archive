Reply-To: Crypto discussion list <cryptography@randombit.net>

Interesting post by Jacob Appelbaum on the compromise of a trusted CA that was
used to issue fraudulent certificates:

https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion

The discussion shows up (yet again) one of the (several) killer problems of
CRL/OCSP-style blacklisting, since you can only blacklist certs that you know
that a certificate vending machine has issued, there could be arbitrary
numbers of further certs out there that can't be revoked because the vending
machine doesn't know that it issued them.

Peter.
