Well, the bit about "18 times the speed of light," and other mistakes I've 
seen through the years, make me suspect that Wolf and company simply don't 
have the technical background and built-in BS detectors necessary to catch 
things like this.  (For some reason I've never been able to fathom, many 
journalists seem to be remarkably gullable, when they're told something 
from the right kind of source, especially a government agency or other 
official source.)

I recall a guy on NPR saying something like this, a bit more 
politely.  Something like "The pieces surely aren't going to be dangerous, 
but moving them is going to mess up the investigation of the crash."  Which 
presumably is what everyone with any technical background and common sense 
was thinking when they heard the original warning, right?
