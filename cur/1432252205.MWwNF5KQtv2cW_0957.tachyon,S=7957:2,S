FORMER CIA OFFICER KIRIAKOU SENTENCED FOR LEAK

Former CIA officer John Kiriakou was sentenced today to 30 months in
prison for a violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act after
he pleaded guilty to one count of identifying a covert agent.

Although the sentence is less than that prescribed by federal sentencing
guidelines, the government said that it considers the reduced penalty
"reasonable."

In a presentencing memorandum for the defense, Mr. Kiriakou's attorneys
said that his offense should be seen in the context of his lifelong
commitment "to public service and the defense of America's national
security."

	http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/kiriakou/012413-defmem.pdf

"In the course of his service to the United States and the Central
Intelligence Agency, Mr. Kiriakou placed himself in harm's way on countless
occasions, earning the CIA's Exceptional Service Award no fewer than ten
times," the defense memorandum said.

Although Mr. Kiriakou accepted full responsibility for his actions, the
defense said that he had been duped into making the unauthorized disclosure
that led to his prosecution.

"In 2006, Journalist A told Mr. Kiriakou that he was working on a book
about the Abu Omar rendition in Milan. That was false. Journalist A has
never published a book on that subject and the defense is aware of no
evidence that he was ever working on one."

"In reality, unknown to Mr. Kiriakou, Journalist A was acting as a private
investigator on behalf of lawyers representing terrorist detainees in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and was forwarding the information he received from
Mr. Kiriakou, as well as information he received from many other
individuals, to another private investigator working with the detainees'
lawyers. Mr. Kiriakou now realizes that he made a very serious mistake in
passing any information to Journalist A, but he would not have done so had
he known how Journalist A would make use of that information," the defense
memorandum said.

The defense noted that "Mr. Kiriakou has fully and forthrightly accepted
responsibility for his actions and recognizes the seriousness of the crime
to which he has pled guilty.  Yet while many will never know Mr. Kiriakou
apart from this prosecution, the incident that led to this moment cannot
undo the reality of Mr. Kiriakou's life in full-- a life dedicated to the
values of freedom, decency, public service, and love of country.  As the
government concedes, although Mr. Kiriakou's crime was unquestionably
serious, he was never motivated by any desire to harm the United States,
national security, the CIA's critical mission abroad, or any individual
person."

A petition asking President Obama to pardon Mr. Kiriakou or commute his
sentence has already been signed by thousands of supporters.

After Vice Presidential aide Scooter Libby was convicted of perjury in
connection with the unauthorized disclosure of the identity of CIA officer
Valerie Plame in 2007 and sentenced to 30 months in jail, his sentence was
promptly commuted by President George W. Bush.
