"Thank you for using ZipLip's free secure mail service. We appreciate your 
patronage and wish to inform you that we will be discontinuing our service 
on June 30th, 2005. For various reasons, including new U.S. legislation 
which significantly impacts the individual's privacy rights, ZipLip is no 
longer able to provide its free secure email services with any reasonable 
assurance of privacy and security, particularly in the context of a hosted 
service. We will revisit the service issue when our legislature reinstates 
our privacy rights.

Please make the necessary arrangements to use another Webmail service 
before June 30th. We are unable to offer any data migration services. We 
sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. "
