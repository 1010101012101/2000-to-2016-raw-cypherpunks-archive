Many of us don't believe this common belief today, that the First is 
mainly about political speech, is consistent with the intent of the 
Framers. The Framers were well aware that when the King can decide who 
can speak, and where, and in front of which others, then the King has 
more power than any government should ever have. This would have applied 
to whether Ben Franklin coudl publish his electricity research, Patrick 
Henry his cure for baldness, or Thomas Jefferson his advertisements for 
his fine tobacco products.

The notion that the King's men get to control what is said about 
electricity research (pace recent cases in crypto, cloning, etc.) or 
what is said about baldness cures (pace FDA, advertising laws, etc.), or 
what is said about fine tobacco products (not in front of children, not  
on television or radio, and not in increasing numbers of places--and 
some of these are the result of "voluntary" (in the Orwellian sense) 
deals the tobacco companies agreed to.

The First was designed to stop this kind of intrusion into personal, 
political, religious, and commercial speech.

More gnawing away at the First, of course.

Given the notion that a local community may ban certain items because 
they violate the "community standards" of the community, one is left 
with the inescapable conclusion that a local community could also ban 
Mormonism, or Catholicism, or any religious practice they deemed to be 
violative of their community standards.

Ditto for community standards for gun ownership (cf. New York, 
Washington, California, etc.).

Ditto for community standards for numerous other rights.

A law student recently reminded me that the "incorporation doctrine," 
coupled I presume with the language of the 14th Amendment (esp. the 
"equal protection" clause), says that the states (and even smaller 
divisions of political units, e.g., cities and counties) are BOUND to 
obey the U.S. Constitution. It took a long while for this to be hammered 
home with landmark cases, such as ones dealing with New York's version 
of press censorship. (The Second is in a peculiar situation, for reasons 
I don't have time to write about now.)

I see no reason under this reading why Idaho, for example, would be able 
to ban "Playboy." Their "community standards" might be offended by 
"Playboy," but then this is just as good a reason to ban Jews. What's 
the difference? Either the U.S. Constitution applies in Idaho and 
everywhere else, or it doesn't.

We talk a lot here about the Constitution. Strange for two reasons: 
first, this is an international list, second, many of us are not exactly 
supporters of government in general.

However, practically speaking, history is showing us that only a "robust 
kernel," to use some computer science notions, can stop the predations 
of the state. Or slow them down. In the legal arena, that is. If 
technology or custom push into new regimes, the law may be bypassed or 
forced to change.

Countries without a hammered-out series of ironclad (to mix some 
metaphors) constitutional prohibitions  on what government can do find 
themselves with laws like Britain's "R.I.P." laws, or bans on crypto 
like in South Africa ("No RSA in RSA!"), Russia, France, etc.

Without the extremely strong language of "Congress shall make no 
law....," the U.S. would have had zillions of laws passed by do-gooders 
and well-meaning Congresscritters.

(We have it with commercial speech, because the courts went off the 
track and bought your theory that the First is about "political" speech, 
not "commercial" speech. That, and overbroad interpretations of the 
Commerce Clause. I've written too much about this issue already.)

Enough for now.

Fuck that noise.

None of the proposals for "voluntary self-labelling" are actually about 
any kind of voluntarism except in the Orwellian meaning of the term.

And self-labelling is a foolish idea. No one is "tricked" into learning 
that "Tropic of Cancer" has sexual content....Miller did not need to 
plaster a warning label across his novel's cover.

As we discussed several years ago when the CDA was being debated, there 
are profound problems with self-labelling. Some people will self-label 
"incorrectly" for various reasons. Much debated several years ago.
