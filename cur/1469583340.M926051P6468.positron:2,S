Was just discussing my ColorComputer 3 on another thread. It had a 68xx
chip and at 4mhz could run Multivue, a GUI based on the Xerox PARC model
(written in C... the manual had ALL the code) in a unix-like system
(Microware OS9) that could run rings around any PC of the time. Multiple
shells, it wasn't necessary to hard code memory locations if you wrote
code for it (Relocatable Object Memory) and all. I hung onto it until it
became totally obsolete.
