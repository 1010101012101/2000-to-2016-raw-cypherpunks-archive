A number of the top scorers in the academic races they ran this year were
home-schooled.

*Tell us* about the teaching of natural selection in Kansas' public
schools.  Ahem.

In any case, freedom from compulsion is more important.

Its not like public education doesn't include bizarre rituals, (chanting
towards
flags, uniforms) limited perspectives, and hidden agendas (public schools must
encourage registration for the draft by US males).

Regardless of the exemplars that you and I have met, its the freedom that
matters.

*Exactly like that*

I was going to include that in one draft... but thought it distracting... glad
you brought it up.

Fundies are a scourge when they open their mouths, no doubt about it.
Ship 'em to Afghanistan and let their gods duke it out.
