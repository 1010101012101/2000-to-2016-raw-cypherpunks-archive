Think about the issue.

If someone takes a post of mine, or yours, or anybody's, and says 
something _honest_ like, for example,

"That's an interesting point. Doing some digging I found this article 
from several years ago...."

then there would be no issue.

I think this is the way Bill Stewart, for example, would begin an 
article.

Choate, however, never does this. He just regurgitates cites he has 
found with search engines.

I called him on this. That's all. Finding a 5-year-old cite, obviously 
the result of searching on a them, but without even commenting on 
context or relevance, is phony.

It's the equivalent of a nonlawyer like me taking some scrap of legal 
comment and then quoting a legal precedent without any context. For 
example,

"But Lopez v. Quesedilla, 16th, 3B, IIc established decedent's writ of 
certiori, am I not correct?"

Phoniness squared.

If you don't see this, you should become a lawyer.
