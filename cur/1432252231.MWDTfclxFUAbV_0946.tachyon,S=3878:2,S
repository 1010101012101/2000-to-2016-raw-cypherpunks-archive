Riad:

Two points:

1. Goverments misdefine things whenever it fits their purposes. I
don't see that other have to automatically bow before their
definition.

2. *Even if*, for the sake of argument, we decide to use the text
you quote as a definition; I fail to see how it rules out the possibility
of nations engaging in terrorism - because of the phrase 'clandestine
agents'. Clandestine agents include secret services.

To give just two example:

When Libyan agents carried out the bombing over Lockerbie, was that
terrorism, or an act of war?

When the CIA secretly mined the harbors of Nicaragua, was that 
terrorism, or an act of war?
