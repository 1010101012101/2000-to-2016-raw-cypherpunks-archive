Everyone?  They've all told you?  Whatever.

I think anyone who objects to profanity spoken out loud in their home
is within their rights to take action, but anyone who would censor the
rest of America as well (on a list absent a declared religious overtone
or theme especially) is possessed of a certain personal problem that
goes beyond a simple decision to refrain from use of profanity.

I'm not worried about being killfiled, it doesn't stop me from reading
what others have to say and I am free to agree or disagree with what
those others have to say.  Free speech, even for the dumb (and censorious).
