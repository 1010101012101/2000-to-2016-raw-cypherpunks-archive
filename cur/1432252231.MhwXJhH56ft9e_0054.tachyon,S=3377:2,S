I'm not at all sure that a large collection of anthrax spores would look
like a powder. These things are far too small to see individually. A
mass of them would look like a paste. Any visible granularity would
either be because they had agglutinated into larger particles in some
way, or because they had been mixed with a powder as some sort of
vector.

New emergency law in UK as of this week. Up to 7 years in jail for
biowarfare hoaxes.

In a world of cheap DNA sequencing, these well-known bacteria bear their
ancestry with them like an audit trail. They are *American* anthrax. 
Why doesn't the FBI let some of those Arabs go without torturing them,
and pick up some of the workers from their own biowar labs?
