Subject: Nov-L: Wanted - cases of prosecutorial misconduct

November Members:

Please pass on the following notice to your imprisoned loved ones.

The Center for Public Integrity and veteran investigative journalist
Steve Weinberg are researching cases of prosecutorial misconduct that
lead to wrongful  convictions.

We would like to hear from anybody - prisoners, their families and
friends,  journalists, lawyers, expert and lay witnesses, jurors,
medical examiners,  police officers, judges - with evidence of
prosecutorial misconduct.

Steve Weinberg, of Columbia, Missouri, an author, is a former newspaper
reporter and  magazine staff writer.

Working with Steve Weinberg is Neil Gordon.  Neil Gordon is a research
associate at  the Center for Public Integrity, who has worked as a
lawyer.

Funding for the project comes from several sources, most prominently the
Open Society Institute in New York.

The research will be disseminated by the Center for Public Integrity,
possibly in  the form of a book from a major publisher.

Steve Weinberg and Neil Gordon plan to name names of prosecutors who
cross  the line, especially in jurisdictions where wrongful convictions
have occurred repeatedly.

Steve Weinberg can be contacted by:
E-mail: weinbergs@missouri.edu
Telephone: (573) 882-5468
Fax: (573) 882-5431
Regular mail: 807 West Blvd. South, Columbia, MO 65203

Read Weinberg's account of the Ellen Reasonover story, "Railroaded,"
which  was  published in The American Lawyer.
