There's a lot of history between the Kurds and the Russians - over two
centuries. This article covers in a number of pages, the bulk of that
history, with a bit of analysis of how the relationship is with also
USA, Turkey and Iran. A lot of information...
After reading this article, I am not so hopeful about "Rojava",
although I do still think it would be an excellent experiment, if the
power players (Russia, USA) can agree to it, to experiment with a mini
state with a political anarchist foundation. If an 'independent'
Kurdistan is carved up out of the mid east, perhaps "Rojava the
political anarchist micro state" will yet be allowed to exist within
that mini state. As a social species, we owe it to ourselves to at
least see what might come out of such an experiment...

Idea of Vladimir Putin as the 'Godfather' of Kurdistan Isn't Half as
Crazy as You Think


This article is quite short, pasted below.
I suspect "the USA thinks" it will get more influence/ control/ money
in the middle east with a separate Kurdistan... at this point in
history I can only see America's actions in a highly cynical light. Or
as the article suggests, this may also be payment for past support.

Turks Aren't Going to Like This: US Building Two Airstrips in Syrian Kurdistan
Which can mean only one thing: more US hardware for the Kurdish militias

 Joshua Grimes
2016-03-08

According to Kurdish reports US is building two airstrips in
north-eastern Syria under the control of the Kurdish YPG militia.
Asked for a comment Americans neither denied nor confirmed the reports
saying they were not "in control" of any airfields in Syria but were
"consistently looking for ways to increase efficiency for logistics".
– Obviously it's possible to have airstrips built or expanded (or ask
to have them expanded) to enhance their 'efficiency for logistics'
without taking formal control of them.

The airstrips are clearly not intended to serve as US airbases (as
Kurds also claim), but that's going to do little to comfort Ankara. US
is already delivering supplies to the Kurdish YPG, particularly in the
Syrian north-east. If airstrips are being expanded that can only mean
that such deliveries are to be increased – possibly to be delivered by
larger aircraft.

Indeed, in recent days the Kurds have been making progress against
ISIS, and have been doing so in the southern direction towards Raqqa
and along the Syrian-Iraqi border favored by the US. (Rather than in
the Kurdish-favored western direction that would see them link up with
the Kurdish Afrin corridor and seal off Syria's northern border from
Turkey completely.)

Are Kurds getting their reward for playing along?
