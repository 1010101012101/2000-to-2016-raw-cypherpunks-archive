'virtualy all assets'? Try 'their life'.

Typical libertarian bullshit, 'my money, over your life'. Libertarianism
is about money and personal image based on that. It has no ethics and no
companssion, it is 'eat or be eaten' - more 'freedom for me but not for
thee'.

Might and right measured by the all mighty god money dollar.
