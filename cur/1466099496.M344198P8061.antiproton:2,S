Thanks. I've been thinking about how to test harder. I did ICMP ping
8.8.8.8 and wget google.com, but not other packet types.

I'll take a closer look at the clients. In many cases, it was just
stock OpenVPN, or maybe with a wrapper.

Good point. I'll tweak that language.

Yes, it's why doing your own leak prevention is best. Unless the VPN
provides its own IPv6 address, disable IPv6 everywhere you can, and
block it with firewall rules. Use firewall rules to allow connections
on physical interface only to VPN server. Restrict everything else to
VPN tunnel. And make sure that you're using VPN-assigned DNS server(s)
through VPN tunnel.

But the six totally leak-free Windows VPN clients do that. Indeed,
FrootVPN and Perfect Privacy provide their own IPv6 addresses. And
FrootVPN is leak-free using stock OpenVPN, doing just server-side.

Interesting. VPN SOCKS5 port.
