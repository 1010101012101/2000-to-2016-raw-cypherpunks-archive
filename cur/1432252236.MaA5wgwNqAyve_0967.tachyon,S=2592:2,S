Yours is timeless wisdom and more, for the love of money is the root
of all evil yet ours is to give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.

Hence speaking as someone who works in Washington (though I suspect
any capitol would be as much), if you don't have money to dole out,
then nothing in the bureaucracy will give you the time of day since
you are temporary where they are not.
