US Brigadier General Erle Cocke, a major player in
the world of covert operations and the former Washington "office" of the
CIA's
Nugan Hand Bank.


Erle Cocke was a banker before a black operative - but he combined both
skills working quietly as a fixer for "every President since Truman." He
was an Alternate Executive Director of the World Bank for four years and a
member of the US delegation to the UN for two years running, with the pay
and
rank of a US Ambassador. General Cocke was also a Knight of Malta and a
Shriner Mason. He died 10 days after making his deposition.


What he says in his deposition is explosive. He leaves no doubt about the
reality of the secretive world of Collateral Trading Programmes and how they
produce "from thin air" hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars in the
blink of an electronic eye.


* Once created these slush funds are used in a variety of way. Read how.


* Find out why former Nugan Hand Bank boss, General Erle Cocke, fingers
former Citibank Chairman & CEO, John Reed.


* Learn how TRILLIONS of dollars are created in the blink of an electronic
eye for later use in covert operations.


* See how the dirty profits from the drugs n' guns trade are privately
laundered
through the banking system -- it isn't like you think it is.


* Discover the South African connection to the Nugan Hand story.


* Read how the Chinese military controlled the South African spook bank that
took over where Nugan Hand Bank left off. Why was a mainland Chinese General
in the Seventh Army region of Xin Xong running this bank?


* What was East Germany's Stasi intelligence connection to this whole
affair?


* What about the NEW French Connection? Seven months before the Berlin Wall
came down, did the French central bank issue a US$7 billion Gold Bullion
Certificate to Erich Honecker, East Germany's then Head of State?


* How do Britain's private spook and intelligence network, Executive
Outlines and Sandline, fit in to this picture?


These and many other issues are addressed in the ground-breaking story THE
PROJECT HAMMER FILE, the first of many other revelations to come.
