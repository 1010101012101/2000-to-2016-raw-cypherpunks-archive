It's been extraordinarily successful.  The US is driving itself (and a lot of
the rest of the world) nuts with terrorists-under-the-beds paranoia.  I
recently saw a replay of some speech that Bush made shortly after 9/11 where
he said something about "the terrorists wanted to demoralise? frighten? us.
This has failed", and my reaction was "Who are you kidding?".  The terrorists
have achieved their goals, and then some.  The correct response would have
been what the UK did in WWII, which was "business as usual" to let the
opposition know that they couldn't be intimidated.  In contrast, all Bush is
doing is telling them which buttons to push.

Peter.
