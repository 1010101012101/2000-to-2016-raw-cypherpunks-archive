if everyone who hates windos puts $10 in a box, you'd need quite a large
box. which makes one wonder why the guy is still alive. or why Linus is
still alive, given the fact that M$ could easily pay for the most
professional contract killers on the globe. I mean: all of them.

the only problem I have with this is that it tends to get the
figureheads killed. not the biggest assholes, but the somewhat-assholes
with a high publicity. instead of learning responsibility, government
would most likely cast a couple new protection laws. say, make it
illegal to publish a politician's name. "our president has today..."
