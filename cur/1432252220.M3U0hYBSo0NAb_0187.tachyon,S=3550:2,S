I've heard that In-Q-Tel found a lot of technology they were interested in 
acquiring that they had to turn down solely because a foreigner was 
involved in developing it. Just as vigilant as they ever were, "private 
venture capital" notwithstanding.

Of course it has a trap door, that's probably the whole point of getting it 
over there in the first place. And by the way, if you're going to question 
SafeWeb for cooperating with CIA, you might as well criticize ZeroKnowledge 
for selling a boatload of the Freedom beta to the NSA in 1999 as well. What 
did they think they wanted it for, farting around on Usenet? I bet they had 
that sucker reverse-engineered and compromised in two minutes flat. Stands 
to reason. I wouldn't trust either of them with anything significant.
