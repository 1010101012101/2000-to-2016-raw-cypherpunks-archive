I wasn't paying attention when the lne node went away,
and was a bit lost in my CP mailing list subscription
for a few months...

I subscribed to minder, but it was a _joke_ in terms
of spam and bounces and all sorts of lameness in my
cypherpunks folder _and_ my inbox.  Further, I noticed
I was no longer seeing any posts by Tim May - I might
have been missing others as well, but he was
conspicuously absent.

So, I have unsubbed from minder and subbed to
al-qeada.net - hopefully they will be closer to LNEs
level of anti-spam excellence ... questions:

1. any comments on this level of spam and bounces,
etc., I saw from minder - does al-qeada use a more
LNE-like processor ?

2. Was tim may being filtered from minder, or is he
just gone now ?

thanks.
