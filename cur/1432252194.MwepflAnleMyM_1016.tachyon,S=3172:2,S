Not exactly good analogy. The mentioned "toolmaker" behaves so recklessly
they well-deserve some serious slapping. There is a huge difference
between making a bug time to time and release patch as soon as possible,
and reckless endangering of the whole world by both lousy code,
intentionally wrong key architectural decisions, and keeping everything
and the kitchen sink on by default, including services that next to nobody
(except worms) needs - if the users need it, they should be able to click
on "Enable" on their own. Not even mentioning the tendency of the patches
(and following patches to patches) to break something else. Can't remember
when an upgrade of OpenSSH or OpenSSL or any other contemporary bug
breeder of the MS-alternative bombed any of my systems. Or when I had to
reboot instead of just restarting the updated service.

If for nothing other than for running scripts in incoming mails by
default, MSFT deserves it. (Yes, I admit bias. Having to admin a couple
machines running their software should be enough to justify it.)

Resorting to worn-out car analogies, it's quite like selling cars with
safety belts made of paper and with faulty brakes (not talking about the
occassional tendency of the mentioned cars to lose their engine, explode
in the middle of the road, or shred the luggage in the trunk). Or, if we
have to talk about tools, selling electric drills that in default
configuration tend to shatter to pieces flying around when set to highest
rpms. In such cases, a class-action lawsuit is likely to be swift.

Though I am not sure if the personal-informations-disclosure venue is the
good one.
