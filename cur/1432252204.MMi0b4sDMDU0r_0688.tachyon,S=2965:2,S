"Frankly, even before 9/11 I thought privacy was, like, rilly, rilly 
scary and all! It scares me to think about what people are doing under 
the cloak of "privacy." So, like, I'm happy that our government is 
quickly passing laws taking back all those "privacy" things in that 
Constitution thing. Like, there are no civil liberties advocates in 
foxholes. -- Cathy Rilly Rilly Young, "Irrational Magazine"

Quote of the Month: "It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; 
perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks."
