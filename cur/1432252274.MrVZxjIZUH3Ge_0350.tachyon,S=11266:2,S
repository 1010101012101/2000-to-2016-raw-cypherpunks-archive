    <P><B>Secured Data, Inc. (NASDAQ OTC:BB: SCDD)</B> is a technology
    company that is dedicated towards introducing its software and
    hardware ASP products and solutions to the overburdened judicial
    and law enforcement communities in the United States. </P>

    <P>The Company acquired its core technologies from <B>iCyber-Data,
    Inc</B>. in February of 2002, including the <B>Court Manager
    SuiteSM</B>, an ASP software package and service designed to
    seamlessly integrate data and information from various federal,
    state, and local judiciaries and agencies into a single, easy-to-use
    Internet and Intranet interface, and <B>IDNet</B>, <U>an ASP
    solution that provides law enforcement personnel in mobile locations
    with access to criminal justice databases and command-and-control
    features via wireless PDA devices</U>. The nature of the this
    one-stop, remote demonstration package also aptly lends itself
    to detailed customization, and interconnectivity with clients
    who's budgetary constraints may limit their ability to fully
    network with other agencies. <BR>

BUY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

    <P>-Increasing security concerns create an opportunity for <B>SCDD</B>
    to expand product offering.</P>

    <P>-<B>SCDD's Court Management Suite</B> beta testing has demonstrated
    increased courtroom and case management efficiency, and reduced
    court and administration costs by almost 50%.</P>

    <P>-The government <B>IT</B> marketplace is tremendous and growing
    at a <B>CAGR</B> of 8.6% from 2001's figure of $82 billion in
    revenues to an estimated $114 billion by 2005.</P>

    <P>-The market for judicial management <B>IT</B> software and
    services alone exceeds $1 billion annually.</P>

    <P>-Ready for sales - <B>SCDD</B> spent 2 years in research and
    development and $2M to develop their proprietary <B>Court Management
    Suite software</B>.</P>

    <P>-<B>SCDD</B> recently completed a successful beta-testing
    phase in 22 judicial locations, and the <B>Company</B> has already
    entered into a service contract with <B>Hillsborough County,
    Florida</B>.</P>

    <P>-<B>SCDD</B> expects to have sales exceeding $9M and achieve
    positive <B>EBITDA</B> in 2002. The Company also expects sales
    to reach <B>$71M</B> in <B>2003</B> with an <B>EBITDA</B> of
    <B>$21.5M</B> or $1.62 per share.</TD>

    <P>-<B>SCDD</B> has initiated discussions with industry leaders
    in the networking field to market the <B>Court Manager System</B>
    and <B>IDNet</B> applications, penetrating other vertical markets
    such as military operations, hospital systems and commercial
    conglomerates.<BR>
    </P>

    <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR=3D"#990000" SIZE=3D"+3">SCDD'S =
VALUATION</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

    <P><B>In our opinion, there are 2 ways to value SCDD</B>, one
    a multiple of earnings, and two a multiple of revenues. According
    to Multex, <B>SCDD</B>&#146;s peer group trades in the marketplace
    at 21.82 times earnings. Based on the company's projections of
    $1.62 per share in earnings for the 2003 fiscal year, <U>this
    would equate to a stock price of $35.34 per share</U>. If we
    take the conservative view that the company only does 20% of
    what it says it will do we are looking at a target price of approximately
    $7.09 per share in twelve months (based on <B>2003 EBITDA</B>).
    </P>

    <P>If we look to value <B>SCDD</B> on a multiple of revenues,
    then we should look no further than Alladin Knowledge Systems
    (<B>NASDAQ:ALDN</B>). <U>Unlike Alladin, <B>SCDD </B>is expected
    to be profitable in their current fiscal year</U>, the primary
    difference for the most part is, Wall Street has not heard of
    <B>SCDD</B>. If <B>SCDD</B> were to trade today in the marketplace,
    at the same multiple of revenues as <B>ALDN</B> (which is 0.5
    times), then based on the company's forecasts of $71.3 Million
    in revenues for the 2003 fiscal year, this would equate to a
    stock price of $2.67 per share. </P>

    <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR=3D"#990000" =
SIZE=3D"+3">CONCLUSION</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><BR>
    Continued concerns in the administration of the judicial system
    creates a potentially positive outlook in <B>SCDD</B>&#146;s
    revenue and earnings growth, <U>we believe that <B>SCDD</B> is
    an undiscovered (until now!) and undervalued investment opportunity
    for risk oriented investors</U>. As Wall Street uncovers <B>SCDD</B>'s
    story, we believe this could have positive effects to <B>SCDD</B>&#146;s
    share price. <BR>
