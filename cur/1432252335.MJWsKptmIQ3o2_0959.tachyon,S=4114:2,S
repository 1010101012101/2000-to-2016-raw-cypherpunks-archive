I guess there aren't many (currently) pot-smkoing persons on this list.
Apparently, pot is the number 2 cash crop in the US, after soy.
As a result of Reagun era "war on drugs", pot-growers moved indoors and also 
in the process created new monster breeds of reefer that render the best 
hash we had in the 70s "lemonade".

There was a fascinating NY Times article in the mid-90s in the subject.

Apparently, some counties in the deep south have tossed out elected sherrifs 
that were hostile to pot growers and installed "friendlier" ones. Look for 
counties were pot busts went from X to zero in a short time.

Actually, there are some technologies used by some pot growers that are 
probably of interest to Cypherpunks. Apparently, Route 95 is now famous for 
growers who move up and down between states to their various grow-locations, 
each one without enough pot to merit long term jail time. If one of the 
locations are entered, the most sophisticated growers are alerted 
electronically, and never return to tha location again. One wonders what 
cryptographic protocols are being used by said growers, and whether growers 
are able to use them properly.
