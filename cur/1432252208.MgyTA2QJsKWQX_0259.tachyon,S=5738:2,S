So, boom.  Once the finger is pointed so directly, this came tumbling
down within a day or two.

r-product-rsa-tells-customers/
http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrb=
g.html?

One mystery is left for me.  Why so much?  It clearly doesn't cost
that much money to implement the DRBG, or if it did, I would have done
it for $5m, honest injun!  Nor would it cost that to test it nor to
deploy it on mass.  Documentation, etc.

What are we to conclude was the reason for such a high cost?
Conscience sedative?  Internal payoffs?

Another theory - take a fool's money?

And, what happens to RSA now?  If this is business-as-usual, does this
mean that when the Feds show up to my door with 'a proposal' that I
should see the mutual interest in sharing my customer's data with them
by means ecliptic & exotic?  Take the 30 pieces of silver (adj. for
2000 years of inflation), and be happy they're also keeping my
struggling business in the black?  Or grey?

Or, is it the new Crypto AG?  Is RSA the new byword for sellout?  Does
RSA go out of business?  An Arthur Anderson event?

In which case I have no choice.  I have a reason to preserve the
privacy of my customers, and tell the NSA I'm not interested in their
cyanide pill patriotism.
