Anonymous writes that there is a CIA facility in Bend, 
Oregon, called CPIC/West, balancing one in Miami 
called CPIC/Miami. FAS offers a description of Miami
which references Bend:

  http://www.fas.org/irp/facility/cia_miami.htm

And to possibly flesh out the operations run out of
the Bend base, Anon points to a statement which alleges
black and criminal government doings in which 
Bend is mentioned:

  http://www.dcia.com/evergree.html

Nothing in these accounts about CIA's ISTAC.

Informative data-mining, A P, but to avoid nailing the
innocent, double check the Mueller names and
aliases, for the person listed on the NIC.gov records 
has a different middle initial from the Mueller you're 
dogging.

That name might be deception, no doubt, but it could
also be a stolen name and identity, even address,
from a real person who is unaware. If stolen, or
fictional, that might explain why the personal info 
was provided in the clear at NIC.

Still, there may be no reason to conceal anything
about the Bend faciltiy or Mr. Mueller's participation.

Perhaps an email to Mr. Mueller would be the way to find
out, so this will be cc'd to him (and Dan S at ISTAC) for a 
response.

Dear Mr. Mueller and Mr. S,

Would you please confirm that there is a CIA facility
in Bend, OR, and that the terms CPIC/West and
ISTAC are applicable to it? 

Also, could you clarify whether CIA's ISTAC is related 
to the ISTAC of the Bureau of Export Administration?

Thanks very much,

John Young

It turns out mail to dan@istac.gov refused to go from here, 
so Dan S is safely SCIF.
