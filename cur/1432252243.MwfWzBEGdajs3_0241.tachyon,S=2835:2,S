Because it means you can complete call to the POTs with no 
company-controlled switch involved, meaning no where to serve a court 
order.  Since the call could be routed through a few intermediate nodes and 
still not have too much latency traffic analysis could take longer than 
short calls.  Since the last gateway could be selected from a potentially 
large group, in major cities anyway, obtaining a phone tap in time could be 
come problematic.

Also, if long distance charges don't drop to zero soon, it means 
participating residential users could actually resell their POTS.
