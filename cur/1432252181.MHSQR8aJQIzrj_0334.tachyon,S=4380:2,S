That still means your original post was wrong.

See?  "Every photon that hits the mirror," etc.  You were under the
impression that each photon lost energy.

You were wrong.  It's not hard to admit it.  C'mon.  If you don't want
to type it, you can just cut and paste the following into a message:

---Begin cut area---

I, James Choate, was wrong.  My statements concerning the interactions
of photons with mirrors showed a clear misunderstanding of the
underlying physics.

---End cut area---
