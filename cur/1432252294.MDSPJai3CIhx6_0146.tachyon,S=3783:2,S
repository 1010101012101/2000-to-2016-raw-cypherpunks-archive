It'll probably be slashdotted by the time you get to it, but
see:

http://devrandom.net/~dilinger/

Andres Salomon, a fairly clued in RPI student, heard on
IRC that the Yankees website had been hacked. He
checked it out, noted some well-known Red Hat 
security holes, and came to the conclusion that
there had been a DNS redirect attack. Total time:
5 minutes.

The next day, the FBI raided his dorm room and
seized his computers (along with a copy of ORA's
DNS & BIND).

He described them as 'nice' -after all, they left
him his CD-Rs of mp3, divx & pr0n.
