<p>Earlier Monday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least seven civilians
near the southern city of Sidon, Lebanese officials said.</br>
The IDF in recent days had dropped leaflets on Sidon, urging civilians to
evacuate.</br>
Israel is attempting to establish a buffer zone between Israel and the
Litani -- about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of the border -- to halt the
Hezbollah cross-border rocket attacks into Israel.</br>
Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said Monday that one person was
killed in an Israeli airstrike on the southern village of Houla, not 40 as
he had earlier reported.</br>
"The massacre in Houla, it turned out that there was one person killed,"
Siniora said. "They thought that the whole building smashed on the heads of
about 40 people. ... Thank God they have been saved."</p>
