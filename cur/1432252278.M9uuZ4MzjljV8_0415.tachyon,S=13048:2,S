Yes, I can see it now.

"I'm sorry I have to tell you this Mr. & Mrs. May, but the genetic tests =
required by your insurance company have revealed that your unborn child =
has a 65% chance of developing an expensive to treat and possibly =
severely debilitating condition requiring many operations, doctor =
visits, therapy, special equipment, round the clock nursing. etc.=20

Since we have already passed this information on to your insurance =
company as required by the terms of your policy, they are recommending =
and will pay you to terminate the pregnancy and to have both you and =
your husband sterilized. Otherwise they will not pay for your pre-natal =
care, the delivery, or any future treatment of your child.

Of course you can opt for our "High Genetic Risk Policy" at $XXXXX =
thousands of dollars a month (which is probably equal to or more =
expensive than the cost of paying for the possible medical costs on your =

  Are you claiming that DNA collected by the police is then given to=20
  insurance companies?

  An audacious claim. Do you evidence to support this extraordinary =
claim?

  I will be very interested to hear which communities, which states,=20
  are doing this. So will many journalists, I hope.

  On the other hand, having heard that even getting a simple blood or=20
  saliva sample requires court action, I expect you are once again=20
  merely hand-waving.

  In the UK? I heard that in one community in the UK, in order to catch =
a
  rapist or somesuch, the police went around collecting DNA samples
  and arresting anyone who refused. After all, only someone with =
something
  to hide would refuse. Of course, this was television.

  As for insurance companies "discriminating," this is what I hope for.=20
  Those of us who don't engage in certain practices--smoking, sky=20
  diving, anal sex, whatever--should not be subsidizing those who do.=20
  This is the beauty of "opt out" plans.

  Yes, only the genetically pure deserve health care. And you are sure
  that the insurance companies won't opt you out when they get a good
  look at your DNA?

  But the first order of business is for you to support your claim that=20
  DNA is collected by the police and then shared with insurance=20
  companies.

  Actually, that's your claim. But I'm surprised that you'er so ignorant
  of cooperation between government and corporations. Maybe you
  don't actually work for a living. You are aware of drug testing in the
  work place, aren't you?
