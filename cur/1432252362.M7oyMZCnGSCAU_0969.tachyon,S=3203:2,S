Yes, but...

the word "engineer" as used here by most people measns someone who 
fixes machines. If I go to somebody's ofice and they say that I'm 
"the engineer" pride makes me say no. I'm not an engineer, I'm a 
programmer. Different think entirely

If I had to describe what I do I'd call myself a "systems 
programmer", even though that isn't  exactly what my job title is.

I'd avoid the word "engineer" because to most people it implies 
the bloke of the street who knows how to put a replacement PC card 
in, but to a few it implies some professional status and formal 
discipline, neither of which I have had anythign to do with.
