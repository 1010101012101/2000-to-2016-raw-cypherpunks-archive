Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, in a booklet entitled Political Guerilla Warfare.
Feltrinelli said that the task of the terrorist was to violate the law
openly  challenging and outraging institutions and public order in every

courts, it will be easy to denounce its harshness and repressive
dictatorial tendencies.
