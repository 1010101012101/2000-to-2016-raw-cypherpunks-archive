And this differs from normal mail how?
most free email services add advert footers, and many email servers offer
virus and spam filtering via just such a parsing method.  the Google
advertising system has for a fair while now offered a number of
"targetted" services, ranging from bought links displayed (differentiated)
on search results keyed on certain words, to targetted links for
"advertisting supported" browsing packages that are appropriate to the
websites visited using that package.  Google are careful to point out that
the actual user is in no way identified before or after the parsing - the
parsing engine merely identifies the appropriate advert, then drops the
data and moves on to the next job....

besides, if you want privacy in email, you encrypt - although the mind
boggles as to what googleads  you would get for cryptotext.
