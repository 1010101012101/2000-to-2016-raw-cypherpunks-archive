You're forgetting the "substantially" bit. Tor does reduce state power,
now, for many people. Maybe not overall, on a net basis, given how state
fascists use it. By "substantially", I mean that anonymity systems might
eventually destroy states by undermining taxation. As in Stephenson's
_Snow Crash_ or MacArdry's _Last Trumpet Project_.

They don't yet work substantially, fucktard ;)

The best _right now_ does not mean the best ever. WTF.

It's not "OK". It's what's so. The Pentagon will use any anonymity
system to fuck people.

He's not so rabid about not using Tor, I think.
