Copyright office, not the FCC

DMCA is a piece of crap though. Probably illegal as hell, but IANAL. 
Anyway it's stupid to assume a liability that is not yours to begin with 
, for the dubious prospect of obtaining an alleged limitation on said 
liablity. I notice Napster has a Designated Agent registered with the 
Copyright Office. Lot of fucking good it did them.
