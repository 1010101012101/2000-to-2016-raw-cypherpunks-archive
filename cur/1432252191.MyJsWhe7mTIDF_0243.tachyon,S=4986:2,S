	What I said is still true. Even if 'compartamentallized', the NSA is
nothing but its employees. 

	But fine, your point is that only 'some' people are doing 'bad' things
there? That whoever cleans bathrooms at the NSA doesn't know what the top
criminals are planning and doing? Mostly true, but I don't think too
relevant.  (even people who clean bathrooms at the NSA could be working
somewhere else)

	I'm saying that the members of the military are morally responsible for
the crimes of the military. You might argue that some members are more
responsible than others, but fact is, they all 'believe' in the same core
murderous principles.
