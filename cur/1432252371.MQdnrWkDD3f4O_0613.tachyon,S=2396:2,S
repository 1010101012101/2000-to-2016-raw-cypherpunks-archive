Poindexter to Quit Pentagon Post Amid Controversy 
Thu July 31, 2003 01:59 PM ET 

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - John Poindexter, the retired Navy  admiral who spearheaded two sharply criticized Pentagon  projects, intends to resign from his Defense Department post  within weeks, a senior U.S. defense official said on Thursday. 

"It's my understanding that he ... expects to, within a few  weeks, offer his resignation," the official, speaking on  condition of anonymity, told reporters. 

Poindexter was involved with the Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency's abandoned futures-trading market for  predicting assassinations, terrorism and other events in the  Middle East, and earlier with the so-called Total Information  Awareness program that drew fire from civil rights groups.
