Wrt. the first proof, it seems to me that the assumed correlation
accuracy rate of 99.9% is incredibly low, and I think that the Raccoon
recognized that by referring to sampling and retention at the end of
his post. With the targeted attack that's similar to bExample 3b in
Raccoon's post that I described in my previous comment here, where one
analyzes all exit traffic without missing packets, I would expect the
correlation accuracy (and as a result, match confidence) to
exponentially approach 100% very quickly with the number of relevant
packets seen, and extremely quickly if the traffic is interactive
(i.e., browsing).

Actually, c/n of 30% in bExample 3b is close to the 25% that's
discussed in the OP here, so let's redo the example with c/n=25% and
different correlation accuracies (leaving the other numbers intact):

(using bbc -lb)
ca  = 0.999
pm  = (1/5000) * (0.25)^2
ca*pm / (pm*ca + (1-pm)*(1-ca))

ca  = 0.999
.01233363786760166917
ca = 0.9999
.11110246894375430565
ca = 0.99999
.55555617284636495961
ca = 0.999999
.92592671467910125759
ca = 0.9999999
.99206358969515668554
ca = 0.99999999
.99920064946444143613
ca = 0.999999999
.99992000739924807495

So reducing correlation accuracy error to 10^-9 will give you 99.99%
confidence in end-to-end correlation match. I suspect that a few
seconds of interactive traffic will give you a correlation accuracy
that's much better than a 10^-9 error.
