No, it was on the compression function, but not in any sense "reduced". But
you had to start with particular values of the chaining variables, and in
practice no-one knows how to do that, so MD5 (as a whole) isn't broken by
this, at least until tomorrow evening. The rumour here is that MD5, HAVAL,
and RIPE-MD are all goners. We know SHA-0 is toast too. There might also be
results against SHA-1. Hash functions are hard.

And the reason you haven't heard any progress from Dobbertin is because his
employers told him to either stop working on it, or stop talking about it,
depending which version of the story you've heard. Since he works for the
German NSA-equivalent, I guess he would take this seriously.

Greg.
