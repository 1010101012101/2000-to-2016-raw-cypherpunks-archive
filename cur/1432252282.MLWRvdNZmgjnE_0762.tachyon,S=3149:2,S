NP. There is plenty of conductor in a laptop. What tends to be missing,
though, is shielding. In particular, laptops tend to have plastic cases.
Without a metal case, even a badly designed, at all, a little signal goes a
long way.

You also may wish to inquire with Ross Anderson or Markus Kuhn what type of
computer their group uses for the van Eck demos and why. Last I talked about
this with them, it was a laptop.

Have fun,
