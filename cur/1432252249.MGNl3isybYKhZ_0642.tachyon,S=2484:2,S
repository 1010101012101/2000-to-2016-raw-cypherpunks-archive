 From The Register:

"To download the online picture, he used the anonymising Surfola service 
(and not Anonymiser.com as we mistakenly wrote in our initial report - 
apologies to all concerned - Ed), believing the companys privacy policy 
would protect him."



So now I don't know what to believe.  Either Anonymizer was never 
involved... or they don't want it known that they sold out so they asked 
for a retraction.
