2. House panel backs civil service protections in homeland bill
By Molly M. Peterson, National Journal News Service

During a marathon markup session that dragged into the Thursday night and 
Friday morning, the House Government Reform Committee voted to ensure civil 
service protections for federal employees slated to move into the proposed 
Department of Homeland Security.

Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., offered an amendment to restore 
collective bargaining rights, health and retirement benefits and 
whistleblower protections that the new homeland security secretary would 
have been allowed to waive under the president's bill (H.R. 5005).

Burton's amendment also would modify the bill's procurement provisions and 
ensure that certain sunshine laws, such as the 1972 Federal Advisory 
Committee Act would apply to the new department.
