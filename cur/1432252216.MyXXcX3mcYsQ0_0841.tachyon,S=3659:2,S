cjdns is certainly an interesting approach, but its inventor doesn't appear
to understand:

- scaling issues

- point to multipoint networking

- that deterministic reachability is usually considered a good thing

- non-local connectivity lookup introduces hilarious denial of service
mechanisms

- the value of bitfield qos

- that the use of bEncoding for connectivity lookup is a degree or two
worse than using TLVs for the same means

- full independence from traditional ip protocols ("Router messages are
sent as normal UDP/IPv6 packets except that their UDP source and
destination port numbers are zero and the hop limit (TTL) field in the IPv6
header is set to zero.")

- that strictly symmetric routing is a bug, not a feature

- that 64 bits as a routing path mechanism is woefully insufficient for
modern networking

- that separation of control plane and data plane on a router is probably a
good idea

- throwing out the book on existing networking models is only valid if the
proposed replacement is measurably better

What's left in cjdns is a poorly specified mishmash of curious ideas which
will work fine on the author's playpen network and which will break
horribly on large networks, regardless of how hard the author waves the
"hey look at me, i'm having a revolution" flag.
