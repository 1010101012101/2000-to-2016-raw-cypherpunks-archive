Shawn Quinn, you are correct. I apologize for only giving the UPS 
information. Copying the tracking number 	92748999964015553004467996 in 
a search engine didn't bring up UPS. It brought up USPS.

I never heard of UPS Mail Innovations before. Similar to FedEx Smart. 
UPS is the initial shipper and transfers the package to USPS.

Entering the tracking number in UPS.com brought up more information. The 
URL is http://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/track If this does not bring 
up the tracking info, enter 92748999964015553004467996

I purchased the media card reader on August 8, 2014. Shipper shipped it 
from Texas on August 12, 2014. Appears to have arrived in Nashville, TN 
yesterday. Yet, won't be delivered until Wednesday:

Projected Delivery Date: 08/20/2014

I am visiting Nashville. I wasn't planning on staying that long.

Also on August 8, I ordered an external battery pack for the Nook tablet 
and MIPS tablet. I wanted to follow Ed Jamison's advice in Dragos Ruiu's 
Google+ on using external batteries to prevent powerline hacking.

I changed my address from Sarasota, FL to Nashville, TN. However, my 
address was mysteriously changed back to Sarasota, FL. I complained to 
Ebay that Ebay's and PayPal's purchase confirmation should contain the 
shipping address. It doesn't. It was not until the seller emailed the 
tracking number that I saw the shipping address. I promptly notified the 
seller of the correct address. Seller confirmed correcting address.
Today, package arrived in Sarasota, FL:
