The portion of concrete which binds it together, called "cement", is calciu=
m hydroxide, or Ca (OH)2. =C2=A0 Mixed with gravel and sand and water, this=
 makes a slurry called "concrete". =C2=A0It quickly (hours) cures (hardens)=
, and it begins to absorb CO2. =C2=A0That conversion makes old concrete har=
der and stronger than newly-poured concrete.Poured concrete continues to ab=
sorb CO2 for months, years, and even decades after it is poured. =C2=A0Howe=
ver, to make the initial cement, calcium hydroxide, =C2=A0a chemical called=
 Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) (limestone is nearly all CaCO3) is heated strong=
ly, and it emits CO2, forming calcium oxide, CaO. =C2=A0Adding a bit of wat=
er forms calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2.
So, the CO2 that curing concrete absorbs is matched by the CO2 that the CaC=
O3 originally released during the making of the calcium hydroxide. =C2=A0Fu=
rther, heating that process requires some sort of fuel, which itself usuall=
y releases CO2 as well.
