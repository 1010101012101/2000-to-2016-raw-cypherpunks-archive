Wait, Sandy, John Edward does sci-fi comedy. Like Penn and 
Teller catching bullets with teeth, David Caine levitating.
Dr. Spin on Fox, Dr. Germ in Iraq.

It's reality TV, like Dan and Tom and The Intelligent One.

Fukrisakes all is Sci Fi. Call them and bitch, or send funny
mail. Join in the tomfoolery, isn't that what Penn and Teller 
dare us.

You think they not an investor in Edward's magic?

I see you and raise.
