                         STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

      Today, I am pleased to sign an Executive Order creating a Commission
on Workers, Communities, and Economic Change in the New Economy.  I would
like to thank Representative Ken Bentsen for his leadership in helping
workers and communities adapt to the new economy and for working with my
Administration to form this Commission.

      International trade, technology, globalization, and the changing
nature of work present extraordinary new opportunities for Americans, but
can also create real disruptions for American workers and communities.
Vice President Gore and I have worked hard to empower workers and
communities to take advantage of the many opportunities in this new
economy, but there is still more we can do.  This Commission will undertake
a careful examination of the effectiveness of existing federal programs to
help workers and communities adjust to economic change, and will identify
the best practices of employers, communities, and public-private
partnerships that have responded successfully to economic dislocations.
The commission?s report, due next year, will help communities, employers,
and workers respond to and benefit from these changes in our economy.
