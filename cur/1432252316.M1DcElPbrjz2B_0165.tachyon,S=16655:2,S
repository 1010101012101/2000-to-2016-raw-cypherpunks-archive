I suspect the companies cleverly saying they do not give keys are giving
account access or emails directly, and just engaging in misleading PR spin. 
There's a lot of it been going on lately and people are seemingly niave
about reading PR spin.  (Push vs pull access to data under blanket FISA blah
blah, right).

Basically the defacto behavior of justice system supoenas for ISPs is that
they'll try to get anything you have, and they'll even try to get things
they are legally prohibited from getting.  So your best bet is to not have
anything useful to give.

Like "zero-knowledge" (spider oak, mozy online backup) meaning end2end
secure so only the user has the keys and the ISP holds cyphertext.

I do think asking for the server keys is too far, probably contravenes
multiple laws, and is ridiculously intrusive - giving access to everything.

Forward secrecy is a good step, and its confusing why not everyone is using
it.  Google apparently is.  Others not so much.  People have been talking
about that since early 1990s.  Still not prefering or enforcing forward
secret ciphersuite, seriously?

Probably time to deprecate HTTP (in favor of HTTPS) and deprecate
non-forward-secret ciphersuites, to a should-not or whathave you
(implementations might implement but must warn).

ps Pretty cool to see cypherpunks list back in action.  And first post I
read was John Youngs longer dense poetic post.  Just like old times :)
