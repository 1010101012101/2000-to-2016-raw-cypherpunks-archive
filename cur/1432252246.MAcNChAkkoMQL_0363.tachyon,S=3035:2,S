Are they?

This is analog electronics 101. All you have is to sample
that at sufficient rate on the cheap. That used to be a problem, but
no longer is

We do not want a dinky little entropy drip. We want a
regular firehose. The USB RTL samples at 1.4 MSamples/s. 
Total part costs is probably 20 USD, in bulk.

Why is nobody selling a kit like that? Because worrying about
sufficient entropy in crypto settings is a terribly niche thing.
Sadly.

Now try for a decent clock. (Hint: time-nuts. And did you
know they use CSACs for IED trigger jamming?).
