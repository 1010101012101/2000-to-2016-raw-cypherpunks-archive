Kinda like disk drives and DRAM arrays.  Its all about yield.

Perhaps, but the jpeg-ization might lose these, or at least the
image "unicity distance" might require many more pictures than
a careful steganographer will publish.

Very relevant, traffic analysis and fingerprinting (intentional or not)
are
always tasty subjects.  One question for the court would be, how many
*other* cameras have column 67 disabled?   One of every thousand?
And how many thousand cameras were sold?
