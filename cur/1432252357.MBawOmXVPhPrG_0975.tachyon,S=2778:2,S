Google has fixed the problem of buggy Chinese censorship:

Also, while we're on the topic, there's a Human Rights Caucus meeting on
Wednesday. The caucus asked Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Cisco to show,
but theyr'e not going to:

But they do plan to go to one on Feb. 15 organized by a House
International Relations subcommittee. It's chaired by Rep. Chris Smith,
R-NJ, who last week accused Google of "collaborating with their
persecutors," a reference to China:

I'm sure the hearing will be entirely fair and balanced.
