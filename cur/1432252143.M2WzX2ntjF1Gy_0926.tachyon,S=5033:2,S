Peter,

After reviewing the list I don't deny the dangers inherent in experimenting 
with these items.  My objection has to do with the federal government's 
involvement.

Over the past ten years I've made it a "hobby" to study the detailed 
legislative histories of several key constitutional amendments (e.g., the 
14th and 16th) and Supreme Court rulings on these amendments and their 
interpretations of the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper 
Clauses.  I've read the works of and discussed the findings with a number 
of Constitutional scholars (e.g., Larry Lessig and Eugene Volokh).  In 
general they support my conclusions and share a serious concern for the 
frightening lack of respect Congress and the Supreme Court have shown the 
Constitution and our liberties.  If I am right substantial portions of 
federal law passed since the Civil War (and especially since the FDR 
administration) have no basis in a clear reading of the Constitution.

I have no qualms with my state regulating many of my behaviors and 
possessions, but find the federal involvement unlawful and unacceptable in 
this area.  Most of my fellow citizens accept an almost unlimited federal 
involvement in our daily lives.  The Founders placed many safeguards in the 
Constitution to prevent this, but Congress and the Courts have found 
illegal circumventions. Most Americans would rather not know that their 
liberties have been and are continuing to be drained away by the 
unconstitutional practices of the supposed guardians of their 
liberties.  They believe that the current balance struck is the best under 
the circumstances.  In fact, they are frightened by (or consider mentally 
unbalanced or unpatriotic) anyone who would raise serious objections. I am 
left to protect my rights the best I can, even if it means violating 
unlawful regulations.

If you are one of the "many" you will probably find my ranting that of a 
loon.  If not, a good place to start your inquiry is with the recently 
published book, "The Real Lincoln," by Thomas diLorenzo 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761536418/lewrockwell/104-1710778-1366320. 
Its causing quite a stir in American historical circles.
