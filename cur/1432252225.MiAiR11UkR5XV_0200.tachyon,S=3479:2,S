Hi,
	
	I have a query wrt 'file' command in unix. 
When I give the following command the following information is displayed.

# file /usr/bin/ABSgtar

/usr/bin/ABSgtar:	COFF format alpha dynamically linked, demand paged
executable or object module not stripped - Version 3.13-12.

My question is what is this version number ?
I am sure this is not the version of the file in SCCS/RCS.

Thanks and Regards,

V.Sreenivasa Prasad.
