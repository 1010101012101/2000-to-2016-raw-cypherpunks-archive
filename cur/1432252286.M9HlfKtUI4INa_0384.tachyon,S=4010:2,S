Somebody is. Prop 8 would allow drug offenders (including low 
level dealers) to opt for treatment over prison, and would 
require all fines, seized funds, and profits from the sale of
stolen^H^H^H^H^H^Hforfeited property in drug cases to be 
used to finance treatment.

I think one other state has a similar proposition this year, and
another (New Mexico?) has had a similar law in place for a
while, to great success.

Needless to say, the police chiefs and DAs are worried that their 
profits will be eroded, and oppose it.

Since the national and state wide candidates' races are non-issues
in MA, most of the campaigning I've seen has been for and against
the various ballot measures.
