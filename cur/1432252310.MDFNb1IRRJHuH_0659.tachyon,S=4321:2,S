quoting from memory from the high-caliber discussion found on the "John 
Boy & Billy Big Show" this A.M. May be off on the details but I got the 
gist,

*click radio on"

[Female security "expert", did not catch her name]

...police are doing a good job of trying [that's a direct quote] to 
search cars parked in front of buildings [etc]...but people [now I'm 
gonna compress somewhat and use the "p" word, which she danced around.] 
should not get paranoid, see terrorists under every bush, and give up 
civil liberties, because that means the terrorists win.

....

[Some retired gasbag of a general these guys trot out for every 
altercation, police action, etc. Tom something or other.]

...I have to disagree emphatically with that. Look at Israel, where 90% 
of suicide bombers are stopped because they're on constant alert. It's 
going to take an increased, sustained, constant state of awareness of 
what's going on around you....etc....etc...

[discussion of suspicious parcels "forgotten" elided]

[Terrorism Dr. Joyce] Oh, absolutely, Take one-way plane trips, for 
example. How many people need one way tickets? Why would they want them? 
  [Insert additional comments from the show's peanut gallery here] If 
someone purchases a one-way ticket, they should be asked why.

*click off*

If an airline wants to search my luggage as a precondition of honoring 
my ticket, they're within their rights, insulting as that may be. My 
reasons for traveling are none of their business, though. Like anybody 
up to no good wouldn't have a convincing lie ready.

America, get a fucking grip.
