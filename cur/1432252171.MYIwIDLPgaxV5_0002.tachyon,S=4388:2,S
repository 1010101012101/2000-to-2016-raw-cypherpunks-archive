This thought has occurred to me, too. At least once a month, a large chunk
of the junk traffic on cpunks is a direct result of Jim's actions - either
directly
posted by him, or by people discussing his almost universally perceived lack
of clue (this message and thread are an example of this).

He is, (in my opinion) a non-asset to this group.
