   from the needs-some-liver-routing-to-round-it-out dept.
   [1]James A. Y. Joyce writes "[2]Tor is an [3]onion routing anonymous
   network. It routes your data transfers through a series of encrypted
   links between random nodes in the network; the greater the number of
   nodes, the greater the anonymity afforded. To commemorate the 100th
   verified node in the Tor network ([4]graphs of throughput and nodes
   mirrored at Imageshack), the [5]EFF are putting up a request for other
   organisations and personal users to [6]start up Tor nodes of their
   own. (Tor has been mentioned on Slashdot [7]twice [8]before.)"
