Wasn't it pointed out quite a while ago, here if no where else, that all 
digital communications and data were susceptible to covert "radiological 
tagging," including those encrypted? I don't recall what protection
against that was proposed or developed, but it was seen to be
so likely that countermeasures were essential, but not necessarily
to be disclosed publicly any more than your passphrase.

Now it is always hard to tell what are spoof vulnerabilities, disinfo,
and real ones, but spoof almost certainly outnumber the real
ones for that is a common offense against attackers: to cloud
clear and obscure vulnerabilities with confabulated clear and
obscure ones.

The way broken security continues in use to mislead those
who are dumbfounded that such cluelessness occurs: to
with the Iran security services continuing to use a cracked
crypto system after news reports about it.

Weak comsec is like orchestrated leaks, fools fall in love
with them, seduced by a belief of superiority and good fortune.

The one about the Russians one-time misuse of a one-time
pad leading to cracking VENOA as if that was all there was
to.

Telegraph hands in the old days were quite good at simulating
hands, and cross-talk in wiring was used to leak believable
information because of the faith the snoopers had that nobody
was aware of the intercepts.

William Arkin listed a few days ago on his Washpo blog some 
500 programs in use by US spooks to surveil for threats, and 
some of those might be more than smoke and sunshine but
most are sci-fi used to promote NSA pantopticonic flim-flam.

The most valuable intelligence is obtained by human betrayal
and the humongous hardware on land, undersea and space 
which gets credit is an effective cloak. Bribing for info is
still the most cost effective, but the US economy doesn't
benefit from that petty pork compared to big iron on land,
undersea and in space.
