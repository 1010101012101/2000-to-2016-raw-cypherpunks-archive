Patent Abstract

The Spread Spectrum Image Steganography (SSIS) 
of the present invention is a data hiding/secret communication 
steganographic system which uses digital imagery as a cover 
signal. SSIS provides the ability to hide a significant quantity 
of information bits within digital images while avoiding detection 
by an observer. The message is recovered with low error 
probability due the use of error control coding. SSIS payload 
is, at a minimum, an order of magnitude greater than of 
existing watermarking methods. Furthermore, the original 
image is not needed to extract the hidden information. The 
proposed recipient need only possess a key in order to reveal 
the secret message. The very existence of the hidden 
information is virtually undetectable by human or computer 
analysis. Finally, SSIS provides resiliency to transmission 
noise, like that found in a wireless environment and low levels 
of compression.
