exactly.

now how can we achive that.

like everyone else - i love the show.  sex is better.  the prices are
dropping.  so i can't really complain from the consumers point of
view.  however i am a human being and i do think it's time we get our
demented politicians to stop this crap once and for all.

so how to do this bill.

i personally think we should maybe make laws to hang politicians.  start
hanging them petty crimes they commit against us - i.e. environmental
polution and we can work up from there.

but i'm a bit of a radical and am willing to listen to other options.

anyone have ideas.

regards
joe
