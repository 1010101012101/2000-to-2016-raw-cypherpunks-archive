            <p class=body2>With offshore sports gaming now 
              a multi-billion dollar industry, it can be difficult for the consumer 
              to separate the reputable sports book from the less so, the exceptional 
              from the merely average. My staff and I, with the help of other 
              industry pros, have investigated many of the present offshore operations. 
              Those that met or surpassed our standards for 2001 are included 
              in this report.<br>
              </p>
            <p class=body2>Our analysis has shown that these 
              offshore sports books are honorable and financially strong, but 
              we welcome your experiences. Send your comments, positive or negative, 
              to Sheridan Specials, Inc., P.O. Box 2122, Mobile, AL 36652, 1-251-476-1122.</p>

              800 7777 – </b><a href="http://www.HeritageSports.com" 
     ><b>www.HeritageSports.com</b></a><br>
              An industry pioneer, Heritage was one of the first sports books 
              to open offshore. They brought a passion to build the most well-run, 
              customer service-focused company in the business – and they’ve 
              done it. They’re one of the most creative sports books I’ve 
              ever seen when it comes to developing new promotions, such as special 
              wagers and enhanced parlay odds during their weekday “Madness 
              Hours, ” “almost parlays,” and “if” bets 
              when you’re out of available credit. Even in the strong field 
              listed here, Heritage’s consistent dedication to providing 
              the best product at the best value has impressed me enough to select 
              them as my pick as the best of the best for 2001 and the #1 sports 
              book in the world. <br>
              </p>
            <p class=sport><b>Tradewinds – 800 387 9358 
              – <a href="http://www.tradewinds.co.cr" 
     >www.tradewinds.co.cr</a></b><br>
              A very low-key sports book, with one huge, differentiating factor 
              that didn’t slip our investigation. They take the biggest bets 
              I’ve heard of and, most important, they pay. This no-nonsense 
              shop takes bets ranging from $10 to whatever you arrange over the 
              phone. I haven’t heard of a maximum refused yet. The underground 
              stories told of bets paid off by Tradewinds are impressive. You 
              can feel comfortable including this operation in your list of “outs.”</p>
            <p class=sport><b>Olympic – 888 Fast Bet 
              (327 8238) – </b><a href="http://www.TheGreek.com" 
     ><b>www.TheGreek.com</b></a><br>
              No one beats the Greek in putting up the first line in the world 
              many days – and I mean on about every game and proposition 
              you can think of. The “Greek” is a gambler and if you’re 
              one too, then Olympic will probably give you more opportunities 
              than you’re going to find just about anywhere to gamble it 
              up. This is a solid shop, run by a man who is one class act with 
              a lot of heart.</p>
            <p class=sport><b>ABC Sports – 800 260 3415 –</b> <a href="http://www.ABCIslands.com" 
     ><b>www.ABCIslands.com</b></a><br>
              ABC Sports opened in the Caribbean several years ago, in what I 
              call the second wave of sports books to select an offshore haven 
              - a move that didn’t seem to slow them down in becoming a top 
              sports book. They are well-managed, motivated (especially this year, 
              with the return of their old manager) and take care of business 
              in a quick, efficient manner. Their claim to fame: They offer clients 
              the world’s absolute best teaser prices.<br>
            </p>
            <p class=sport><b>Royal Sports – 800 644 
              3846 –</b> <a href="http://www.BetRoyal.com" 
     ><b>www.BetRoyal.com</b></a><br>
              Royal Sports moved to the Caribbean in the “second wave,” 
              like ABC Sports. While these two sports books were obviously the 
              cream of their class, they offer very different styles. Royal is 
              a much more laid-back book , but don’t let that fool you. Every 
              member of Royal’s management I’ve met takes a tremendous 
              pride in the consistent level of quality service their clients receive 
              day in and day out. I don’t believe there’s a sports book 
              out there that gets you your money any faster, making them another 
              in a handful of world-class sports books.<br>
              </p>
            <p class=sport><b>WIT Sports – 800 416-4031 
              – </b><a href="http://www.WitSportsbook.com" 
     ><b>www.WitSportsbook.com</b></a><br>
              A slew of new sports books opened their doors last year. There aren’t 
              many left. So I can’t help but acknowledge the accomplishments 
              of first-year sports book WIT as my “Rookie of the Year.” 
              WIT stands for “Whatever It Takes” (to please a customer) 
              and they put their money where their mouth is. Like Olympic, WIT 
              puts out a lot of propositions and they put them out early. That 
              confidence is pretty impressive for a couple of new kids on the 
              block. WIT is a solid sports book – at their current pace it 
              shouldn’t be long before they could join the elite list of 
              top sports books.</p>
