You can run RS over Tor. In fact, IIRC RS is in Whonix.

RS could have profited from a less is more approach. E.g. running NNTP
could have allowed you to use standard clients. In general I'd much
prefer to connect with known (SMTP, IMAP) protocols to localhost rather
than poking an unstable, monolithic blob with usability from hell.
