They can go downvote everything, smoke weed, work crypto,
and inject whatever they care about... being random selection,
that's representative too. Certainly no worse than the level of
care given by some in existing governments.

As a culture, selected people should be paid to go, free
to return to where they left upon term limits, etc. Such that
conscious objectors would be the only ones not there.
Certainly other things they'd think about... remaining
independant, serving the people, etc. Who knows what
makes people go or not go.

Get in, fix some problem at hand, leave. That's not bad either.
