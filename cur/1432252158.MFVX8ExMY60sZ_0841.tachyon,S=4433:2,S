If the U.S. wasn't in an undeclared 'war', this would be considered
an unfunded mandate.  Does anyone realize the cost involved?  Think
of all the spam that needs to be recorded for posterity.  ISPs don't
currently record the type of information that this is talking about.
What customer data backup is being performed by ISPs is by and large
done by disk mirroring and is not kept permanently.

I did a bit of back of the envelope calculation and the cost in the
U.S. approaches half a billion dollars a year in additional backup
costs a year without any CALEA type impact to make it easy for law
enforcment to do data mining.  The estimate could easily be low by a
factor of 5-10.  AOL of course would be hit by 40 percent of this
though, not to mention a nice tax on MSN.  Call it ten cents a day
per customer in fee increases to record all that spam for review by
big brother.  I feel safer already.

Whats next, censorship?
