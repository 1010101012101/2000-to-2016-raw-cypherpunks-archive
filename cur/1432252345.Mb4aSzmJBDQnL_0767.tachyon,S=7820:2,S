Let me try to restate John's proposal, which has some very attractive 
qualities. There are a few questions, it seems to me:

1. Should we require by law that government employees never act under cover 
of anonymity? (In practice, what does that mean? Does that mean they can't 
lie about their truename, or does it mean that they have to affirmatively 
volunteer their employment status?)

2. Since the people enforcing this hypothetical law are the same people 
with the greatest incentives to violate it, what makes a disinterested 
observer believe that it will be effective? If we're not interested in 
effectiveness, why don't we just pass a law saying "no more police 
brutality" or "no cop shall violate someone's civil liberties?"

3. Since the people regulated by this hypothetical law who would object to 
it have innumerable allies in the legislatures of this fair nation, what 
makes a disinterested observer believe that this proposal could ever be 
anything more than a thought experiment?

4. Should privacy-providing companies pledge to disclose the identities of 
their .gov purchasers? Do we think that .govs will follow this rule, or use 
cutouts? Will it be effective when the tools can be freely downloaded or 
bought at CompUSA?

Me, I tend to think that federal agents shouldn't be infiltrating U.S. 
political parties, that the extent of undercover police work could be 
profitably scaled back quite a bit, that the IRS has few if any reasons to 
send its agents undercover, and that intelligence agencies have no business 
running operations domestically. Contrary to what John says, I'm happy to 
look critically at "homeland defense plans" -- what I've said is simply 
that this HD campaign has not yet eroded our civil libertes to the point 
where we have none. Be concerned, but not terrified.

I think John has a valid point when he says that we should look askance at 
anonymity firms that help government spy on us. Companies would be 
well-advised to make their practices (we sell to Feds, we refuse to sell to 
Feds) public. But the market being what it is, the tools so well-discussed 
in so many circles, and the switch from .mil or .gov to .org or .com so 
easy, that I suspect such promises might give us only a false sense of 
security.
