Well, that's true. It's a point I've made on Cypherpunks many times, that 
many economic, political, or legal analeses of other countries (particularly 
non-Indo-European) only hold up at the surface...
My comment was more general, and not necessarily aimed at Germany per se. 
For instance, there theoretically seems to be laws about everything in 
Italy, but nobody seems to obey them and they are only enforced 
half-heartedly, and for as long as it's in vogue to give a crap.

Likewise, Communist "Land Reform" in mainland China isn't communist so much 
as it's Chinese: land reform and nationalisation of salt production and 
other industries have regularly occurred throughout Chinese history. 
"Communism" in mainland China was a mask that seemed to last about as long 
as Mao was alive. (Of course, the hardheads on this list will reply by 
saying that Chinese culture has always been more "communistic" than other 
countries, but then this statement ignores just how truly capitalist China 
has become since 1984 or so. It remains oppressive, of course, if you're 
discussing the wrong subjects....)

Yes...because we Americans have only had one government, we tend to equate 
"legality" with morality, and then assume the discussion is over. No doubt 
that causes us to look at laws "over there" as being far more important than 
they really are...at least some times.
