By the way, "consensus" is a red herring thrown out by those who never want
there to be a fork. There can never be consensus for a fork, because
otherwise it wouldn't be a fork. Claiming there needs to be consensus is
just a way to try to make it look like any fork is somehow unilateral and
undemocratic. But to succeed, any fork by definition needs broad support.
In fact, it's about the most democratic you can get: people put their money
and their mining power on the fork they want. It's those opposing any fork
who are the authoritarians. Obviously, when you consider who's making the
death threats.
