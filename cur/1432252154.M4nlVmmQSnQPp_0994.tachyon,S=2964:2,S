Sandy sandfart... wrote ...Is "free range bank" supposed to convey some 
sort of meaning? a) Define "free range bank." b) Give three examples. 
(There are "a lot" of them "out there," right?)
Clearstream and another clearinghouse, Euroclear -- based in Brussels -- 
transfer titles in 150 million transactions each year, involving more than 
US$7 billion in assets. At the discretion of Clearstream, clients can open 
non-published accounts that do not figure in any printed document or record 
of international financial transactions. When law enforcers ask to see 
records, they don't exist.
Also there was a story on the 400 banks on nauru some of whom laundered the 
billions looted from russia,What if hawala
works,Hawala's good.Its more about trust and initial inertia being problems 
than anything else.
As sandy is such a doubting thomas he must immediatly arouse suspicion as a 
fed.yours etc toto,sorry matt.
