Liar, check the archives. I never said anybody was dangerous. What I did
say was that I felt the C-A-C-L philosophy was dangerous. I stand by that.
I believe that were the C-A-C-L philosophy to take hold the results would
make the death counts from Nazism and Communism in this century pail in

As to you, the only thing I told them was you worked for Intel, made some
money, retired, live out in the boonies with a bunch of guns, and talked a
lot of crap.

Stand by that too.
