They use Russian Zenit rockets which are loaded on the platform in Long Beach then the launch platform and command and support ships move to equatorial waters for the launch.  And you're absolutely right, SeaLand can't support that sort of operation, nor does it provide an equatorial launch site.

Which is irrelevant because nobody but you, Tim,  Declan, and the rest of
the Peyote Pete Club was talking about anything like this.

For people that seem to be so sophisticated, it's surprising you don't
understand concepts like 'amateur rocket' or 'can-sat'.
