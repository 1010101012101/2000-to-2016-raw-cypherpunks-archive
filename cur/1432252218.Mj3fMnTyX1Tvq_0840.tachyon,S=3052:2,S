Get yer draconian Blunkett rhetoric here
By Lester Haines (lester.haines at theregister.co.uk)
Published Wednesday 24th November 2004 09:31 GMT

Those readers who are following the magnificent meanderings of UK home
secretary David Blunkett as he moves the UK inexorably towards
voluntary/compulsory ID cards
(http://www.cashncarrion.co.uk/?op=catalogue-products-null&prodCategoryID=28)
in an attempt to stem the tide of swan-roasting illegal immigrant members
of al-Qaeda who threaten the very fabric of our society will certainly
enjoy Chris Applegate's David Blunkett Policy Maker
(http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/other/blunkett.php).

This nifty piece of programming is designed to deliver "draconian rhetoric,
whenever you want it", and can instantly formulate a Blunkett-style policy
guaranteed to make Britain a safer, more loving place. For example:

Give refugees a 'Citizenship test', and then deny them the right to trial
by jury. And charge them for it.

Quite right too. Applegate warns users that: "The random generator can
generate actual policies that Blunkett has launched. I take no
responsibility for any distress caused by sudden realisation of the truth,
nor any feelings of fear, doom etc. for one's own civil liberties." You
have been warned. .
