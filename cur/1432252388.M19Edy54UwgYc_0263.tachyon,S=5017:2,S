What is the basis for this claim about the NSA having such expertise 
and technology? Paranoia, ESP, cluelessness, or actual knowledge?

Do you believe, for example, that the NSA knows how to factor very 
large numbers?

Do you believe they have a dramatically faster factoring algorithm 
than any mathematicians suspect exists?

I would also ask if you think the NSA has some hidden supply of 
computers, except we both know there aren't enough places in the 
solar system to park the numbers they would need to brute force 
readily-attainable key sizes.

So, could you explain your first comment?

After that we can move on to your "fear the corporations, not the 
government" bit of cluelessness.
