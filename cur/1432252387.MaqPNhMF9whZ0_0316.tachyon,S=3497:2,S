I am currently doing market research for a client  --
Company Nurse(r). They reduce your worker's compensation
Insurance cost.

I was interested in finding out what advantages you see for your company to
use Company Nurse.

I have included some basis information for your review.

I would really appreciate your input :)

patricia@sellingwithtechnology.com or http://www.companynurse.com/index/

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Just like having your own nurse on site

What the Company Nurse(r) Does!!!

* Eliminates 1/3 of workers' compensation claims
* Decreases the number of claims incurring disability costs by 2/3
* Decreases emergency room referrals by 80%

What the Company Nurse(r) provides:

Telephonic triage and first aid advice to injured employee's helps to
eliminate 1/3 of potential claims.

Referral to appropriate level of medical care decreases emergency room
referrals by 80%.

Completion of claim forms, and documentation for employers and claims
administrators within minutes of the injury.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Again thank you for your Help.
