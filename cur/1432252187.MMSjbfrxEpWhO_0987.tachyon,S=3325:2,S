We have a NSIS automated build process. So anyone can now build xB
Browser based on the SVN repository. It takes any version of xB Browser
you select, and then builds that against the latest library files, the
result is a fully completed XeroBank Browser Installer file, not just
the package.

Steve Topletz

The short version:

compile XeroBank Installer.nsi

The long version:

svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Installer - Main build directory.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Library - Static files of Tor,
Firefox, and profile. Replace as you please.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Latest - Latest build of xB
Browser, installer looks for xBBrowser.exe from this directory.

1. First you designate which xB Browser version you want. Installer by
default selects the "Latest" directory, but you can change this in
Installer/XeroBank Installer.nsi, at the PACKAGEVER definition. For
example "2.0.0.10a".

2. Make sure a xB Browser executable is available to make into the
package. Whatever directory you selected for PACKAGEVER, be sure to
compile _build.nsi first to generate a xBBrowser.exe.

3. Update the Library directory to include any version of Tor or Firefox
you like. Tor is at App/tor, Firefox is at App/Browser, Portable PuTTY
is at App/Xerobank/XeroBankPlus.exe, Firefox browser profile is at
Data/Browser.

4. Compile XeroBank Installer.nsi, and it will pack up the xB Browser
executable and all the library files in App and Data. The result is a
complete installation program.

This doesn't yet go to the web and snag the latest tor and firefox, but
it's a lot further along. The next version will probably break apart the
library directory. If you are missing any plugins, they are included in
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbmisc/Plugins.zip
