Hi all, thanks for the detailed responses on this thread. 

I'm trying to understand how weak BGAN, Thuraya, Iridium encryption could be. For example one of them claims in its site that "Thuraya's integrated satellite communication solutions are rapidly deployable, employ the highest level of encryption, and are proven in meeting exacting security standards for use in the field."

Beyond the ability that some may have to detect the location of a call/connection and log their calls, how true is that their encryption can protect the contents of the information transmitted? Is the risk the same for each voice/data/text?

Is part of the solution to use encryption modules like http://www.shoghicom.com/thuraya-encryption.html?

Thanks,
Enrique

Thuraya is easy to monitor. It's not even expensive. There are
commercial solutions and there are non-commercial projects that work
with common hardware. Satellite communication networks are absolutely
not secure to use without additional protection. If location anonymity
is important, I highly advise against using satellite communications
technology. Unless you've properly tampered with the device to falsify
the location reporting, you're probably not as secure as you'd like...
