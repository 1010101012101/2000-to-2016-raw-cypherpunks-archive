For starters, why don't you start writing in standard English?

Even if English is not your first or second language, using such 
"cutisms" as "u" for "you" and
"any 1" for "anyone" is much more misleading than using the standard, 
defined words.

We mostly get rid of Choate's rants, we get rid of nearly all of "mattd" 
spews, but now we have "gfs pedo" as our new nutcase. Some sort of 
conservation of strangeness, I guess.

Or, in your non-Earth language:

u ask more quest shuns than any 1 kneads too..i peep u r a troll.
