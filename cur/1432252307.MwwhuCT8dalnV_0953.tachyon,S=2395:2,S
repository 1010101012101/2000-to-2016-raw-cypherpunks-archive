   from the can-I-borrow-a-cup-of-data? dept.
   An anonymous reader wrote to let us known about a News.com story
   regarding so-called [1]trusted computing, and its adoption by the
   major PC manufacturers. From the article: "The three largest computer
   makers--Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM--have started selling desktops
   and notebooks with so-called trusted computing hardware, which allows
   security-sensitive applications to lock down data to a specific PC."
   Interestingly, while Microsoft is said to be behind the idea support
   won't be forthcoming for trusted computing until they release Longhorn
   next year, making this a hardware-vendor lead initiative.
