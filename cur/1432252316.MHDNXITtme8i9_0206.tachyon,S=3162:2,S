Los Alamos develops quantum crypto system

LOS ALAMOS, N.M.  Engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have 
developed what they believe is a practical quantum cryptographic system. 
The system features two portable units that can encrypt and decrypt 
information transmitted via photons. Experiments have shown that encryption 
keys can be sent via free-space transmission at distances of up to 6 miles. 
The system could be used to ensure safe communications between satellites.

Quantum cryptography uses the fundamental law of quantum mechanics: Any 
observation of a system changes its state. Since photons are elementary 
particles, they are subject to the law. If a third party attempts to "tune 
in" to the encrypted transmission, the quantum state of the photons will 
change, allowing the eavesdropping to be detected.
