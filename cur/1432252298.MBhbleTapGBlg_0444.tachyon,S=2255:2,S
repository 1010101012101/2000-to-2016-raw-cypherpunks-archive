I've been watching this shit throwing match between Troy and Cari for
the last few days and, let me just say, both of you need to GROW THE
FUCK UP. I don't give a rats ass if Cari is a 'real Indian' or just some
crazy bitch pretending to be one and I don't give a fuck if Troy is
offended by her pretending. 

This list is NOT the place for this bullshit. Get a room and fuck it out
or just take it off-list but keep us the hell out of it.
