This is such a joke.

In 2000, at the rump session of the International Conference on Financial
Cryptography (FC00 to its friends), Paul Harrison and I got up after a few
beers and had a Letterman-esque "Break this Mickey Mouse Projector
Protocol" contest about an encrypted-to-the-projector movie-distribution
scheme proffered by a, heh, entertainment conglomerate, earlier that year.
The protocol was this belt-and-suspenders monstrosity, encrypted seven ways
to Sunday, practically collapsing into a singularity of its utter "provably
secure" canonicity.

The winner, of course, was a simple question: "And, *where*, exactly, do we
put the CCD?".

Meaning that if *any* part of the scheme involves photons going through the
air to someone's eyes, you can replace the eyeballs with a camera, and ...
heh ... Walt's your uncle.

Cheers,
RAH
