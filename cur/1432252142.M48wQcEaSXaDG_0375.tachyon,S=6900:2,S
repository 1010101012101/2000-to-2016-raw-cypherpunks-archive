"""
The English language contains numerous euphemisms related to dying,
death, burial, and the people and places that deal with death. The
practice of using euphemisms for death is likely to have originated
with the magical belief that to speak the word "death" was to invite
death; where to "draw Death's attention" is the ultimate bad fortune:
a common theory holds that death is a taboo subject in most
English-speaking cultures for precisely this reason...

Someone who has died is said to have passed on, checked out, cashed in
their chips, bit the big one, kicked the bucket, keeled over, bit the
dust, popped their clogs, pegged it, carked it, was snuffed out,
turned their toes up, hopped the twig, bought the farm, got zapped,
written their epitaph, fell off their perch, croaked, gave up the
ghost (originally a more respectful term, cf. the death of Jesus as
translated in the King James Version of the Bible Mark 15:37), gone
south, gone west, gone to California, shuffled off this mortal coil
(from William Shakespeare's Hamlet), run down the curtain and joined
the Choir Invisible, or assumed room temperature (actually a
dysphemism in use among mortuary technicians). When buried, they may
be said to be pushing up daisies, sleeping the big sleep, taking a
dirt nap, gone into the fertilizing business, checking out the grass
from underneath or six feet under.

Euthanasia also attracts euphemisms. One may put one out of one's
misery, put one to sleep, or have one put down, the latter two phrases
being used primarily with dogs, cats, and horses who are being or have
been euthanized by a veterinarian. (These terms are not usually
applied to humans, because both medical ethics and law deprecate
euthanasia.)

Some euphemisms for killing are neither respectful nor playful, but
instead clinical and detached, including terminate, wet work, to take
care of one, to do them in, tooff, or to take them out. To cut loose
or open up on someone or something means "to shoot at with every
available weapon". Gangland euphemisms for murder includeventilate,
whack, rub out, liquidate, cut down, hit, take him for a ride, string
him up, cut down to size, or "put him in cement boots," "sleep with
the fishes" or "put him in a concrete overcoat," the latter three
implying disposal in deep water, if then alive by drowning; the
arrangement for a killing may be a simple "contract" with the victim
referred to as the "client," which suggests a normal transaction of
business.

One of the most infamous euphemisms in history was the German term
Endlösung der Judenfrage, frequently translated in English as "the
Final Solution of the Jewish Question", a systematic plan for genocide
of the Jews. Even if not associated with the Holocaust, the Nazis used
such terms as Schutzhaft, best translated as "protective custody" for
persons seeking shelter from street violence by Nazi militias, but
such shelter leading quickly to long-term incarceration in a Nazi
prison for political offenders who often got murdered, and
Sonderbehandlung, whose translation "special treatment" implies
privileged protection but in practice meant summary execution. Nazi
officials authorized the disappearance of hostages into 'night and
fog' (Nacht und Nebel) whence few returned. "Charitable Ambulances"
for the buses which took mental patients away to killing centers, and
"Lazarett" (a quarantine clinic for ill travelers) for the
shooting-pits where severely ill death camp arrivals would be
executed.
