does the family see an outlet/standing to sue the prosecutor or the state
or FBI ????

i just watched the gibney film on scientology and i have so many times
looked for ways to counter the state within this kind of action

in gibneys film it states that the IRS was effectively sued into granting
the "church" of scientology tax free status - which meant life or death for
scientology as they owed tons of money in back taxes

Questions I&#39;d ask his defense team, if I were there:<br>
<br>
Has your client received a fair offer from the prosecution? Did the<br>
prosecution ever address DeHart&#39;s allegations of torture in FBI custody=
?<br>
Has the judge made any ruling or evaluation of those claims of torture?<br>
If DeHart is pleading guilty for failure to appear, should he not<br>
receive credit for time served in immigration detention in Canada? At<br>
the dismissal hearing, why did your team not cite the 2012 case of<br>
vindictive prosecution in that same federal district, against your same<br>
prosecutor, which resulted in charges being dismissed? What will the<br>
rest of Matt DeHart&#39;s life look like, after this case?<br>
<br>
For his parents (who are lovely people, and will try to help you to the<br>
best of their abilities):<br>
How has standing up for your son changed your lives? What did you grow<br>
up believing about American values and law enforcement? What do you<br>
believe now? Has your son&#39;s experience made you activists? What do you<=
br>
feel are your key causes?<br>
<br>
For the prosecutors:<br>
Why the years&#39; long persecution, the violent interrogations, the seizur=
e<br>
of property and threats against family, to take a plea that essentially<br>
amounts to receiving CP from a teenager who took a selfie, (I didn&#39;t<br=
>
even know one could be charged with a crime for the text messages one<br>
merely received these days!), and fleeing the jurisdiction, which is a<br>
new charge stemming from the defendants actions taken after the<br>
aggressive persecution began, and the alleged torture? Doesn&#39;t that kin=
d<br>
of make you look like an incompetent prosecutor? Do you think that<br>
DeHart deserves seven years in prison and ten years on the sex registry<br>
and living without a passport and with a criminal record, do you think<br>
that is proportional to what you are now saying happened?<br>
<br>
Good luck at the hearing, I hope it goes as well as it can possibly go,<br>
which is: it&#39;s going to be terrible.<br>
<br>
My heart breaks for this family every time I think of what they have<br>
gone through.<br>
