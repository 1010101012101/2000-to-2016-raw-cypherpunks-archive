You could set up a remailer which is never an exit point for mail,
so that your ISP never gets the flak.  This could still provide an
entrance point (e.g., SSL'd webform to encourage use) and also participate
in the randomly-store-and-forward mix-infrastructure.

This of course regresses the problem to the exit nodes.  But it encourages
more anonymizing infrastructure.
