For civil suits, see 42 USC 1983 and 1985. For criminal actions, see
18 USC 241 and 242; unfortunately, the criminal sections are only of
interest to federal prosecutors. The rest of us need to use civil
suits; against federal agents, it's not a 1983 action, but one under
federal common law, a la _Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents_, a Supreme
court case whose citation eludes me at the moment.
