<<south africa and germany>>

You can throw the post-Civil War American south into the mix, too. Some
Southern politicians were distressed that shop-keepers were dealing with
negroes, and passed laws to prevent that. This resulted in the first
section of the 14th Amendment (for our non-American readers, the key
point is all American citizens get equal protection of the laws). It
wasn't individual discrimination that was a serious problem; as Tim
says, self-interest drove at least _some_ merchants to ignore any
prejudices they might harbor. It was state-mandated discrimination that
caused the federal remedy.
