To repeat for those who came in late.  To stop such copying 
requires a ban on general purpose computers, and the licensing of 
engineers.  Presumably existing computers would not at first be 
criminalized, but new computers would require a special license, 
that would be available only to the specially privileged.

The hardware implementation of a crippled computers for the masses
would be identical to palladium -- except that the palladium
component, instead of merely truthfully reporting whether the
computer is running unauthorized software, would prevent any
unauthorized software from running.

The trouble with palladium is that though it is not quite what the 
RIAA wants, it is alarmingly close.
