Interesting. And of course it fits with why "exorcism works."

Like other forms of sympathetic magic--voodoo, for example--it works 
by the power of belief and suggestion. Those who believe in all the 
stuff about eating the body of Christ, drinking his blood, being 
possessed by evil demons, speaking in tongues, etc., are the ones 
most inclined to become possessed.

And when Ritalin won't work, maybe killing a few chickens or 
spritzing with holy water will chase dem demons out.
