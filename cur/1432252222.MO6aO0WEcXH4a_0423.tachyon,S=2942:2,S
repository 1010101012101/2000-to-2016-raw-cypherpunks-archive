Ah, but would you or I know that it had been broken? You've missed my
point, Choate. Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities happens
because of researchers and groups who work for recognition.

If people cannot gain recognition for having broken a system, they will
not profit from revealing that said system is broken, unless perhaps they
are the developers of a competing system.

So, perhaps Sprint or AT&T or one of the CDMA/TDMA cell network providers
would have put researchers on the problem of breaking A5/1... but who else
would have had the motivation *and* would benefit from the public knowing
that it wasn't secure?

And besides, I think it would probably have been less legal for Sprint to
reverse-engineer GSM than the SDA/Berkeley folks.


So my point stands. Systems will still be broken, but will be broken by
the "bad guys" and the public will not be notified.
