New breakthrough technology safely and effectively treats dry, irritated skin associated with eczema and atopic dermatitis without steroids.
 If you're using heavy, greasy creams, you already know they don't work.
TRICERAM is the only moisturizer clinically proven to reduce eczema
symptoms in 21 days. Give your skin the natural lipids it needs to repair itself.
</p>
<p align=center>
                               GIVE YOUR SKIN TRICERAM.
</p>

<p>Unlike petrolatum and mineral oil based moisturizers that artificially coat
the skin, TRICERAM contains a unique combination of natural lipids that
allows the skin to heal itself. This unique formulation is based on a
patented ceramide dominant ratio of epidermal lipids clinically proven to
repair and restore healthy barrier function (your skin's natural moisture
barrier). This patented technology was developed by leading dermatologists
at The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In a recent
completed clinical study conducted at UCSF, daily use of TRICERAM resulted
in a significant reduction of severity of eczema in just 21 days.
</p>
<p>
TRICERAM is completely safe for long-term use and safe for all skin types,
including sensitive. The key lipids used in TRICERAM are the very same
lipids that occur naturally in the skin, which dramatically reduces skin
sensitivity and irritation.
</p>
<p>
Seeing is believing.
