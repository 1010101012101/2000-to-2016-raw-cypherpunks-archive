Speaking as a non-American, you guys have big problems concerning the
nexus of cryptography and politics.

I really, really doubt that.  I don't really wish to attack the
author, but the style and phraseology is pure PR.  Ordinary people do
not write PR.  Nor do they lay out political strategies and refer to
their commander-in-chief as the supreme leader.  Nor indeed are
employees of military and intelligence *permitted to talk to the
press* unless sanctioned at high level.

Of course, Americans talking to Americans might be one debate.  But
then there are Americans talking to the world, and people talking to
people.

It should be remembered that espionage is illegal, and the activities
of the NSA are more or less illegal *outside their borders*.  I give
them no permission to monitor me or mine, and nor does any of the laws
of my land(s).

The fact that we cannot stop them doesn't make it any less legal.  The
fact that there is a gentleman's agreement between countries to look
the other way doesn't make it any less palatable to us
non-gentlepersons excluded from the corridors of powers.

And all that doesn't make NSA mathematicians any less a partner to the
activity.  Any intelligence agent is typically controlled and often
banned from overseas travel, because of the ramifications of this
activity.

In two paras above, and the next two paras below, this 'mathematician'
lays the political trap for Americans.  The collection by the federal
government of data is almost certainly unconstitutional.  Yet,
everyone acts as if that's ok because ... we live in the new world of
Big Data?

 data that NSA has access to, which I feel misses the critical point.

Unless one subscribes to the plain wording of your (American)
constitution...

 on a daily basis, that these rules and the oversight and compliance practi=

cans.

ditto, repeat.

Although, to be honest, we-the-world don't care about it;  the USG's
temptation to rewrite the constitution in the minds of its subjects is
strictly a domestic political affair.  For most other countries, the
Big Data genie is truly out of the bottle, and there's precious little
we can do about it.

I seriously doubt that.
