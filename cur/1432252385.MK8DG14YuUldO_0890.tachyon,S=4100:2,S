Researchers Develop Quantum Processor By Jay Wrolstad
January 12, 2006 11:57AM

A computer chip based on the esoteric science of quantum mechanics has
been created by researchers at the University of Michigan. The chip
might well pave the way for a new generation of supercomputers.

Employing the same semiconductor-fabrication techniques used to create
common computer chips, the Michigan team was able to trap a single
atom within an integrated chip and control it using electrical
signals.

...

Electrically charged atoms (ions) for such quantum computers are
stored in traps in order to isolate the qubits, a process that is
essential for the system to work.

The challenge is that current ion traps can hold only a few atoms, or
qubits, and are not easily scaled, making it difficult to create a
quantum chip that can store thousands or more atomic ions. A string of
such atoms, in theory, could store thousands of bits of information.

In the chip created at Michigan, which is the size of a postage stamp,
the ion is confined in a trap while electric fields are applied. Laser
light puts a spin on the ion's free electron, enabling it to flip it
between the one or zero quantum states.

The spin of the electron dictates the value of the qubit. For example,
an up-spin can represent a one, or a down-spin can represent a zero --
or the qubit can occupy both states simultaneously.

Applications for Cryptography

The quantum processor is made of gallium arsenide in a layered
structure and etched with electrodes using the same type of
lithography process as those used to create today's computer chips.
Each electrode is connected to a separate voltage supply, and these
various electrical voltages control the ion by moving as it hovers in
a space carved out of the chip.

The next step is to build a bigger chip with many more electrodes, so
that it can store more ions. There still is a lot of work to be done
to learn how to control lots of ions in one of these chips. It won't
be nearly as easy as it was with conventional computer chips, but at
least we know what to do in principle, Monroe said.

"This type of integrated chip structure is significant because it
demonstrates a way to scale the quantum computer to bigger systems,"
Monroe said. "It has applications for processing very large [data
sets] such as in cryptography, for example, and there is a lot of
interest in this by the government."

enjoy those pubkeys while you can suckers!

(i'm waiting for someone to suggest 32KBit key sizes.  how much RAM
does that eat?)
