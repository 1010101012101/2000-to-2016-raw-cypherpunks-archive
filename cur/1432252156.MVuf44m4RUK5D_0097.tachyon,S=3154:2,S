Tim,

It's not so much books qua books but the habits of mind that book reading
inculcates.  Most of the necessary information is up on the Universal
Library these days but many have a hard time reading or writing long form
"material".  The discipline of paper books is a useful one to employ.
Better even than free weights.

Perhaps those in the best postion are those in our birth cohort who are
old enough to have learned to read but young enough to have computed.

it was too late).
