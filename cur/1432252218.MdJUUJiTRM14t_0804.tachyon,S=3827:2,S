Cato is the first place that I visit when curious about the current agenda of
the unique mix of libertarian/new world order propaganda.

Translating protesters' agenda to "anti-property" *is* pure propaganda designed
to scare god-fearing middle class cypherpunks that somehow they will lose some
of their property should G8 protesters seize the world government (BTW, it
would be interesting to see what is the net worth of cpunkers and how that
influences their positions :-)

As the word "communist" loses its strength new words are needed to instill
fear, and "anti-property" is a nice catchall. It's all in the language. 

You also enumerate ideologies with implicit assumption that they are "bad". So
whatever can be labeled "marxist" or "socialist" is somehow horrible. You don't
say WHAT is bad about it, you *assume* that everyone will jump to the bandwagon
and agree that it's something bad. Kill the commies. This is a classic
propaganda technique.

I will not bother citing sources that have exactly the opposite PoV from Cato's
- you can look them up yourself. The point of a discussion is not spamming each
other with pre-digested, ready-to-wear, downloaded simplifications but to
inject some of own experience and induction.
