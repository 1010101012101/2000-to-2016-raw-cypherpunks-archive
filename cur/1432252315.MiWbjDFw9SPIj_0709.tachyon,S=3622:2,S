And help the narco-nuko-islamo-terrorists in the PI?

I just watched U.S. Defense Secretary and the latest PI chick president 
talking about the Phillipines on tract to be the next major center of 
Islamic unrest.

"We are prepared to bomb Manila in order to root out terrorism," he 
might as well have said.

The U.S. seems to be settling into a comfortable pattern: rolling 
application of overwhelming high tech power, with the cruise missiles, 
bombs, and materiel paid for by taxpayers who enjoy the light show on 
the evening news.

The PI chick prez is promising more cooperation in the war on terrorism, 
so look for more crackdowns on civil liberties in the PI.
