Yep - all those commercials for "Be All You Can Be, Join The Army" and
"Join The Navy, See The World, Meet Interesting People and Kill Them", and
"Army Reserve - Spend Saturdays Keeping In Practice as a Trained Killer" and
all the war movies the Pentagon helps get made, and "COPS" tv shows, and
"The Drug War - Fix Moral and Health Problems By Declaring War" and its
related "Job Training and Practical Entrepreneurism For Inner-City Youth"
program,
both of which teach kids that violence is a good way to relate to your
neighbor -
in some cities, the training extends to franchising opportunities,
starting your own "Young Crips" neighborhood chapter.
There's also the "Starve Young Children By Economic Blockade" programs for
ridding the world of Hitler-of-the-year candidates that's worked so well,
and the "Be Afraid - Make More Anthrax Vaccine Before Terrorists Use It" gigs.

The government really *should* stop marketing those violent programs.
Themselves.
Before they mess with the (really large) motes in the movie businesses' eyes.

				Thanks!
