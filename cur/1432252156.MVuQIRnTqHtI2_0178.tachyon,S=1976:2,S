At least we now know that the capabilities of the FBI in this 
regard are at least equivalent to that which a good Linux admin
can deploy when he has control of your upstream link.  The FBI 
cannot argue in court that their network eavesdropping capabilities
require secrecy and non-disclosure.  Sure they can pretend that
the userland tools are super high-tech, but the analysis and 
inteception of arbitrary network traffic is not rocket science.
