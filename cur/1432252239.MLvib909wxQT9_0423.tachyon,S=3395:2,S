In the immortal words of Mr. Parker, Kerry's a pussy who's so full of
shit he might as well be an asshole.

In a lot of ways, he's just Dukakis, stretched out on the Marxist
rack, only his voice got lower.

>who no longer has the guts

Sorry. Even then, he was a pussy. He had Karl Marx and Uncle Ho
shoved so far into both lower orifices he had sticky fluid coming out
all of his *upper* ones...

In the meantime, Bill, I um, feel your pain. He's *my* senator. And
the *liberal* one, too.


Cheers,
RAH
