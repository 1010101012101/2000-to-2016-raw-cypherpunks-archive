Wouldn't it be relatively easy to regenerate the MIME boundary strings on 
the level of the remailer, and filter the content of the headers? Various 
mail clients have various peculiarities, "fingerprints". Shouldn't the 
remailer be able to break the message down to individual data objects 
(subject, message text, attachments...) and then reassemble them back, in 
a sanitized way?
