GLENDALE, Calif. - Police arrested a man they said tracked his
ex-girlfriend's whereabouts by attaching a global positioning system to
her car.

                                     Ara Gabrielyan, 32, was arrested
Aug. 29 on one count of stalking and
                                     three counts of making criminal
threats. He was being held on $500,000
                                    bail and was to be arraigned
Wednesday.

                                    "This is what I would consider
stalking of the 21st century," police Lt.
                                    Jon Perkins said.

                                    Police said Gabrielyan tracked the
35-year-old woman, who was not
                                    identified, after she ended their
relationship, showing up unexpectedly at
                                    a book store, an airport and dozens
of other places where she was.

                                    Police said Gabrielyan attached a
cellular phone to the woman's car on
                                    Aug. 16 with a motion switch that
turned on when the car moved,
                                    transmitting a signal each minute to
a satellite. Information was then
                                    sent to a Web site that allowed
Gabrielyan to monitor the woman's
                                    location.

                                    The woman learned how Gabrielyan was
following her when she
                                    discovered him under her car
attempting to change the cell phone's
                                    battery, police said.
