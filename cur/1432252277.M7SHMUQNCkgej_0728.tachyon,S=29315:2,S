Censorship Wins Out
Many journalists and activists have brought their struggle for democracy to=
=20

for their purposes
Andrew Stroehlein
posted: 2002-04-16
Editor's note: Andrew Stroehlein is head of training at the Institute for=20
War and Peace Reporting and founder of Central Europe Review. He writes=20
regularly about Internet censorship in authoritarian regimes.
A decade or so ago, it was all clear: the Internet was believed to be such=
=20
a revolutionary new medium, so inherently empowering and democratizing,=20
that old authoritarian regimes would crumble before it. What we've learned=
=20
in the intervening years is that the Internet does not inevitably lead to=20
democracy any more than it inevitably leads to great wealth.
  "The Web really does scare these regimes," says Veronica Forwood of=20
Reporters without Borders.
The idea that the Internet itself is a threat to authoritarian regimes was=
=20
a bit of delusional post-Cold War optimism. It is true that many activists=
=20
and journalists have brought their struggle for democracy, the rule of law=
=20
and freedom of expression to the new medium, but they have not been blessed=
=20
by inevitable victory, and plenty of nasty regimes have learned how to=20
co-exist with the Internet in one way or another. In country after country,=
=20
the same old struggle goes on: hard-line regimes and their opponents remain=
=20
locked in battle, and the Internet has become simply one more forum for=20
their fight.
Repressive regimes are paranoid by nature. Those in power see enemies=20
everywhere and encourage mass paranoia, overemphasizing threats to national=
=20
security in order to justify their draconian rule. When early Web-heads=20
equated the Internet with inevitable democracy, paranoia-prone regimes were=
=20
natural suckers for the idea.
"The Web really does scare these regimes," Veronica Forwood told me.=20
Forwood is the UK Representative for Reporters without Borders, the=20
publisher of the excellent "Enemies of the Internet" report, outlining the=
=20
situation in many regimes around the world, "They want to control=20
everything, and the Web seems so nebulous and unknowable to them, they are=
=20
just frightened by it."
Indeed, many repressive states see the Internet as such a threat that they=
=20
simply ban it altogether. The former regime in Taliban-controlled=20
Afghanistan and North Korea are two cases of a complete ban, though it is=20
known that a few very high-ranking ministers in each regime have had access=
=20
to e-mail at least.
Another particularly harsh example is Burma. A. Lin Neumann, Asia=20
Consultant for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and author of an=
=20
excellent recent report on press freedom in Burma, explained to me that the=
=20
military junta in Rangoon effectively prevents public Internet access in=20
the country. One needs a permit for a modem, and though a few people have=20
them illegally, long-distance calls for foreign access are prohibitively=20
expensive. The tiny number of government-approved e-mail accounts are all=20
monitored by censors, and the high price of those accounts again keeps most=
=20
ordinary citizens away in any case.
Relying on high access costs as a de facto censor is an easy trick for=20
regimes, as they generally lord over desperately poor countries. As we=20
previously discussed here in OJR, Uzbekistan is a perfect example. In true=
=20
Soviet style, the authorities in Tashkent have set up the technical=20
infrastructure so that they have the capability to monitor e-mails and Web=
=20
browsing, but it seems they don't actually interfere that much just yet,=20
because they know the price of access means that only a tiny fraction of=20
the population are online, an insignificant fraction apparently in the=20
authorities' view.
But an all-out ban and relying on high access costs are hardly the only=20
methods of keeping control over online information. Despite the theory=20
behind the Internet's built-in anti-censorship architecture, official=20
control is actually very possible in practice, especially as the regimes=20
run the telecommunications infrastructure when the country comes online.
In Iraq the regime is trying to use the Internet to its own advantage while=
=20
cutting off access to the public. The Internet is accessible from some=20
government ministries, but since, like Burma, one needs special permission=
=20
to own a modem, home access is limited to the most trusted members of the=20
ruling elite.
The situation in Cuba is little better. The government allows access at=20
approved institutions, including trusted firms and universities. Private=20
access at home is nearly non-existent, and the government is setting up a=20
Cuba-only intranet for young people, to keep their activity corralled in an=
=20
easily controlled space. The overall effect of these efforts, according to=
=20
a detailed report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is=20
that, "there is essentially no legal, commercially available public access=
=20
to the Internet" in Cuba.
Some repressive regimes, however, realizing that the new technology can=20
have some positive benefits for society at large, have developed a more=20
sophisticated approach to the Internet, attempting to allow widespread=20
access and yet maintain control over it. China has tens of millions of=20
Internet users and has easily one of the fastest growing online populations=
=20
in the world. Still, the authorities' control points are several. Chinese=20
chatrooms, for example, are monitored and comments offensive to the regime=
=20
are removed quickly by the moderators.
Much more importantly, though, is the Chinese government's ability to=20
censor material coming in from outside China. All external information runs=
=20
through government servers, so the authorities can and do block outside Web=
=20
sites they deem potentially dangerous. A report by CPJ in January of last=20
year notes that the main targets for blocking are Western news sites,=20
Chinese dissident sites, Taiwanese media and sites of the banned religious=
=20
group, Falun Gong. But the CPJ Report also observed how inconsistent the=20
blocking can be, and this point is backed up by this writer's experience.=20
On a recent trip to China, I did a little test of my own in an Internet=20
cafe: US sites cnn.com and time.com were blocked, but UK sites for The=20
Guardian and The Independent newspapers, both with plenty of articles=20
critical of Beijing, were easily accessible.
It is, however, probably not as random as it appears, and the Chinese=20
authorities have blocked a huge number of sites, most likely paying more=20
attention to those sites they feel are better known to Chinese users.=20
Certainly, the authorities' overall control can be in no doubt, exemplified=
=20
by the fact that their blocking can be turned on and off at will: during=20
last October's APEC meeting in Shanghai, the Chinese authorities=20
temporarily lifted their blocks of some American Web sites as a sop to=20
foreign delegates.
As CPJ's A. Lin Neumann told me: "Chinese blocking is reasonably effective=
=20
on their part. It takes some determination to get around it, and I doubt=20
that many people want to really play the game. Most of the students I=20
talked with, quite frankly, were more interested in sex, computer games and=
=20
English proficiency (in that order) than they were in politics on the=20
Internet."
While it's true some editors try to stay one step ahead of the blockers by=
=20
constantly setting up new proxy sites, that kind of cat-and-mouse routine,=
=20
forcing the reader to waste time keeping up with frequent address changes,=
=20
only benefits the censors.
While access to the outside world is significantly limited in China through=
=20
extensive and complex blocking, the authorities have a much easier time=20
controlling what is published within China. As in many heavy-handed=20
regimes, self-censorship is the key factor in China: editors of Web sites=20
inside China know well the limits of what is acceptable and what is not,=20
and it only takes a few tough arrests and harsh crackdowns to send a clear=
=20
signal to Web journalists and activists everywhere. The infamous=20
persecution of online publisher Huang Qi is probably enough to keep most=20
Chinese Web editors in line.
This "let that be a lesson to you all" tactic is as old as man, but even=20
with the newest technology it still works -- and is a typical ploy even in=
=20
regimes that are generally considered less repressive than China. Umit=20
Ozturk, vice-chair of Amnesty International's Journalists' Network,=20
explained to me how this works in Turkey. In Turkey, if a Web site=20
publishes something the military-dominated state finds unacceptable, the=20
ISP's will receive a quick visit or a phone call from someone "suggesting"=
=20
the immediate removal of that site. Failure to do so would be very=20
detrimental to one's health, so the ISPs naturally comply.
When the optimists spoke of inevitable freedom through the Internet a few=20
years back, they forgot about such crude and effective methods of=20
information control.
Virtually in exile
With such personal threats at home, it's not difficult to see why some=20
online journalists and activists chose to work in exile. There are problems=
=20
with this approach, obviously -- their online information might be blocked=
=20
at home, many potential readers will not be able to afford access to their=
=20
site and their critics will always accuse them of being stooges of foreign=
=20
governments - but for some the benefit of being able to tell the truth=20
outweighs these concerns.
The main problem of running a Web site in exile is maintaining local=20
relevance and authenticity when writing from abroad; specifically, the site=
=20
needs regular, up-to-date information from within the country. The only way=
=20
to do this is to develop a network of reliable correspondents on the ground=
=20
and to develop efficient channels for getting their information out of the=
=20
country.
The main problem of running a Web site in exile is maintaining local=20
relevance and authenticity when writing from abroad.
In the worst cases this means either heavily working the phones to your=20
contacts on the ground, or, where phone-tapping is a concern, the smuggling=
=20
of documentation out of the country. On the face of it, that would seem to=
=20
be little advancement on the tedious and dangerous methods of the=20
Communist-era dissidents. Still, when it works, it can bring the only=20
non-regime-sponsored information to the outside world and offers a unique=20
eye on closed societies. The work of the Revolutionary Association of the=20
Women of Afghanistan in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan was certainly one of=
=20
the best examples of such activity the Internet has ever seen.
In less restrictive situations, the Internet itself is the networking tool,=

and e-mail allows =E9migr=E9 publishing to be current from the ground in a=
 way=20
that Iron Curtain dissidents never could be. Even then, however, expanding=

a network of correspondents on the ground is not always straightforward,=20
and the specifics of the local culture and local regime need to be=
 considered.
My own Institute for War and Peace Reporting is familiar with this problem.=
=20
The editors of our online publications covering post-Soviet Central Asia,=20
Afghanistan and the Balkans are all =E9migr=E9 journalists in London who=20
develop their networks on the ground according to the possibilities in=20
individual countries. In Uzbekistan, for example, the situation is relaxed=
=20
enough for us to have a physical office in Tashkent and a rather normal=20
network of correspondents radiating out from it. In Turkmenistan, however,=
=20
the situation is significantly more complicated for us. Forget a physical=20

with our central office in London. Trying to build a normal network there=20
would only attract informants who would turn in all our associates, so we=20
keep our correspondents on the ground isolated from one another. They=20
wouldn't recognize each other if they sat next to one another on a bus in=20
downtown Ashghabat.
But even if you have a developed network of correspondents on the ground,=20
that doesn't mean that people will feel comfortable talking to them. When=20
fear so thoroughly permeates society, mouths stay closed.MORE...
