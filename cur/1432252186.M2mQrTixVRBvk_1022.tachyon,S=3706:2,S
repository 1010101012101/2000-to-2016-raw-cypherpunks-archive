Carnivore does more than previously thought
By: Thomas C Greene in Washington
Posted: 05/10/2000 at 14:49 GMT

Heavily censored FBI documents obtained by US watchdog outfit the Electronic Privacy Information Centre (EPIC), under a Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit, indicate that the FBI's electronic snoop known as Carnivore might be able to monitor a good deal
more than just e-mail traffic.

Among the capabilities that peek out from behind all the indelible black swaths in the documents is an ability to reconstruct an
entire Web page as viewed by a subject. A planned, updated version may even be able to capture voice-over-Web communications.
Presently the system can capture and record all packet traffic to and from a selected IP, while monitoring a subject's on-line
movements.
