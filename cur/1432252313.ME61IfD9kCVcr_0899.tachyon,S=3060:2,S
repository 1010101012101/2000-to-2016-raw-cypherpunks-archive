Not all of the leftie greens object to discussions on this list,
but if this (your?) list is not for greens, maybe those with different
political views than your own should go away?  Unlikely, given the
political importance of crypto and privacy, sorry.

What is your intent with Ms. Farr? (If she really is a Ms. - "No
one knows you're a dog on the Internet.")  Out the fed?  Or, to
get her off the list?

Maybe you'd like a law that makes it illegal to troll.  Heh.
