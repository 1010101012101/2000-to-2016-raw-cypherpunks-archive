   The evening news says Dubbya is asking Congress for 
20 billion for his little war, and it sounds like the
moron is actually going to try to invade Afganistan. I
hope, in one respect, they actually do it. It will be
amusing to watch the body bags coming home as the Afgans
kick Yankee butt just like they did Ivan's. 
   How did you people ever allow this delusional sub-normal wacko
to become your leader? For those of us old enough to remember,
he sounds more and more like Adolf Hitler.
God help us all.
