For people interested in ecash / credential tech: Stefan Brands book
on his credential / ecash technology is now downloadable in pdf format
from credentica's web site:

	http://www.credentica.com/the_mit_pressbook.php

(previously it was only available in hardcopy, and only parts of the
content was described in academic papers).

also the credentica web site has gone live, lots of content. 

(credentica is Stefan's company around digital credentials).
