Subject: 08-29-01 -- ACLU Action Update: Oppose the Expansion of 
Government Secrecy!

TO: ACLU Action Network
FR: Jared Feuer, Internet Organizer
DT: August 29, 2001

Last year, with little debate and no public hearings, Congress 
adopted an intelligence authorization bill that contained a provision 
to criminalize all leaks of classified information. Although 
President Clinton vetoed the bill, this year's intelligence 
authorization bill may include the identical provision. If this 
provision is allowed to become law, it would essentially eliminate 
the check on government power that public scrutiny provides!

To accomplish the crucial role of exposing government misdeeds, most 
major news outlets often base stories on classified information. A 
recent example of such a story is the government bungling of the Wen 
Ho Lee case. If this provision becomes law however, reporters that 
rely on leaks of classified information to expose government 
misconduct could be compelled by subpoena to reveal the source of the 
leak, or go to prison if they refuse.

Current law already protects national security by prohibiting the 
disclosure of certain classified information that could cause serious 
harm, such as the disclosure of the names of covert agents. This was 
deemed enough to protect the national security even during the heyday 
of the Cold War.

Take Action! The government should not be allowed to hide its 
mistakes, incompetence, political embarrassments, and even in some 
cases, criminal behavior behind a classified stamp. You can read more
