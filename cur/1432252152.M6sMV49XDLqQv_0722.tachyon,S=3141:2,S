Being from Germany I would like to detest that statement.

The German law clearly defines what is hate speech. It is not an easy 
task as you can see in a six month trial.

Certain symbols (e.g. Swastika) are forbidden as well. And I would like 
to add that most of these laws were made up by the allies (read US and 
Britain).

There is no "ultimate" free speech as the US promises, but let's be 
serious here for a moment: The US is not as free as people like to 
think.

Michael
