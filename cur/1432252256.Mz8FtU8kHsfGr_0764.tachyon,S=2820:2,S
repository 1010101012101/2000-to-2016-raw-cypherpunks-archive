Use common sense for best security

An established company moves into a downtown high-rise and a few months 
later discovers that many of its secrets are going public. How is that 
possible? Its networks are locked down. Its employees use passwords, and 
are given security clearances. So what's the problem? How about that old 
warehouse next door? A competitor has rented it and mounted large antennas 
behind closed window blinds to listen for electronic emissions from its 
neighbor's electronic equipment.
