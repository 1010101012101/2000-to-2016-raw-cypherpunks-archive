The UK gov't is trying to push through new anti terrorism measures,
including id cards, indefinite detention of suspected terrorists, and
there's more talk of key escrow too..

from the Gaurdian :
http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour2001/story/0,1414,561052,00.html

[snip]
Concerns about the effect on civil liberties of at least three pieces of
anti-terrorism legislation, which ministers promise to introduce in four to
six weeks, were raised. A cross-party alliance, supported by sacked Home
Office minister, Mike O'Brien, has already been formed to resist the
introduction of identity cards.

New powers being introduced will include faster powers of deportation and
extradition and an end to the mandatory obligation to consider asylum
applications from known supporters of terrorism.
