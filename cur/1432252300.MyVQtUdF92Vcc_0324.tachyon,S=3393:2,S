I wouldn't be surprised if most or all outdoor cameras use a polarizer to 
reduce glare and improve image quality in sunny situations.  If so, 
windshields with cross-polarized inner liners (invisive to the naked eye as 
they would appear to be just a slight added neutral tint) should make their 
job much harder.
