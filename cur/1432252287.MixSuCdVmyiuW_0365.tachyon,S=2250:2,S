If Orrin Hatch proposes such a thing, we can propose technologies which  
identify those from .gov or .mil or other Congress/Gov't. domains and  
send lethal viruses and suchlike back to them to destroy their machines  
if they illegally connect to our machines.

(A simple warning that government stooges, lawyers, judges, clerks, and  
any GS-xx employees are not allowed to connect should suffice. After  
that, if they connect, fuck their machines dead.)
