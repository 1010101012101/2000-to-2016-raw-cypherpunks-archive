That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed.

That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
Happiness. 

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and
transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. 

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design
to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government,
and to provide new Guards for their future security. 

Thomas Jefferson




We the people of this country we can do this if all
our freedoms are taken away by the government. We are
allowed to ask for reform if our country goes bad.

How much longer will we let the government pick off
our right?

If we let it continue our country will become just
like england right now!
