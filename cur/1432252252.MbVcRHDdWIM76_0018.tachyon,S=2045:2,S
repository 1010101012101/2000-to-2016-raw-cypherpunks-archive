The most hilarious thing is when a web site "prohibits" copying,
even though to view it, you've copied it to your disk.

More hilarious is when javascript is used to prevent saving
images.  Even if you get the OS to obey, there are always
cheap cameras.   An older videocam can be used to copy
a movie off your screen (like a first gen cassette) even if
all the video D/As are 0wned by the MPAA and forced
to have DRM.  (Don't think it can happen?  Look at
CALEA & Skype, etc.)
