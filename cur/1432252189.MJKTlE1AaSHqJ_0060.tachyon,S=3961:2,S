Didn't mean to call out brian specificaly, just wow, that's a lot of text to
digest, and on and on. Maybe I just missed the summary post somewhere
so as to killfile it or not. Similar might be said for Eugen's forwarding... a
good crosspollination service to be sure. But many of us are already on all
these lists. So we get flooded out with stuf we've already seen and the
threading get all screwed to shit. Heck for my part I go months without
saying anything useful lately. so happy posting all :)
