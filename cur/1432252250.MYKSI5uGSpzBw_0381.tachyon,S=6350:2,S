Can you document this claim of the existance of 'help fields' in
Netscape? I am (to put it mildly) astonished by this claim, and
more than a little skeptical. I was aware of the Workfactor
Reduction field in the export 'aka International' version of Lotus Notes
(which this 'help field' seems identical to), but was not aware
of it being included in any other application.

If you can document this, I'm seriously interested in following up.
