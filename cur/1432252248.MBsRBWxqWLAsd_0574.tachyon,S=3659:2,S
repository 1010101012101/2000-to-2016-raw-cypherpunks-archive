A revolution involves mass participation, and widespread
spontaneous defiance of state authority.  A coup involves a tiny
little secretive conspiracy.   A coup is announced, a revolution
experienced.  Few proletarians in Russia had heard of the
communists, until they learnt they were the government.  There
was a real revolution in Russia, but many people felt the
revolution had failed, since the new government was still trying
to prosecute the war, and was still dominated by the rather small
group that had been dominant under the Tzar.  Then there was a
coup by an even smaller group against this new regime.
