It seems to me like Tor would do everything this solution would do, and
even would avoid the two attacks you present. The attacker can do the
same thing (camp the destination), but they'll just get Tor exits. It's
also simple to transparently proxy all traffic on your system through
Tor.

If you really wanted to limit your anonymity set, you could run those
nodes and set a few of them up as bridge nodes and a few of them up as
exits, and cycle through that. An upcoming feature of Tor is matching
circuits to destination ports, so you could use your (trusted) exits for
cleartext traffic (the few sites when you're forced onto HTTP) and use
the wider Tor network for the rest.

Maybe I'm not seeing what you're trying to get at, but it seems like
this would do everything you need.
