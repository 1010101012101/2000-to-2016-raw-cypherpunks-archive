Trolling accusations presume existance of non-trolling, such as adhering to the
charter or statute or some other rules of conduct.

That is pathetic. Regardless of what some cal-ideo-libertraians think, the
concensus about cpunk charter exists only in their heads. And especially
amusingly-pathetic are calls to "read the scripts" (ie. list archives) before
one engages the Send button. My sincere "fuck you" to all you gentlemen. An
extra gratis "fuck you" to those that mention kill filtering at least once per
week.

I hope that feds and associate TLAs will gain more presence on cypherpunks.
That is the only chance to enhance the intelligence of topics. At least it is a
stimulating intellectual exercise when pig is trying to entrap you or seed shit
that his handlers prescribe. And often they do have things to say, so much more
than regulars, it seems.
