NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 

Declan, this IS REAL STUFF. 

June 1998 !!!

#
#    WASHINGTON -- The head of a new US cyber law-enforcement agency
#    says a half dozen substantial attacks have been launched against
#    government computer systems since February.
#
#    "A good percentage of the incidents we see ... involve [the
#    Department of Defense], because DOD is such a prime target for
#    even individual hackers who want to test their skills," said
#    Michael Vatis, the chief of the National Infrastructure Protection
#    Center of the FBI. "They see the Department of Defense as the
#    big banana, the final exam, the ultimate challenge to test their
#    skills." 


The casual (or otherwise) surveillance of cypherpunk
traffic has now backfired in conjunction with this
virus-trojan! 

What wonderful things did Tim May get and flush,
not knowing the potential??? 

Tim, quick send Declan, JYA, and me a text extract! 

HOT DAMN!!! 

#   Agents are advised to seek out means of forcing
#   these persons out of the public debate 

FUCKING FEDS!!! 

#   The take-down is being planned for maximal public impact,
#   as per AG Ashcroft's memo of 24JUN01. 

Let them have it with both barrels, Declan!
