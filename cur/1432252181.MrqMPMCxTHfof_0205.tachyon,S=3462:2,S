Try the Euro notes. The firms contracted to print them are rumoured to have
experienced serious trouble with the first batches. But that is hardly the
same problem. I don't think the same precautions apply, as we aren't trying
to protect the information on top of the note but the identity of the
physical note itself. Clearly you cannot do that when dealing with GIFs.
