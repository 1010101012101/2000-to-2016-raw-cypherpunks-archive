Just Occam's Razor. Why bother getting cooperation when the software is not
secure to begin with? There are too many ways to gain access to Windows
that aren't vulnerable to leaks. And we know for sure this is true and has
been for a long time; just look at the thousands of exploit kits out there,
most of which have been made by people without much in the way of resources
or experience. If that's what the script kiddies can do, imagine what an
agency with a $50B budget can do.
