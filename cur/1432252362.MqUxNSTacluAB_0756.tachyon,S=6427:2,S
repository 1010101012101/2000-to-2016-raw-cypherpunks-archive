New crackdown on bikie gangs
By MARK BUTTLER, PAUL ANDERSON and RICK WALLACE
09jan02
NEW bikie-busting laws will be used by authorities to cripple outlaw 
motorcycle gangs.
The Victorian and Federal governments want stronger powers to strip the 
gangs of assets generated through crime as part of a fresh crackdown.
The tough new approach -- which has Victoria Police support -- comes after 
a Herald Sun investigation that has revealed the extent of violent bikie 
standover tactics and drug activity in Victoria.
It has shown:
BIKIE gangs have been linked to at least 23 violent deaths or 
disappearances nationwide in the past four years.
ONE Melbourne gang has used violent threats to compel neighbours to report 
police activity near their clubhouse.
A GANG "prospect" was ordered to commit murders before he would be admitted.
BOOBY traps to maim or kill raiders, including police, were found at bikie 
fortresses.
BIKIES now have closer ties with other rogue elements, including Asian 
organised crime cells and New Zealand's feared Mongrel Mob.
OUTLAW gangs have made millions of dollars by muscling into stolen car 
rebirthing and counterfeiting.
A VICTORIAN hotelier told of rape and death threats during years of gang 
terrorism.
The Federal Government, frustrated by years of murder, shootings, bombings 
and drug production, has outlined to the Herald Sun plans to attack the 
most notorious of the gangs.
Some are believed to be capitalising on a slump in the heroin market and 
subsequent rise in demand for amphetamine-based products.
Police sources said almost all of Victoria's amphetamine "cooks" were 
bikies or had some connection with outlaw clubs.
The gangs believed to be of most concern to police are the Hell's Angels, 
Bandidos, Rebels, Gypsy Jokers, Outlaws and Coffin Cheaters.
Despite several successful Victoria Police operations in recent years, some 
officers said there was still a long way to go.
"They do more intelligence on us than we do on them. It's their 
livelihood," a police source said.
The officer said drug-running bikies were known to travel in tandem with a 
decoy vehicle. Its role was to commit traffic offences to attract police 
attention if it appeared the car carrying drugs might be pulled over.
Some leading figures in the gang world were making fortunes, an 
intelligence source said.
"The heads of the gangs are living like businessmen. They're in suits on 
planes . . . big money. They're clever organised crime businessman," the 
source said.
National concern over bikie activity has heightened in recent months with 
the car bombing murder of West Australia's former top detective, Don 
Hancock, and his friend Lou Lewis
The Gypsy Jokers, who allegedly blamed Mr Hancock for the sniper murder of 
member Billy Grierson, are being treated as suspects in the case.
A Victorian policeman said the strongest gangs had access to frightening 
weaponry.
"They carry powerful guns, these blokes. But they have heaps more stacked 
away for a rainy day if they decide ever to go to war," he said.
Federal Justice Minister Chris Ellison said some bikie gangs had become 
wealthy conglomerates with significant investments.
But he outlined a fresh assault on bikie gangs that he will put before 
Parliament next month.
Among the key measures will be new laws allowing police to seize assets if 
they are believed to be criminally obtained.
Mr Ellison said the Government would also look at prohibiting clubhouse 
fortification, a major advantage the bikies have over police mounting raids.
He said some gangs had installed booby traps to maim or kill raiders, 
including police, at their clubhouses.
Old consorting laws, not used for decades, could also be dusted off to 
prevent outlaw riders associating with one another, he said.
Mr Ellison said gangs were running outwardly legitimate front businesses as 
smoke-screens for their lawless activities.
And Victoria's Police Minister Andre Haermeyer said bikie gangs would be 
among crime groups that could be affected under a state review of asset 
confiscation legislation.
