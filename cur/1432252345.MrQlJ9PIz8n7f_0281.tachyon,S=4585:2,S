Well, there's one, but it's a bit of a stretch: William Tyndale. He was
burned 
at the stake for publishing the New Testament in English in 1536, two  
years after Henry VIII had made himself the head of the Church of England
with the Act of Supremacy.

It can be reasonably argued that at that time the Crown and Church were
one and the same in England, and an offense against the State Religion
was an offense against the State.

However, it's generally true that burning was reserved for religious
offences
(including witchcraft), the axe for acts against the Crown, and hanging for 
other criminal cases.

[Just 2 years later, Henry ordered the production of an official translation
into English, known as the "Great Bible"].
