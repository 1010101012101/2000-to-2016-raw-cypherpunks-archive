Because legal records, at least with relation to Tx, are indexed according
to Tx DL#. Warrants for example are issued against DL# and not just SS#.

During a criminal records search in Tx. you'll never be asked for a SS#.

They're also public record so somebody may want to make finding info
harder. Security through obscurity I'd guess.
