See below for article on Autonomy [http://www.autonomy.com] getting picked 
up by the US govt.

Met a salesbod from Autonomy a few months ago, who gave an impressively 
scary demo of the stuff they were doing with uber-pattern-matching.

Another article at http://www.vnunet.com/News/1136175 quotes:
"The software searches names and words with variable spellings and 
retrieves information based on patterns that are related but may not match 
exactly."

Most of it was tailored towards searching for related subjects and topics 
within text (BBC news use Autonomy to link stories) using "Information 
Theory" and Bayesian Inference, but they're also doing stuff with 
image-matching (such as studying landscapes to find different films from 
the same place), voice-matching (to find different audio samples by the 
same person), and audio-to-text conversion (which can then be subjected to 
all the usual matching).

It's also designed to take information from anywhere, all ready to link 
into whatever Echelons and Black Lanterns and Netbuses governments are 
running these days.

Surprised this didn't happen months ago.

Autonomy scoops American anti-terror deal
By Susie Mesure
21 October 2002

Autonomy, the once-fjted information sorting software group, has scooped a 
multimillion-dollar deal with the US government that could be crucial in 
preventing terrorist attacks such as the recent bombing in Bali, Indonesia.

Its software, which will form a key element of George Bush's war on 
terror, will be used by 21 US government agencies under the aegis of the 
Office of Homeland Security. "After 11 September, the US President 
realised one of the big problems was the very large number of government 
agencies [meant] they couldn't work together as one," Mike Lynch, 
Autonomy's chief executive, said.

The new software package will help the plethora of security agencies pool 
any tip-offs they receive about possible terrorist attacks by working as a 
"backbone" to connect all of the pieces of information. Mr Lynch added: 
"The whole idea is to try and stop something like the Bali bomb happening."

The contract win comes at a critical time for Autonomy, which has seen its 
shares collapse over the past four months amid a fresh downturn in 
spending on technology.

Explaining how the US agencies would use the software, Mr Lynch said: "The 
whole problem is that you don't know exactly what you're looking for. This 
technology can read things. It has the ability to take something like an 
e-mail or a report and rather than just see individual words like a search 
engine, understand the ideas behind it."
