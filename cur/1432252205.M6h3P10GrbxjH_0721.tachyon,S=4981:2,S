I agree with this assessment, but would also suggest that Tim May's 
old-fogeyism has some validity to it. As far as I'm concerned, the state has 
successfully bonded with big media to pretty much stifle a lot of critical 
thinking, particularly about what other Americans believe. We saw it with 
the war protests--despite the fact that the numbers were larger than during 
Vietnam, the media was successful in (first of all) convincing Americans 
that the vast majority of Americans supported the war/troops/president. 
After that, since most Americans believed the right thing was to support the 
war (because "everybody else supports it"), they then came to quasi-support 
it, or at least shut up about it. And still, no Osama, no Saddam, and no 
WMD, but only "kooks" and "commies" are screaming about it.

Thus, to go back o your point, you're starting off with a small population 
of dissenters, so that once you pass down through the needs for engineering 
and math skills, you're left with very little.

On the other hand, the only thing that's stopping me from coding up my 
"eJector"  is a full time job and trying to live in the little spare time I 
have. So I guess I'm in the population you describe and will be, as long as 
I remain employed.

But then again...if someone I actually know gets tortured or whatever, that 
could change at any minute. Then I'll be the REAL...
