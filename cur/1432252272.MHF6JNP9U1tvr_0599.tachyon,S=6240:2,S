All true, but you didn't address my concern about the nature of the SC 
intervention.

In the book, 'The Accidental President,' by Newsweek writer David A. 
Kaplan--challenges statements by some justices in the aftermath of the 
decision that they had put the matter behind them and were once again 
enjoying cordial relations. It describes Souter and the three colleagues 
who joined him in dissent--Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and John Paul Stevens--as angered and baffled by the majority opinion.

Kaplan's book excerpt reveals that the animosities within the Court spilled 
over at a gathering of the Justices while they were hosting six visiting 
Russian judges. ``'In our country,' a Russian justice said, bemused, 'we 
wouldn't let judges pick the president.' The justice added that he knew 
that, in various nations, judges were in the pocket of executive officials 
-- he just didn't know that was so in the United States,'' Kaplan writes.

``Stephen Breyer was angry and launched into an attack on the decision, 
right in front of his colleagues. It was 'the most outrageous, indefensible 
thing' the Court had ever done, he told the visiting judges. 'We all agree 
to disagree, but this is different.' Breyer was defiant, brimming with 
confidence that he'd been right in his long dissent.'' Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was more baffled than annoyed, attempting to rationalize the 
legitimacy of the ruling. ``'Are we so highly political, after all?' she 
said. 'We've surely done other things, too, that were activist, but here 
we're applying the Equal Protection Clause in a way that would 
de-legitimize virtually every election in American history','' Kaplan writes.
