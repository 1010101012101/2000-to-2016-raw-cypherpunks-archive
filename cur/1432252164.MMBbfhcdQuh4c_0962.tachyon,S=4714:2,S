Agreed, many options for directly grabbing the data.

However, most people don't care about minor analog stages. Audiophiles 
and videophiles are not the primary consumers of this stuff, as 
evidenced by the mountains of MP3s not even sampled as well as they 
could be (64 kbps being the norm) and by the DIVX files shipped around 
the Web. And videos 10x-compressed to fit on CD-Rs. The people 
bootlegging CDs and DVDs are not usually the people with the 40-inch 
plasma screens.

Video pirates in Asia routinely use covert camcorders to grab weird-ass 
angles of first-run movies. And their DVD stall customers cheerfully 
pay them the equivalent of two dollars for their DVDs. Compared to 
this, sampling from an analog signal is heaven.

I have my own collection of about 30 DVD+Rs, each containing 1-2 
full-length videos. By the end of this year, I should have several 
hundred movies added to my collection.

The video quality is perfectly fine for me, and I like good quality. 
Until I move to HDTV and blue ray DVD, the quality is excellent. And 
even with HDTV and blue ray, so long as component video connections (a 
la progressive scan cables) are available, nearly perfect sampling will 
still be easy to do.

(Which is why Hollywood would like the HDTV sets to be sealed, with 
only digital inputs. Except that they tried this trick with twiddling 
with the specs of past HD generations. A lot of HDTV receivers and 
monitors are already out there, and changing the spec yet again and 
making the suckers, er, "early adopters," have to scrap their systems 
is not going to go over very well.)

Indeed.

Friends,

After more than 7 years with my got.net e-mail address, 
"tcmay@got.net", the amount of unsolicited e-mail I am getting on a 
daily basis has escalated sharply in recent months.

So my new address is "timcmay@got.net"

Please make a note of it and change your address books...if you wish to 
reach me in the future! Mail to my old address will be forwarded to my 
new adress for a few weeks, but then will start bouncing.

P.S. I plan to make strong efforts to stop my new address from being 
harvested by spammers, such as using "timcmay@got.removethis.net" in 
Usenet posts. I hope this works.

--Tim, timcmay@got.net
