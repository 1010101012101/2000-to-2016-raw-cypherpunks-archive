OK, It wasn't clear (at least to me) that you were starting from a random
seed to generate the hash cash.

Note that ISPs could look for duplicate hashcash tokens on the input to
their mail transfer agents, and save the disk and bandwidth for duplicates.
It would be basically the same algorithm I proposed for collecting
micropayments.  (The couldn't check for the correct addressee because of
facilities like .forward, but they could eliminate duplicates.)
