This is my general experience with programming, yes, though it is somewhat
orthogonal to security.

It makes it someone else's problem *in userspace*. Linux supports all that
stuff, but it does so *in kernel space*. And while seL4 and Nova don't
address device drivers, Genode does, by reimplementing the Linux (and
NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) kernel interfaces (yes, I know in the
Linux case this is a moving target, but Linux has a LOT of drivers, so even
if you're stuck to a narrow range of versions, you can still get a lot of
mileage out of this approach) and then running each driver as a separate
server process.

I'm not talking about raw size or complexity here; obviously having lots of
features and support for lots of devices means high complexity, but it
doesn't require that all that complexity run with full system privileges.
