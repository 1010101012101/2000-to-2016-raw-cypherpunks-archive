=========================================================================

To all administrative and technical contacts:

As you may already know, since 1993 the Information Sciences Institute of
the University of Southern California has administered the .US domain
under a subcontract with Network Solutions, Inc. through its cooperative
agreement with the U.S. Government.  USC has chosen not to renew its
subcontract, and therefore VeriSign Global Registry Services, a division
of Network Solutions, Inc., will assume direct administration of the .US
domain as of Tuesday, November 28, 2000.

Please note that no changes will occur to syntax, and the standards
established by RFC 1480 located at http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1480.txt
will continue to apply. VeriSign Global Registry Services will forward its
revised standard interim service agreement to you via email shortly for
your review.  We will also post the agreement on our web site at
http://www.nic.us.

Should you have any questions, you may email them to
usdomhelp@verisign-grs.com.

Best regards,
