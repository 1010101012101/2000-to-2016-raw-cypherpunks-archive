I'm not convinced that the intersection of the sets 'uses windows' and
'needs to nymify' (or, alternatively, 'cannot use (some other
operating system)' and 'needs to nymify') is so great that this really
matters.  Even if it is, if the need is great enough even the steepest
learning curve can begin to look pretty inviting.

In other words, the answer at that point is not to use Windows.
