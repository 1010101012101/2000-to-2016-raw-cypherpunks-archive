1. Make your property a habitat for endangered species; there are
plenty of plants, bugs, and small animals that qualify.

Getting them there in the first place is probably illegal, but
once they're established, no development which destroys their
habitat is legal, generally speaking.

2. Similarly, and even simpler, turn strategic portions of
your property into wetlands or vernal pools. Similar protections
vs development apply.
