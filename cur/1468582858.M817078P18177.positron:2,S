I don't know what the truth is. Just to play devil's advocate, lack of
proceedings might mean out of court deal (I don't believe this is the
case).

Well, feds/nsa are known to use ladies to seduce people and then blackmail
them (probably this is since ancient times).

Isn't this very close to Assange's charges in Sweden? They look quite
made up to me.

Are most activists rapists? This appears highly unlikely to me.

According to The Guardian, Applebaum was accused of "emotional abuse".

WTF is "emotional abuse"? Calling a bitch "bitch"? @juan will get
death sentence for "emotional abuse" just from this list, I suspect.
