I doubt the "prestigious" part, at least out here in the boondocks of 
Silicon Valley. Herb Lin may be a nice enough droid, but he certainly 
wouldn't be an attractive hire to the Intels, Ciscos, Ebays, Oracles, 
and others in the Valley.

The last Washington insider hired by a Valley company was, IIRC, Joe 
Lockhart, former press secretary to Clinton. Larry Ellison hired him to 
do something vice presidential at Oracle. He lasted several months, then 
left "to spend more time with his family" or somesuch. (If I'm wrong 
about it being Lockhart, I'm definitely right about it being Oracle. A 
search should turn up the details.)

The National Research Council is inconsequential, which is why they are 
now carrying water for the anti=porn crusaders.
