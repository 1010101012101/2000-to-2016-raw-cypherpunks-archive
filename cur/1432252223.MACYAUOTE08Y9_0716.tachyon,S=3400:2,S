I'm mostly trying to stay out of this rather than going off on rants,
but there's an issue of fact to be dealt with here...

Ramsey Clark is _not_ one of "our minders", stating official policy to the 
sheeple,
which is what you're implying here.  He was at one time, but that was
long, long ago, in a job title far, far away.
For the last umpteen years, he's been a major anti-establishment figure,
beating up on the US government when they do things that are wrong or illegal.
I'm not sure when it was that he rehabilitated himself, probably during the
Nixon administration, and I don't know if he beat up on Jimmy Carter
or only on all the Republicans (+Clinton) since Jimmy.

In any case, what he's saying here is his analysis of US policy,
spoken years after he was out of office, not that it's any the less correct 
for that.
