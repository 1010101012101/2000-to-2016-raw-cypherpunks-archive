Ironically, the U.S. headquarters for Glock is in Smyrna....Smyrna, 
_Georgia_.

(There are Smyrnas in both Georgia and Tennessee.)

This sort of accident (caused by carelessness) may affect Glock sales 
slightly. The lightness of the trigger ("Glock SafeAction") on Glocks 
makes it more likely that a 3-year-old could manage a shot than with 
other actions. For example, a "cocked and locked" 1911 would probably be 
safer in this situation, as the kid would have to disengage the manual 
safety and also depress the grip safety (*). A DA/SA or DAO would also 
have more resistance on the first shot. And the "clack-clack" P7 that 
Matt Gaylor derides would be tough for a small child to squeeze cock.

(* Some folks disable the grip safety on their 1911s, either by taping 
the grip lever in the squeezed position or with special mods. But nobody 
I know of carries the piece "cocked and unlocked.")
