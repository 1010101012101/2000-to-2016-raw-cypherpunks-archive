Of course, "Privacy Rightwingers" don't believe in real privacy either.
(You can't use the term "privacy rightists" to parallel "privacy leftists"
because it will be interpreted wrong, but "Privacy Rightwingers" is close.)

After all, the government ought to be able to poke into your business,
and tap your phone calls in traditional fashion, and keep track of your race,
and keep track of your nationality in case you might be a furriner,
and keep track of who lives where because there might be (gasp!)
unmarried persons of opposite sex sharing living quarters,
or otherwise shacking up.  Motels, too.   And anywhere Commies do anything.
They probably don't insist on violating your privacy in everything -
for instance there's no need to search people getting on airplanes,
because if everybody took handguns on planes they could shoot
any Commie hijackers trying to go to Cuba....

Then there's Barlow's definition of privacy in a small town
"where you don't need to use your turn signal because
everybody knows where you're going anyway."
				Thanks!
