Yep.  But that's not implied by the (probably totally exploitive, BTW) ad.

My argument, to any judges reading, is that its *not* circumvention if you've
bought the damn thing, no matter how you decode it.

If you paid for satellite TV but you build your own descrambler, its *not*
illegal circumvention, even though your gizmo (legally) circumvents
access controls.  Get it? [Rhetorically; Riad is not the problem :-]

Hint: its only illegal if its fraud.  DeCSS has nothing to do with fraud.
"cp" does.  Actually, only humans do, "cp" is not a moral entity.
