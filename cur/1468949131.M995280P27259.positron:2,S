this was not my interpretation of "alternatives to tor", and surely some come
with much reduced functionality, percy++ just being a library. there's much
more use-cases than using a browser anonymously, in some of these use-cases
tor can indeed be replaced by these technologies. also i still consider that
some people on this list are actually building stuff, instead of being overly
verbose, and for those, at least pynchon gate and percy++ should be
interesting building blocks.

a real alternative to tor would tackle the GPA issue, for that i think the
only solution is high-latency, that means also that browsing the web will be
quite a different experience with such.

btw david chaums cmix is also an interesting inspiration for a replacement in
certain use-cases, but surely not in general either. and not for dissidents in
tanzania now (which was no explicit requirement anyways). but then those
dissidents probably have also problems with computers in general including
tor.

we agree on this one. however this was not the point of the question i
believe, and as such fits as an answer.
