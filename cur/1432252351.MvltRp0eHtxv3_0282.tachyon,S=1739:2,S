 Interestingly, I have had more than one report of aural acquistion of
 typists keystrokes being used to attempt to calculate the content of a
 short keysequence (I assume a password is what was meant by "short
 keysequence").  These reports indicated "poor, but occasionally lucky
 results".  

I wonder if this follows the technique used by Song, Wagner, & Tian to attack SSH-encrypted passwords by watching keystroke timings.
