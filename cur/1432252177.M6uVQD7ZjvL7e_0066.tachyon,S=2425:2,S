It would be better to inject *more heinous* secret rules than to attempt
to remove
them.  "Why" is left as an exercise to the reader.  Fax would probably
suffice.

The phrase "constitutional protections" doesn't pass the giggle test
these days.
However the courts --when trials get that far-- will still toss out
cases in which
the state's evidence is not revealed.  I expect that behavior will
stop when domestic-US secret trials become common.  To protect
means, methods, and the chiiiildren, of course.

At least the Europeans don't take the US seriously, esp after the use of
torture
was made clear, see eg the German trials.  But the US is trying to
control
them via the oil connection.

Rome did not fall in a day.
