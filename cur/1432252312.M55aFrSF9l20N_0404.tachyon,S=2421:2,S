Bin Laden's intent was to make anyone in America afraid - thus 
the use of airliners, rather than truck bombs.   McViegh's 
intent was to make BATF afraid.

Analogously, in Iraq, the murder of schoolchildren for 
accepting candy from Americans, the use of children as human 
shields.

If group A, acting as an organized cohesive entity with single 
central will, makes people belonging to group B rationally 
afraid by violent and evil acts, and someone in group B strikes 
back at group A in order to make group A afraid to do wrong, 
this is not terrorism, even if innocents happen to get in the 
way. If instead he goes after the guy who washes the windows
for someone in group A, and the friend of the little sister in 
someone in group A, and the child who smiled at someone in 
group A, this is terrorism.
