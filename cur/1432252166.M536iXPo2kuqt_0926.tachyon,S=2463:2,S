One of my catch-phrases is "eat the poor". This is a combination of 
letting the poor pay back the productive part of society for the 
welfare they'd sponged, and a response to the "eating animals is cruel" 
crowd.

Similarly, I proposed to stop benefits to the elderly after they'd taken 
out all the Social Security they'd put in (plus interest). That was met 
with howls of protest, so I proposed a no-bag-limit open season on 
geezers. "Eat the old!"

(Believe it or not, I'm viewed as unelectable... But that's ok, I don't 
want elected office, I just want to shake up the comfortable one-party 
no-debate shoo-ins that have been the norm in every city in which I've 
ever lived.)

I'm a bit younger than the youth Tim mentioned above, and while my 
proposals above were not entirely serious, I think the yells of the 
students a few decades ago were serious. I surely have no patience with 
the statist mind-set of the boomers.
