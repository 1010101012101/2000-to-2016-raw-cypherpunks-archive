               According to former and current DEA,
                  military, and State Department officials,
                  the cartel had assembled a database that
                  contained both the office and residential
                  telephone numbers of U.S. diplomats and
                  agents based in Colombia, along with the entire call
log for the
                  phone company in Cali, which was leaked by employees
of the
                  utility. The mainframe was loaded with custom-written
data-mining
                  software. It cross-referenced the Cali phone
exchange's traffic with
                  the phone numbers of American personnel and Colombian
                  intelligence and law enforcement officials. The
computer was
                  essentially conducting a perpetual internal mole-hunt
of the cartel's
                  organizational chart. "They could correlate phone
numbers,
                  personalities, locations -- any way you want to cut
it," says the
                  former director of a law enforcement agency.
"Santacruz could see
                  if any of his lieutenants were spilling the beans."

                The central feature of
                  the facility was a $1.5 million IBM AS400
                  mainframe, the kind once used by banks,
                  networked with half a dozen terminals and
                  monitors.
