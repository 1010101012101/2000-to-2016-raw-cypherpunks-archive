  PivX Solutions Files for Patent Protection and Discloses New Inventions
 Newport Beach, CA  July 27, 2006  PivX Solutions, Inc., a vendor of
Windows intrusion prevention software, today announced the filing of a
provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
in which the company discloses new inventions as well as seeks patent
protection for key aspects of its PreEmpt 2.0 intrusion prevention
security product for Windows computers.
 "Filing for patent protection is a necessary step in the growth of any
business that owns intellectual property. said Jason Coombs, CEO of PivX
Solutions. "Whenever we examine in forensic detail the actions and
thoughts a creative person produces, be it in the realm of purely artistic
creative expression or in a field of technological innovation, we find
specific ways in which that person's creativity was driven by measurable
units of tangible progress that further inspired more creative effort. The
PivX creative staff was remarkably creative and innovative in the face of
business difficulties. This provisional patent application reveals just
how novel and rewarding the company's work has been."
 The title of the provisional patent application, filed on July 25, 2006
reads as follows:
 "A System or Method of Creating Cryptographic Command or Control Channels
with Layers of Digital Signature Authentication or Verification of Digital
Communications Enabling Remote Control Over, or Distribution of Arbitrary
Reprogramming or Reconfiguration Instructions to, One or More General
Purpose Programmable Electronic Devices" and its inventors are Oliver
Lavery and Michael Bringle, et al.

"A nation's success or failure in achieving democracy is judged in part by
how well it responds to those at the bottom and the margins of the social
order... The very problems that democratic change brings -- social
tension, heightened expectations, political unrest -- are also strengths.
Discord is a sign of progress afoot; unease is an indication that a
society has let go of what it knows and is working out something better
and new."

Sandra Day O'Connor
