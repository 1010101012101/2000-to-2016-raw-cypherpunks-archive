Note that if the user can modify the wallet, a "fat, dumb, and happy"
implementation may be vulnerable to the following attacks.

Attack 1:

(1) Withdraw $0.01 from the bank.
(2) Change a random bit in the encrypted wallet.  (Picking the bit to
change will be easier if the storage format in known.)
(3) Fire up the application as see how much money you have.

Attack 2:

(1) Withdraw many $$$ from the bank.
(2) Copy the wallet.
(3) Deposit the $$$ back in the bank.
(4) Restore the wallet using the copy.

While there are certainly ways to notice modifications to the wallet, and
prevent the replay attack, they result in considerable additional
complexity for what was a very simple implementation

Cheers - Bill
