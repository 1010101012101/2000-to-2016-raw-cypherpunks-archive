I spoke to CJR about this last week, including some of the failed
attempts so far. I think it's much of a culture clash between
traditional journalisms and comp.security environments.

Essentially, the problem you face is one of differing threat models. In
traditional journalism, the idea is that you and your source would know
each other's identities, but the journalist would be ethically bound
(and legally protected) from revealing the whistleblower's name.
Traditionally this hasn't required "anonymity".

Your problem is that any networked connection is vulnerable to making
that identification between the two users, journalist and whistleblower,
unless you maintain absolute anonymity over the network, but provide
some form of consistent attestation (ie, I don't know who you are, but
you're the same person as I talked to last time). Any actual identity
can be ascertained out of band. (I'm that guy you met that one time
wearing a rose. We both know Bill's shoe size. etc)

It's worth reading the original paper for OTR which covers some of these
particular requirements in depth.
