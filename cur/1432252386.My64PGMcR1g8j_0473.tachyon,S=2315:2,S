one more comment that ties into your mention PCIe bus limitations.
previous research on monitoring high speeds links has shown FPGA
devices well suited for header and deep packet inspect at line rates
up to 10GigE for hundreds of snort style  filter rules. this approach
scales in a linear fashion.

i'll try to find some of the papers on this subject; i don't have them
on hand.  coincidentally, many of those involved in such projects seem
to get sucked into the proprietary/classified commercial and
government sectors. *grin*

it's turtles, all the way down...
