Both Scotland and Wales contained people who spoke Celtic languages. 
Although it is difficult to determine where Patrick is from, I believe the
scholarly working consensus is that he was from the Roman province of
Britannia, where the majority of the inhabitants would have spoken a
language of Celtic origin. Perhaps my analogy of New York and Californain
English was misleading: a truer example would be the relationship of
Spanish with Catalan, or Sicilian with Tyrolean. That's to say,
mutually intelligible, with difficulty. Traders and slave-traders
(such as the slaver who captured Patrick) would have traded with
the Roman Empire in Britain and elsewhere, so presumably a lingua
franca emerged. No doubt Patrick learned his powerful mastery of
Old Irish from his captors.

and historically accurate than the Catholic Encyclopedia, try

I don't deny it for a minute. I had a problem with the way you took the
currently existing region known as England and its current (troubled)
relations
with Ireland, and projected it back into a period of history where an
entirely different socio-political scene existed.

All the best
