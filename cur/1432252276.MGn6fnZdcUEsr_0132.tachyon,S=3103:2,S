I agree up to a point. Species do disappear all the time, as a natural process of elimination. The difference in this scenario is a deliberate and fast genocide, not the extinction of a species which is not viable. An artificial interference rather than a natural progression.

Stopping nature from changing is definitely an interference, and one with which I disagree. This isn't the case here, though. We're not talking about preventing the mosquito from becoming extinct through natural causes, we're talking about not wiping it out.

Which environment is better? Well, it's impossible to compare. I think that the current drive is generally to have as little impact on the "natural" evolution of a landscape as is possible. It all depends where you draw the line. It's certainly possible to argue that any species should try as hard as possible to survive, and so we should wipe out everything that threatens us in any way and create a homogenized and safe environment for humans. I don't think that many people would agree with that viewpoint, however.

... and so another delightfully off-topic message ends.
