3 USC 202 (http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode03/ 
usc_sec_03_00000202----000-.html) already has the SSUD under DHS. The  
powers to carry firearms, make arrests, and "perform other duties"  
are not currently given explicitly, but I'd assume they're  
encompassed under "privileges and powers similar to those of the  
members of the Metropolitan Police of the District of Columbia,"  
unless Congress is planning to disarm the Metropolian Police sometime  
soon.
