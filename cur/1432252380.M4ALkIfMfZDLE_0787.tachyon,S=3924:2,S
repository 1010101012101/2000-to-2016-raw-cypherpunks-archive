Ensure that the anonymity set is large enough to make analysis hard.
With small sets, you lose to simple correlation attacks.  (For
example, Alice sent messages to the MIX at these times; Bob got
messages at these times.  That Alice operates a node is scant
protection, it simply means that some set of messages come out
uncorrelated with input, and are thus correlated to one of the 40-odd
remailer operators.)

To Sandy's point about costs, yes, its nice for the stuff to be cheap
to use, but Tim is right that people fly to Geneva to get privacy.
(There's a recurring story that the Mass state police used to drive up
to the cheaper New Hampshire state liquor store on the border to note
plate numbers of people driving north to save on the rediculous direct 
and indirect taxes that Mass puts on booze, until such time as the NH
state police arrested them for loitering.  Do IRS agents loiter in
certain airports?  A large anonymity set is your friend, and is almost 
always necessary, but not sufficient.)
