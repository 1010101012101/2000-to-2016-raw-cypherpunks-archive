The Total Information Awareness Program has been dressed in drag,
now it is the Terrorist Information Awareness Program.

Best line:
"Saying they are worried about Americans' privacy, Pentagon officials
 announced in a report today that they were changing the name of a
 projected system to mine databases for information to help catch
 terrorists to Terrorist Information Awareness from Total Information
 Awareness."

They're worried about Americans' privacy, so they change the name?
How thoughtful of them, I feel better already.

Anyone who tells you they want a utopia wants to put chains on the
souls of your children. They want to deny history and strangle any
unforeseen possibility. They should be resisted to the last breath.
