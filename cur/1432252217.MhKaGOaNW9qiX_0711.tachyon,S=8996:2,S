As a big, sloppy footnote to this, I'd point out that (these days) anything 
that does not jibe with the current right-wing party line is now called 
"Left", even though there's really not much that is particularly left 
economically (or politically for that matter) in what's said in quotes such 
as below. It seems odd to me that such a wide variety of political views are 
all called "left" simply they don't proclaim the US as savior-to-the-world.

Of course, there are those with fairly leftist views in these ranks, but 
that's not all that relevant. The interesting thing however is that American 
liberalism is now seen as right-wing (in the pro-US policy sense) by 
international "leftists" (meaning international dissidents), indicating it's 
complete and total moral failure.
