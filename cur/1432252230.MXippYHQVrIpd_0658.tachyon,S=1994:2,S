Thanks you for your interesting notes, and this is my first post.  My
best current theory is that the "real mole" killed Kelly as a
diversion.  Now that Gilligan has changed his story, he has been
discredited, but at least he lives.  With Kelly dead, it may be harder
to trace to their sources the lies that the Government told, and
Campbell & Co. will be sleeping better at night.

Anyway, everyone has a favorite conspiracy theory.  If this is too far
off topic, feel free to reply in private or direct me to another list.

Regards,
