Film Wholesaler Charged With Obscenity
The U.S. Justice Department said that its 10-count indictment against
Extreme Associates and its owners
is part of a renewed enforcement of federal obscenity laws.

Federal prosecutors said today they have charged a North Hollywood
wholesaler
of adult films with violating federal obscenity laws as the government
steps up a
campaign against the major distributors of adult entertainment.
