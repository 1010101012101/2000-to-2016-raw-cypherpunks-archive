DJ Bernstein and Tanja Lange did a study on which ECC curves are safe to
implement and use, found at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/

YMMV as per the snowden releases but for now curve p25514 appears to be
safe AND accessible in at least 2 cli type implementations.

To be avoided at present is SECCURE-0.4 and below(no safe curves as per
the bernstein document)

 foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers
 in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
 their safety and happiness.’
