It would be good to have nontrivial qubit assemblies at all in in
*solid state*. I don't think anyone has QC working yet. It's not
obvious it is at all usable, even for number factoring (entangling
and keeping entangled a large qubit constellation, error correction, suitable
QC algorithms, etc). Does at all elliptical curve crypto map well to QC?
