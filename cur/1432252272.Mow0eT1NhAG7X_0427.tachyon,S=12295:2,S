Shee-IT. Layer 4 packet inspection at OC-192 is kinda surprising, but Layer 
7 at OC-48 is for me the more difficult thing to swallow.

This has interesting implications in terms of where they place one of these 
boxes.

Another thing worth thinking about is the control channels they must use to 
update the policies to one of these boxes. It's obviously in-band. One 
wonders if one could tap one of the fibers and find the packet stream they 
use to program one of these things.
