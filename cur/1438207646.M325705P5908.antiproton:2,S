Must have been something in the air.  Now everybody will want
something similar - and some won't have the luxury of trusting the
NSA, NRO, ETC the same way the DoD can.  "Let's talk about the
chips in your TAO/ANT Brand scrambler phones..."  :o)

I do see problems with scaling DYI chip projects up to commercial
production numbers, and down in scale to achieve fast, high
capacity performance.  That's why I am much more interested in the
prospects of a manufacturing process built for radical
transparency, using "commercial best practice" technology at
conventional production facilities.

IMO the same kind of radical transparency should apply to all
industrial processes that pose large potential hazards to public
health & safety, i.e. nuclear power stations, transgenic
agriculture, etc.
