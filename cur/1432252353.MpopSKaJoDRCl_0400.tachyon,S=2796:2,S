   from the not-that-any-chinese-people-will-see-this dept.
   [1]Torrey Clark writes "China is the world's [2]leading censor of the
   Internet, filtering web sites, blogs, e-mail, and online forums for
   sensitive political content, [3]according to a study released
   Thursday. The [4]OpenNet Initiative said that China employs thousands
   officials and private citizens to build a 'pervasive, sophisticated,
   and effective' system of Internet censorship. 'ONI sought to determine
   the degree to which China filters sites on topics that the Chinese
   government finds sensitive, and found that the state does so
   extensively,' said the study. 'Chinese citizens seeking access to Web
   sites containing content related to Taiwanese and Tibetan
   independence, Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square
   incident, opposition political parties, or a variety of anti-Communist
   movements will frequently find themselves blocked,' the report said."
