Hizbullah operatives seeking to block IDF
                       cameras

                       (IsraelWire-11/10) Hizbullah guerilla forces are
                       stepping up their anti-Israel activities, including efforts
                       to block sophisticated IDF cameras installed along the
                       northern border. With the use of mirrors, Hizbullah is
                       working to block the effectiveness of the surveillance
                       cameras installed along the northern border.

                       The cameras, mounted atop armored personnel carriers,
                       were deployed following the unilateral IDF withdrawal
                       from southern Lebanon in June. 

                       Hizbullah activists are using mirrors to blind the
                       cameras with sunlight, making surveillance increasingly
                       difficult at a time when the northern border remains on
                       high alert.
