"the US in the Balkans is if anything over strength" does NOT 
contradict the "spread too thin" point, which is about the number of 
troops the U.S. has available to deply, the need for replacements, etc. 
The fact that U.S. soldiers in all of these places who were expecting 
to be relieved have instead been told they will stay at least several 
more months, perhaps another year, is the point.

As for the general Yugoslavia situation, we supported the wrong sides 
in the Balkans. Not that supporting _any_ side in that European war was 
any of our business.
