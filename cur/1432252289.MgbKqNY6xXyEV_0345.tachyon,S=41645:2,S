Legal Immigration - Total numbers for each decade is listed as follows
1990 - 19,767,316
1980 - 14,079,906
1970 - 9,619,302
1960 - 9,738,091 

FRIENDS - PLEASE NOTE THAT OVER 45 MILLION LEGAL (YES I SAID "LEGAL") IMMIGRANTS HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY SINCE 1970. NOW ADD TO THAT BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LIVING WITHIN AMERICA. 

THIS MEANS THAT  A TOTAL OF BETWEEN 55 AND  65 MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW LIVING IN AMERICA WHO WERE NOT BORN IN AMERICA. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE TOTAL POPULATION OF AMERICA IS LESS THAN 290 MILLION, IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMON SENSE AT ALL THOSE NUMBERS SHOULD SCARE THE HECK OUT OF YOU. "SOMETHING IS HAPPENING HERE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS... DO YOU, MR. JONES?"

MYTHS AND HALF-TRUTHS ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

VCT Web Posted 1/17/2000

MYTH: America has lots of room to double the population (The U.S. Census Bureau says that the U.S. population will double this century).

TRUTH: The open spaces one sees from an airplane are not where the 260 million new immigrants and their families will settle. They will settle in the already overcrowded urban areas of the country just like they always have. Much of America's open spaces are occupied by food production for our own people and to sustain tens of millions of people in other countries. Open spaces are also part of our national heritage of parks and wilderness. A U.S. Census spokesman recently said we shouldn't be very crowded even at twice the population because we still will have only about a fourth the density of England. This irresponsible "trick" statement averages our open spaces, much of which is farmland, parks, and otherwise uninhabitable land, into the equation. In the sections of the country where most Americans live, we are already very much as crowded as are Europeans. And do we want to live like Europeans who centuries ago destroyed most of their wild areas.

MYTH: Americans won't do the work that illegals do.

TRUTH: Prior to 1965 when the disastrous Immigration Bill was passed, there was very little immigration. In fact, between 1925 and 1965, there was even a period of net emigration out of the United States. During this time, our grass was getting cut, our meat was being packed, our children were being watched and our houses were being cleaned. The idea that somehow we suddenly can't run a country without an unlimited supply of foreigners is absurd.
Those in favor of foreign labor are corporations who are addicted to cheap labor. They are the ones who are benefiting. But their benefit comes at the American tax payer's expense when you consider that the American tax payer is virtually subsidizing the labor costs of the greedy corporations by supplying the illegal foreign workers and their families with welfare, free education, free medical, WICs, housing assistance, etc. -- something the corporations won't do.
Americans won't allow themselves to be exploited like illegals do, but they WILL do the work that illegals do for fair compensation and benefits. If Americans did the work that illegals do at higher pay, would that benefit the consumer? You bet it would in the long run. But many Americans who do not care about America's future are consumers who favor the idea of exploiting illegal workers because it keeps commodity and service prices down in the short term.

HALF TRUTH: illegals eventually become assimilated Americans.

TRUTH: Many do. But Most third world illegals come to the U.S. for personal economic reasons. Most do not cherish our system of government, A Constitutional Republic. Many so called "immigration rights" groups "fan the fire" with their rhetoric which encourages immigrants to preserve their culture and language at tax payers expense. Among some of these groups, the word "assimilation" is considered xenophobic. When ultimately illegal immigrants and/or their children do become voting citizens, many vote in blocks (Mexican-American, El Salvadoran-American, Guatemalan-American, etc.), not for the good of America, but for personal economic gain usually at the expense of another group.

HALF TRUTH: Illegal aliens are better off in the U.S. doing lousy menial jobs than they are in their own country.

TRUTH: That may be true for the Illegal aliens in the short run (and businesses that hire them), but for many "undocumented immigrants" (Mexicans make up the majority), the "American legacy of exploitation of immigrants" remains in the minds of their children for many generations to come creating resentment of America and hinders assimilation of even their American born offspring. Resentment of America has created anti-American organizations such as MECHA whose nationwide college and high school members must pledge their support to forcefully take back what they call "Aztlan," the U.S. Southwest ceded in 1846 to the U.S. in the Mexican War.

HALF TRUTH: Illegal aliens pay taxes that benefit the economy.

TRUTH: Most illegal aliens do not receive a typical paycheck with tax deductions -- they are paid in cash and do not pay taxes. Even when they do pay taxes (only possible if they use fraudulent social security numbers or government assigned ID tax numbers), their meager income is not enough to pay for medical expenses and all the expenses for all the children they give birth to. You don't have to look at statistics -- just visit the maternal ward at the L.A. county hospital. There, illegal immigrant women are having thousands of children per year free of charge and can't afford them once they give birth, and that doesn't stop them from having even more children -- most learn how to work the system so that they receive cash assistance and food stamps.
A basic principle in economics is this: The more people that assimilate into the system the better -- if it creates a larger tax base. But here in California it hasn't. For example, the feds had to bail out the L.A. County hospital system several years ago and the county hospitals are now again headed for another crisis. The evidence shows that the net results are that illegal immigrants cost the taxpayer significantly more than they pay in taxes.

HALF TRUTH: Illegal aliens have a good work ethics.

TRUTH: It depends on what one means by "work ethic." If it means that illegals will allow themselves to be exploited, then they have a good work ethic. If it means that a group of day laborers would be consciences in the assembly of precision built automobiles, it might get an argument. But it is irrelevant if an illegal alien has a good work ethic -- they are working illegally!

MYTH: Illegal aliens don't affect politics because they can't vote.

TRUTH: Just by being counted in the census, illegals give political power to special groups. Many illegals fraudulently vote anyway and there is strong evidence that some key elections have been upset by illegal voters. Politicians represent the "people" even if those people are illegal aliens. Since the number of representatives in congress is fixed, any increase in population in California, for example, due to illegal immigration will require more representation for that group while taking away representation from people in other states. Most politicians that represent areas of large illegal population, vote in the interest of illegal aliens since they are the ones they represent. On the state level, it is clear that politicians like Governor Davis, California Speaker of the House Antonio Villaraigosa, California Senator Hilda Solis, California Assemblyman Gilbert A. Cedillo, etc., all want laws changed in the interest of illegal aliens.

MYTH: illegals go to illegal unlicensed medical clinics run by unlicensed quacks because they have no other alternative and because they are afraid of being deported.

TRUTH: Illegals know that they won't be deported simply for seeking medical help -- thousands go for free medical help every day. Obviously, the thousands of illegals who give birth in our county hospitals do not seem to be worried about deportation after their free delivery. The real reason many unsophisticated Hispanic illegals don't go to "free" medical facilities is because they actually trust "curanderos" ( type of witch doctors popular in Mexico) over licensed medical doctors.

HALF TRUTH: Illegals come to the U.S. for jobs to support their families, and wives and kids in there homeland.

TRUTH: Many do. But record numbers of those wives and kids are sneaking over the border to join their breadwinner in the U.S. But most alarming, is the record numbers of dead-beat dads that find an easy escape from their responsibilities in their homeland and in fact abandon their families. There is also strong empirical evidence that even illegal aliens who had good jobs in their homeland still want to be in the U.S. -- most of the world's people want to come to the U.S. because it is a very good place to be for many more reasons than just for a job.

MYTH: Pete Wilson's attitude towards illegal aliens stifled trade with Mexico. Governor Davis will change that.

TRUTH: Trade from California to Mexico increased 84.5 percent between 1992 and 1997 and did more trading with Mexico than any other state including Texas - all during the central years of the Wilson administration.

MYTH: Proposition 187 is unconstitutional because governor Davis says so.

TRUTH: Maybe 187 is unconstitutional. But it is not for the governor of California to decide that. That decision must come from the U.S. supreme court. Davis has preempted the supreme court and snubbed his nose at the voters of California by deciding on his own that 187 is unconstitutional -- contradicting a statement he made to the voters "I'm a governor, not a judge."

MYTH: The cost of not educating undocumented children is higher than the cost of educating them.

TRUTH: This kind of statement is absurd. It assumes that disallowing illegal alien children into our schools and/or deporting them is not an option. The idea that undocumented children are being punished for the bad deeds of their parents is ludicrous. Undocumented children already have citizenship in another country that is responsible for their education. California schools have a "don't ask, don't tell" policy regarding who gets to go to school. This policy is a powerful magnet that attracts illegals to California. The costs are enormous. Undocumented children are being rewarded, not punished.
Few disagrees that if the current rate of illegal immigration continues, a school a day will have to be built to accommodate the undocumented children and citizen children of undocumented parents.

MYTH: Record public school enrollment on a national level of 17.5 percent from 1983 to 1997, is a result of Baby Boomers.

TRUTH: Current Population Surveys (such as reported in the January 1999 Backgrounder) shows that 15.9 percent of the school-age population growth in 1997 had immigrant mothers. In California, officials say a new school each day -- or a new classroom an hour -- is needed to keep up with the growth (Since immigrants are just as likely (even more likely) than natives to go to public school, it's clear that nearly all the increase in public school enrollment over the past 15 years is due to federal immigration policy, not the Baby Boom generation.

MYTH: Issuing California driver's licenses to illegal aliens will make our roads safer because they would be trained to drive safely and would have insurance.

TRUTH: Giving illegal aliens driver's licenses will only make enforcement of our immigrant laws more difficult -- it would make it harder to detect them. It also "throws in the towel" and sends the wrong message to illegal aliens that they can change the law by breaking the law. Society must assume that anyone who would break the law and drive without a license, would continue to break driving and other laws even if they were licensed and most would not be any safer drivers. Moreover, it is laughable to think that these illegal aliens are going to run out and buy car insurance (one of more profitable documents now being sold to illegals, are fraudulent "proof of insurance" documents).

MYTH: Lack of academic achievement and high school dropout rates are caused by the poor economic conditions of immigrants.

TRUTH: This belief is another one of those "just accept this as truth" cliches." Poverty in itself does not cause school dropouts. This was proven in a report in Scientific American magazine (Indochinese Refugee Families and Academic Achievement, February, 1992). The article showed that many refugees from Southeast Asia with large families arrived in the U.S. with little more than the clothes on their backs and with no exposure to Western culture or knowledge of the English language. Yet their children display stunning scholastic achievement in American schools. In the U.S., the effect of poverty on education has been focused mainly on two ethnic groups, Black and Hispanics. Ironically, these groups have the most representation by their "leaders" who's livings depend on bringing high visibility to the children's penurious conditions -- instead of emphasis on the hard work it takes to succeed in academics.
But for the sake of argument, if poverty of immigrants is the cause of their lack of academic acheivement, why would the U.S. want to import poverty.

MYTH: Since illegal alien farm workers come to the U.S. for "jobs Americans won't take," they would not present a problem if they were given temporary visas to allow them to work the fields and then return to Mexico (or other country).

TRUTH: Millions of illegal alien workers who could be doing all the farm work that "Americans won't do" are already in the U.S. Almost all illegals who come to work the fields do not make a career of low paying, hard working farm jobs. The belief that only pitiful third world laborers can be content in doing menial farm work is obviated when it is seen that almost all of these workers sooner or later "head for the city" for the better jobs.

HALF TRUTH: Illegals are enjoying the fruit of the recent great American robust economy.

TRUTH: While many Americans are benefiting from a robust economy, government data shows that record numbers of Americans are falling into poverty in spite of overall good economic conditions -- and in spite of 35 years of record government spending on social programs. This down slide can be directly linked to illegals flooding the low scale job market -- virtually importing poverty faster than it can be irradiated. Had there not been any massive illegal immigration in the past 20 years, poverty in much of America may well have been reduced significantly.

MYTH: Employers are solely responsible for illegal immigration because they attract illegals by providing low paying jobs.

TRUTH: Illegals are directly responsible for their illegal presence. Blaming the entire problem on employers for illegal immigration is like blaming a women for her own rape because she dressed to sexy and the rapist couldn't resist her.

HALF TRUTH: Hispanic immigrants are family oriented and very religious catholics.

TRUTH: The vast majority of illegal entries from across our southern border are unsophisticated, poor, and uneducated, who do not necessarily hold to strong family values or the Catholic faith. This is evident by U.S. statistics showing that while unwed teenage pregnancy in the U.S. is decreasing as a whole, Latina unwed teenage pregnancy is on the rise. The illegal immigrants of today are not all the honest, hard working, American dream seekers. This is evident by record numbers of dead-beat dads who walk away from their responsibilities to their children by leaving their homeland and simply crossing the border.

MYTH: If the U.S. pumps money into Mexico and other third world countries for the purpose of improving their economies, it will create jobs thus eliminating the need to illegally immigrate to the U.S.

TRUTH: The only way that the improvement of other countries' economies would appreciably stop illegal immigration to the U.S., is if those countries' economies were to become as strong as that of the U.S. Thousands of visa over stayers from non-third world countries like Canada, France, Israel, are also part of the illegal immigration problem and those countries have good economies. The U.S. is not the only country to which illegal immigrants seek to immigrate. Countries all over the world are experiencing illegal immigration driven by "wanting a better life." As soon as Third World countries become even only a little bit more prosperous than their neighbors, they rush to keep strangers out. Mexico, for example, does not tolerate its border violations by Guatemalans. Malaysia recently announced that in the case of repeat offenders, it will flog illegal aliens, their employers, and anyone who smuggles them into the country. In early January, 2000, over 35,000 illegal Zimbabwe!
an!
!
 workers were tossed out Of South Africa. So forget it! The U.S. should be concerned with improving its own economy and strictly enforcing its immigration laws.

HALF TRUTH: Immigrants make good entrepreneurs.

TRUTH: The common belief that immigrants are natural entrepreneurs may have its roots in the observation of the thousands of illegal alien third world style illegal street venders now found in most large U.S. cities. This belief has been obviated by a wall street article in which recent data shows that native born Americans are more likely to be successful entrepreneurs. (Immigrant Entrepreneurs Slide From Their Top Spot, The Wall Street Journal, January 12, 1999).

Claudia Smith, "Condemning Migrant Job Seekers to Death."

My Findings and Suggestions:

* Today 5 1/2 million illegal aliens from Mexico enter San Diego and Imperial counties in CA each year. Some bring drugs and later traffic drugs. Many come for other reasons. Drug smuggling is common with illegal immigration from Mexico. 

* A total of 7 1/2 million mostly Mexican illegal aliens now cross the U.S.-Mexico border yearly and permanently remain in the U.S., and this number is increasing 2 million per year. 

* The apprehension figures are almost identical in CA from 1994 to 1998, therefore the so-called "Gatekeeper displaced" illegal immigration to AZ and NM in 1999 may actually be NEW illegal immigration, or in essence a tremendous increase in illegal immigration from Mexico. Some of the new AZ figures alone extrapolate to more than 2 million more new illegals per year! 

* Most illegal aliens coming across the U.S.-Mexico border are not drug smugglers, but almost all drug smugglers and people smugglers are illegal aliens. 

* Illegal drugs produced in Mexico and smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico cost a U.S. family of four $1,286.00 in 1998. Tax money you paid which your family could have used for other things. 

* Illegal immigration from Mexico costs each U.S. citizen another $341.00 per year in federal, state, county, and local taxes and fees for public education, housing, health care, welfare, social security, emergency medical treatment, sanitation, unemployment, fire suppression, and a plethora of other costs such as private losses by property owners, ranchers, and border residents. $1394.00 for a family of four. 

* The cost of illegal drugs and illegal immigration from Mexico to your family of four is now $2,680.00 per year. And you have to earn $3,752.00 to pay this amount. 

* $3,752.00 right out of your pocket or your purse and those of every other U.S. family. U.S. citizens in high immigration states, counties, and cities will pay a higher amount. Maybe much higher. Example: The same family in California will pay an additional $1,250.00 in emergency medical care costs per year for illegal aliens. 

* The total cost of illegal drugs and illegal immigration from Mexico to your CA family of four is now $3,930.00 per year. And you have to earn $5,502.00 to pay this amount if you live in California. 

* One large city reports that up to 87% of their drug arrests are now illegal aliens mostly from Mexico. But most will not release this 'racially profiled' information. 

* The U.S. Border Patrol now has an armed patrol agent for every 475 feet* of the 66 mile border in San Diego county (2,200 armed agents plus support personnel), yet over 5,000,000 illegal aliens slipped by them in 1998 and remain in the U.S. in 1999. Unofficial USBP estimates are that fewer than 25% of these 2,200 agents are ever on or near the border engaged in their primary duty assignment at any given time. 

* The U.S. Border Patrol is not on the U.S. border. They stop motorists on highways. They conduct highway checkpoints. They help local, county, and state police. They rescue illegal aliens. They chase vans overloaded with 45 illegal aliens. They catch between 10% and 30% of the illegal aliens. But few USBP are on the actual real border strip of land that's 60 feet wide, owned by the federal government (in CA only), and defined as the U.S. Border. This must change. And control of the U.S.B.P. by I.N.S. management must change. And using privately owned and U.S. citizen occupied property as a "buffer zone" between the real border and the interior highway defined "pseudo* border" must stop. 

* The current I.N.S. illegal immigration policy is a deceptive plan of "catch, count, and release," sometimes without deportation of the illegal alien, but instead release into the community, with a promise by the alien to return to Mexico. Even after deportation, almost all (99.2%) illegal aliens return to the U.S. often bringing their entire extended families. 

* Once across the real U.S.-Mexico border, virtually all illegal aliens, smuggling drugs or not, are "home free" in the U.S.A. and almost all eventually become U.S. citizens. This is the real intent of the current I.N.S. management. 

* The U.S. desperately needs a National Border Fence and a National Border Control Procedure that respects the rights of the majority of U.S. citizens, the rights of U.S. citizen border residents near the border, and which takes their well-being and ideas into consideration too. And then shut down Operation Gatekeeper which is a failure in 79% of San Diego county and 100% of Imperial county based on apprehension figures from 1994 to 1998. 

* There will be another Mexico peso devaluation. Probably after December 2000 when President Zedillo's term ends. Today's flood of aliens and drugs from Mexico may only be a trickle in comparison. 

* Wake up Americans before it's too late. 

* Wake up Americans before it's Kosovo. 

*Excludes two days off per week, training days, holidays, vacation days, sick days, review board days, personal leave days, various interior duty assignments, court appearances, highway checkpoint assignments, and management personnel.

* Today up to 75% of the illegal drugs in the U.S. come from Mexico across the U.S.-Mexico border. These drugs are produced in Mexico or transported through Mexico and then smuggled into the U.S. by mostly illegal aliens from Mexico. 

* The importation of illegal drugs into the U.S. from Mexico and the wide-spread smuggling of both people and drugs from Mexico results from an unprotected U.S.-Mexico border, a NAFTA caused relaxation of border inspections, and a corrupt neo*-narco Mexico government. 

* All the available evidence indicates massive drug money-corruption throughout Mexico's civil and military establishments: police officers, attorney generals, army officers, generals, cabinet officials, governors, and even presidents. Some experts say the Mexican drug cartels operate as an arm of the government of Mexico. 

* For every $10 million dollars we export to Mexico with NAFTA, the U.S. "imports" $12.28 million dollars of Mexican drug-related costs. This cost was $87.75 billion (with a "b") in 1997. 

* If only 2% of the illegal aliens now crossing the U.S.-Mexico border smuggle in 2 kilograms of cocaine (4.4 lbs) this would account for all 342 tons the DEA says now enter our country annually. 

* Mexico is the transit station for 50-70% of the cocaine, a quarter to a third of the heroin, 80% of the marijuana, and 90% of the ephedrine used to make methamphetamine entering the United States. - Senate Hearings 1998 

* Methamphetamine cases now account for 80% of the nation's police departments' drug investigations. - DEA Report 1996 

* One million legal immigrants come to America each year making the 1990s the highest population growth decade in U.S. history, not counting the 7 1/2 million additional illegal aliens coming from Mexico each year. 

* Most illegal aliens reside in large cities, not in less problem plagued unpopulated "open areas" that the pro-immigration proponents say the U.S. has "plenty of." 

* Can we expect people who don't respect laws and private property rights in Mexico to respect ours in the U.S.? Much of Mexico's rural population is socialistic. All Mexico rebel groups, the EZLN, EPR, etc. are openly Marxist communists. 

* We must control our country's border if we are going to control illegal drugs and illegal immigration into the U.S. and have true national security. 

* All the costs in this summary are directly attributable to Mexico and to illegal drugs and to illegal aliens coming directly from Mexico. Some of both originate elsewhere but all enter by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. 

* Immigrant Rights attorneys should sue the employers of illegal aliens who are forced into wage peonage (economic slavery). A few multi-million dollar favorable judgments might accomplish more than the I.N.S. or the U.S.B.P. have yet achieved. 

* Mexican citizens should remain in Mexico and work for political and economic change in Mexico. 

* Drug use is increasing among U.S. children. Illegal immigration from Mexico is also increasing. 

* Based on my personal experience, the same ranch job in Colorado now pays $700 more per month than in Southern California. 

* Law enforcement and the media should stop making excuses for the criminal activity of illegal aliens. Illegal aliens pay to be smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico and illegal aliens are usually the smugglers. Crime is never politically correct.

EFFECTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN CALIFORNIA 

(1) They threaten the public health with imported disease. They load the public hospitals beyond endurance because they have no means and are thus charity cases; no insurance--which means that taxpayers pick up the medical bills; 
(2) They have single-handedly...via gangs...accounted for most of the violent crime in L.A. 
(3) They overwhelm all public services--including welfare--paid for by guess who? 
(4) One-third of all prison beds in California are presently occupied by illegal aliens. 
(5) TWO thirds of all "live births to indigent mothers" (paid for by taxpayers) are to illegal alien women who came here specifically to give birth so that the child will be a U.S. citizen and hence eligible for massive and immediate largesse from Uncle Sucker. 
(6) The illegals are voting--contributing to massive voter fraud. And they--like the dead--vote reliably Democrat. Ask Bob Dornan. Other than those...and a host of other problems...they're fine. I'd love it if apologists for illegal immigrants--such as yourself--could be made to assume all the costs of their presence and flouting of U.S. laws. Then I'd cheer as they swim the Rio Grande. --Boris

FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF COMMON OBJECTIONS RAISED BY THOSE WHO THINK THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR CURRENT IMMIGRATION POLICIES. THE "OBJECTION" IS STATED FIRST AND IS THEN FOLLOWED BY A "SHORT ANSWER" AND A "LONG ANSWER."

#1 - OBJECTION & ANSWER 

OBJECTION  -- This is a country of immigrants 

#1 - SHORT ANSWER 

I am an American. 

I am not an immigrant. 

Therefore this country is not a country of immigrants. 

#1 - LONG ANSWER 

If you are discussing immigration with a friend, you are likely to hear him reflexively blurt out the above gem. When he does, simply point out to him that eighty percent of the residents of the United States were born here.

How could that preponderance of home-grown Americans justify us being called a "nation of immigrants"? 

Certainly we are descendants of immigrants (as is everyone in the world except those living in the Garden of Eden), but that is not the same thing as being an immigrant. 

Sloppy use of language does not help the discussion.

If your friend has been drinking and insists on repeating this meaningless phrase we are a nation of immigrants over and over like a mantra, explain to him that if he is, for some inexplicable reason, including ancestry in his argument, then all nations are nations of immigrants and we should simply open the borders.

If he has been drinking a lot and this sounds like a good idea to him, take his keys away and suggest he go live for a while in a Third World country, asking himself why everyone there is coming here.

If he is one of those really obstinate drunks who cannot be swayed by sober argument, then say to him, "We should open the borders? Fine. let's put it to a vote and see what most Americans think."

We will win that vote. 

Every sovereign nation has the right and obligation to protect itself. That is to say: defend its borders.

To advocate open borders is to say we are not a country, which is to say: there is no law. 



One of the most crucial things we must do in the U.S. to protect ourselves from the certain perils of overpopulation, is to stop our population growth. Our only tools are to reduce births and/or immigration. If we want to accomodate a million immigrants a year, then one should advocate a reduction by a million a year in births. 

And this would not even stop our growth. It would only freeze it where it is today. If we cut the number of births by two million a year and allowed a million immigrants a year to enter we would be somewhere close to achieving zero population growth. This should be the goal. "Smart Growth" won't do it

#2 - OBJECTION & ANSWER 

OBJECTION  -- Your ancestors were immigrants, so you have no right to say anything about immigration 

#2 - SHORT ANSWER :

Yes, I do. I am an American citizen.

This is a constitutional republic with a bill of rights that includes both the right of free speech and the right to vote in free and honest elections at regular intervals. All Americans who vote are doing so in an attempt to influence the direction of our national governance.

Therefore, as an American I do have a say in public policy issues.

#2 - LONG ANSWER :

Yes, my ancestors came from somewhere other than the North American continent. And so did yours. And so did everyone else's--including those of the American Indians. In fact, except for, possibly, on the banks of some isolated watering hole in Africa, everyone in the world's ancestors came from somewhere other than the place their descendants inhabit now. 

In other words, every nation is a "nation of immigrants" and the term itself is basically meaningless. 

But no one seriously thinks that this fact somehow renders the term "sovereignty" meaningless. Think of it this way: Imagine if, due to overcrowding in India, millions of Indians started pouring over the Himalayas into Sichuan Province in southern China. Undoubtedly, the CHinese would complain. Then, imagine if the Indians said to the Chinese, "You have no right to complain or to stop us from coming into Sichuan Province because you Chinese are ethnic Han people originally from Shanxi Province in the North near Mongolia and your ancestors were also immigrants here. Sichuan Province therefore belongs to all the people of the world." The Chinese would laugh at them and tell them to go home before they got a thump on the head. They would say, "Sichuan Province is a part of China and we Chinese decide who may or may not come here."

In other words, the Chinese would not be moved by claims that because their ancestors had been born somewhere else, they had no right to decide public policy in their own country. In fact, nowhere in the world would such an argument be considered for even a moment.

Except in the United States. It is only in this country where we actually consider the undemocratic notion that the majority of the citizens of our country have no justifiable say over who may and may not enter our nation. It is only in America where a person's skin color or ethnic background has a bearing on what they are permitted to feel is best for the country. It is only in America that we encounter the lunacy that race can somehow determine the legitimacy of one's patriotism.

The rest of the world scratches its collective head in amazement at our folly, naivete and childishness.

If we are going to try to start redefining the world's boundaries according to ancestral wanderings, we have quite a task before us. Maybe it would be better not to start. The boundaries of the United States are as they are, just as the boundaries of China or any other country are as they are, and the citizens of each nation in the world are the keepers of the boundaries of their own nation.

Americans must retake control of their country's borders and discard the notion that somehow an Ecuadorean or a Swede or a Pakistani has some sort of "equal" say with an American over the boundaries of the United States. 

A foreigner does not have the right to determine American public policy vis-a-vis immigration policy. American Constitutional rights do not apply to Germans or Chinese or Mexicans. No foreigner has equal rights with an American citizen qua an American citizen. There is no such thing as "alien rights."

On a deeper level, this argument is a kind of "original sin" argument. It is an easily refuted argument from a religio-anthropological stance. For now, let us say that ancestor worship is not a part of the American tradition.

#3 - OBJECTION & ANSWER 

OBJECTION  --  Only the American Indians, the "Native Americans", are true Americans 

#3 - SHORT ANSWER 

"And the Native Americans allowed uncontrolled immigration and look what happened to them." 

#3 - LONG ANSWER 

Anyway, this argument ignores the concept of "nation". There was no such thing as the political entity known as the American nation until the Founding Fathers created it in 1776. Furthermore, there are not grades of citizenship. One is either a citizen of this country, or one is not. We are not more or less citizens of the United States based on the number of generations preceding us on these shores. 

And, particularly, we are not more or less citizens of this country based on our skin color or ethnicity.

Because my ancestors immigrated to this continent 5 or 6 generations ago does not make me a "truer American" than someone who took the Oath of Allegience yesterday. Nor are Indians "truer Americans" than I simply because their ancestors immigrated many generations before mine did

#4 - OBJECTION & ANSWER 

OBJECTION  --  Immigrants built this country 

#4 - SHORT ANSWER 

At some point, maybe we should stop "building."

#4 - LONG ANSWER 

And immigrants didn't build this country anyway. Americans did.

If my family has been here for six generations, and they all had jobs, how can it be said that America was built by immigrants. If my case is typical, only 1/6 of America has been built by immigrants.

Now, if having been built by an immigrant means that for the rest of eternity anyone calling himself an immigrant has carte blanche, then I say we settle the problem once and for all. We should turn over 1/6 of the U.S. land mass, declare it as having been "built by immigrants", open its borders and let everybody in the world move there. 

Alaska would fit the bill nicely. We might even be able to trick Russia into buying it back first.

In all seriousness, immigration averaged only 235,000 persons per year prior to the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act. That's only 47 million immigrants over the course of our nation's history. Compared to our current population of 270 million, that's not much. And then, if we add all the people who have lived before in the United States, we are approaching a billion total Americans who live now or have lived in this country--all of them, or at least most of them, busy "building" it.

#5 - OBJECTION & ANSWER 

OBJECTION  --  Diversity is good for America 

#5 - SHORT ANSWER 

One shouldn't decide public policy on racist or ethnicist grounds.

#5 - LONG ANSWER 

Whatever the benefits of ethnic or racial diversity, we are already the most diverse country in the world. It is not clear we need more of it.

Though we often hear the mantra "Diversity is our strength," polls show that Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are less than convinced.

Almost everyone agrees that balkanization--the breaking up of our country into combative, ethnically defined political groups contending against one another as hostile units--would be a bad thing. 

Yet, even a cursory glance around can not fail to impress upon the observer that, as our country becomes more diverse, it is also becoming more politically balkanized. "Identity politics" is increasing--not decreasing. 

Why in God's name would we continue to pursue a policy that can only intensify this tendency to balkanization?

If we are going to maintain a public policy with the effect of making ourselves even more "diverse," let's put it to a vote.
