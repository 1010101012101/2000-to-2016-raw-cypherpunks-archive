Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a Letter of Intent with the European

the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regulatory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects re|ating to Wind Power.

About the Wysak Wind Project

This deve|opment wil| be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in deve|opment expenditures. Once completed, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annua||y for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Total gross

of RES projects, the deve|opment of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of

its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
