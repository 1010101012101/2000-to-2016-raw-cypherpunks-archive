Congressional Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for
Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (The Gilmore Commission)

Next meeting: Sept. 24th from 9:00 am until 4:00 pm at the RAND Washington
Office - 1200 North Hayes Street.

Boilerplate: "The Advisory Panel will assess the capabilities for responding to
terrorist incidents in the U.S. homeland involving weapons of mass destruction.
Response capabilities at the Federal, State, and local levels will be examined,
with a particular emphasis on the latter two. The Secretary of Defense, in
consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary
of Health and Human Services, and the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, has entered into a contract with the National Defense
Research Institute (NDRI), a federally funded research and development center
(FFRDC) at RAND, to establish the Advisory Panel in accordance with Section
1405 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, Public Law
105-261 (H.R. 3616, 105th Congress, 2nd Session) (October 17, 1998)."
