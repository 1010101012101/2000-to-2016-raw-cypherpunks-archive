If they want to do some good, how about investigating these criminals?

http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/0304/23senators.html

Have to confess I'm a little confused, though.  On the one hand, the article 
insists they broke no laws; on the other, it says they "trade on privileged 
information not available to the public." Isn't this the very definition of 
insider trading?  Isn't it what they were originally pursuing Martha for?
