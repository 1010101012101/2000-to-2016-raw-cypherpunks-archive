So they did have the server before they knew who he was. We also knew
that he was sold out by his VPN provider. Hopefully, the identity of
that VPN provider will come out soon.

Given what I see in the complaints, I suspect that he was sold out by
one of his administrators, perhaps the one (with a huge drug debt) that
he tried to have killed. This is rather like Snowden, isn't it?

More fundamentally, a business built around selling drugs by mail to
customers' actual physical addresses was doomed. Anonymity in the
physical world is much^N harder than on the Internet.
