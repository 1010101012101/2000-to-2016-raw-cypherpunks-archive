Gardening is emotionally rewarding in its own right, as well as getting you 
food.
Lots of people also grow flowers they don't eat...

Back when I lived in New Jersey, the Bell Labs plant where I worked had a 
garden area
out back that employees could use, and it was somewhat popular with 
apartment dwellers
who worked there.  Given the quasi-rural area and the local population,
there wasn't much theft problem, but there was some; a friend of mine said 
his technique
for avoiding theft was to grow kohlrabi "for some reason nobody ever steals 
it :-)".

Occasionally other people used other parts of the back pasture to grow dope,
and I've never heard it confirmed or denied whether the official building 
maintenance
policy was to smoke any that they confiscated.
