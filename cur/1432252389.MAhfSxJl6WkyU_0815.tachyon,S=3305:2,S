In case it's not well-known, an LGX is a Lightguide Distribution 
shelf...that's a passive box with lots of optical couplers in it...they can 
have 60 or more depending on the density. The splitter is normally placed 
behind the box, it's input and two outputs marked on the front. In general, 
most optical equipment is never directly connected to each other but 
connected through the LGX, otherwise things get unamangeable in the CO.
