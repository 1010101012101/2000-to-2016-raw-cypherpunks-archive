Wikipedia should allow Tor users to register Wikipedia nyms.
Then they could block:
     Tor users trying to edit without a nym;
     Tor users trying to edit with a nym that has a bad reputation;
and they could rate-limit
     Tor users trying to edit with a nym that has insufficient history
     to be classified as good or bad;
while not blocking
     Tor users trying to edit with a nym that has a good reputation.

This will require some changes to the MediaWiki software that Wikipedia
uses.  AFAIK, there's currently no way to rate-limit nyms that have
insufficient history, and blocks on IP addresses are currently all or
nothing.
