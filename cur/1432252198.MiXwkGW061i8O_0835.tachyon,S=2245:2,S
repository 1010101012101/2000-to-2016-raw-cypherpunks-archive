They were never really used.  The great feature of SPKI is that it's not X.509
(so it's a design fit for a purpose rather than being digital ancestor-
worship of failed OSI standards from the 1980s).  The great failing of SPKI is
that it's not X.509 (it's impossible to get any cert mechanism accepted unless
it's called X.509).
