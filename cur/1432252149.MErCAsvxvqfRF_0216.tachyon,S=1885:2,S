The comment period on NIST's draft FIPS-201 (written in very hasty  
response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12) ends  
tomorrow.  The draft, as written, enables use of the card by "Smart  
IEDs" and for improved selection of kidnapping victims.

One cabinet department's Associate CIO for Cybersecurity said of this  
project, "Eventually this is going to lead to a national ID card."
