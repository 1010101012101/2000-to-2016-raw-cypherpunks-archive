Before you make silly accusations go read the VeriSign Certificate
Practices Statement and then work out how many people it takes to gain
access to one of the roots.

The Key Ceremonies are all videotaped from start to finish and the auditors
have reviewed at least some of the ceremonies. So while it is not beyond
the realms of possibility that such a large number of people were suborned,
I think it drastically unlikely.

Add to which Jim Bizdos is not exactly known for being well disposed to the
NSA or key escrow.


Hacking CAs is a poor approach because it is a very visible attack.
Certificate Transparency is merely automating and generalizing controls
that already exist.

But we can certainly add them to S/MIME, why not.
