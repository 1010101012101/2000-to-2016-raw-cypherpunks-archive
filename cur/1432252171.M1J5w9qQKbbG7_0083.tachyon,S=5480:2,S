Point taken. I stand corrected.

You're right. Tens at the very least.

I figured I'd present it anyway. Nobody who is in a position to have
access to the equipment, to get grant money, etc., is stupid enough to
obscure data. Other researchers would make their name mud in very
short order. If nothing else, it's a professional-self-preservation
thing.

Hey, it's a prison camp with a government re-education emphasis. No
sense mincing words. :)

And because it would mean that the government doofuses can't sue the
people with the deepest pockets, and can't use it to bolster policy
positions, and it's political suicide to start attacking the primary
sources of problems. It's easier to call everyone a victim and lose no
votes and appear compassionate, than it is to place blame where it
belongs, lose some votes, and get attacked as "mean-spirited" by the
opposition. 

Censorship and gun control sound like risky schemes to me.
