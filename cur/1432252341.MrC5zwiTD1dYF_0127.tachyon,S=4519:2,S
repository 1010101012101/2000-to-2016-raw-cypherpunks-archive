i checked this out when it dropped. it was delivered in haste, and not
something overly impression (like a pro kit re-tailored for bitcoin
wallets.)

the day before this dropped wallet encryption was released in the
official bitcoin client. the attackers had to rush deployment of this
malware before too many potential targets upgraded to encrypted
wallets (thus making them less accessible to attacker using this
method.)

the interesting aspect is how this following a significant crackdown
on the bitcoin.org forums and was sent as a mass phish via private
message to all the members.

i've pasted the content below. note that clicking on the image went to
a ....JPG/ directory which in turn sent the screensaver malware
payload that is not identified in most browsers as potentially
malicious (unlike .EXE or .COM, .BAT, .PDF, etc.)

once you click, it rather clumsily traversed the disk looking for the
first wallet.dat to deliver via an open relay to a drop box at
hotmail.

they'd clearly spent more time on the delivery aspects than on the
smarts within the wallet stealing code. as said, a rush job due to the
client update the day before.

waiting for the next trojan to target RPC port on running bitcoind's...
