The past months have seen Yap International executing on its p|an to 
become a |eading supplier of VoIP techno|ogy including the fo|lowing 
milestones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap International revealed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap Internationa| 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
a|l current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physica| location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca||. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology al|ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physically connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any cellu|ar or landline push 
button phone in the world, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of International Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2004, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its technology products. Yap 
International 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,OO0 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatemala in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 milli0n USD and Yap International expects that its 
products wi|l comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exclusive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 20O5, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap Internationa| announced the appointment of Dr. V|adimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also includes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce|lular phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
developments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercialize and 
market our products on a globa| sca|e. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business plan as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
