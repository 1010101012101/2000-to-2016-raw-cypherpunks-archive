Over the past few days, I found the story about James Bell in 
Tacoma who is being hung out to dry it seems.

I thought that the group I am associated with would enjoy reading all
the info you have on James Bell, so I pieced together some of the posts
about him and the link to Wired's articles.

That post was not incredibly controversial, nor were any threats made
against any person or group by myself or the respondents, yet I have
evidence that starting today, I am being watched, and trailed as I
drive.

Is there something magic about the James Bell case that causes
alphabet agencies to investigate those that openly discuss it?

This is a real question to which I hope you will reply: Considering the
type of data you post on your sites, do you find that you're being
watched, or has that period come and gone?  Have you ever requested your
FBI file through the FOIA?  I don't know that I have one, but I may send
off a request just to see.

I would love to hear your suggestions on how to react to "being watched"
if you've been frustrated by similar experiences.  Also, on the FOIA.

Would the DoD, CIA and FBI use Jeff Gordon's pissant operation to 
conceal a burgeoning homeland defense Stasi octupussy? Yes, and here's why:

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

Defense Science Board

SUMMARY: The Defense Science Board Task Force on Intelligence Needs for 
Homeland Defense--Follow-On Initiative will meet in closed session on 
April 11, 2001, at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM, 
April 12-13, 2001, at Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM. This 
Task Force will explore the intelligence ramifications posed by a 
changing spectrum of threat regimes, including biological, chemical, 
information, nuclear, and radiological weapons.
    The mission of the Defense Science Board is to advise the Secretary 
of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, 
Technology & Logistics on scientific and technical matters as they 
affect the perceived needs of the Department of Defense. At this 
meeting, the Defense Science Board Task Force will: consider the board 
spectrum of intelligence issues from early threat detection to 
deterrence, through response--including attribution; evaluate the 
collection and analysis of target-related information and weapon unique 
information; examine the role of HUMINT against these missions as well 
as the technology that the HUMINT collectors needs to be equipped with; 
consider strategic indications and warning and tactical warning 
dissemination and how the two need to be merged; analyze methodology to 
correlate large data flows spatially temporally and functionally (Low 
SNR); and assess the robustness of today's intelligence apparatus for 
coping with these challenges.
    In accordance with Section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act, P.L. No. 92-463, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. II), it has been 
determined that this Defense Science Board meeting, concerns matters 
listed in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1), and that accordingly these meetings will 
be closed to the public.
    Due to critical mission requirements and scheduling conflicts, 
there is insufficient time to provide timely notice required by section 
10(a)(2) of the

[[Page 19145]]

Federal Advisory Committee Act and Subsection 101-6.1015(b) of the GSA 
Final Rule on Federal Advisory Committee Management, 41 CFR part 101-6, 
which further requires publication at least 15 calendar days prior to 
the meeting of the Task Force.

feasibility of a coordinated information dissemination capability 
within the U.S. Government encompassing tactical, operational, and 
strategic information. Specifically, they will investigate detailed and 
actionable recommendations with respect to enabling ``channels'' and 
establishing appropriate ``brand identity''; DoD's role in a U.S. 
strategic information dissemination capability; policy, legal, and 
economic issues hindering U.S. capabilities; and identify new and 
emerging technologies capable of enhancing U.S. capabilities.
