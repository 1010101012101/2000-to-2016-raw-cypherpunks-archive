The company I work for has a charitable donation matching program. Do you 
have any suggestions for organizations with 501(c)3 status who would be 
worthy recipients of a donation? I have EFF and EPIC on my list. Are there 
others doing things to protect anonymity and privacy rights?

I am more interested in actively working on developing ways of securing 
people's anonymity, rather than lobbying or litigation organizations. I 
think that the two I have above cover the latter nicely.

TIA.
