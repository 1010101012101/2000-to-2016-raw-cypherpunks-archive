Take a look at Dallas Semiconductor's Crypto iButton family.  FIPS level 2
and 3 certified DSA/SHA services with a JVM in a large watch battery form
factor, under $50 for FOB and interface.  (Disclaimer - I don't work there,
I've just used their products for many years now and have designed them
into a dozen odd products.)  Many interesting places use these as personal
certificate storage to authenticate access.
