Duh.  No shit Sherlock.  Let me quote myself in part:

Declan, do you have a chip on your shoulder, or are you just leaping
to the fore in defense of a statism apologist?  On this list?

I'd like to know, so I can watch and remember.

 >and I can't exactly blame her.

What can you exactly blame her for?  Propagating FUD?  Being a troll?
Being a girl?  Why did you weigh in on this discussion?

Inquiring minds want to know.

So drop the shitty chivalry act Declan, she's been flipping it and it
is her turn to catch some without you running interference.  Or would
you like to explain yourself?
