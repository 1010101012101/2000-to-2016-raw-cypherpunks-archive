Jolly good show ole chap! Jolly good show...

Listen up everyone, we have a humble servent of thee who doth provide
copious work products for thy glory and satisfaction. Please, do think
of the humble!



Here we go round the mulberry bush, the muleberyy bush, da mulled bree
bush, here we go ... ahem, ok, ok, I'll stop there.

TADAAA!!!


And the winner is - no one! This is sad. The bill is sad. Your
interpretation is self contradictory. Your quotes are clear. The clarity
iluciferdated is appreciated. You contra conclusions are a weird kinda
magic trick.

But hey, feel free to keep saying black is white - at least I'm enjoying
it :D

OK, I'll help out here - read this paragraph just above again, then
without blinking (I'm serious now) read the following paragraph three
times:

> >>"Relevant operators" are persons who provide "any service that consists in

I'm getting lazy, so I'm going to trust you to point out to us, in
simple terms, your own contradiction, e.g. how a commieputer program
running on my phone, and talking to Juan or Applebaum's phone which is
likewise running the same program, how this program for example could be
considered to be encompassed by "any service", with me, running that
program as the "relevant operator" of my telemaphone, which service so
operated consists of provision (to me the operator, likewise to Juan or
Appelbaum at the other end as mentioned) of "access to" or at the very
least "facilitates for making use of" a certain "telecommuniscations
system" provided by my ISP/Telco (and likewise by/for Juan or Applebaum
at the other end as previously mentions), and further which program
manages the latency of, facilitates the creation of the connection, and
optionally stores for the operator the data thereby transmitted, or that
may be transmitted next time I operate this sytsem, my means -of- the
system.

Again, I'll leave it to you to point out such an example for the benefit
of our loyal, deserving and patronising readers.

(I'll assume those particular forms of encryption are those particular
forms of encryption not covered by the Act of course, since as you so
magnanimously pointed out, the Act does not ban any end to end
encryption.)

Ahh ok, so so long as I am not added to her unilaterally designated and
completely hidden (for national security purposes of course) "no fly"
list, whoops sorry, I mean "may not end to end encrypt" list, i.e. as
long as I am not designated as a terrorist, whoops sorry again, I mean
"relevant operator",

which I am not entitled to know about,

and for which, if I were so designated, either individually or as a
class, say "those humans who have subscribed to cypherpunks list, made a
phone call to Iraq or Syria, made any donation to Greenpeace (those
bloody terrorists), or used the Tor Browser Bundle, attended a Communist
Party event, participated in an Occupy protest, or have any family
member who protested against Vietnam war, Falklands war, Afganistan war,
the cold war or any other way,

then I should be ok to keep using end to end encryption?


> If you are a private citizen and you aren't providing a service,

Which for example if I am running Linphone in a VM on CyanogenMod on my
mobile handset, I could never be "considered to be providing or
operating or managing and potentially providing access to" any
"telecommunications service" to myself, with or without "conference
room" audio facility to connect a few Libyans in a conference call, or
...

Can you see the picture?


> she can't prevent you from doing any encryption you like,
> nor can she make you backdoor it.

As long as ALL of the above conditions are met, and ALL of the
conditions we have not yet thought of are met, by me, then I should be
A-OK, she'll be right mate, just end to end encrypt right on brother...

right?


> PGP is okay,

Woah! Awesome. Thanks Peter for your legal interpretation of that Act
and its exemption for PGP!

Come on guys, now swap out libtorcrypt.so and plug in libgpgcrypt.so
instead - Peter tells us that'll be A-OK and we'll all get a free ticket
for facilitating our end to end voice, text, chat and video calls to any
and all, right around the world!


Jump on the Free Train - We live in a dee-mock-crass see?

Sing it brother, we are SAVED! Sing it from the hill tops!

Phew! Pete, brother, you really had me going there for a while I really
thought we were all fucked..

Ahh ok, so as long as Juan or Applebaum don't run their phone directory
and voice service daemon on their mobile handset, in the geographic
territory called UK, only THEN are we all ok.

Shit, I dunno WHAT to believe. Peter, you make it so confusing?

Because they could never be classified by her as relevant operators -
only terrorist would ever be so classified.

   We have conclusion!

Wellllll ... Peter ... you certainly cleared all that up. The bill only
applies to relevant operators, which could never be Facebook or Google,
probably could never be end user operators, unless possibly their bodies
are physically located in the UK, but it's likely the new Act would
apply to terrorist, but we're not sure, we do no it will likely harm
Facebook and Google, but it doesn't apply to them because no court would
ever uphold that they are relevant operators.


Peter, we mere humans are eternally grateful. Please, do come again...
