Sad indeed. A nuanced (from our western media perspective), almost
academic analysis of why USSR fell, due to its internal problems, and
what those problems were:

I add that today, the relevant thing is that Putin on an inter-nation
level is one of the only true diplomats on today's world stage, and
has forged many significant relationships (e.g. BRICS) which have
shifted power significantly and irrevocably away from USA and towards
a multi-polar world;
and I say this is a damn good thing and we are fortunate that "Russia"
has produced someone like this - perhaps not so fortunate for some
Russians inside Russia, but extraordinarily important, and good, for
the world as a whole. USA hegemon had to be ended, and it's almost
done but the shoutin'.
