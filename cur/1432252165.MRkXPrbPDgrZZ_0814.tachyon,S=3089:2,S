 Anonymity: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow
 Esther Dyson

 It's ironic that the Web once seemed to promise individuals new
 opportunities to explore the world without showing their face. Instead, it
 is turning out to be a powerful force against anonymity. Most information
 about people's online actions is traceable - if someone with resources
 cares to go to the trouble. But there will be much more to this trend than
 the familiar fear of governments spying on innocent victims, or even
 they-asked-for-it dissidents. The bigger questions revolve around the
 tolerance of societies for diversity and recognition of the human capacity
 for change.
