Spam seems the best best.

Sometimes you get the same spam message multiple times, each message
identical except for the munged return address. You can use that address
to encode a few bytes per message. Send the same message ten times and
you have enough of a channel for a short message. Maybe you could boost
the information per message by doing the same trick with a header line.
