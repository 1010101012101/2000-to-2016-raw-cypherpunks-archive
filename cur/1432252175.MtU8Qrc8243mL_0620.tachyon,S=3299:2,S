>How are RO systems at removing microorganisms?

I'm sure it depends on the product: I have a PUR Ultimate faucet-mount that has
a one-micron carbon filter that's supposed to remove "99.99%" of the
microbiological cysts cryptosporidium and giardia. Anthrax is supposedly 1-3
microns, but if they weaponize it to smaller than a micron (if that's possible)
it's coming through. Oh well, better than nothing.

According to the Airborne Pathogen Database,
http://www.bio.psu.edu/People/Faculty/Whittam/apdbase/ the optimum temperature
for anthrax spores is 37C, but can be destroyed if you get them to 140C for
three hours. Good luck, ha.

Speaking of sub-micron bacterial filters, check this out, if they have any left:

PUR also sells some awesome small independent units and desalinators.

Good luck!
