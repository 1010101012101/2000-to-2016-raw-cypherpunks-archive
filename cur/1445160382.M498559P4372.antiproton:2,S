Not quite...

When your ISP (and every other ISP/Peer) logs traffic then you can
circumvent this by using a VPN/Tor/i2p etc and so the only logs they get
prove that you are a privacy conscious customer who is actively using
the internet.

You can't use VPN/Tor/i2p to bypass the CDN's because the CDN is the
endpoint in your communications.
Therefore, the CDN has access to the entire contents of your
communications which allows them to gather a massive amount of
information about you.
When they can do this across multiple websites then the ability to
correlate that information into a complete profile of you and your
online activities becomes very dangerous.

Unfortunately, avoiding CDNs is difficult because they are part of the
Corporate and Government effort to centralise the web for exactly the
reasons I outlined above.

So, the wise person expects to lose freedom but the wiser person does
everything they can to reduce the loss.

One of the things that surprises me on this list is the number of people
who are happy to accept the loss of privacy that the modern web allows.
It's as if this isn't the Cypherpunks list after all!!!
