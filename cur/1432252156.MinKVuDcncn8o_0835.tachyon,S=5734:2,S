U.S. Set to Begin a Vast Expansion of DNA Sampling

By JULIA PRESTON
Published: February 5, 2007

The Justice Department is completing rules to allow the collection of
DNA from most people arrested or detained by federal authorities, a
vast expansion of DNA gathering that will include hundreds of
thousands of illegal immigrants, by far the largest group affected.

The new forensic DNA sampling was authorized by Congress in a little-
noticed amendment to a January 2006 renewal of the Violence Against
Women Act, which provides protections and assistance for victims of
sexual crimes. The amendment permits DNA collecting from anyone under
criminal arrest by federal authorities, and also from illegal
immigrants detained by federal agents.

Over the last year, the Justice Department has been conducting an
internal review and consulting with other agencies to prepare
regulations to carry out the law.

The goal, justice officials said, is to make the practice of DNA
sampling as routine as fingerprinting for anyone detained by federal
agents, including illegal immigrants. Until now, federal authorities
have taken DNA samples only from convicted felons.

The law has strong support from crime victims' organizations and some
women's groups, who say it will help law enforcement identify sexual
predators and also detect dangerous criminals among illegal immigrants.

"Obviously, the bigger the DNA database, the better," said Lynn
Parrish, the spokeswoman for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National
Network, based in Washington. "If this had been implemented years
ago, it could have prevented many crimes. Rapists are generalists.
They don't just rape, they also murder."

Peter Neufeld, a lawyer who is a co-director of the Innocence
Project, which has exonerated dozens of prison inmates using DNA
evidence, said the government was overreaching by seeking to apply
DNA sampling as universally as fingerprinting.

"Whereas fingerprints merely identify the person who left them," Mr.
Neufeld said, "DNA profiles have the potential to reveal our physical
diseases and mental disorders. It becomes intrusive when the
government begins to mine our most intimate matters."
