Full judgment is avalable, thanks to Russian Pirate Party
http://www.slideshare.net/temychk/bitcoin-43468448 All in all, there is
7 websites, two others is bitcoinconf.ru and hashbitcoin.ru. That two
addresses not blocked (yet?), but presented in the judgment. One of them
shows just parked domain page, the other one is a website of Russian
Bitcoin conference set to 2 April 2015 in Moscow.

Judgment basically says it's illegal to use Bitcoin because the only one
currency in Russia is ruble, and Bitcoin is a money surrogate, which is
prohibited by Russian law, and the law allow courts to prohibit
distribution of any information in Russia.

For reason, it says that: "Free distribution of information about
electronic currency causes active use of cryptocurrencies for drug,
arms, and forgery dealing and other criminal activity. These facts, as
well as ability to uncontrollable transboundary money transfer followed
by cashing in, are hight-risk approaches for potential using
cryptocurrencies in schemes for legalization (money laundering) incomes
from criminal activity, and the financing of the terrorism."
