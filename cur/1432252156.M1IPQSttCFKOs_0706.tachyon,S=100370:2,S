To:=A0 Andy Greenberg of Forbes Magazine, author of "This Machine Kills Sec=
rets".=0A=0A=0AKeep in mind that most of what I describe here will be in my=
 2003 lawsuit, 02-1052. <http:///> cryptome.org/jdb-v-usa-106.htm <http:///=
>=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 I should point out that you don't seem to be commenting ab=
out my now-numerous emails to you about these attorneys.=A0=A0 What's the p=
roblem?=A0 Are you AFRAID to comment?=A0 I think it's unfair for you to wai=
t until I have disclosed all this material, before you comment.=A0 =0A=0A=
=A0=A0=A0 I really think I have a right to learn WHY you claimed that I had=
 tried to fire 'every' attorney I'd had.=A0 Where did you hear this?=A0=A0 =
You certainly never tried to verify this claim with me!=A0=A0 I would have =
told you the truth;=A0 I would have directed you to lawsuit 02-1052, which =
already contained the truth.=0A=0A=0ARobert Leen:=A0=A0 (You might initiall=
y be pleased to hear that Leen was the first attorney I'd actually TRIED to=
 'fire'.=A0 But don't get your hopes up!=A0 I was entirely unsuccessful at =
that attempt.!)=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 My next attorney was assigned about No=
vember 21, 2000.=A0=A0 I knew 'the fix was in' because I had done NOTHING i=
llegal.=A0 I didn't know about the forged, fake, fraudulent appeal case (99=
-30210), at least the portion of which was prior to May 2000=A0 But I had v=
ery publicly announced that I had major, major suspicions about government =
government corruption, especially Ryan Thomas Lund's November 25, 1997 assa=
ult on me (ordered by government employees).=A0 And, I knew that the govern=
ment had placed a tracking device on my parents' car (probably both of them=
) in April-June 1998.=A0 Also, I knew that the Feds had illegally searched =
my house on my arrest in June 1998.=A0 (I had been removed from my house; t=
he house was empty of=A0 'cops'.=A0 They had no authority to continue to se=
arch that house, yet they did so.=A0=A0=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Robert Leen refus=
ed to try to obtain any 'discovery'=A0 shortly after my arrest about Novemb=
er 20, 2000.=A0 Recognizing that Leen was trying to sabotage my legal case,=
 I wrote a letter to the Judge (Tanner) in about December 8, 2000, complain=
ing that Leen was trying to sabotage my case.=A0 I was astonished (at least=
 in part) that the Judge refused to have Leen fired.=A0 I kept asking for L=
een to be fired throughout January, February, March, and beyond in 2001. =
=A0 No (good) answer by the Judge.=A0 I began learning the law in mid-Decem=
ber 2000.=A0 Starting about late February 2001, I began to write various le=
gal motions, in order to document my complete unwillingness to accept Leen'=
s 'representation'.=A0 (If you just look at the docket entries for case 00-=
5731, you may not be able to easily identify which motions were written by =
me, and which w=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 To show your lawyer how corrupt the Ju=
dge (Tanner) and Leen, and the prosecutor (Robb London) were (case 00-5731)=
, during the last week of March 2001, I filed a 'notice of interlocutory ap=
peal'.=A0 Your lawyer presumably understands that if a 'notice of appeal' a=
rrives at court, of an appealable issue, that divests the jurisdiction of t=
hat court to proceed with any trial.=A0 Wanna know what happened?=A0 The ju=
dge PROCEEDED with a 'trial' as if nothing had happened.=A0 I filed a SECON=
D notice of interlocutory appeal a few weeks before the 'sentencing', and a=
gain that filing was completely ignored.=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Robert Leen w=
as NEVER 'fired'.=A0 In fact, in May 2010 (after being arrested for an oste=
nsible probation violation.)=A0 Leen actually continued to (pretend to) 're=
present me'.=A0 Even until today, I presume, he is ostensibly still 'repres=
enting' me.=A0 At least, on the paperwork he will be listed as 'representin=
g' me.=0A=A0=A0=A0 I should point out, also, that it was about this time (e=
arly in Leen's malicious 'representation' of me) that I first heard the wac=
ky comment (by the prosecutor Robb London) of his resistance to having Leen=
 replaced.=A0 London said something LIKE "Bell fires all his attorneys".=A0=
 By now, Mr. Greenberg, you are well aware that this isn't true.=A0 You rea=
lly need to find Robb London, and ask him if he ever said something like "B=
ell fires all his attorneys".=A0 Perhaps London would defend himself by cla=
iming that he looked into the court record, noticed that at various times t=
he name of my lawyer had changed, and he decided this 'must have' meant tha=
t I succeeded (and, therefore, certainly tried) in replacing these attorney=
s.=A0 =0A=0A=0AAnnemarie Levins=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I guess I'm getting tired=
 of re-hashing what you could, and SHOULD, have read in my lawsuit, 02-1052=
, filed July 14, 2003.=A0=A0 Levins was assigned shortly after my ostensibl=
e 'conviction' in September 2001.=A0 (The reason, as I vaguely recall, was =
that Robert Leen had stated, "I don't do appeals". =A0 I responded by sayin=
g to Leen, in what was only about 25% intended as a joke, "You don't do app=
eals.=A0 You merely make them necessary.") =A0 Over the next 4-5 months I w=
rote Levins numerous letters, containing easily 100 pages of single-spaced =
text, listing HUNDREDS of very arguable appeal issues.=A0 Levins, to my rec=
ollection, NEVER responded to even a single one of my letters!=A0 An increa=
sing sense of dread resulted.=A0 I felt it was quite obvious that Levins wa=
s planning to further victimize me, in precisely the same way Avenia, Mande=
l, and Leen had done.=A0 (Remember, I did not then yet know how Solovy had =
victimized me, by concealing the
 pre-May-2000 existence of appeal 99-30210.)=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 As I vaguely re=
call (not referring to any record) my appeal had to be filed on a Monday, p=
erhaps it was in January or February 2002.=A0 At virtually the last minute,=
 perhaps on a Thursday before,=A0 I finally received a copy of "the appeal"=
.=A0 By that time, I had learned plenty of federal criminal and appeal law.=
=A0 I saw the appeal that Levins had written, the one that she had CONCEALE=
D from me for 4 months, and it was obvious that it was intended to sabotage=
 my case.=A0 Which, in fact, it did.=A0 There were at least 100 incredibly =
valid appeal issues which, if they had been argued properly, would have eas=
ily freed me, but Levins argued NONE of them.=0A=A0=A0=A0 Perhaps the day l=
ater, maybe it was Friday, the weekday before the appeal had to be filed, I=
 obtained a telephone call to Levins.=A0 In that call, I accused Levins of =
deliberately sabotaging my case, saying that her failure to even respond to=
 my 100+ pages of letters proved that she was a crook.=A0 She didn't deny i=
t!=A0 When it was clear that Levins wasn't going to apologize, I ORDERED he=
r to NOT file that appeal.=A0 I told her, "You're fired!=A0 You must not fi=
le that appeal!=A0 And if you're already filed it, I order you to withdraw =
it!!!".=A0=A0=A0=A0 Strong words, but quite appropriate under the circumsta=
nces.=A0=A0 The result?=A0 She DIDN'T resign.=A0 She filed the appeal.=A0 S=
he DIDN'T have it withdrawn.=A0 The appeal lost, as I knew it would.=0A---=
=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Mr. Greenberg, you should be utterly and completely ashamed=
 for what you have done.=A0 You have thoroughly and completely misrepresent=
ed virtually every fact, implication, and nuance relating to me and my lega=
l cases, and virtually everything I said/wrote to you.=A0 You LIED by claim=
ing of your lawyer, "She read Bell's letter, then checked his legal file, w=
hich showed that he had fired practically every court-appointed lawyer ever=
 assigned to him---little wonder that he had botched his appeals.=A0 It als=
o showed he had filed fifty-one lawsuits against the government while in pr=
ison---nearly all dismissed immediately.=A0 She wanted nothing to do with i=
t."=0A=A0=A0=A0 Mr. Greenberg, your lawyer is totally incompetent to have s=
aid ANY of these things.=A0 I have made perfectly clear in my recent set of=
 emails to you:=0A1.=A0=A0=A0 You never verified any of these supposed 'fac=
ts', when in fact you had access to my 02-1052 lawsuit which would have tol=
d you the truth.=0A2.=A0=A0=A0=A0 I never was SUCCESSFUL at firing ANY atto=
rney assigned to my case.=0A3.=A0=A0=A0=A0 I never ATTEMPTED to fire Avenia=
, Mandel,=A0 Floit, Bukey, and Solovy.=0A4.=A0=A0=A0=A0 When, finally, I di=
d begin to ATTEMPT to fire an attorney, Leen, I was entirely unsuccessful, =
indeed for a period of 9 years.=0A5.=A0=A0=A0=A0 When I did ATTEMPT to fire=
 Annemarie Levins, and ordered her to NOT file that appeal, I was completel=
y unsuccessful in that attempt.=0A6.=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 I did not file "Fifty-o=
ne lawsuits against the government".=A0=A0 As I have already explained to y=
ou, I DID file well over 100 "habeas corpus" actions, which your lawyer was=
 apparently unable to distinguish from 'lawsuits'.=A0 But since your lawyer=
 probably didn't even bother to do anymore than read the dockets for some o=
f these cases, it is perfectly obvious that she had no genuine idea why the=
se habeas corpus actions were "dismissed immediately".=A0 In other words, s=
he (presumably) didn't know whether those dismissals were 'genuine', or whe=
ther the dismissals were entirely frivolous.=A0 I can assure you that these=
 dismissals were entirely frivolous.=A0 But, you didn't check my side of th=
e story, because YOU DIDN'T ASK ME!=A0 That's called "bias".=0A=0A7.=A0=A0=
=A0=A0 _I_ never "botched any appeals".=A0 The appeals, to the extent they =
were 'botched', were 'botched' by the attorneys who were assigned to me, an=
d (I claim) were actually assigned for the PURPOSE of 'botching' those appe=
als.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Mr. Greenberg, at this point you have an obligation, no=
t merely to APOLOGIZE, but in fact to set the record straight.=A0 And I mea=
n, not only in future editions of your book, but also to investigate the re=
ality of the facts of the case.=A0 After all of the victimization I faced a=
t the hands of the government and its thugs, you come along and make the si=
tuation worse!=A0 You try to make me look like a nut, when the reality is p=
recisely as I have long claimed:=A0 I am the victim of the Federal governme=

rt of the problem by changing your book, and by writing a long article for =
Forbes telling (at least) how you claim to have been hoodwinked by the Fede=

 Fw: Your errors about me in your book.=0A =0A=0A=0AMr Greenberg,=0A=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0 I will continue about the history of 'my' attorneys, who were 'my=
' attorneys in name only:=A0 They were actually the attorneys of "The Unite=
d States of America", and of their colluding employees.=A0=A0=A0 While I wo=
uld like to say that my 'next' attorney was Jonathan Solovy, given the pape=
rwork I should first deal with a couple of 'asterisks', named Catherine Flo=
it and David Bukey.=0A=A0=0A=A0=A0=A0 At some point after I wrote that lett=
er to the Ninth Circuit Court, I received a letter (about June 2000?) from =
an attorney named Catherine Floit.=A0 I called her by telephone, and I expl=
ained a bit about the history of prior attorneys Peter Avenia and Judith Ma=
ndel.=A0 I further explained that I had very, very serious suspicions about=
 government corruption by these attorneys, and the government in general.=
=A0 I said that I would be suing those attorneys, and any other people who =
assisted the government corruption I then suspected.=A0 (Note:=A0 Remember,=
 at that point, I did not know about the pre-April existence of phony, forg=
ed Ninth Circuit Court appeal 99-30210.)=A0 I was surprised when that phone=
 call to Catherine Floit didn't last very long after that!=A0 (A minute?)=
=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 'What happened?', I thought!=A0 It turns out that Floit lat=
er contacted the people who had appointed her (the Public Defenders' Office=
 in Seattle Washington, I think.) and asked to be de-assigned to my case.=
=A0 I later heard that she CLAIMED (quite falsely) that I had 'threatened' =
her!=A0=A0 But I hadn't threatened her at all!=A0 I had no reason to do so,=
 particularly at that early stage in her representation.=A0 But at this poi=
nt I knew very little about the law.=A0=A0 Eventually (a few years later, a=
fter I first saw the docket for the forged appeal case 99-30210, in late Ju=
ne 2003; see Jonathan Solovy's 'representation', which I will shortly write=
 about) I realized that Floit must have been informed about the fact that t=
he case she had been assigned to handle, 99-30210, was ALREADY a fraud, and=
 in my phone call with her she learned that I was rather well-informed abou=
t the corruption of those two prior attorneys, Avenia and Mandel, AND that =
I intended
 to sue them, etc.=A0 In other words, she understood that if she took that =
case, and if she did what the government wanted her to do, she herself was =
almost certainly going to get sued, and for exactly the kinds of things tha=
t Avenia and Mandel were already 'in the crosshairs' for having done in the=
 past.=0A=A0=0A=A0=A0=A0 When an attorney is ASSIGNED a case (by a judge or=
 a court) it's fairly hard to 'get out of it'.=A0 Such an attorney has to h=
ave a rather 'good' (but not necessarily, 'valid') reason to be relieved of=
 that responsibility.=A0 Floit (I realized, years later) could not have sim=
ply said, "Jim Bell is on to them/us!!!=A0 He's going to sue us!".=A0=A0 Fl=
oit could not have said, "The government is engaging in corruption against =
Bell, and I don't want to be part of it!".=A0=A0=A0 So, what was she going =
to do?=A0=A0 It turns out that the easiest way for her to get out of the as=
signment was to (falsely) claim, "Jim Bell threatened me!!!".=A0=A0 Which s=
he, apparently, did.=A0 But I DIDN'T threaten her.=A0 But that didn't matte=
r:=A0 Floit's mere allegation amounted to a "Get out of representation free=
" card, analogous to Monopoly's "Get out of jail free" card.=A0 She was not=
 obligated to actually prove I'd done anything:=A0 No proof was required, o=
r even requested.=A0 The
 allegation itself was quite enough.=A0 As she, no doubt, knew quite well.=
=0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 A few weeks later, another attorney (David Bukey) was=
 assigned, but I didn't hear of that.=A0 I was not given any notification t=
hat Bukey had been assigned:=A0 Apparently Bukey heard of his assignment, r=
efused it, and he never contacted me.=A0 Nor did anyone else contact me, ei=
ther, on any subject, including that of Bukey or his (brief) assignment to =
my case. =A0 During this time, I wrote yet another letter to the Ninth Circ=
uit Court basically asking, "Where's my representation?".=A0 =0A=0A=0ANotic=
e, now, that the count is up to FOUR:=A0 Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and Bukey:=
=A0 None of these attorneys did I ever attempt to 'fire'.=A0 (And I didn't =
even learn that Bukey was supposed to be representing me, until after he ha=
d been relieved of that.)=A0=A0 The closest to even 'attempting to fire' I =
had done was when I tried to prevent Avenia from being relieved, because I =
didn't want his successor (who turned out to be Mandel: I didn't want anybo=
dy assigned, because I had already gotten promises from Avenia to do invest=
igation, which eventually he never effectively did) to be assigned.=A0=A0=
=A0 But at that, I was unsuccessful at both, of course.=0A=0AJonathan Solov=
y:=0A=A0=A0=A0 Eventually, Solovy was assigned to case 99-30210, as I vague=
ly recall in about August 2000.=A0 Keep in mind that I STILL didn't know ab=
out the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210 as of then:=A0 I would only=

 OBVIOUSLY wrong.=A0 At least, I didn't recognize that in 2000.=A0 He wrote=
 the appeal, 99-30210, filed it, and it lost. I think he may also have writ=
ten a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court, which also obviously fa=
iled. =A0 (I don't recall what they contained; I didn't learn the law until=
 beginning December 2000).=A0=A0 But I can say this much:=A0 At no time dur=
ing Solovy's representation did he EVER say to me anything that would have =
alerted me to the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210.=A0 I may not hav=
e known much (or even 'anything') about Federal law in September, 2000, but=
 if he had said something like "Jim, I see you've been assigned pro-se to t=
his appeal since July 1999:=A0 What are your theories as to appealing this =
case?"=A0 I would have been alerted, with a distinct start, and I would hav=
e instantly asked him, "What do you mean?=A0=A0 I thought I began this case=
 in April 2000, when I wrote a letter to the
 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?=A0 What's this about July 1999?!?".=0A=0A=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 By the time I first saw a copy of the docket for case 99-30210=
, on about June 20, 2003, I knew FAR more Federal law.=A0 I'd spent since a=
bout December 2000 in a jail/prison law library.=A0 In fact, two of the REA=
SONS I wrote to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in early June 2003, ask=
ing for the docket for 99-30210, were:=0A=0A1.=A0=A0=A0 Clearing up loose e=
nds for my Portland Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, I remembered that I had=
 (thought!) initiated that appeal (99-30210) by means of mailing a letter t=
o the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asking for an appeal.=A0 (In case 97-=
5270, as I recall).=A0 As of June 2003, I understood that the rules require=
d that to appeal, somebody needs to file a 'Notice of Appeal' within about =
two weeks of the date of the order-entry.=A0 My letter of April 2000 was, I=
 then realized, nearly ten (10) months too late to initiate an appeal in th=
at case.=A0 "So why," I thought, "wasn't that letter immediately rejected?!=
?"=A0=A0 and "Why did they give me that appeal?"=0A=0A=0A2.=A0=A0=A0 At som=
e point, I recognized that the case-number of that appeal (99-30210) starte=
d with the number, "99", which stands for "1999", the date that appeal was =
initiated.=A0 In other words, I eventually realized (June 2003) that that a=
ppeal had been begun in 1999, NOT in 2000.=A0=A0 Evidently, my letter of Ap=
ril 2000 DIDN'T 'start the ball rolling' on that appeal.=A0 =0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=
=A0 Therefore, and being quite suspicious, I wrote a bland, routine note in=
 early June 2003 to the Ninth Circuit, asking for the copy of the docket fo=
r case 99-30210, which I had never seen before.=A0 I received an envelope a=
bout June 20, 2003, containing a copy of that docket.=A0 The most obvious t=
hing that struck me about that docket was that case 99-30210 DIDN'T start i=
n April 2000, as I had previously assumed.=A0 It was quite clear, instead t=
hat it had begun in July 1999.=A0 (Although, the 'Notice of Appeal' had act=
ually been filed about June 20, 1999).=A0=A0 Something VERY VERY suspicious=
 had been going on!=A0 Secondly, I looked through the various docket entrie=
s, and I could see that this case had appeared to have been active:=A0 Oste=
nsibly, I had actually been 'pro se' (representing myself) which I knew tha=
t I hadn't been doing!=A0 (because, of course, I hadn't even known about th=
e existence of that case, prior to May 2000, thinking I initiated it with
 a letter to the Ninth Circuit in late April 2000).=A0=A0 In fact, I could =
see that there were two filings, about November 10, 1999, and March 2, 2000=
, which purported to have been filed by me!=A0 (And, obviously, I knew that=
 I hadn't filed them!)=A0 Most importantly, I realized that I had not recei=
ved ANY of these many mailings while I was at Seatac FDC (until Sept 3, 199=
9) nor any while I was at Phoenix FCI (From Sept 10, 1999 though April 13, =
2000, when I was released; I was at the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Cent=
er for a week from Sept 3 to Sept 10, 1999.)=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Note:=A0 I rece=
ived NONE of the mailings from the Ninth Circuit Court during July 1999 thr=
ough April 2000, because the Bureau of Prisons staff at both those location=
s hid them from me.=A0 (Did not deliver them to me).=A0 If I had received E=
VEN ONE of those mailings, I would have been alerted that an appeal existed=
.=A0 I didn't receive even a single one.=A0 Of course, I wasn't EXPECTING a=
 single one, either, because I was not then aware that appeal 99-30210 exis=
ted.=0A=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 But there was more.=A0=A0 I looked at the docket ite=
m numbers at the middle of the docket pages (between the dates on the left,=
 and the descriptions of the entries on the right) and I noticed that they =
were not all there.=A0 Some were out of order (I later understood that mere=
ly being out of order is not abnormal) but 29 of the first 79 docket entry =
numbers simply were not present!=A0=A0 Since I already knew there had to be=
 a dramatic amount of corruption associated with this case, I considered th=
at a very significant clue.=A0 Later, weeks and months later, I showed this=
 docket to numerous 'jailhouse lawyers', and to a person, they said they ha=
d never seen even a single 'missing' docket entry number on any dockets the=
y had ever seen.=A0 Over the subsequent years, I also looked at any docket =
I could get my hands on, and never once was I able to identify even a singl=
e 'missing' docket entry number on any docket.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 An explanatio=
n is in order.=A0 I believe that in about May 2000, some of the staff of th=
e Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals engaged in a 'forgery party' of the docket=
 for case 99-30210.=A0 I think that they realized that they could not deny =
me an appeal in that probation-revocation case, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY GI=
VEN ME THAT APPEAL!=A0 But, they also realized that they couldn't simply co=
ntinue on with that forgery, because they knew that I DIDN'T KNOW of the ex=
istence of appeal 99-30210 during the time of June 1999 through April 2000.=
=A0 They knew that they couldn't simply initiate a new appeal, because a re=
cord of appeal 99-30210 already existed.=A0 They also knew that they couldn=
't allow me to see a copy of the docket for 99-30210, because that would ha=
ve alerted me (just as it eventually alerted me in June 2003) that the appe=
al had existed, yet had been concealed from me during the period June 1999 =
through April 2000.=A0 What they had to do, I think,
 was to RE-forge that docket, which they did in May 2000, and then assign a=
 colluding attorney (First Floit, then Bukey, then Solovy) who would help c=
onceal the history of this case from me, and then write a serviceable 'appe=
al', so that it could lose:=A0 Their hope, apparently, was that I would be =
satisfied with that.=A0 And until June 2003, I was indeed 'satisfied'.=0A=
=0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 Perhaps a couple months after I first saw that copy of the =
docket for case 99-30210, I wrote a letter to Jonathan Solovy.=A0 (He had n=
ever been 'de-assigned' to my case).=A0=A0 I don't recall,=A0 precisely, wh=
at I said (It's been 10 years!), but I asked him to look into into the prob=
lem.=A0 His response?=A0 Well, suddenly he had developed 'carpal tunnel syn=
drome' (I was well aware of that condition) and he couldn't handle my case =
anymore!=A0=A0 I insisted; He wrote to the judge, asking that he be allowed=
 to withdraw.=A0 Actually, I think he wrote to the WRONG judge!=A0=A0 I thi=
nk he wrote to Judge Burgess, of the District Court case, 97-5270, NOT the =
Ninth Circuit appeals court=A0 (99-30210).=A0 But it didn't matter:=A0 he w=
as allowed to withdraw.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 Please note:=A0 Jonathan Solovy was =
my FIFTH attorney, if you are counting Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and Bukey bef=
ore him.=A0 And note that I didn't try to get Solovy, either, 'fired'.=A0 I=
ndeed, yet again I wanted to see Solovy to continue to handle that case (99=
-30210) in large part BECAUSE I knew that he had committed fraud against me=
 and, kinda-sorta, against the court as well.=A0 But, Solovy's fraud was in=
 league with the U.S. Attorneys (Seattle), the Federal Bureau of Prisons st=
aff at FDC Seatac, and at FCI Phoenix, and the staff of the Ninth Circuit C=
ourt of Appeals, and possibly others.=0A=0A=A0=A0=A0 So, where did you come=
 up with that claim that I fired "all" of my attorneys, HMMMMMMMM?????????=
=A0=A0 Sorry if I display a little schadenfreude, but I think I've earned t=
he right to complain.=A0=A0=A0 And I still haven't yet mentioned attorney R=

July 2002, and there was a 1-year limitation period on my amending that law=

It was, I believe, Judith Mandel who filed the one-page "Notice of Appeal" =
(About June 20, 1999) for my probation-revocation case in Tacoma Federal Co=
urt. (And she resigned about June 21, 1999).=A0  But she never sent me a co=

one if she had been going to 'allow' me to defend myself in any subsequent =
appeal.)=A0  Even that wouldn't have been a problem, EXCEPT that all of the=
 mailings subsequently done by the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals (or shoul=

equently (beginning about Sept=A0 10, 1999) at Phoenix FCI.=A0  The only pl=

 the most profitable.&nbsp; In principle, however, my fiber optic invention=
s number far more than this:&nbsp; The main problem is that isotope separat=
ion is rather expensive, and any such invention isn't worth doing unless th=

nbsp; The main reason my optical=0A fiber is practical is that the isotopic=
ally-modified core of the 125-micron fiber is only about 30 microns in diam=
eter, so that it uses very little isotopically-modified material.&nbsp;  My=

 period of April 1998 and June 1998, after which they arrested me for a 'su=

n 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled (U.S. v. Jones) that such a placement was=
 a "search" under the 4th Amendment.&nbsp; Indeed, in a 1999 9th Circuit Co=
urt of Appeals case (U.S. v.=0A McIver) , that court ruled that it was lega=
l (under certain circumstances inapplicable to me) for 'cops' (term used ge=

in any court hearing.&nbsp; I, quite the opposite, DEMANDED to my attorney,=
 Avenia, that he verify the tracking device(s) placement, and argue the mat=
