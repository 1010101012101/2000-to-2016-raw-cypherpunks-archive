Sorry, wrong again. Hatch is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints, LDS, aka Mormon. Not an actual Christian church. 
Details available with Google. Basically, Jesus is no more a divine 
figure in LDS than in Islam. In fact, LDS and Islam share a number of 
things in common with regard to the role of the various prophets and 
seers.

I've known a bunch of Mormons, and "jeebus-talking" is not  something 
they do much of.
