Ideally a client that mediates interactions should get trust
information from all relevant sources, and flag the user when
there is something unusual about an interaction.

However the more sources, the harder it is for mere software to
figure out what is meaningful and relevant, and therefore the
greater the risk that one will wind up continually throwing
irrelevant dialog boxes at the user, which the user eventually
learns to click through and ignore.

It is hard to do what you propose.
