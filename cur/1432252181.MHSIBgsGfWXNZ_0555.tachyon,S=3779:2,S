I think it's more about the principle of it. No sane, sensible, tolerant
person would go as far as to try to regulate spam. Or, indeed, UBE-friendly
ISPs. But bulk mailing is such reprehensible behavior that it surely
deserves a pile of social and technological sanctions. Blacklisting,
shunning, DoS attacks and teergrube-kinda software immediately spring to
mind, a combination of the first and last perhaps being the least
intrusive. I totally fail to grasp why governments seem so intent on
criminalizing most such measures. To me they seem like the essential
ingredients of basic cyber-hygiene.
