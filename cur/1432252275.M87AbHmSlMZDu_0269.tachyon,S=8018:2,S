This is from another thread, from awhile ago, but it popped up in my
mutt window today.

At my last 'full-time employee' gig, I was at a company that effectively 
lobotomized themselves with an idiotic "data retention policy". One test
engineer had 20 years of email going nearly back to when the company was 
started, and 'policy' was that it must be deleted.

The problem with that policy is that now you incentivize your employees
(and contractors) to run their own mail infrastructure and duplicate
everthing off-site because that is what any good attorney representing
the employee or the contractor would advise you to do.

Now the company attorney can, with a straight face, say "we deleted that
email, per our document retention policy". But anyone that can read 
between the lines can (or should) know that the good engineers will 
have off-company backups, and that email should be easily acquireable 
with an appropriate targeted spear-phishing expedition if you want to 
be covert, or a 'better job offer' if you want to be overt.

So what's the economic cost of lobotomizing your company by using exchange
and delete-this data retention policies?

really I think it's just a game venture capitalists play where they tell
investors that this company A really has unique new fancy IP when it all
just came from company B because you hired all their engineers and their
email archives.
