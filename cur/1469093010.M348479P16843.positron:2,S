	Well, enjoy your amusement...

	That's your personal preference, not an argument.
	
	And the "better than nothing" bit has been addressed ad
	nauseam. Cheap VPNs are also 'better than nothing'.

	I can't recall if I mentioned VPNs? Freenet? Maidsafe, if they
	ever finish it? I don't know. 

	Have the 'cypherpunks' create something? Aren't some
	'cypherpunks' rather rich? And what about the people who bought
	bitcoins at 10 cents? Can't they put their money where their

	Ah no. Better to use the pentagon's fake anonimity network.

	I'm not focussing on how to apply patches to
	broken-by-design tor at the moment...

	That is absurd. If what you have is not fitted for the task at
	hand you are just wasting your time.
