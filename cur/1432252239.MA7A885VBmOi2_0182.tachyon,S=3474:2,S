Perhaps instead of offering "Jim Choate" money to take the LSAT, the money should be offered for "Jim Choate" passing a Turing test to be judged by contributors to the fund.  Also other prizes could be given for things like figuring out what hardware "Jim Choate" is running on.  Just a thought since he doesn't seem likely to take the LSAT.
