Never mind that. They drop to $5k/mule (talk about absurd - there's this 
story about this Chinese emporer, some bloke who made him happy, a chess 
board, and a bunch of rice...). Doubles the transport cost. I predict an
almost immediate increase of marijuana cost of approx. 20-25%. Stock up
now! (just kidding, really)

At some point they'll have to come face to face with the fact that there
is no (zero, nada, nil, none, nope, not happen') ethical or moral
justification for regulation of 'consensual crimes' in a democracy. That
the only thing it demonstrates is that power corrupts. That to stop
somebody from willingly smoking a doobie is about the silliest fucking
thing any 'rational' man can come up with.

When they see the light they will see that taxation will more than make up
for any social 'disruption' it might cause.

People are people, outside of murder, physical assault, or theft as long
as both parties say "I do!" it ain't nobodies business.
