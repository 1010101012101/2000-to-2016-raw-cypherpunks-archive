I think this is trivially possible with, well, just the twitter rss
feeds. But, with yahoo pipes you make *them* follow the rss feeds, and
you watch the output of that. In that way, you aren't directly linked
to them, yahoo is, and they'd need to follow the pipe and see who owns
it/visits it. But if you make it public, it's visitable by anyone. And
I don't think yahoo requires any personal info.

Of course, the idea with the pipes is that you could forward the data
around a bit, munge it, mix it in with some other services, perhaps
encrypt or what-not. But I've not gone to town on what is available
with them.

Are you thinking specifically about the request for info on Wikileaks
followers? If you just follow the public RSS of that twitter account
(assuming it is public) surely they don't have any info on you,
because you haven't had to join twitter to do that. I must admit, I
don't have much of an idea of how twitter handles that stuff, as I
haven't used it for a few years.
