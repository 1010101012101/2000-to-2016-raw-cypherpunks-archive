See,

the problem with your attitude is that it results in a "me me me" approach.

If mankind would act that way we would have been extinct a long time 
ago. A single human being is a rather weak individual. There isn't much 
we could have done.

Only after we managed to work together as a society we were able to 
"conquer" the planet, and most likely ultimatly destroy it for all forms 
of life.

Even though I do not agree with people sitting on their asses and not 
working, I do not think that we should turn our backs to them and ignore 
them. If society casts out the weakest as a strategie of survival than 
something here is horribly wrong.

Your Stereotyping doesn't really help either to make your point as they 
are just simply painting black and white, and literally meaning it that way.

Quality of Life has nothing to do with how much money you make, but how 
you live your life. This seems to be something that is slowly forgotten 
in the western world, especially north america.
