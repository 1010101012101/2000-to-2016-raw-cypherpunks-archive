Well, I think a lot of people actually get some real $$$ doing this kind of 
stuff. And as an engineer/physicist by training, I can't help thinking this 
is bulsshit as well at best, and a real danger at worst...I can't imagine 
how much damage George Guilder caused in Telecom.

Nevertheless, if people are wiling to regularly pay for "motivational 
speakers" (I'm thinking of Chris Farley), perhaps they are providing some 
kind of value that is not so easily assessed...a lot of folks probably grew 
up in Church-going homes and they are used to be Preached at. So...companies 
pay for oporae preachers to give their sales folks (for instance) a 
warm-and-fuzzy.

BUT...it's clear to me that there's a lot of money going to sheisters like 
this.
