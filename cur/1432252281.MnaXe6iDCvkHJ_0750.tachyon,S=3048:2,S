 >>You know, historically, when there is no reliable justice system,
society gets blood feuds,
etc.   When the justice system is unreliable for sheeple but reliable
for a special class,
maybe AP *does* have a future.  Meanwhile the traditional bag of cash &
friend of a friend
will have to do.<<

Back to the future.The wild west with computers.Westworld.Vigilante justice 
in slow motion via AP gives bad guys and gals time to "Get out of Dodge!"
If AP doesnt have a future soon,real soon,I dont think any of us have.
