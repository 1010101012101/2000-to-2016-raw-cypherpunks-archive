There's an ARM system in there: http://www.entropykey.co.uk/
but in principle you can resurrect something like that, or
wait until the company sees fit to sell that product again.

You don't need radiation. 12 USD USB SDR can sample 1.5 Msamples/s
at 8 bit, and http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/3469
is as simple as it gets, and is amplifies effectively quantum
noise. 

I'm not sure how complex 
http://www.realtek.com.tw/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&PFid=35&Level=4&Conn=3&ProdID=257
is, but you can certainly decap a representative sample from
each lot to validate it.

Seems like a decent business idea.
