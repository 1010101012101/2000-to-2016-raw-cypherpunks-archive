Those who peer at children in public could find themselves on the wrong 
side of the law in Maine soon.

A bill that passed the House last month aims to strengthen the crime of 
visual sexual aggression against children, according to state Rep. Dawn 
Hill, D-York.

Her involvement started when Ogunquit Police Lt. David Alexander was 
called to a local beach to deal with a man who appeared to be observing 
children entering the community bathrooms. Because the state statute 
prevents arrests for visual sexual aggression of a child in a public 
place, Alexander said he and his fellow officer could only ask the man 
to move along.

"There was no violation of law that we could enforce. There was nothing 
we could charge him with," Alexander said.

He attended a talk with Hill a week later and brought the case to her 
attention. Hill pledged to do what she could, Alexander said, and the 
result was a change through the Criminal Justice and Public Safety 
Committee in the House, which made the law applicable in both private 
and public places.

Alexander said he's grateful Hill was willing to take up the cause, and 
is hopeful the measure will clear the Senate.

"I'll be pleased that we were able to identify this flaw and take steps 
to rectify it," he said.

Under the bill, if someone is arrested for viewing children in a public 
place, it would be a Class D felony if the child is between 12 to 14 
years old and a Class C felony if the child is under 12, according to 
Alexander.

Hill said she believes the move was necessary to correct what she called 
a "loophole" in the state's criminal law statutes.

"I told Lt. Alexander that I would be happy to work with him and sponsor 
a bill that would correct this in the 2008 session," Hill said. "And so 
we did."

In arguing for the bill, Alexander said she cited public rest rooms as 
places where the people using them should have a reasonable expectation 
of privacy. She said the committee determined that there would not be 
any major side effects from expanding the statute to include public places.

The bill recently cleared a fiscal review, done because of the state's 
major prison budget crunch, and Hill said it should be heading to the 
Senate before long.

York Police Chief Doug Bracy said the statute would represent a fairly 
minor change that would help keep the public safer, especially children. 
He noted that York police respond fairly regularly to reports of public 
peepers on the town's beaches.

With ever-growing concern over sexual predators, Bracy said the arrests 
will also allow police to check backgrounds and determine if there is a 
criminal history involved.

"There is a growing outcry by the public to protect our children," Bracy 
said, noting that tourists from all over the country visit York.
