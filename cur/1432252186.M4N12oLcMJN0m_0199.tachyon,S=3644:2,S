	Portability, and durability were primary concerns, plus it's 
cheaper to make a "decent" sounding CD system than a *decent* 
sounding analog system.

	LPs (Well, *properly cared for LPS from early in the 
production run) (even to my Tin Ear) sound *better* than CDs when 
played on high end equipment, and when playing music where absolute 
fidelity matters.

	CDs are just cheaper to produce, easier to carry around, 
subject to less degradation when *mildly* abused etc.
