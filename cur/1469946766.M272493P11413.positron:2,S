Muuuaaah!  :*  My dear Rayzer, thank you a lot for caring about me, but I
will answer to Juan.  I like him very much.  He has lots of patience with
me and is always teaching and explaining me several things.  He is nice and
feels pity when I don't understand bad words, wordplays and concepts of
anarchism.  And I do love to annoy him, hihi!  ;)

'Mal cogida' is a very very very bad word in Spanish, which he teached me.
I like him enough to say that he is the only guy in the world who can call
me 'mal cogida' without being kicked right in the balls with all my
strenght, hihi!  :)

Juan dear, sorry, I will answer to your message, but a bit later.  Now I am
very busy, burning all my bras because they are oppressing my breasts!  :P

Nah, it's a joke.  Cute bras are very expensive, hihi!  ;)

Talking seriously, I am really busy, need to finish a lot of crazy stuff
and was stupid enough to delete the draft of my answer about sexism when
was distracted, d'oh!  :P

Sorry, I won't write about it again right now.  It's a boring theme.  Talk
to you soon!  Kisses, take care and eat chocolate!  :*
