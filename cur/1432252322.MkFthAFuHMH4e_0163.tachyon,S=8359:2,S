You clearly did not get the point, but let's move along your argument.

E-mail not allowing one to make his ego appreciated and envied in a structured nicely formatted page maybe?

Can you recode outlook, eudora and other closed source stuff people use(d) for e-mail handling for business? No? Well, that answers why it is hard to remove.

The gateway idea is interesting, but it has to be efficient enough and low cost enough for people to switch over. Something like bitmessage is not.

I think that answers your concern about SMTP transport in the clear, in less than one year the darkest bar in that chart will be close to 100%. If 80% of hosts demand strict encrypted transport, it will force the other 20% to change. Considering the snowden revelations and the fact that one year ago we barely used encrypted transport, having 1/4 already and accelerating is a good prospect.

Fixing the problem is better than overhauling all offices in the world, you clearly haven't been in may offices in your life.
