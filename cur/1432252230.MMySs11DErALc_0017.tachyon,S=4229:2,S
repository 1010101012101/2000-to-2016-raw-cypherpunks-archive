But then you are tilting at windmills, as no one who is reputable has 
made such a claim, that anonymity will always cost more than 
non-anonymity.

Sometimes anonymyity costs something. Sometimes traceability 
(_non_anonymity) has certain benefits worth trading for. Sometimes 
security costs a lot, sometimes not so much, sometimes almost nothing.

In general, these tradeoffs cannot be boiled down to a simple 
relationship of "anonymity costs more than nonanonymity."

As with the lock example, a lock almost always costs more than no 
lock. But the costs of having no lock may be much higher.

Things should not be reduced to simplicities.
