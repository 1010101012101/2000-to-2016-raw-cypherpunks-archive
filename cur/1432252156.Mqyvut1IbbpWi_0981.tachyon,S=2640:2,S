Has anyone done any research into how much better new cryptosystems
with proofs of security do, as opposed to their unproven cousins?  It
seems that having a proof of security doesn't actually improve the
odds that a system will survive attacks.  But thats my intuition, not
a proven fact. ;)

Has anyone read a stack of papers and done some statistics?
