That is the issue is it not?  The fact is the building of a nuclear bomb
and the associated risks are questionable.  Much easier to just work with
easy to find materials.

Incidentally - the process of refining U-235 from U-238 is not impossible
- and I suspect U-235 is easily available on the black market.  It's
normally distributed as little pellets.

But you are absolutly correct - much easier to just goto the local
supermarket and pick up a few sundries and bang - you've got a bomb - or
something dangerous.

My point was that it is unfortunate that humanity is so repressed that
issues exist which cause individuals or groups to manufacture such things
with the intent of committing harm.  Sept 11 is an excellent example of
this where planes became flying bombs.

And it is much easier to walk onto a plane and use it to cause harm then
building a nuclear device.
