Horrific news, as I am certain everyone here will agree.  Len was a 
one-off who will be urgently missed on a daily basis for generations to 
come.  Len "Wrote Code", "Ran Code", and everything else in-between.  
Never refusing a request for help, he gave more of himself on an average 
day than many give of themselves in decades.  Peace out Len.

Immediately on the heels of Len's earthshattering newsquake comes the 
first aftershock: Robert Morris is [finally?] dead at 78.  At least 
Morris got to finish most if not all of his meal before he checked out:

http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/124957294.html

Etc...

This is a July 4th weekend that the crypto and computing communities will 
remember for a very long time to come :-((   

I sincerely hope there's no "third" to "round out" the already bad news 
today.
