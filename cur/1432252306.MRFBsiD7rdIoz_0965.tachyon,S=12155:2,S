I'm familiar with J3M, but unfortunately none of the current J3M/informacam
techniques actually work, as they have no _external_ verifiability. There
isn't actually any information which ties the media to a place or a time,
it's just information encoded into data which could be applied to any
document at any time. By factoring the network, a geotemporal pkey system
would address this problem. J3M is good for tying information to a specific
device (sort of) - but not to a place or a time.
