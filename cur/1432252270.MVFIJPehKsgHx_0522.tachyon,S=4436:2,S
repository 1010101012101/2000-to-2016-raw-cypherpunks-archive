Um, no, it didn't. There was no jury in Silveira - Silveira was a 
constitutional challenge to legislation, which is a question of law decided 
by judges, not a fact question decided by juries.

Did you actually read the opinion, or just read some screwball summary of it?

Nope. That opinion was written, as the citation indicated, by the Court of 
Appeals for the First Circuit, not the Supreme Court.

While I do think that the 2nd Amendment does, in fact, protect an 
individual right to keep and bear arms, I think that the 1st Circuit's 
reasoning re _Miller_ in _Cases_ is actually quite reasonable. The opinion 
points out that interpreting _Miller_ so that it says the 2nd Amendment 
means that Congress can regulate firearms, but only ineffective or useless 
ones, is nonsensical. While I don't think the Ninth Circuit reads _Miller_ 
in a reasonable fashion, I don't think the "only useless weapons may be 
regulated" is an especially rational interpretation of it, either.

Yes, that is an unreasonable conclusion to reach. It is also unreasonable 
to conclude that the 2nd Amendment means that no regulation of weapons is 
constitutionally permissible. Even the 1st Amendment - which contains the 
words "shall make no law" - is interpreted to allow some regulation of 
speech. (e.g., shouting theater in a crowded fire, etc.)
