Somebody wrote in response to Bill Stewart's message:

  At least under Windows 98 you can "Start", "Programs", 
  "Accessories", "System Tools", "System Information", and 
  list the "System Hooks".  Most keyboard sniffers are 
  installed as "hooks".  If you see a new one, you may 
  have a problem.


Here's what a JYA machine shows (sorry if the table wraps):

Hook type      Hooked by      Application    DLL
path                                                           Application
path
____________________________________________________________________________

Keyboard       Wbhook32.dll   WEBSCANX.EXE   C:\PROGRAM FILES\NETWORK
ASSOCIATES\MCAFEE VIRUSSCAN\Wbhook32.dll  Same as DLL path
CBT            Pgphk.dll      PGPTRAY.EXE   
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\pgphk.dll                                       
D:\PGP658\PGPTRAY.EXE                                              
Mouse          Wbhook32.dll   WEBSCANX.EXE   C:\PROGRAM FILES\NETWORK
ASSOCIATES\MCAFEE VIRUSSCAN\Wbhook32.dll  Same as DLL path

Surely Network Associates/PGP have no connection to the 
snoopers, but why scan keyboard and mouse?
