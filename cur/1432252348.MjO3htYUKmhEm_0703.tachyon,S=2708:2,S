The US has not won since WW2. Rebellions, now called
terrorist wars, have been far more successful. If you want
to be a winner do not enlist in military forces of states, rather
get a spin contract far from danger, arguing the virtues of
mightily fearsome hardware and sacrificial patriotism.

The US, a hidebound state, engages in limited combat, dithers, 
gets youngsters killed, parades the funerals and heroes, eventually 
pulls out, and the apologists for warmongering do their dirty. 

Still, it can be said of US military might: more servicemen die 
of military and civilian accidents, ill health, murders and
suicide than in combat. Worse, deaths and maimings from 
friendly fire and bad medical care, not to say military justice,
remain a high hazard of high technology and a natsec/military
policy of acceptance and/or denial of responsibility for self-
caused casualties and homicidal behavior in abused and
abandoned service members -- Tim McVeigh one of tens
of thousands who attack at home due to momentum rigged
by inept military training and ethics.

Bob Hettinga is just baiting by putting up flimsy arguments
for western supremacy, evangelizing brand USA. Hoovering 
the yokels who cannot not believe their kind are chosen people.
Standard fare of US (Western, all) state-sponsored education 
and religion and, oh my god, journalism.

Quote of the day from the NY Times: "every journalist should
spend a month in jail to appreciate the freedom of the
press." This from a reporter for the Far Eastern Economic
Report, to be closed shortly by Dow Jones.
