It has no implications other than Mr. Best has too much time on his hands.
It is not a big deal in any way.

I don't think anyone's missing the point.
The mass of dumps are yet another datapoint that confirms the ethos, the
integrity of the slides, whether there are false flags, etc, doesn't matter
in the least. Did the GCHQ drink too much to evade KD fingerprinting while
writing the slides, and instead scraped together a photoshopped screenie?

I am amused by the theory that this is all an elaborate troll, in 10 years
Snowden will declare he personally made it up in one epic last disclosure,
with a dickbutt on the last slide.

There's one message:
Whatever is technically possible will happen. It will continue to happen,
whether they be your government, someone else's government a corporation
that handles your data or by criminals.

Build systems that are secure from what is technically possible; not
because you've deleted the logs - but because there is no data to grab.
