I can't sympathise much on this basis. A family member, a retired cop
and the family shame, confirmed what I had suspected: that most people
in jail are there because they couldn't keep their mouths shut --- on
the street, in the police station, in court. And many who are denied
parole or who have it revoked couldn't keep their mouths shut in jail.
To tell the truth, I don't think Ralph Waldo Emerson, Martin Luther King,
etal, were particularly concerned about receiving sympathy.
Even if you couldn't shut up, why didn't you use an anonymizer? You have
a characteristic writing style, but there are other rambling, obscure
writers on c-punks and the writing couldn't be positively linked to you.
Or, better yet, you could learn to write in a conventional,
straightforward, clear style and have complete deniability.

My parole conditions prevent me from using anonymizers or
anonymous remailers.
Besides, I had complete deniability at the time of my original
conviction, but it didn't matter, because I was denied the right
to defend myself or interfere with the government's attorney
conceding my guilt.
