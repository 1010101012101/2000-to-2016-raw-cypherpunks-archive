Well, this is pretty much pure bullshit. 

The LE folks are hip to using ir imaging to figure
out who is running a whole lotta lights inside at
night to determine who is doing home cultivation. 

They use this technique as probable cause to request
a (rubber stamped) search warrant. Not the other way
around.

This type of surveillence is allowed without warrent 
because it is non-invasive.
