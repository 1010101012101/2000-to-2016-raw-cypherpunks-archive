Why bother with hermetic cases? Just cover the disc with a thin layer of
something inert with suitable transparency.

Or, if the coating is thin, just polish it away. Toothpaste does wonders.

Or, the oxidized layer could be maybe reduced back, using a suitable
chemical process. Or, it could be oxidized further, breaking the
polyaromatic structures causing light absorption.

Oh, the possibilities! I *knew* those thick chemistry books will be handy
for me to keep around! :)
