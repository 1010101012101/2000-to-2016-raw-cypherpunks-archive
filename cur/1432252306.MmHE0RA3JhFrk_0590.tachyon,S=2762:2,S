Some significant fraction of the cars in the States have (generally
Chinese-made) flags fluttering on them.  And since, well,
stuff happens, some of these have broken and now you see flags
on the ground by the side of the road.

This is twisted because the flag is never supposed
to touch the ground, etc., but we'll see lots of that as the
cheap plastic flags disintegrate.  [That wasn't a metaphor
but it could be....]

In fact you're supposed to burn weathered flags ---and of
course, folks' reaction to burning the flag *prematurely* is how
you distinguish freedom (eg of expression) lovers from poseurs.
