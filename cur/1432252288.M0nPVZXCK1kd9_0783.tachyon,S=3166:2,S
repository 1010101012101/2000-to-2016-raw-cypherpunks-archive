A Calif native friend of mine had griped to me (years ago)
that the Princeton, NJ based SATs were biassed: they had
an analogy like 

	furnace:basement::stove:______

and my SoCal friend complained that furnaces are in walls or maybe an 
attic, and he had never seen a basement.  Coming from places
where triple-paned glass is the norm, I found this absurd,
but soon realized it was likely.  Tens of millions of Californians
have *no idea* of the many-armed oil-fed beast that lives in basements..
