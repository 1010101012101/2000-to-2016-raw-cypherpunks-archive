Yes - it'd never work.  Electronic Engineers are a strange bunch.  I've
spent way too much of my time in a room full of people staring at mask
plots of various 50M transistor and up CPUS looking for flaws, areas for
optimization, etc.  It's part of every CPU design cycle and the
developers hate it, but it has to be done.  If the mask doesn't match
the circuit you designed, you can spot that kind of thing fairly
quickly.  If it didn't match in a way that actually did something
useful, then it'd leap right out at you as soon as you unfurled the
plot.

It's not just at the design review stage, either.  The fab people are
constantly processing the chip design, performing their own reviews,
staring through microscopes at the wafers: working on alignment issues,
probing test points, stripping layers and taking cross-sections to
examine everything from VIA quality to metalization issues.  Something
out of the ordinary would make itself obvious pretty quickly.

These people live inside their chips.  That's why they sort of work.

Regards,
 Robert.

I'm sure you're right.  It was a fun strawman to build, though.

Linux Kernel Back-Door Hack Attempt Discovered

More precisely into the CVS mirror of the Linux kernel, which is
primarily maintained with BitKeeper. This copy of the tree is
unauthoritative, the only authoritative copy sits on Linus' personal
machine. Thus for this copy to get merged into Linux proper, someone would
have to pull a copy from CVS, generate a patch containing the bogus
code, and then ship it off to Linus. Linus would then have to
completely fail to notice the meaningless code in an unrelated patch
and apply it. As the kernel is currently in deep freeze, possibly
weeks away from release, this is a rather unlikely scenario.

More importantly, this is a mirror, and immediately broke on the next
mirror update, and updates happen multiple times a day.

Except Zwane in fact knew exactly what the code was doing when he
commented on its oddness and had to suffer dozens of people writing to
explain the code to him.

There was very little sophistication in this attack.

a) It attacked a secondary repository with no likely method of getting
fed into the core
b) It got noticed as corruption by the automatic update tools immediately
c) The patch itself created unreachable code which current compilers
will warn you about
d) And it wasn't particularly subtle by kernel standards

We haven't heard how the attack was planted yet, but I'm expecting
we'll hear it was done with script-kiddie tools.

If you want to get a backdoor in the kernel, a more likely approach is
to stick it in some poorly audited peripheral code and submit it when
there's not a code freeze on. Even then, odds are heavily against you.

The code was inserted into a CVS mirror of the kernel.  The kernel
itself is stored and updated in BitKeeper, primarily on a machine of
Linus's, and then copied to a public BitKeeper archive, and from
there to the CVS mirror.  Neither BitKeeper machine was not broken
into and their code was not changed.  So it's arguable whether the
change, which was caught within 24 hours, constituted changing the
Linux kernel.  I would argue no.
