the link reads:

"A senior official of DoT said the report is expected to be submitted by November third week and most likely the existing ISP licences would be amended to incorporate penalty and punishment for the ISP and the mail sender respectively for an open Wi-Fi network."

It would be interesting to see if they recommend WEP since it can be 'hacked' if traffic is abundant. Maybe they will recommend WPA-1 or WPA-2.
How hard is it to 'hack' cable? How hard is it to find an alternative? They seem to be focusing on a very narrow threat scenario and finding a solution to it.
