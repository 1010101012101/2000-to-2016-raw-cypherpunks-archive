Not at all. Tim has spoken on many occassions how he feels that any
'special' considerations with respect to handicapped is wrong and that his
solution is to not hire them.

He has also stated that he felt that the public expulsion of lesbians from
a public event was justified.

In general Tim's solution to anything that irritates Tim is to shoot it.
(Ok, that's a slight exageration; but not by much)

Check the archives, you can read it in Tim's own words. You don't, and
shouldn't, take my word for it.
