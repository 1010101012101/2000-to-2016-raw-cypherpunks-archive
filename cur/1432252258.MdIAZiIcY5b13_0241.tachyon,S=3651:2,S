There is lots of junk up there.  Schemes to de-orbit satellites at the end of their useful life have been put forward but they always fail on the liability issue.  Apparently if a satellite falls out of orbit it is an "act of god" and the owner/insurer is not responsible for damages, but if the satellite is deliberately de-orbitted the owner/insurer is on the hook.  No one, partiucularly the insurance companies wants to try it.  This despite a high degree of confidence in being able to bring a satellite down in a hopefully empty patch of ocean.  Insurance companies are very risk averse.
