At least one London Underground station has swastika patterns in 
its tiles, and apparently did through the War.

India House in London, the offices of the Indian High Commission 
(Commonwealth-speak for "embassy"), has swastikas in the 
scupltures on the outside walls, and also in murals inside.   They 
would have been there right through WW2, the building is from the 
1920s and early 30s. I have no idea if anyone covered them up.

Its in the Aldwych, right in the middle of London, passed by 
millions of people every year.  (Including me on my way to work). 
I've never heard of anyone complaining.
