This is also the same Joe Baptista who's not supposed to
email or fax the government* of (Ontario, I think?)
because he used to contact _all_ of them when they
(collectively) did or failed to do something that they need 
to be told to do or not do or do differently or whatever.
Apparently the Canadian equivalent to "needs killing" is "needs faxing"....  
and they weren't prepared to deal with that.

[*I'm using "government" in the US sense, which includes everybody
in the civil service working for them, rather than the British sense,
which refers to the top office-holders in the ruling party, 
(US-speak "The Administration".)
I'm not sure which term Canada tends to use. ]
