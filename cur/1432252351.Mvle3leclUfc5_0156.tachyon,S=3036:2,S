Local reports of eyewitnesses say an engine came off first,
and landed separately from the plane. The plane came in
"flat," not nosediving, thus perhaps somewhat under the 
pilot's control. Plane was zigzagging before it crashed.

The A300 can be landed without power, thus stable with
both engines gone. The engine that came off could have
caused destablization.

No evidence of an attack. However, terrorist games often
include scenarios of an ground to air attack on planes
leaving Kennedy as they pass over the lightly populated
areas of Queens (a lot of open water and marshlands).

No eyewitness accounts of missile tracks. One witness
of the engine falling said he heard no explosion beforehand.

Another said the sound of the plane was unusual, more
like a jet fighter than an airliner. Jet fighters are on regular
patrol around the city and NY airports.

As reported, bridges and tunnels closed, except some outbound 
traffic allowed. Phones here are jammed.
