If they can find out who you are, you aren't "anonymous," you are 
"confidential."

Anonymous means no trail was created which might be examined to disclose 
your identity, and no individuals are in possession of that information, 
and might disclose it.

Confidential means the information exists, but that people have promised 
to keep it secret, until they change their minds.

There is a vast difference, for instance, between confidential HIV 
testing, and anonymous HIV testing.

When I want to be anonymous online, I rely on technology, not peoples 
promises, and if this individual had been truly anonymous, he would not 
have been identified.
