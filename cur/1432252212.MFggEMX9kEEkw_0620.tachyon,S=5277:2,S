Good question. I guess it's just that I love to argue, and you could hardly
ask for a better assortment of intelligent and colorful characters to mix it up
with. I enjoy the back-and-forth; putting out documents people here might find 
useful and interesting--and most importantly, being able to give my unvarnished
opinion without, well, worrying too much about being rigorous and objective. 

For instance, if anyone wants to tell someone here to go fuck themselves,
they just come right out and tell them to go fuck themselves. How refreshing,
positively theraputic! Expressing a little heartfelt hostility isn't always a
bad thing...LOL

Anyway, Usenet is an entirely different animal. Why anyone so intelligent would
waste five minutes on that pack of pumpkin-headded "God Bless Amerikuh"
drooling imbeciles is beyond me. It literally makes me want to puke just 
thinking about it--no wonder Tim always seems so dyspeptic.

Think whatever you please, it certainly suits me fine.

Actually Congress is chock full of lightweights. And all their ratty little
undereducated staffers who soak up whatever lobbyists and their shoddy two-bit
partisan "guess tanks" happen to be shilling for this week.  I know plenty of
quality analysts who loathe testifing before Congress--quite unlike the faceless
horde of guess tank media whores scrambling for the spotlight. 

I'll say this much: getting pro-freedom policy analysts in positions where they
don't have to scramble to be heard will be the real accomplishment. Not just
knocking their heads against a brick wall as per usual.


>Besides: Gosh!  Just think: we'll be able to say that we knew her when.

No comment. LOL

Infuriatingly yours,

~Faustine.
