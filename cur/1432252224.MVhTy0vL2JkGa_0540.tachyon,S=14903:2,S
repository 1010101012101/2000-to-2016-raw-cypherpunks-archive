Paranoid, no. having personal experience of locked psychiatric wards and
snakeoil, i know the domain and this is not that. grounded observations
here.

my independent research has been messed around with for a decade plus, this
includes heavy surveillance, now ubiquitous. several projects shut down or
sabotaged due to active, hostile yet "kids gloves" interference, given
origin.

ex. political agenda shuts power off to apartment to stop basic research
into new computing system, threatens destruction of tools (NAS) needed to
prototype AMS (Asperger Management System). message: "stop or equipment
will be fried!" NAS and router already backdoored, NAS ghosted from
beginning anyway, hive of activity, manufactured for sabotage. so have to
stop and move onto plan Z^n.

under siege for years. existence as if held hostage within illegal prison
of hidden dictator. unwanted truth, its uncanny ability to rattle
megastructures of power. ping the biased networks, learn its programmatic
malfunctioning. private group using constitution as shield to illegally
attack citizens, then wrongly expecting to be able to hide behind it for
their own defense, no such boundary.

mistakenly thought refraining from saying what was actually on my mind
would be keeping it ~classy on cypherpunks :L

that is: no advisement of will-writing, death sentences, deballing, cutting
tongues out, hanging by nutsack, fingers cut off, eyes gouged out-- nothing
about war, takedown of vital public equipment, nor role of legal state
murder.

though i wanted the perpetrators to realize the horror that awaits them.
perhaps too understated- i.e. they are cursed with extreme and increasingly
misfortune as a result of their actions. the error-rate will be going way
up for those involved. unbearable pressure. the nightmare of hostile
metaphysical code.

context for computer attack: under heavy noise assault for 19 months,
ranging from harassment and abuse to long periods of sustained noise
torture. water remotely turned down in shower, 70+ times. VOC toxic fume
attacks, bombs of laundry detergents and chemicals, deteriorating nervous
system, debilitating. those involved denying their actions, trying to frame
as crazy, force suicide. noisemaking devices in the walls, remote switches
to control water valves. internet-connected. apartment the bizarre context
of embassy psychological trickery. events directly connected to ruling
ideology, power politics.

my equipment thoroughly surveilled. multi-level honeypot, manufactured to
spy and to break. completely monitored. whomever subverted my system in PC
takedown due to active retaliatory censoring (against crypto-ideas) walked
into a trap. even while i cannot figure it out, it is indicated the
perpetrators are KNOWN.

this event oddly sequenced with local CIA matched reference, power outage
to apartment and immediately back on. a second power blip recurs in the
morning, coinciding with computer attack. seemingly signaling hidden
observer.

the computer attack- DOS shell occasionally appears and vanishes upperleft
upon login. disembodied close-window [x] checkbox sometimes appears
upperleft of screen, as if virus or trojan, along with lower right MS red
signage warning of unidentifiable security threat at time of kernel panic,
locking down windows in pause, cascading into BSOD shutdown. clean
installing OS, new BIOS, nothing stops it, as if occurring outside OS and
motherboard control. occurs after one hour, as if strategically deployed or
unlocked bug to sabotage computing system that cannot be repaired by
software or disk overwrites. so my equipment is ruined. it had bug exploits
before, though now it cannot be used at all as a research tool. this is
active hostile censorship. destruction of property.

imagine if this is what 'crypto' is allowing the state to do to its
citizens, by ideological design. circuit faults as failsafes to stop public
communications via subversion, oversight of an illegal dictatorial state
and its methods, using these 'secret weapons' against the constitution:
freedom of thought, ideas, free expression. now what if those at the NSA or
CYBERCOMMAND are attacking citizens not aligned with the ruling
exploitative political agenda- the state as enemy.

(important to distinguish the context for remote hostile actions localized,
the reliance on 'virtual power' and allowing such functioning, versus
~securing its basis in actual grounded power. also, dependence on masks and
hiding to get away with these exploits, cheating, stealing, subterfuge and
sabotage, etc.)

there is a definite aspect of aggression and bullying, to the point of
torture, and destruction of peoples' lives that has somehow been normalized
by detachment of the population from its representation within the state,
via short-circuits.

that is realism for me. sanity. and my perspective of these events. that
someone would write off-list at the exact moment i begin first attempts at
repair then triggered a thoroughly muted response, not getting into the
fact that people die for doing these things. it is not all virtual and
remote. it can be extremely close-up and involve brutal events and
unimaginable pain and anguish. yet these same mediocre oppressors seem not
to believe there is anything to fear anymore.

there, balanced the psychic equilibrium. thanks.
