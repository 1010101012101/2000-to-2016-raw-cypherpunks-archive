[Of course Bush sees diplomacy with North Korea more likely to yield 
results: they've already got nukes.  Any nation that wants respect from the 
U.S. and to maintain their sovereignty needs to get theirs ASAP.  Wouldn't 
be surprised if Saddam is telling the truth about WoMD. You can bet that if 
the inspectors doesn't find any smoking gun the international community 
will quickly lose interest.  He has less need to develop them himself if he 
can purchase them covertly from NK.  Probably already has all presents for 
next Ramadam picked out and paid for ;-) ]

Bush More Hopeful for Diplomacy With Korea Than Iraq
By DAVID STOUT[]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31  President Bush said today that he was still hopeful 
that the confrontations with Iraq and North Korea could be resolved through 
diplomacy rather than war, though he seemed to express deeper concern over 
Iraq.
