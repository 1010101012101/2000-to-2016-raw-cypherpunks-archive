	NEW YORK -- Former National Security Agency director Bobby Ray
	Inman lashed out at the Bush administration Monday night over its
	continued use of warrantless domestic wiretaps, making him one of
	the highest-ranking former intelligence officials to criticize the
	program in public, analysts say.

	This activity is not authorized," Inman said, as part of a panel
	discussion on eavesdropping that was sponsored by The New York
	Public Library. The Bush administration "need(s) to get away from
	the idea that they can continue doing it."

As the article goes on to point out, one can hardly accuse Inman of not
understanding the value of SIGINT.  In fact, he wants this sort of
wiretapping to continue -- but only after Congress amends the law.
