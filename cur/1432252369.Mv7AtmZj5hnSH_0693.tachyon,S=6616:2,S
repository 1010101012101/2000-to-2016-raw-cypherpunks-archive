Ex-Stasi Spy Chief Markus Wolf Hired By Homeland Security?



Dec. 6, 2004
Alex Jones
Prison Planet

Political analyst Al Martin, who has in the past proven accurate in getting
ahead of the news curve, is reporting that Homeland Security have hired
former Stasi head, the 'Silver Fox' Markus Wolf.

Martin states, "Wolf is the man that effectively built the East German state
intelligence operation's internal directorate," Martin continues. "He turned
half the population into informants. That is his specialty, is taking a
population, constructing the various state divisions, mechanisms of control,
in order to organize informants within the population. That is his real
specialty. And that is precisely, as Primakov has intimated, why Wolf is
being brought in. The regime knows that once all of Patriot II is in law and
they begin working on Patriot III, they will then begin to establish the
internal mechanism to coordinate, as an official function of state, a system
of informants. Wolf's speciality was to turn East Germany into the greatest
and most efficient informant state ever created."

On a radio appearance earlier today Martin stated that the admission that
Wolf would be hired was made in a BBC radio interview given by the former
head of the KGB, General Yevgeni Primakov.

Martin had previously reported that Primakov had been hired as a consultant
by the US Department of Homeland Security to implement CAPPS II and the
national iD card system which he dubbed an 'internal passport'.

Sources close to Martin have told Alex Jones confidentially that the
appointment of Wolf was also confirmed by a US Congressman.

During his radio interview, Martin outlined the immediate agenda. The
remaining portions of the 9/11 Commission intelligence reccomendations which
include the introduction of a national ID card would be passed and
subsequently 'Patriot Act 3,' which would include the formal establishment
of a Stasi-like domestic spying organisation which would be similar in scope
to the TIPS program.

TIPS, which was supposedly nixed by Congress, would have recruited one in
twenty-four Americans as domestic informants, a higher percentage than was
used by the Stasi in East Germany.

Government funding was cut but private funding continues and the same
program was intriduced under a number of sub-divisions including AmeriCorps,
SecureCorps and the Highway Watch program.

After the passage of Patriot Act 3 Wolf and Primakov would be tapped for
their expertise in further collapsing America into a surveillance grid
police state. Primakov has openly stated that they are working on behalf of
Bush and Cheney to complete the 'Sovietization of America.
