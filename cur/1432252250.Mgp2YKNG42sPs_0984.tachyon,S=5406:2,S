One would think the more interesting question for you to ask is why I
chose the word permit-->S<--. Pick up the pace, Sherlock.

But what's so amusing is how incredibly well I hide it.

Of course, the most obvious thing to do would be to give you the
standard-issue sermon about what happened to people trapped in various
historical crises when they failed to prepare ahead of time, etc. etc. Or give
you examples of the many times I've actually used the contents of my bag to
help others--you'd probably be surprised.

But since I'm sure you don't want to hear it, I might as well cede the
point that any "normal" person is going to think carrying a portable BOB on my
person wherever I go is eccentric to the point of being downright
nutty. Given that you'd never suspect it of me unless I told you-and you'd
never notice anything out of the ordinary even if you were standing right next
to me--I suppose there's nothing left to do but for both of us to feel smug at
each other.

Though you might be interested to note that my employer was the one who issued
all its analysts the NIOSH-95 filter mask and nitrile gloves. And the first day
I got here, I found on my desk a gift basket containing a black fanny pack
with-let me get it out of my file cabinet and see here-a "one person three
day survival kit"; quoting the tag on the side: "food rations, water pouches,
flashlight, waterproof blanket, radio and batteries, and first aid supplies."

Not everyone is as scornful of being prepared as you are.


>>Have you discussed this with your psychiatrist/handlers?

Not on your life, baby. But given that I know the L, F, Pd and Pa scales of the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory like the back of my hand, it's
something of a moot point. A little recommended reading you might find
relevant: Cleckley, Hervey (1903-1984): The Mask of Sanity, Fifth Edition, 1988.

Hope that helps!

Cordially,

~Faustine.
