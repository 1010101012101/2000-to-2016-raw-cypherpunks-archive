There are not any examples that I know of that are exponentially 
harder for computers to solve than for humans to solve.

There may be examples which polynomially harder for computers to 
solve (e.g., 1000 800 MHz Pentium IIIs for 3 hours vesus a single 
human for one second), but this is not interesting from a crypto 
perspective.
