KIRKUS REVIEW
Vigilantism goes viral in this thriller about a website that pays bounties =
for the killing of unpunished child abusers, financial scammers, human righ=
ts violators, and other bad actors.
These are individuals such as Chase Lombardi, a Bernie Madoff=E2=80=93like =
investment banker, who days after his acquittal gets shot through the eye b=
y a sniper in the name of "social justice" while gazing out the window of h=
is posh Manhattan office. The price on his head, as he was informed in taun=
ting text and email alerts: $530,000. More than 20 other people have been t=
argeted by bounty4justice.com in the United States, Europe, and Asia. But e=
ven the savviest techs can't locate the host servers of the site, especiall=
y after it starts dealing in untraceable NcryptoCash. As brutal as the kill=
