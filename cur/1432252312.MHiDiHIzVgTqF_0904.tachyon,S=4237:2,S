The reason you cannot think of such a situation is because there is none.
The common law is derived from appellate rulings.  If a lower court goes
against the common law, it will be overruled when it reaches the appellate
level (assuming it is appealed; lots of cases aren't, but they have no
bearing on similar future cases; only appealed cases do).  If they conform
to the common law, they will be affirmed on appeal and that will stand since
the issue has already been adjudicated once before and upheld on appeal.

Also as you figured out, there is little or no overlap between the common
law and constitutional admonitions against government action.  If you can
come up with a concrete example, we can discuss it.
