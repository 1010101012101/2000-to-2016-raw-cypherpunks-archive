Been done.

Something like that is included in Tinfoilhat Linux distribution, see
http://tinfoilhat.shmoo.com/

Another thing for keyboard-based data input is Sneaky Pete, a Java app
http://packetstorm.icx.fr/java/sneaky.tar.gz
(from http://packetstorm.icx.fr/java/indexdate.shtml - original project
homepage is dead).

And I suppose there are more.

However, this will work around the keyboard loggers, but will cause
development of eg. programs saving the screenshots at the moment of a
mouseclick. (Which is definitely more detectable - by storing bulk amounts
of data - than just a plain keylogger, disadvantaging the adversary
somehow.) Also won't protect against ceiling cams, if they'd have enough
resolution to see the screen clearly enough.

Couldn't there be some challenge-response device, eg. over IrDA or radio
waves or direct contact (eg, iButton DS1955B or DS1957B), which would be
unlocked by something like a PIN code? How to avoid the leakage of the PIN
and subsequent seizure of the device then?

At least for a while, yes.
