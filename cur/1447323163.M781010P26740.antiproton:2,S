you would not believe the kinds of fucked up clients and relays that
participate in the Tor network! even the friendly implementations in
Java or Rust have at times failed in ways that look like an attack.

i don't think people appreciate the scale, complexity, and novelty of
activity in the Tor ecosystem.

on this we concur :)

0day happens! response is important, and Tor has always responded with
urgency and transparency in these situations.

this is indeed a challenge!

not just for circuit behavior in general,
  but also bad exit checking (which is usually bad upstream)
    and suspicious cliques of relays.

proposals and patches welcome :)
