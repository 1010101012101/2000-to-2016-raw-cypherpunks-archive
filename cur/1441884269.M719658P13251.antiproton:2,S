tl;dr:

- CEC - "change is good" peddlers in Australia.

- CEC says "Our government is doing bad stuff, we have problems,
therefore we must change our constitution by removing our titular
queen/'crown' to fix the problem of the scumbags in power," which is
of course bollocks.

- How can any constitution protect against apathetic acquiescing citizens.

- Is it possible that any "new" constitution (or constitutional
change) "put to us" might be formulated by opportunistic scumbags
currently in power, in order to grab more power to themselves?

The CEC perpetrates serious misunderstandings in this email, and

The CEC's otherwise un-challenged assumptions must be rebutted, and

The only way to do that would be to have a referendum changing the
foundations of our federal constitution - this is a VERY DANGEROUS
thing to do!

Gerrit Schorel-Hlavka, Andrew Moyle, Malcolm McClure, Mark McMurtrie
and many others have shown that our CURRENT CONSTITUTION is plenty
enough for those individuals who know which bits are important and are
willing to stand in court (from personal experience, that's a bloody
hard thing to do).

We have powerful foundations in our federal constitution of Australia,
and any referendum at this point will almost certainly TAKE POWER AWAY
from the people, power THAT WE ALREADY HAVE if we would only use it.

The problem is that the people of Australia DO NOT KNOW the power they
hold thanks to our current constitution, and "change at any cost" will
result in a WORSE SITUATION for all of us (except temporarily for
those who currently hold political power, i.e. politicians, and they
should know better since in time new politicians will replace them).

She sits sort of above (in some very good ways mind you, at least with
respect to her duty to uphold Christian and other common law
foundations), but also in some ways she sits NEXT to our institutions
of power. And re Australia, she is more titular (sovereign in title)
than in the UK.

Absolute BOLLOCKS!

The tendency for those who don't know any better (such as myself 20
years ago at the first "make us a republic" referendum) is to:

1) Throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.

2) Assume that a referendum will improve things - any change will be
better (yeah right!).

3) Assume that good people, who know how to improve things, are the
ones who write the proposed options or "referendum questions" at any
referendum.

These assumptions are FALSE, and BLOODY DANGEROUS - since it is those
who currently have some political power, who want MORE power, and want
to get that additional power by TAKING it from we the people!

Is it you who writes the proposed new foundations to be put to
referendum? Is it me?
NO - it is not us, therefore why the hell should we think that what is
presented is going to be in our interest at all?

If the government REALLY wanted to improve things for us - that's
almost trivial to do - slash politician wages and pensions, eliminate
revenue raising by Police, stop making victimless crimes punishable
with jail, and plenty other common sense things, like don't bomb the
crap out of countries at the other side of the world of people who
think differently to us!  It's not that firetruckin difficult!


> The only way to bring this power-structure under democratic control is to
> replace the Queen with a democratic head of state,

Bollocks! The Queen is essentially titular anyway! And:

A) She (the "Crown") granted us our respectful and united request for
nationhood, with her blessing!

B) The naming of our titular sovereign in our federal constitution's
Preamble "under the Crown" is an AWESOME thing - this invokes the
PROTECTIONS of the crown - Bill of Rights 1688, The Great Charter, ie.
the Magna Carta 1215 and 1297. USE THESE AND REJOICE!

C) Besides our foundational BILL OF RIGHTS and the great MAGNA CARTA,
many other IMPERIAL ACTS are at our disposal - some of these are
awesome! Right to Trial by Jury? check! Right to be brought before the
Supreme Court and not be held indefinitely "on remand"? Writ of
Mandamus, check!!

D) Besides these and more wonderful things, the Crown is bound, and
similarly we have bound ourselves, in our federal constitution, to the
Blessing of Almighty God!
This Blessing is better than the rest of the protections of the Crown
combined - to learn why this is true is an excellent journey in
understanding, and highly recommended!

"So why are things so bad?" I hear you ask ... well, there are a bunch
of power-hungry, greedy, selfish, self-centered humans who lust for
positions in parliament, and so 'we' leave it to them since most of us
want to get on with a life, family, creativity, wealth and stability.
"Leaving it to them" is a major problem with we Aussies!

Also most "of us Aussies" do not know the awesome foundations in our
federal constitution - The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act
1900/1901/whatever - tear it down AT YOUR PERIL, fellow Australians!!!


> accountable to the people.

The Crown has a duty of care to the people, and that duty of care HAS
BEEN MET in the VERY FOUNDATIONS of our federal constitution!
Learn these foundations and enjoy the fruits!

We ought be thankful to the Crown, for providing to every one of us
Australians such an awesome foundation! It was hard won for sure -
some tough negotiating back and forth between our Aussie delegates
(our founding fathers), and the Crown, and the British Parliament -
but we got there, we got our nation and we kept the protections of the
Crown, and we got the protections of the Blessing of Almighty God.

Just because we might have a bunch of crooks who've taken power in our
parliament today, does not mean we have a fundamentally broken system!
We have a fundamentally good system, with some bad (selfish and
compromised) people! As Malcolm has said many times - better to have
bad people in a good system, than good people in a bad system - the
bad system will deteriorate MUCH QUICKER! Our current constitutional
monarchy system has withstood over 100 years of internal attacks and
opportunists.


> It is past time Australia did this, and finally
> became an independent sovereign nation.

Warning, this is what those in power want. Every few years they try
again to turn us into a republic!

So what should we want?

The Crown HAS satisfied its duty of care to the people - this might
sound strange, but in fact it is true. What is also true is that our
state (i.e. our state and federal parliaments) have a duty of care to
us as well - and on this front there are many failures.

Finally and MOST IMPORTANTLY, it is also true that WE, the people,
have a duty of care to our state (i.e. our state and federal, and also
local for that matter, parliaments) - we the people have THOROUGHLY
FAILED in our duty of care to our own state/ our system of government,
our constitutional monarchy and the protection of our federal
constitution!

Absorb that, and know why we have problems. No matter what "system" we
have, if we, the people, fail to satisfy our duty of care to our own
bloody state, then we deserve the problems we get and no constitution
in the world will ever do it for us!

Sure, blame the government, blame the Crown and blame our constitution
- but in the case of us here in Australia, blaming anything outside of
ourselves won't help a bit, and a new constitution will not only NOT
solve the problem, it almost certainly will create a WORSE PROBLEM,
and the protections of the Crown, and the Blessing of Almighty God,
are protections we should NEVER GIVE UP.

NOTE CAREFULLY - even the SMALLEST CHANGE to the Preamble of our
federal constitution, will allow the LAWYERS and POLITICIANS and
JUDGES to reinterpret all the rest of our constitution, name us a
republic and/ or a secular state and remove the protections of the
BLESSING OF ALMIGHTY GOD.

Let me repeat, whether you are religious or not, never give up the
protections of the Blessing of Almighty God, as invoked by our
founding fathers in our federal constitution. Give up these
protections at your peril.

Just as the president of the USA is commander-in-chief of the combined
military forces of the USA.

Just as there is some possibly analogous situation in Australia which
no-one knows for sure but if we read our constitution we'd probably
find out about.

> 	*  may convoke, adjourn, remove, and dissolve Parliament;

British parliament. And perhaps via the governor general, the
parliament of Australia. I don't know the details here. But do note,
when (if) we the people finally learn to express our will of the
people, for example oh that's right, establishing our nationhood as
states federating in a commonwealth under the Crown and by the
Blessing of Almighty God, then the Queen/Crown has been known to
assent to said will of the people.

But bloody hell mate, we have to speak up. And we need to speak in
relative unity.

If we can't unite in any demand of our politicians, for example to
slash politician wages, how the hell do we think we'll ever get a
better deal at a referendum scripted and orchestrated by those same
politicians? Dream on...

Certainly here in Australia we sign to treaties by our own
parliament's sovereign right and authority.

The Chameleon Crown - ok, haven't heard that one before.  That can
also be described as "historically significantly neutered Crown".  A

Historically, "benevolent dictatorships" are also one of the most
stable forms of societal structure - yes it requires ongoing
benevolence of the monarch/dictator though, of course, yet exactly the
same thing must be said of our "democratic" parliament - our
Australian federal parliament is pretty non-benevolent these days,
with incredibly feathered nests, declarations of war around the world,
pervasive spying on its own population, and an endless litany of
enforced victimless crimes...

No.  Firetrucking.  Way.

I didn't realise the CEC had sold out common sense.

Watch out people - the road to hell is paved with good intentions,
like diluting our local tribe with an endless parade of
sympathy-snatching refugees from illegal wars perpetrated by our own
government no less.

I hope we Aussies can wake up. I really really hope so.

Good luck Australia,
