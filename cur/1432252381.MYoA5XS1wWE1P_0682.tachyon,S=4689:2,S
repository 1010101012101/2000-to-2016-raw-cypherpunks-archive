FEBRUARY 12, 2002 NATIONAL DAY OF ACTION AGAINST STATE REPRESSION
FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE EARTH LIBERATION FRONT SUBPOENAED TO APPEAR 
BEFORE A U.S. CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECOTERRORISM
Craig Rosebraugh, a spokesperson for the North American Earth Liberation 
Front (ELF) from 1997-2001, received a subpoena on October 31 to testify at 
a Congressional Subcommittee meeting on "ecoterrorism".  Craig is commanded 
to appear before the Congressional Subcommittee on Forests and Forest 
Health at 3:00 p.m. on February 12, 2002 in Washington D.C.
At a Congressional meeting on October 3, 2001, U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis 
(CO), chairperson of the Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health argued 
that Craig should be subpoenaed to provide them with information on the 
ELF. (Since 1997 The ELF has inflicted more that $40 million in damages to
entities profiting from the destruction of the environment.). When one of 
the committee members made the reasonable objection that subpoenaing Craig 
would be a waste of time, he was accused of being "soft on terrorism".  He 
pointed out that Craig had been subpoenaed before and never given any 
information, his house had been raided etc. and yet he had never been 
indicted for any crimes.
1)Take part in the NATIONAL DAY OF ACTION AGAINST STATE REPRESSION.  Show
your support for Craig, the Animal Liberation Front, the Earth Liberation
Front, and those that risk their freedom to stop  the destruction of life.  A
national protest will be held in Washington, D.C. on February 12, 2002.
Please make every effort to make it.  For those that can't make it, consider
organizing local support protests in front of U.S. federal buildings in your
