I worked for a subsidiary of SAIC for a number of years. Their "Private 
Stock" always seemed like a pyramid scheme to us engineers. And they 
couldn't manage us worth a damn.

Doesn't really suprise me, given the way they operate. I'd bet someone 
brought the risks to their attention, too and made a conscious decison that 
the risk wasn't worth the necessary expenditure.

>Bobby Ray Inman, former deputy director of the CIA and a former director at
>SAIC, agreed. "It's worrisome," said Inman, who also received notification
>of the theft last week. "If the security is sloppy, it raises questions."
>
>Ben Haddad, an SAIC spokesman, said yesterday that the Jan. 25 theft, which

>where no sensitive contracting work is performed. Haddad said the company
>does not know whether the thieves targeted specific computers containing
