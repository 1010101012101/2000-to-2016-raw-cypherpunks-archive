"A nation's success or failure in achieving democracy is judged in part by
how well it responds to those at the bottom and the margins of the social
order... The very problems that democratic change brings -- social
tension, heightened expectations, political unrest -- are also strengths.
Discord is a sign of progress afoot; unease is an indication that a
society has let go of what it knows and is working out something better
and new."

Sandra Day O'Connor
