Also Congressman John Lewis gets caught by this,
though he can usually fly if he buys his tickets as "John R. Lewis".
Unlike Kennedy, he tried going though channels to get off the lists,
rather than starting with Ashcroft and working his way down.
There's also a "Dr. John Lewis" who gets this kind of abuse,
and registering as "Dr" or "John W. Lewis" doesn't seem to help him.
