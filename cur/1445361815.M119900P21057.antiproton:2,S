AIUI state-sponsored actors have primarily been targeting people from their
own state, so to the extent "hayrab" governments have been going after
accounts, it's been other "hayrabs" trying to free their own people. And
the Chinese and Russians figure largely as well, again primarily going
after their own people. Last I checked the Russians were themselves
Christian and Jewish and are probably going after the accounts of Muslims
quite frequently.

A large fraction of Facebook's growth is coming from Indonesia, which is a
Muslim country. None of it is coming from the US, and very little from
Europe. You really need to get your facts straight.
