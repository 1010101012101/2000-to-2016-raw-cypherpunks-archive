Well, the first one's a little "Hey this is scary give us some grant 
money"-ish. This has zero impact on real-world telecom systems in terms of 
detecting actual payloads BUT detecting some of the management channel info 
(via the external DS1 management channel) could actually matter in some 
cases.

I'm still waiting for someone to put a trojan into the telecom control 
channels causing them to randomly reprovision themselves. That could have an 
impact that far exceeds mere PR...
