Don't.  If you aren't just a paranoid nut, and you suspect she's cheating
on you, i.e. your gut is telling you something's not right, she probably is
cheating on you.  Move on.  Get over it.  Don't hack.  The feds will be on
your ass faster that you can say "Get lost bitch."

Unless of course you are one of the many trolling feds who monitor and
post on this list and ask for bomb making receipies: in that case
the answer to this email is that same as the answer to the "How do I get
to Carnagie Hall?" joke. i.e. "Go fuck yourself."
