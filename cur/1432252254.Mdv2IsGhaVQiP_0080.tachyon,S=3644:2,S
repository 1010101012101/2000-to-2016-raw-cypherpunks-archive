Here in San Francisco, having the Straight Party on the ballot
would be pretty controversial.

Voting for the Dead, on the other one's hand, is just fine.



Currently, however, it's still Nobody for President.



(If New Jersey election laws didn't require the candidate to sign
ballot petitions, I was seriously tempted a few years back to put
Frank Zappa on the ballot for President.  He'd declined somebody's offer
because he had cancer, but it only requires 1000 signatures,
which would be an afternoon or two at Rutgers :-)
