There's value in running security software on a compromised system
because it helps to stop /mass/ surveillance. Ultimately, if you are
under surveillance, they're going to get you but they're going to have
to devote some time an effort /to you/. You're not going to get caught
up in the worldwide dragnet.

My personal quarrel with the NSA and other security services isn't that
they watch people at all. It's that innocent people are getting caught
in a dragnet and that information could be used against them later.

It's a hard AND expensive problem to address. There aren't a whole lot
of people with processor design skills that aren't already working in
processor design for one of the biggies. And the few that are likely
don't have the money to bring up what it takes to do it. It's not like
this is going to be bootstrapped by a Kickstarter.

It's making people more aware of what's going on and how to protect
themselves. Sure, it's not solving the problem but it is making things a
bit better. Perfect is the enemy of good. If the spooks don't go after
one person because it would take more personalized resources than simply
catching them in a dragnet, that security has worked. We don't need
'perfect'. We need 'good enough'.
