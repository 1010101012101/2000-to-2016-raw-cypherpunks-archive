It appeared extreme to a minority of people then. The fact it happened
once is enough to make sure it DOESN'T happen AGAIN, not even once is
acceptable. Unfortunately this isn't an isolated case. They are not
kicking kids out of school for wearing 'anarchy' t-shirts and wanting to
form an 'anarchy club' in school. Both acceptable behaviour in America
(spelled with a 'c', not a 'k').

Besides, if this guardsman was as naive as you say how did he know who she
was? As I understood it her name was on a list.

Think about that, on a list...

You're an apologistic idiot.
