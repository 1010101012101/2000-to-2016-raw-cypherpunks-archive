In the stuff you sent me, the part you claim was written two days before
the alleged Sharon October 3 quote is under a big title saying...

           Copyright 2001 The Omaha World-Herald Company
                          Omaha World-Herald

           November 1, 2001, Thursday  SUNRISE EDITION

Unless I'm missing something here, your point that I have been proven
wrong because something was written about the Sharon quote two days before
it was supposed to have been said is void.

Also, the text you pasted which said that the quote could not possibly
have been true, and that the source was biased, was a pro-Israel letter to
the editor, criticizing someone identified as a theology professor who
apparently mentioned the Sharon quote in something printed earlier.

Yes, the quote is extrordinary.  Yes, Sharon is a nut.  That he shares
with bin Laden the fantasy that the Jews control America is no huge
surprise.

Do you have anything else to add?
