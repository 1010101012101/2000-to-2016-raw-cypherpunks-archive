Actually I'm trying to get you to be more precise with your 'litmus test'.
The fact is that you draw a specious distinction as to attacking one group
over a community and another. As if it's ok to kill soldiers but not their
mothers. Unless of course it's us doing the killing, for whatever reason
we've used to justify it.

Really? How? Why is attacking imperial soldiers on land they believe is
theirs any different?

Seems to me that if one takes active, supportive measures with respect to
their government they can hardly call themselves 'innocent'.

Who were these people paying taxes for a war they knew nothing of? This
certainly didn't apply to the British. The general populace was informed
as to what was going on.

Realistically, how is 'terrorism' different from 'guerilla warfare'?
