CIA used 'illegal, inaccurate code to target kill drones'

'They want to kill people with software that doesn't work'

By Chris Williams

The CIA is implicated in a court case in which it's claimed it used an
illegal, inaccurate software "hack" to direct secret assassination drones in
central Asia.

The target of the court action is Netezza, the data warehousing firm that IBM
bid $1.7bn for on Monday. The case raises serious questions about the conduct
of Netezza executives, and the conduct of CIA's clandestine war against
senior jihadis in Afganistan and Pakistan.

The dispute surrounds a location analysis software package - "Geospatial" -
developed by a small company called Intelligent Integration Systems (IISi),
which like Netezza is based in Massachusetts. IISi alleges that Netezza
misled the CIA by saying that it could deliver the software on its new
hardware, to a tight deadline.


The Predator B

When the software firm then refused to rush the job, it's claimed, Netezza
illegally and hastily reverse-engineered IISi's code to deliver a version
that produced locations inaccurate by up to 13 metres. Despite knowing about
the miscalculations, the CIA accepted the software, court submissions
indicate.

IISi is now seeking an injunction to ban Netezza and the CIA from using the
software or any derivative of it, in any context.

The relationship between the two firms dates back to 2006, when IISi signed
up to resell Netezza data warehousing kit combined with Geospatial.

The code allows users, for example, "to incorporate and cross-reference vast
amounts of business data with geographic location within the same database,
and enable events (such as... a cell phone signal moving from one tower to
another) to be matched with personal characteristics in the database (such
as... the identity of the person whose cell phone signal has moved from one
tower to another)", according to IISi's court filings.

Such techniques - quickly combining intelligence with live mobile phone
surveillance from the air - are reportedly central to the CIA's targeting of
missile strikes by unmanned aircraft.

They want to kill people with my software that doesn't work

The partnership between the two firms strengthened, and in August 2008
Netezza acquired exclusive rights to distribute Geospatial, alongside its NPS
hardware. By August last year, Netezza was starting to promote its next
generation appliance, TwinFin. Whereas NPS was based on IBM's Power PC chip
architecture, the TwinFin relies on cheaper x86 silicon. As a result,
Geospatial would not run on the new gear.

Nevertheless, Netezza sales staff sold Geospatial running on TwinFin to a "US
government customer", which later turned out to be the CIA. The purchase
order, totalling $1.18m, via an obscure Virginia IT consultancy, came through
on 11 September last year. This despite - as claimed in IISi court documents
- that the software product referred to on the order "in fact did not exist".

Up to this point IISi had done little work porting Geospatial, as its
engineers had not had physical access to a TwinFin. Indeed, the agreement
between the two firms did not require IISi to support the new machines - a
fact confirmed last month by a Boston judge - but it agreed to begin the
process in September 2009.

Netezza supplied the software firm with TwinFin hardware on 1 October. Within
a week, Richard Zimmerman, IISi's CTO reported that porting Geospatial was
"proving fraught with difficulties" and would take at least two months.

Two days later, on 9 October, the relationship took a strange turn. Jon
Shepherd, Netezza's "general manager, location-based solutions" called
Zimmerman to pressure him to deliver the code quicker, court documents say.

"He basically told me the CIA... wanted to use [Geospatial] to target
Predator drones in Afganistan and that, quote/unquote, it was our patriotic
duty to work with them to get [Geospatial] ported to the TwinFin as fast as
possible and that we need to have a phone conversation the next day to
discuss that," Zimmerman said in a sworn deposition to the court.

"Frankly, that response suggests a cavalier sales approach to a profound
issue. Lives are at stake."

During a conference call the next day, Netezza CEO Jim Baum repeated
Shepherd's claims that national security demanded IISi's help, according to
the deposition. Shepherd suggested the CIA would accept untested code in
chunks, Zimmerman said.

"My reaction was one of stun, amazement that they want to kill people with my
software that doesn't work," he said.

According to the affidavit of IISi CEO Paul Davis, who was also on the
conference call, his firm did not previously know Netezza had sold the
undeveloped product, let alone for deadly application by the CIA.

In an email to Baum two days later, on Columbus day 2009, Davis wrote: "Jon
[Shepherd's] statement, apparently endorsed by Jim [Baum] that the customer
can 'just work with whatever we give them' is not consistent with how IISi
works. And we don't really believe that is how our national security agencies
work. Frankly, that response suggests a cavalier sales approach to a profound
issue. Lives are at stake."

Enter Skip

Yet according to Baum's response, that is how the CIA worked. "It is the
CUSTOMER who has indicated that he is willing to work with IISi and Netezza
to accept code progressively," he wrote.

As a follow up, Davis got a call from a man who identified himself as Skip
McCormick, of the CIA, to discuss speeding up the port of Geospatial. Davis
was recuperating from a heart attack and could not speak at any length.
Straight after the the call, however, he received an email from McCormick
with a CIA address.

"We depend on the Geospatial tools here every day," it said.

"We just upgraded to a [TwinFin], but it doesn't yet have the Geospatial
tools. I'm trying to figure out what options are available for getting them
asap."

Davis had doubts the contact was genuine but The Register has established
that a Hays W. "Skip" McCormick III, co-author of a 1998 book on software
project management, has worked at the CIA for several years. Sources
including conference guest lists record his involvement in software projects
at the agency. According to book publicity he previously worked as a
consultant to DARPA, Northrop Grumman and the Office of the Secretary of
Defense.

Further evidence of the CIA's apparent acceptance of untested software is
offered by an internal Netezza email from the same day as the crucial
conference call. "A US Gov customer is expecting the toolkit to be available
as soon as Monday for use in a mission-critical project," wrote project
manager Razi Raziuddin.

"They do understand we won't have a fully-qualified, production-ready release
and are OK with it."

Immediately after IISi's refusal to deliver untested Geospatial code,
internal emails disclosed to the court show Netezza executives began making
alternative arrangements. "I want to set up some time on Thursday to get on
the phone with you guys to talk about some options in the event we need an
alternative TwinFin solution," Shepherd told Netezza engineers in an email.

Thank God for optimists On the Thursday one of the engineers told Jim Baum
via email that "it appears" Geospatial was working on TwinFin. On Friday it
emerged that however Netezza adapted the software, the results were
inaccurate.

"For some strange reason many of the calculations are a little off, from 1 to
13 metres," wrote Joe Wiltshire, a federal account manager at Netezza.


Jim Baum: "We are likely screwed"

"The customer is not confident they can live with the uncertainty in meters
unless we can tell them a bit about why this is happening."

"No matter how you slice this, we are likely screwed," Netezza CEO Baum
replied.

The unreliable results were traced to a floating point problem, but less than
a week later Wiltshire reported to Shepherd that in fact "they are satisfied"
and believed "the minor discrepancy in metrics... is due to [TwinFin] doing a
better job".

"Thank God for optimists," came Shepherd's reply.

 to comment for this story. A CIA spokeswoman said the agency does not
comment on pending litigation, especially if it is not a party to the
lawsuit.
