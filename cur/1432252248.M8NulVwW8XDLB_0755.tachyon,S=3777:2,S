Shoot, Sign me UP for that menial, makework job.

For the first time in YEARS, I finally saw ditchdiggers at work,
Guess it's finally cheaper again to use "guest workers" than to
rent a ditchwitch. The equipment rental houses aren't too happy
about that I'll bet. So much for the information super-hiway.
The "guest workers" were pulling conduit for fiber through
the muck. 

Mom always said I was going to be a ditch digger, I was cool
with that. Turns out, that it made more sense to build equipment
that did a much better job at ditching in less time than manual
ditching. Nearly half a century later, I ended up a network 
administrator. Kinda like digging ditches, but not as healthy.

Now, thanks to the Best and Brightest, The elite, and the fundamental
masters of the universe, where all folks get what they deserve,
Good honest, hard labor, that was so hard to find, -because it
makes so much more sense to take that "can-do" redneck tool-spinning
attitude and put it to work building equipment rather than wasting
it on the task better served by equipment- is now back, and back 
in force, because, we finally get slave, indentured servants who
will either take the 90 cents and hour or be deported. 

For a short while, it was almost possible to earn a living wage
doing real work. Oh well, that's all over now. 

As for math and physics, 
I like to say I "audited Feyman's freshman physics lecture series" because
I bought the CDs and listend to them alot, but without a good functional
understanding of physics and math, you are not as able to do good,
productive physical work, be that swamping, or ditch digging. On the other
hand, I have always thought that someone who can sink a 16d nail in 3 
swings of a hammer is a damned site more useful in a *society* than yet
still another chip designer. 

We got to the fucking moon without chip designers, and what have we
done since? nothing worth remembering.
