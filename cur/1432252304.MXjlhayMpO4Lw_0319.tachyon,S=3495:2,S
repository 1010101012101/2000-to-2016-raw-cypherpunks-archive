The list has only 5% of the content it had in its glory years, 1992-95. 
And perhaps only 10% of its content in its declining years, 1996-98. 
It's now at about half the level of its senile years, 1999-2000. This 
past year has been the worst.

There are many reasons for this decline, discussed as early as 1994.

Any newbies who think this list is now interesting or exciting has my 
sympathy.
