Thank you for your email message. For national security reasons, the No-Fly
List is not available to the public.  The release of such information could
endanger intelligence sources both in this country and abroad.  In addition,
please note that the airlines will not give a boarding pass to individuals
who are on the No-Fly List. Therefore, if you have a boarding pass, you are
not on the No-Fly List.
