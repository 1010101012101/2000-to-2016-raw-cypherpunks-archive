No, they don't. They do need a persistent network presence however.
Distinctly different things.

Which is pointless. The only(!) group that is excluded from IRC at this
point is anyone who doesn't have the brains to request a session key
through the server.

Using pk's doesn't do this since I can loan my key as easy as I might own
a password. Besides how do you know somebody isn't diddling with the
central server?

Any centralized system is bound to be defeated through a 'least effort'
attack on the servers. As a result of the server going down the entire
system has now been breached and the trust in the operators is nil.
