There are a *lot* of generals in the Pentagon. Any attack that takes
out hundreds of linear feet of the building is likely to kill some.

As for the F16, could be disinformation. The Pittsburgh newspapers
quote lots of eyewitnesses, but no mention of a missile:

Also, if you were a pilot held hostage and wanted to crash the plane
somewhere, farmland that's a former coal mine would be a good bet.
