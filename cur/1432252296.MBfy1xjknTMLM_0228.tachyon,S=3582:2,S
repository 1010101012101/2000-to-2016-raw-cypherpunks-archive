#    Having the courts extend the hours so that more inner city mutants
#    can stagger down to the polls is inexcusable.

Why are you referring to people you don't know as mutants?

TimMay Moroned:
#    I expect "The polling hours are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m." to be upheld.
#    People arrange their schedules accordingly. If they work hours such
#    that they cannot be at the polling places during these hours, they
#    obtain absentee ballots. Or they take personal time off of work. Or
#    they go in an hour later. Etc.


Well, let's see if there's a perfectly valid reason for the extension:

#    Mahina Nightsage, 41, said she attempted to vote at 10 a.m. but
#    was told by an election judge that she was not registered for
#    that polling place. Nightsage said she arrived at the board's
#    downtown office by 12:30 and by 3:15 p.m. had not yet been able
#    to vote.
#
#    "That is too much of a burden for anyone to exercise their
#    constitutional right to vote," Nightsage said.

Yep. If you couldn't vote, you'd be ballistic about that too.

Gore wins, ha! Tax May's lilly-white ass to the bone!
