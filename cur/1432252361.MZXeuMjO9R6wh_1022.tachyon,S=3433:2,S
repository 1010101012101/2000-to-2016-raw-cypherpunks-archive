James (who I imagine is that wonderfully inventive liar James Donald
of Usenet infamy) provides a url in which he "exposes" Spanish
Anarchism. The following URLs are in reply to such claims:
This is a direct reply to James webpages:
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2374/blood.html
This is a more detailed reply to another such attack:
http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/spainrebut.html
I will leave it up to the reader to consult the all URLs and
leave it to them to discover who is telling the truth.
Readers may be interested in the following URL which
refutes James Donald's infamously inaccurate and
dishonest diatribes against Noam Chomsky
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/9879/jamesd.html
these urls will indicate to the reader exactly what "James" is
like.
