Because Congress is currently debating retroactive telco immunity
for warrantless wiretapping, in which AT&T passed a full feed of everything
to the feds, and meanwhile AT&T is simultaneously proposing to filter
all traffic for copyright violations?

This would be the same administration that is proposing to get Congress
to pardon itself for war crimes:

 http://www.blogfordemocracy.org/2008/01/pardon_me.html

The same one that is still trying to lie us into a war in Iran.

This administration should bear the burden of proof that it is not lying.

Please point at any department or agency of the U.S. government
that is not completely controlled by political appointees of the
current administration, well beyond the political control exerted
by previous administrations.

Would that hardening SCADA would be the result.

The more likely result, unfortunately, would be legalization of
filtering of everything that goes over the Internet, looking for
bad guys about as effectively as airport security, and with
even more dampening effect on free speech and innovation.

People should be watching what goes into any FISA bill very closely.
