The CF is just an ATA drive. You should be able to get a utility that
will do a raw sector by sector read to a file on a hard drive. Having
done that you could probably piece together the image files. You could
share the data file with multiple parties and see who gets it first.

Here's hoping the filesystem SW in your digital camera marked the flash
blocks as slated for erasure rather than actually erasing them.

How large a CF card is it? 

What is your host system?
