Many still have test jacks on them.  Both my old Samsung A500 and my
current Sanyo SCP-8100 have a connector (either MC or SMA, IIRC) on the
back hidden under a rubber plug.  My guess is that with an appropriate
connector you could use, e.g., a pringles can to make your antenna much
more directional.  

Triangluating on a non-isotropic antenna should be quite a bit harder...
