Bullshit.  A constructive proof of NP=P would doom strong crypto.  A proof 
of the Riemann hypothesis MIGHT lead to polynomial time factoring, which 
would break RSA, but leave the rest of cryptography largely untouched.

The Guardian needs to raise the bar a bit for that which it alleges to be 
"Science Writing."

Louis de Branges "proves" the Riemann Hypothesis every year, by the way.
