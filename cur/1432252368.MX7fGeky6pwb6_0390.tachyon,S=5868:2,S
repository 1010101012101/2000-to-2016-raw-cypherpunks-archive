The IRA and the Real IRA have a lot of money, as the Brits have been 
complaining about recently. Osama bin Laden is said to control more than 
a billion dollars. And so on. I disagree with you assertion that "these 
guys aren't rolling in dough."

(Note that I am _not_ saying they are likely to start using a student 
project remailer operating out of dorm room in Schenectady. A different 
issue.)

You make the assumption that overthrowing, say, the PRC or USSR 
governments, would result in a "worse or just as bad" regime. I 
disagree. And the same tools are still available to deconstruct interim 
replacement regimes.

Planned Parenthood is not envisaged as the user....

The technology is agnostic to "morality."

Choate argues that at least 5 or 6 axes are needed. Ever the nitwit, he 
fails to realize that the main debate doesn't even use the _two_ that I 
have outlined. Yes, I know about phase spaces and multi-dimensional 
diagrams. But given that the debate about privacy tools is mired at the 
1D level ("untracebility good, traceability bad...why don't the proles 
see this?"), graphing the major users and suppliers on the 2D graph I 
outlined is a step in the right direction. It goes a long way to 
explaining why people will spend thousands to fly to the Caymans to set 
up a bank account while others won't even bother using PGP.

You want to add "morality" to the chart. Fine, except I don't see how it 
gives different answers than my chart gave.
