You seem to miss the fundamental point of what 'law' is for in a
democracy.

What if all he's doing it dumping them on your front porch?

Your comparison of your email inbox and your living room being equivalent
is flawed on several layers. The first is the concept of 'privacy', you
have it in your living room because you have a door and locks. You don't
have any of that in an electronic mailbox. An electronic mailbox is like
ones front porch, inherently a place with -public- access.

> We need more law.

No, we don't. All law will do is make life more complicated and reduce the
concept of individual choice. What you propose is to let others decide and
it is clear that they will decide based on their desires and wants and not
yours.

There are no angels among men.

You just shot yourself in the foot and in the process demonstrated your
lack of understanding of what a democracy is about.

<sigh> Democracy (and the USA) is dead.
