The message it sends is to accept the cops offer of on-site "protection"
when the ISP is faced with allowing the tap or being put in jail.
By upping the stakes you force the business
owner to accept the cops as the lesser of two evils.

The mafia's actions tended to make business owners clamor for
more police and more intrusive police protection.   Not less.

This is a problem that's better solved with crypto.
