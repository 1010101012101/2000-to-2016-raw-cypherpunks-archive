In simplest terms, anarchism stands against not just government, but all 
forms of domination and exploitation. This includes government, but also 
capitalism, landlordism, interest, and profit. In addition, anarchism 
stands for decentralized direct democracy, free association, the 
replacement of capitalist private property "rights" with possession/use 
rights, direct worker ownership and control of the means of production, 
direct action instead of political action, delegation instead of 
representation, and total freedom (which is inherently limited by the 
"other person's nose").

Anarchism is a variant of socialism, because it is for workers' control of 
the means of production, but is a form of libertarian socialism rather than 
state socialism. Unlike the various sorts of state socialism, anarchism is 
for not only workers' control of the means of production, but direct 
democratic control of all aspects of life (instead of by some 
self-appointed "party" or legislature which supposedly knows and acts in 
the interests of the people). Those things which are difficult to control 
at a small level where immediate direct democracy can be practiced are 
controlled through delegation, which is different from representation 
because the delegates are not only chosen by the rank and file, but are 
also given mandates that they must and must only carry out by the rank and 
file, and can be recalled at any time for any reason (all of these are done 
in a directly democratic fashion).

Anarchism stands against capitalism, because capitalism is inherently 
authoritarian. Those who say that capitalism is freedom, forget to say that 
it is just freedom for only those who are in the ruling class. As for the 
workers, who make up the vast majority of the population, the only freedom 
they have under it is to choose who exploits them. They have no real 
control over the means of production. They do not receive the fruits of 
their labor; all they get is their paycheck, which they need to survive 
(which is why most people really don't have the freedom to not be employed 
by anyone, unlike what supporters of capitalism say). There is no real 
democracy in capitalism; the workplace is run in a thoroughly authoritarian 
fashion by a hierarchy of bosses and managers, ending up at the top with 
the executives and big shareholders.

Anarchism also stands against state socialism and "Communism," because 
those also aren't freedom in any respect. First thing, most forms of "state 
socialism" and "Communism" are really state capitalism, which is similar to 
private capitalism except that the government replaces the company as the 
unit of competition, the ruling class is composed of the Party apparatchiks 
and or the politicians and bureaucrats which make up the government, and 
that one doesn't have the choice of what/who they are exploited by. 
"Communism" is really like the "cradle-to-grave" capitalism, where one not 
only works in company factories, but also in company houses in company 
towns, etc. On the other hand, anarchists tend to prefer state socialism 
over private capitalism, because there at least is some social support 
structure rather than none at all (this does not mean that they advocate or 
are willing to settle with state socialism, though). At the same time, 
anarchists often treat Communists (especially Stalinists) in the same 
fashion as fascists and such (even to the point of armed conflict).

Anarchism is a very often misunderstood political theory (not ideology, 
because ideology means a fixed set of prescribed ideas that are 
automatically correct as a block), which forms a real alternative to both 
capitalism and state socialism, both republican ("democratic") and 
autocratic/totalitarian. It is for both freedom and social justice, rather 
than just for social justice or "freedom" (capitalism claims to be for 
freedom, but really isn't for that at all). It is against impersonal 
"representation," where a body of elected politicians from an elite make 
decisions for the rank and file without their input, and replaces that with 
making decisions directly and democratically, and carrying out in the same 
exact fashion. It empowers the people directly, rather than empowering some 
elite to act in their name. Luckily, anarchism today has very significantly 
replaced state socialism on the far left, and is further expanding, but 
anarchism still has a very far way to go until there will be any real 
revolutionary change.
