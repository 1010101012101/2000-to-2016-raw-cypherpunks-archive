Both responses are required.

I mean something more along the lines of encrypting each of your
electronic books and burning it to a CD. Nobody should be able to tell
by looking what you read, nobody should be able to compromise someone
else's library. Then the issue of reading habits become null. All tools
should be open source. Essentially they already exist - just need a
little packaging.

Each data set written to a CDR contains a mfg id code and a unit serial
number. This is stored in FLASH or ROM somewhere and the firmware simply
includes this info when writing - probably in some header somewhere. I
don't remember, it's been ten years since I looked at CD formats. I
don't know exactly how much work this would be but I would guess that it
is very feasible. Simply put it might be nice to have a raw read/write
capability.

It's a huge problem, literally. There are bazillions of MB of data out
there in the form of maps, R&D reports and other stuff. Shrub and his
corpfasc entourage are going to delete it from the public space over the
next few years.
