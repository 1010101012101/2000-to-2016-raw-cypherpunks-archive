Why not just get your own domain? For about $10/yr or so, you can set up yo=
ur DNS/MX records to use any provider you want &amp; fw your yahoo mail &nb=
sp;(Stay away from GoDaddy.)

You should have a local backup of your own emails, is what Moon Jones was=
 trying to say in a rude way. &nbsp;Easily done with thunderbird.

Would be happy to help you set it up or advise if you need.

&nbsp;I assume Yahoo DOES 'back up important data'.&nbsp; The problem here=

 different:&nbsp; The Yahoo computer system probably (falsely) figured that=

 rarely) used do not tend to be perfected.&nbsp; ("Software rot"; see &nbsp=

Also, you are wrong for a second reason.&nbsp; Yahoo (or any other email pr=

 on the user's computer.&nbsp; While that data, too, would be vulnerable to=
 various events, the probability that BOTH the 'cloud'-kept data AND the us=

ngly low.&nbsp; Probably one of the reasons Yahoo doesn't take this precaut=
ion is
 that they are trying to lock-in users to their system.&nbsp; If they gave=
 a user's computer a copy of the entire content of the user's data, it woul=
d be too easy (for Yahoo's purposes) for the user to transfer his data to=
 another email system:&nbsp; Competing email systems would be motivated to=
