context: forgot to mention overriding hypothesis that state of
insecure crypto - as with nukes - may be price of peace for
cold war reunification in improved framework, thus structural
duplicity has wider impact than inside states alone, could
also bridge state-state secure relations in parallel with those
that are insecure, allowing for advanced governing relations;
in this way, broken crypto could represent deeper truth of
the inside condition than what is able to be written about,
yet exists as consciousness for those in the industry, etc,
given what perspective, parameters, values, in the deception
