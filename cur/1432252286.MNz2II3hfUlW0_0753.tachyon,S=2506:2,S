Zero-Knowledge Systems is reported to be shutting down their Freedom
network and product.  A letter has apparently been sent to subscribers
with the bad news.  Could someone please post a copy here?  Does it say
anything about the reasons?  Just lack of money, or something related
to 9/11?

The web sites have not been updated and are still hyping the new version
3.0 released just a few weeks ago.
