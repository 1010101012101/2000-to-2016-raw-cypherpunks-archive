Waiting in a public lobby of an educational facility in NYC I was asked
to move by a dame at the security desk. Huh, I said, why? She said
you're blocking my view, I have to see everything going on. So I moved
two inches, grinned, said show me your tits, sure she'd like the Seinfeld 
line from Boy in A Bubble. Sgt Madam banged a 10-13 bell and six more 
dames encircled me aiming their protuberances terrifically. Whoa, I said, 
gobbling a 360 bubbling cheek-swipe of the twelve knobbies, 6 badges, 
6 nym tags, ripping leaks and smearing Tyson's blood and spit on their 
mountainous blue fronts. Then the six-pack array-pivoted 180 and 
jack-rammed me senseless with hard butts, flashlights, cuffs,
and swear-to-god hard leather pouches of powderpuffs and tampons, 
and, ass-clenching me upright, jitterbugged to the holding pen, where 
I was sloshed with a bucket of icewater, stripped searched, body cavitied, 
Abu Ghraibian privates ridiculed, magic-markered pederast to symbol 
who rules domestically, not the caucasian dodos peddling silly secrets 
of terrorists about to shit on civilization.
