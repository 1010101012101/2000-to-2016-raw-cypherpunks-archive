Let's see, as far as the Taliban and probably other extremists are
concerned, all of Islam is in a life and death battle against
non-believers, non-Muslims, namely a bunch of atheist Americans. 

The U.S., OTOH, is taking great pains to emphasize that we are not at
war with Islam but rather with a relatively small group of extremists.

Somebody has the wrong picture.
