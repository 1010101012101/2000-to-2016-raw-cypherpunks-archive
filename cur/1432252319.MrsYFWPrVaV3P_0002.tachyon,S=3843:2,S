You might have a point if some of the terrorists actually had 
been brutalized -- if for example some of them were 
palestinians that had been roughed up by Israeli soldiers.

They were not.

This was not an attack on America for any specific things the 
American government has done -- it is an an attack on 
Americans for being being free and rich, while arabs have 
inflicted slavery and poverty on themselves, an attack on 
Amercans for being American.

When two hundred US soldiers were blown up for meddling in  
Lebanon, the US government go out of Lebanon.  The US public 
is not going to stop being American, and will kill as many 
arabs as is needed to ensure that they are allowed to be the 
people that they are.  If modest violence suffices, modest 
violence will be used.  If modest violence does not suffice, 
the process will continue till no arabs remain.
