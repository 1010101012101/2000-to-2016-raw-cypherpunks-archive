Is it possible you're off by a factor of 10 here? I am very skeptical that 
you have an iron which heats up to 2200 or 2700 degrees Fahrenheit. I would 
expect a little more than a slight yellowing of the dish towel at those 
temperatures, unless you have asbestos dish towels you use along with your 
superheated iron.
