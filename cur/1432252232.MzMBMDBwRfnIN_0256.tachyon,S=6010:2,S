Well, the rason d'etre of 'eJazeera' as I see it is primarily for 
publically-taken photos and videos to be quickly "gypsied" away from their 
port of origination (ie, the camera that took them), so that they can 
eventually make it into a public place on ye old 'Net. The enabling 
technology as I see it here is802.11b, Wi-Fi. A typical scenario is the case 
of public demonstrations where the local "authorities" are called in, and 
where they get, shall we say, a little overzealous. In many such cases 
(here, New York City, Here, USA, and there--China, etc...), such authorities 
will attempt to confiscate devices that could have captured the events or 
captured the perpetrators (and their badge numbers, if applicable) in photo 
or video.

The ultimate aim of eJazeera is to make even the thought of "capturing" such 
video non-existent, due to the commonplace practices outlined in an 
eJazeera-type document (or eventually tribal knowledge). Short of that, it 
is of course in itself desirable for such events to get onto the public 
'Net.

The methods can be various, but the easiest one was (I think) described by 
Tim May. Bob and Alice are pre-known to each other. Bob holds a camera, 
Alice has a Wi-Fi enabled laptop operational in her knapsack. After Bob 
takes the photos/video, he transfers the images to ALice, who walks off and 
moves the data to a secure and public site.

Other methods seek to eliminate the need for various levels of pre-knowledge 
between Bob and Alice, and to also stave off the "round up" scenario where a 
large group is examined and cleansed of all electronica, before data can 
make it onto the public net. (Less likely in US now, but easily possible 
elsewhere).

ALso to be addressed in the document are (possibly) suggested technologies, 
down to the actual gadgets and manufacturers, and recommended spacial 
resolutions vs distances in order to record, say, badge numbers and facial 
features. Also, powering requirements won't hurt, as well as suggested 
methods for mitigating power issues.

(Hey--this might be way beyond what's needed or desirable, butI still think 
like an engineer).

In a reasonably just world, such images might be used in he short run to 
prosecute those that overstepped their legal bounds. Inthe long run, the 
commonplace practice of uploading such images should act as a deterrent to 
such overzealousness.

As it turns out, however, those POWs being transported were photographed in 
such a way as to not need something like eJazeera (unless the scope as I 
imagine it is broadened...is it worthwhile to consider the robust creation 
of image links etc... on the 'Net?).
