Breaking News: Police raid buildings, arrest and detain Biodev activists

St. Louis Police have raided the Community Arts and Media Project (CAMP) 
and the Bolozone, a St. Louis housing collective. The raids target 
participants of the Biodevastation7 conference and activists converging at 
the World Agricultural Forum. Observers at CAMP have reported that the St. 
Louis Police have handcuffed about 20 people, and City Inspectors 
accompanied by police are inspecting the building for violations. Ten 
people have been arrested at Bolozone. A post to the St. Louis IMC newswire 
encourages everyone to call Chief of Police Joe Mokwa at (314) 444-5624 to 
demand their immediate release and a stop to the harassment of the movement 
against genetic engineering and corporate agribusiness.
