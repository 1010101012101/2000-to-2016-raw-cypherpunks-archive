 From Bill Scannell :
-----------------------------------
On the 16th of August 2004, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals begins work on
the Gilmore vs. Ashcroft case.  At stake is nothing less than the right of
Americans to travel freely in their own country -- and the exposure of
'secret law' for what it is: an abomination.

The man who is fighting the good fight is named John Gilmore.  John made his
fortune as a programmer and entrepreneur in the software industry.  Whereas
most people in his position would have moved to a tropical island and lived
a life of luxury, John chose to use his wealth to protect and defend the US
Constitution.

On the 4th of July 2002, John Gilmore, American citizen, decided to take a
trip from one part of the United States of America to another.  At the
airport, he was told he had to produce his ID if he wanted to travel.  He
asked to see the law demanding he show his 'papers' and was told after a
time that the law was secret and no, he wouldn't be allowed to read it.

He hasn't flown in has own country since.
