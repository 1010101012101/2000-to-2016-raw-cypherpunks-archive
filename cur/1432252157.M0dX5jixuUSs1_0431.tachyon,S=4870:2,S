Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr. ~ 2005 Press Release ~


PRESS RELEASE
 Office of the Governor

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 Monday, January 24, 2005

 Governor Ehrlich Launches "I.D. MARYLAND" Public Safety Initiative

Smart Cars, DNA Database, Information Technology Top Priorities

ANNAPOLIS - Governor Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr., today introduced a broad plan
to strengthen Maryland's public safety and homeland security strategies to
meet the new threats facing Maryland and its critical infrastructure.
Governor Ehrlich's plan includes new technology investments in "Smart Cars"
and information technology while expanding access to fingerprint
identification and DNA databases.

"We have no more fundamental obligation in government than to ensure the
safety of our citizens," said Governor Ehrlich. "This multi-faceted new
plan empowers law enforcement and criminal justice officials to keep our
citizens safe with state-of-the-art technology and real time information
sharing systems. This plan is also big step forward in our efforts to
protect Maryland's roads, tunnels, airports and harbors from the threats of
the 21st century."

Governor Ehrlich's plan includes:

Smart Car Project: Governor Ehrlich invests $7.5 million in the Maryland
State Police "Smart Car" Project, giving troopers direct, real time access
to criminal databases.

Information Technology: The Governor will invest $20.6 million in a major
public safety information technology initiative to better respond to
requests for statewide criminal record checks for identifications,
investigations, gun purchases and bail hearings.

Fingerprint Systems: Governor Ehrlich invests $12.5 million to improve the
State's fingerprint identification system by replacing obsolete equipment
and expanding storage capacity. Additionally, the Governor has requested
$1.6 million to upgrade arrest booking systems and extend the "Live Scan"
electronic fingerprinting system throughout the State. Finally, Governor
Ehrlich will recommend approval of the National Crime Prevention and
Privacy Compact, allowing Maryland secure access to the National
Fingerprint File.

Governor Ehrlich will also propose two pieces of legislation:

DNA Database: First, the Governor will propose a plan to expand the State's
capability to collect DNA samples from convicted felons and enter those
samples into the national DNA database. Law enforcement agencies must build
capacity to collect and analyze DNA samples that can help close cold cases,
convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent.

Communications Systems: Second, he will submit legislation to reduce
bureaucracy and improve information technology and communications systems
planning between state and local agencies. This plan will improve
communications between governments to immediately get accurate data to
first responders.

Additionally, The Governor's Office of Homeland Security, Maryland Military
Department, and Maryland State Police, will work with the FBI, U.S.
Attorney, and other public safety entities, to support to the Maryland
Coordination and Analysis Center - the first joint federal, state and local
intelligence and data collection/analysis center in the nation.
