So the Dems who sought "campaign finance reform," via "McCain-Feingold" 
(*) are now trying to get an exception to allow George Soros to spend 
his "soft money" to help Dems. It seems the "legally collected" $160 
million war chest that Shrub has collected is scaring the Dems, who 
have raised vastly less. They are looking with lust at the coffers of 
Soros and others, except the "campaign finance reform" laws they got 
passed are a problem...

(* McCain is officially a Republican, but is actually deeply statist 
and is to the left of Ted Kennedy on many things)

The Constitutional principle is crystal clear on all of these "limits 
on speech": there ain't none.

If Tim May wants to speak out, buy ads, write articles, hire others to 
speak out, he can. Ditto for George Soros. Ditto for anyone else. 
Period.

The fact that the Supreme Court has not said "Just what part of the 
First Amendment have you not read?" and struck down the laws is 
symptomatic of the sick adhocracy we now live in.

I cannot wait for the mushroom cloud over D.C.
