Yes, brain fart. :)  s/b Emmanuel Goldstein.  Doh!  Need more coffee...


Yup, but you don't have to splice a tape, you can do it all digitally
these days, then create a signle low quality audiotape recorded so poorly
that your analyst won't be able to acurately say yes or not.

The real question is whether or not you can have a speech synth that can
put out convincing inflections, pauses, um's ah's, coughs, etc. to the
point that it sounds like a human with emotions, not a machine.  You can
get the samples from existing speeches/addresses and extract just the
phonemes.  Your speech synth's output shouldn't sound like a bunch of
clips of words of course. :)

I don't know how many phonemes would be required for a convinging Iraqi
leader...  For English there's like 30 something...  If you get them all
at the same tone from the same speech, you're set.

If you've ever played with MacOS's speech synth, they have some that are
somewhat realistic human voices, but they still speak with out human
sounding rythms - rather they sound like a human trying to imitate a
computer a la old Star Trek episodes. Add the inflections to get emotion
like sounds, and increase the quality of the synth so you don't hear
machine artifacts, and you're set.  It's not an easy problem, but neither
is it impossible.


As to DNA: Uh, I was talking about Sadam's palaces - lots of skin flakes,
clothes, hairs in combs, etc to be had there.  Ok, well that presumes that
sufficient samples were collected before the nice palace parties. :)
