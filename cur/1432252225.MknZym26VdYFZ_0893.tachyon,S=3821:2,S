Isn't the idea that you don't get to see the surface of the disk? The
copy protection is in the onboard circuitry.  The drive refuses to
return data from "unreadable" sectors/blocks, where readability depends
on a function of the  of the drive serial number, some sort of
certificate in the system request, and the relevant field in the media
key block.  For most people it wouldn't even have to be encrypted. They
aren't going to break the box open & put in their own chips, or take out
the platters & read them with their own probes.

This will presumably crash & burn in the market. As long as anyone sells
user-controllable disks, we will carry on buying them. It's not as if
IBM are the only manufacturers in the world.
