"Michael Alan Crooker, currently in jail in Connecticut, says
security features advertised by Microsoft and its business partners
should have kept federal agents from accessing the files on his PC.
In court papers filed this week in Massachusetts Superior Court,
Crooker says he "suffered great embarrassment" as a result of
Microsoft's failure to keep the FBI's prying eyes off his computer."

"In the court papers, Crooker says he already has reached settlements
with Hewlett-Packard, which owns the Compaq brand, and Circuit City."
