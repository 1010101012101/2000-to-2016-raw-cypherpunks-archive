The book Binding Chaos by Heather Marsh, who ran WikiLeaks Central from
2010 to 2012, describes a system for governance using the Internet as a
mass collaboration tool. Free, full text PDFs available from the landing
page: http://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/binding-chaos/

The book describes using stigmergy for work, rather than time-wasting
consensus or coercive hierarchy, approval economy instead of a financial
system, control by user groups rather than democracy, and more.
