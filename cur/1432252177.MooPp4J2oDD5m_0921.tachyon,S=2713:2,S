You are making up your own history.  When Saddam came to power, 
he seized western property and murdered westerners, especially 
Americans, and you lot cheered him to an echo. Saddam was 
always an enemy of the west, he was never a good guy.  He was 
at times an ally, in the sense that Stalin and Pol Pot were at 
times temporary allies, yet somehow I never see you fans of 
slavery and mass murder criticizing the west for allying with 
Stalin.

Evil men, by their nature, find themselves in conflict with 
other evil men for the same reasons as good men do.  Thus evil 
men and good men will often find themselves in a temporary 
alliance of convenience against a common enemy, an alliance
that both sides know will end in war or near war fairly soon.
This however seldom leads good men to mistake evil men for
'good guys"
