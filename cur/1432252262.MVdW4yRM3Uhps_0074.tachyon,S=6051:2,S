I am finding some older stuff. I did not notice it at the time it originally
was published.  It is still good stuff.

 

Big Picture (only topic in this installment)

 

http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50142221n

http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/airplane-collides-drone-18670726 

Control Tower audio from JFK sighting of a drone, or a UFO or whatever.

If there had been a collision, it probably would not have done as much
damage as Canadian Geese in Miracle on the Hudson, but timing is critical
during landing and taking off, when airplane has to throttle down so as not
to violate noise rules for people who live under airport flight paths.

Next generation of drones, which the public is allowed to see.

 

http://billmoyers.com/content/drones-by-the-numbers/

One of the people, commenting on this, asks how drone deaths compares to
deaths thanks to the other side, such as suicide bombings.

A good place to put that in perspective is Pakistani Body Count
<http://pakistanbodycount.org/drn.php> [1] which tracks both drone attacks
(by USA), and suicide bomb attacks, both of which allegedly kill a hell of a
lot of innocent civilians, even though the USA claims not to be deliberately
targeting non-combatants.

*        According to http://pakistanbodycount.org/suicide_bombing in
Pakistan 1995-Feb 18 2013 there have been 375 attacks by suicide bombers

o       They killed 3,886 to 5,533

o       They injured 8,536 - 14,463

*        According to http://pakistanbodycount.org/drone_attack in Pakistan
2004-Feb 08 2013 there have been 336 attacks by drones

o       They killed 1,675 to 3,144 of whom 1,250 to 2,488 were innocent
Pakistani civilians

o       They injured 330 to 1,215

*        The variations in numbers are because of different stories,
uncertainties, other reasons explained in some analyses, such as Living
under Drones in Pakistan. http://livingunderdrones.org/links/ 

 

http://billmoyers.com/segment/vicki-divoll-and-vincent-warren-on-drones-and-
democracy/?gclid=CP-L0Z7d-7UCFc19OgodBhIA7A 

Bill Moyers explores moral and legal implications of using drones to target
our enemies - both foreign and American - and other intelligence issues
with:

*        Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel to the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence and former deputy legal adviser to the C.I.A.'s
Counterterrorism Center, and 

*        Vincent Warren, Executive Director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights.

fighting-along-the-Syria-Iraq-border

Iraq is supporting the Assad regime in Syria.  The US is now using drones to
attack our former allies.  This is a confusing situation.

The USA spent billions of dollars and the lives of nearly 4,500 soldiers in
Iraq, fighting to put down a Sunni insurgency that was described as a grave
threat to American interests. Today, the US government policy is assisting a
Sunni insurgency in Syria that is not only similar in character to the one
put down in Iraq, but has surviving Iraqi veterans of the war serving in it.
Some of us were very ignorant of politics of the region until recent years.
The trouble in Syria started because some children did some graffiti, and
the secret police tortured them, then there were peaceful demonstrations to
protest the torture, and the regime attacked the demonstrators.
