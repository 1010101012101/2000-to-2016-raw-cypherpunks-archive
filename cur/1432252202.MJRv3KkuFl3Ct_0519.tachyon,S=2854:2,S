Pakistani journalists jailed, printing press destroyed

---------- The Frontier Post, an English-language newspaper in Pakistan, 
was closed by the government and some of its staff imprisoned after it 
printed a letter that criticized the founder of Islam. The crime of 
blasphemy is punishable by death. (02/16/01)
