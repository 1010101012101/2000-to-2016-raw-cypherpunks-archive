possible answers:

1) because, for a variety of reason, they like "made here" stuff AND/OR  they had money to 
absolutely spend.  Grand projects like that are good for rallying the troops and inducing all sort of

times to get to copies of custom-made inferior product?

2) because they *know* that everything else is operationnally broken (yeah, right! )
