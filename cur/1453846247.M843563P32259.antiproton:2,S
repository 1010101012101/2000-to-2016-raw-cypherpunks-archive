Every society is a collective. Fascist societies maintain their
collective structure by emotional, psychological, and physically
destructive methods. In any legitimate anarchist collective society if
you don't fit somewhere, that's ok... You don't have to.

Situationists and other anarchist cells for example:

You don't hear this sort of thing from intrinsically Fascist formations
on the left like the SWP or Revolutionary Workers Party, they're too
busy snitching each other off to the police or engaging in
informant/provocateur activities themselves.
