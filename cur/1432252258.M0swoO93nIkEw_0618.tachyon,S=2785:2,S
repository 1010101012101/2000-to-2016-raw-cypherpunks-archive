A patient was handed a medical information rights and disclosure booklet
she got from her doctor. It lists the folks that they might
release medical information to for various reasons (health department,
lawyers and courts because of subpoena, law enforcement officials, coroners,
medical examiners, funeral directors, etc.).
Below them, there is this graph:

Protective Services for the President, National Security and Intelligence
Activities:
We may disclose medical information about you to authorized federal
officials so they may without limitation (i) provide protection to the
President, other authorized persons or foreign heads of state or conduct
special investigations, or (ii) conduct lawful intelligence,
counter-intelligence, or other national security activities authorized by
law.
