No, I hope not. Unfortunately, to quote Bernard Brodie, I suspect this may be a
case in which the rigidity lies in the situation, not in the thinking. As long
as the technology exists, it's going to be problematic. So then the really
interesting question becomes finding a way to translate a more pro-freedom,
idealistic approach into practical policy within the situation and
institutional framework as it exists now. You know, it sort of gets back to
Herman Kahn's idea of "men of influence" as those who "write the documents that
are placed in the hands of the decisionmaker at key moments." As a "community",
(if a term like that even makes sense) we could use a few more Men of Influence
in the policy arena, rather than leaving it entirely in the hands of the
statists. We turn up our noses at participating in the process and then wonder
why it all turns out so badly. What a surprise.

A useful exercise might be the following: pretend Condi Rice asked you to draft
up a point paper of policy recommendations related to technology and security
to be presented to the President next week. Could you distill your approach
into a set of bullet points--short, to the point, and easy enough for George
Bush to understand? If anyone gives it a try I'd certainly be glad to see it.
 Even getting it out in a public forum like this might be beneficial, who knows.

If a nation values anything more than freedom, it will lose that freedom; and
the irony of it is that if it is comfort or money that it values more, it will
lose that, too.

- --Somerset Maugham

We live in a world where emergencies are always possible, and our survival may
depend on our capacity to meet emergencies. Having said that, it is necessary
also to say that emergency measures however good for the emergency do not make
good permanent policies. Emergency measures are costly, they are superficial,
and they imply that the enemy has the initiative.

- --John Foster Dulles
