The main material of FANGFUWANG is active nanometer 
bamboo carton. Through Chinese and Japanese experts' many 
years research and repeatedly proof, the nanometer bamboo 
carbon has the characteristics of being close and porous, and 
having strongly absorbable capacity. 

The characteristics of FANGFUWANG's design are natural,
