Flash is proprietary. Meaning licensing problems with the media.

Flash is closed source. Meaning it can contain anything. See the latest 
talk about DLink routers.

Flash has its own bugs on top of the browser bugs.

Flash asks for rights to access the webcam.

Flash asks for rights to access the microphone.

Flash can tell on you in so many ways, including font lists.

Flash has its own way of upgrading although it's just a silly plugin and 
needs a browser to do its magic.

Flash, as you wrote, has a particular type of storage.

Flash, as you wrote, needs one extension or app to remove its storage 
and another extension in order to stop it from playing.

Are you sure these aren't enough reasons to remove any trace of it on a 
system you own?
