So much about security is based on probabilities and unknowns, and our own
privacy is such a personal issue, that I don't think this is something
that's going to be solved by "evidence." Some people are going to be
uncomfortable using or supporting Tor no matter what because of its
history, and now potentially because they blame Tor for what happened to
Appelbaum.

Personally, from having talked to people who knew him that I've known for
years, I am inclined to believe that Appelbaum did at least most of what
he's accused of. But I blame the community for tolerating it and saying
nothing at least as much as I blame him. He could not have existed without
the legions of fanboys who, when they saw him trying to force a kiss on a
woman, just wished they had such big balls rather than being concerned over
whether or not she actually wanted that.

I think that what they are saying is that whether or not crypto is
effective for a given application depends on the resources your adversaries
are able and willing to apply to breaking it.

Agreed. It's also the fundamental fallacy behind all of the NSA's attempts
to weaken crypto.

The latter seems perfectly plausible to me. Groupthink.
