	Anybody who would take such a test (assuming that it wasn't 
from "skin flakes left behind on the couch") without being able to 
see the results as a pre-condition would be lucky not to get what 
they disserved.

	For at least some plans, they send a nurse-like person around 
with a stethoscope and a sphygmomanometer to give you a health 
questionnaire and take certain vitals. It's amazing what can be 
inferred from some very basic measurements. i.e. you're 27, have high 
blood pressure, a high pulse rate, high respiration rate, are 5'9 and 
weigh over 200 pounds. I don't need to know all that much about your 
family medical history, or your individual one. You are a big risk 
for some *very* expensive treatments over the next 20 years, but will 
probably be fine for the next 5.

	I really think that DNA testing for insurance is being 
overblown--I don't believe that it's going to catch all that much 
that family history, and there are a *LOT* more environmental factors 
that lead to health problems.
