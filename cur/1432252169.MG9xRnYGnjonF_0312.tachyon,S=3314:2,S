Aww, Rich, that trick never works!

More seriously, most of the vendors will search forwards and back
through the expected codes to make the attack less likely to work.
(If authentication is centralized, searching backwards may not be a
security risk.)

I think the most interesting part of this is the unit looks cool, and
its spun slightly differently than other tokens have been.
