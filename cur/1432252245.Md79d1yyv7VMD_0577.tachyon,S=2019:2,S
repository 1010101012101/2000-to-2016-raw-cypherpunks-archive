Get this through your head: a corporation can't initiate force against
you.
You may not like their product, practices, or price, but no one is
coercing you at gunpoint.

The state, on the other hand, is entirely based on coercion.

If you can't appreciate this, you'll be hopelessly inconsistant.

PS: you are a corporation, I am a corporation, together we could
be a corporation, with 100K others we could be too.  Doesn't
matter; all have the same rights to act, and be left alone.

The state can legitimately only use taxpayers' armies to defend citizens
in the
country, not other countries, not its perceived-by-some self-interest,
not
corporations.  All the oil colonialism is illegitimate for that reason,
as well
as illegal as Congress has not declared war.
