Rent a mob cross state lines for shrubs grand theft auto.
"...In the Chicago Seven case, the jury acquitted all defendants of 
conspiracy charges, though finding five defendants – David Dellinger, Tom 
Hayden, Rennie Davis, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin – individually guilty 
of inciting a riot, charges that later were reversed on appeal. Separate 
government investigations also faulted the Chicago police for using 
excessive violence to quell the 1968 protests.
Ironically, the kind of documentary evidence that might have proved 
valuable in tying up the loose ends of the Chicago Seven conspiracy is 
present in the new filings that the Bush recount committee made to the IRS. 
The evidence is clear that the Bush committee organized the movement of 
protesters across state lines, paid for their lodging, moved them into a 
position for the riot, and then defended their actions."
