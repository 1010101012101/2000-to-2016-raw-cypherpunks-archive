The minimal unix userland process count up to a basic window
manager is about ten, with all remote network bindings for same closed.
Learning unix is essential for those who want to do that.
BSD's usually have fewer layers of crap installed by default and
are generally more discrete, thus easier to minimize than Linux's.
As in this thread, minimization is only part of security.
