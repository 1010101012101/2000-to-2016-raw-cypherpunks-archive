Sorry to double-post, but does anyone think Tor + encryption use
would've saved this guy?

I think encryption of the emails + hard drives would certainly help;
but would he be "coerced" into giving up the key? Could be burn the
key and deny everything? Would the FBI attempt to crack the key? Can
the FBI find you on Tor?

very interesting ...
