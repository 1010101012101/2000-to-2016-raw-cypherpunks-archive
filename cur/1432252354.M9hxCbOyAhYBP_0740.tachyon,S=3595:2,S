Do they exist? Certainly any session ID I've ever had a hand in has two 
properties that strongly resist session fixation:

a) If a session ID arrives, it should already exist in the database.

b) Session IDs include HMACs.

Session fixation is defeated by either of these. Modulo insider attacks, 
of course. :-)
