None, and in fact I have made my own DAT and CD copies of many hundreds 
of CDs I borrowed.

I also burn an average one DVD per day, of movies and suchlike.

This last point I have no problem with, provided Megacorp pays all the 
costs for its own schools. In fact, I support bringing back indentured 
servitude.

The problem is when a "public school," which taxpayers have been 
ordered to pay for, becomes the fiefdom of a corporation. If a child is 
compelled to attend school, as he is, he may not be compelled to watch 
commercials or listen to corporate pitches.
