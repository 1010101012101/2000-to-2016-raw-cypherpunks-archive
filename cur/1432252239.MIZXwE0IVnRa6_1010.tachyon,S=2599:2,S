And therefore it is bad....yadda, yadda, yadda

Bullshit. That is such a general statement as to be worthless.

The 'law' stems from the individual right to self-defence. Law is backed
by violence because that is what is is about.

To then try to portray this as the stem of human abuse of same is simply
abusive to the reader. People do not do violence on others simply because
laws exists. It is not unreasonable, to any reasonable person that is, to
expect a certain percentage of persons in 'the law' to abuse it. Where
else is the best place to be after all? As usual, the devil is in the
details. It isn't 'the law' that is the problem, but rather how as people
we allows it to be abused.

Your thesis is self-referential, inconsequential, and still born.
