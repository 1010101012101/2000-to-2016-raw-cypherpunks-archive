don't think so. it's a good observation, and most likely better than
yours unless we talk about infinities. there are libraries full of books
where neither nazis or hitler are even mentioned. yet usenet debates DO
converge on those topics with surprising pace. most likely a
psychological thing - the search for a recent, extreme and well-known
example or counter-example to your point. in the middle ages, one
would've used witchcraft and satan instead.
