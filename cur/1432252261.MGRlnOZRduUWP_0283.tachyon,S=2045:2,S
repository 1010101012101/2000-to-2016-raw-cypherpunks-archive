Well duh.  KaZaa carries news film clips that the media don't transmit.
So does ogrish.com, but ogrish is not distributed and its name servers
are run by the State of course.  And then there's the indymedia
(again, single point of failure) sites.

There are censorship and authentication issues, of course, its hardly
novel.

First, that flavor of erotica is not well defined.  E.g., A picture of

15 year old wives?   Your legally emancipated 16 year old lover?

Second, Anderson, who should know better, forgets about stego.
