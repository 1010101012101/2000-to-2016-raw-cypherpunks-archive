dear razor

soldiers sign up to be filmed as far as i am concerned they have sold
themselves - the journalist was not in the frame so i dont see why you
think it relates to this argument - i think soldiers should always be
filmed like the cops because i think the role they play is super psychotic
- maybe if the images of them and what they are doing were distributed more
it would be helpful

i think it would have been ethical for scahill to film the dead body in the
morgue - it would be great if they had the permission of the family but...
its that he was in the frame thats really my big problem

also the person in the scene with scahill - a white man - is a person of
color (POC) which also was super problematic for me
