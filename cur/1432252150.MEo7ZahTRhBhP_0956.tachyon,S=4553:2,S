Are you dense? Do you understand the concept of nested, encrypted text blocks?

While the remailers may be "non-anonymous," this certainly does not 
mean that an external attacker can know the mapping from N arriving 
messages (encrypted) to N' departing messages (also encrypted, but 
not the same pattern).

Do we have to draw a picture?

Do you think that knowing the locations of, for example, all of the 
remailers in the world means that messages can be traced through the 
network?

Have you even _thought_ about these issues which were explained a decade ago?

Do you know about DC-Nets?

Actually, this is false. Pipenets and Blacknets don't require knowing 
locations/identities of nodes. Using alt.anonymous.messages is 
increasingly common. Go look at it if this is new to you. Left as an 
exercise, though oft-discussed here in past years, is how to post 
messages untraceably to it and how to read messages untraceably.

(I used a variant of this for Blacknet in 1993.)

You haven't even bothered to think about the technical issues, have you?
