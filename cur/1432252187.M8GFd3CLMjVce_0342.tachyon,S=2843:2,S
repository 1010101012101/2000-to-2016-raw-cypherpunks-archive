         Naaah. John doesn't go on vacations. I would be surprised if he 
sleeps.

         According to well-informed US government sources --speaking in 
their private capacities, with a promise of ZKS-protected anonymity) -- 
subject JYA is, in any case, never further than 7.6 meters from a keyboard 
whether he is awake or asleep.

         Could it be he was off on a binge celebrating the continuation of 
the DC gridlock?
