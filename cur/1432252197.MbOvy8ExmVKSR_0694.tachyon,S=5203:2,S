Tor 0.2.2.6-alpha lays the groundwork for many upcoming features:
support for the new lower-footprint "microdescriptor" directory design,
future-proofing our consensus format against new hash functions or
other changes, and an Android port. It also makes Tor compatible with
the upcoming OpenSSL 0.9.8l release, and fixes a variety of bugs.

Changes in version 0.2.2.6-alpha - 2009-11-19
  o Major features:
    - Directory authorities can now create, vote on, and serve multiple
      parallel formats of directory data as part of their voting process.
      Partially implements Proposal 162: "Publish the consensus in
      multiple flavors".
    - Directory authorities can now agree on and publish small summaries
      of router information that clients can use in place of regular
      server descriptors. This transition will eventually allow clients
      to use far less bandwidth for downloading information about the
      network. Begins the implementation of Proposal 158: "Clients
      download consensus + microdescriptors".
    - The directory voting system is now extensible to use multiple hash
      algorithms for signatures and resource selection. Newer formats
      are signed with SHA256, with a possibility for moving to a better
      hash algorithm in the future.
    - New DisableAllSwap option. If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all
      current and future memory pages via mlockall(). On supported
      platforms (modern Linux and probably BSD but not Windows or OS X),
      this should effectively disable any and all attempts to page out
      memory. This option requires that you start your Tor as root --
      if you use DisableAllSwap, please consider using the User option
      to properly reduce the privileges of your Tor.
    - Numerous changes, bugfixes, and workarounds from Nathan Freitas
      to help Tor build correctly for Android phones.

  o Major bugfixes:
    - Work around a security feature in OpenSSL 0.9.8l that prevents our
      handshake from working unless we explicitly tell OpenSSL that we
      are using SSL renegotiation safely. We are, but OpenSSL 0.9.8l
      won't work unless we say we are.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix a crash bug when trying to initialize the evdns module in
      Libevent 2. Bugfix on 0.2.1.16-rc.
    - Stop logging at severity 'warn' when some other Tor client tries
      to establish a circuit with us using weak DH keys. It's a protocol
      violation, but that doesn't mean ordinary users need to hear about
      it. Fixes the bug part of bug 1114. Bugfix on 0.1.0.13.
    - Do not refuse to learn about authority certs and v2 networkstatus
      documents that are older than the latest consensus. This bug might
      have degraded client bootstrapping. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
      Spotted and fixed by xmux.
    - Fix numerous small code-flaws found by Coverity Scan Rung 3.
    - If all authorities restart at once right before a consensus vote,
      nobody will vote about "Running", and clients will get a consensus
      with no usable relays. Instead, authorities refuse to build a
      consensus if this happens. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 1066.
    - If your relay can't keep up with the number of incoming create
      cells, it would log one warning per failure into your logs. Limit
      warnings to 1 per minute. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre10; fixes bug 1042.
    - Bridges now use "reject *:*" as their default exit policy. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1113.
    - Fix a memory leak on directory authorities during voting that was
      introduced in 0.2.2.1-alpha. Found via valgrind.
