Well, it is southern w.r.t. certain states, but yeah, y'all got me.

But what I meant was, a jeebus-talking, flag-waving pinhead.
A look at hatchmusic.com (while its still up :-) supports that
description.

Not all niggers are negroes, you know.  And many negroes
are not niggers.  Substitute "southern"...  its culture, not
genes or geography.

I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to discover with whom
I was confusing, or what other senators (and other
elected federal officials) give that impression.
