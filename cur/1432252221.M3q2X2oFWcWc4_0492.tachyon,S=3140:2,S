Bill Would Permit DNA Collection From All Those Arrested

By Jonathan Krim
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, September 24, 2005; Page A03

Suspects arrested or detained by federal authorities could be forced to
provide samples of their DNA that would be recorded in a central
database under a provision of a Senate bill to expand government
collection of personal data.

The controversial measure was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee
last week and is supported by the White House, but has not gone to the
floor for a vote. It goes beyond current law, which allows federal
authorities to collect and record samples of DNA only from those
convicted of crimes. The data are stored in an FBI-maintained national
registry that law enforcement officials use to aid investigations, by
comparing DNA from criminals with evidence found at crime scenes.
