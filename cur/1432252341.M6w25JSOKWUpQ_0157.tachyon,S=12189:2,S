No, you're ignoring my whole entire arguement - and that is telling.  You
realize you're wrong, but just refuse to admit it.  I didn't ask why
denial of service attacks are forbidden by law.  That's obvious.  I asked
why would AOL's policies in terms of their service agreements be forbidden
by law when their customers agreed to them?  They're not necessarily
considered a common carrier since they decided a long time ago to police
the content of their service.

Not at all.  Bob agreed to the terms of service and was asked to both read
and acknowledge that he read them.  AOL's terms of service are available
for anyone to read at any time.  Regardless, should Bob not live up to his
end of said agreement, the contract would be null and void, as would his
access.  At the same time Bob is free to sever his contract with AOL by
the same rules.  Your claim that Bob was coerced is exteremely
dubious.  

There is no proof of this, we do not have Bob here claiming this.  We
have, only you, a third party uninvolved in Bob's agreement with AOL
making such claims because you cannot communicate with Bob.

Either way, if Bob is unsure of what he agreed to, he (and you) can check
these pages: http://www.aol.com/copyright.adp and
http://www.aol.com/copyright/rules.html

Some relevant quotes addressing your dumb arguements:

------------

not agree to these Terms of Use please do not use this site. We reserve
the right, at our discretion, to update or revise these Terms of

"ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN

"America Online reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate

"However, America Online and its agents have the right at their sole

--------------

These are the terms to which Bob has agreed to.  It clearly states that
AOL may if it chooses to remove access to content it deems harmful for
whatever reason.  It does not list what those reasons are, therefore, they
are at its discretion - NOT AT YOURS.

There is no need for any law to change this.  Bob and AOL both voluntarily
agreed to these terms.  End of story.

Stop right there.  AOL's contract is with Bob. NOT WITH you, ALICE.  You
have no claims to make.  You have no contract with AOL, it is under no
obligation whatsoever to deal with you.  If you don't like that, sign up
with AOL, agree to their terms, and file a complaint - if those rules will
allow you to do so.  Otherwise, you have no way to interfere with the
agreement between Bob and AOL.

No.  There is no such legal entity as "The Internet."  AOL, like all other
ISP's (I'm stretching the term here) has contractual agreements with other
ISP's from which it obtains service.  Depending on what those rules allow,
AOL may or may not be playing by the rules.  That's up to whomever feeds
AOL to decide, not you.  You are not AOL's ISP.  You have no contract with
AOL on that level either.

AOL is not actively causing any denial of service to anyone other than
those who agreed to be subject to AOL's jurisdiction - by contract.  Says
so in their terms that they reserve the right to do this.

That is not upto you to decide.  That is upto Bob.  Since you haven't
entered any business agreement with AOL, you cannot make such claims
against them.

I am?  So, then you understand that you have no claims whatsoever against
AOL since you aren't using their service, nor have any contract whatsoever
with them?  Then why all the BS?

> Absolutely, I
> cannot sabotage the city water line that goes through my property.

Of course, because they're providing you with water service.  Therefore,
you have agreed to those implict or explicit terms.  You have a contract
with the city, or the water company.  Either because that's what the laws
of the city state, or because you've signed a contract with the water
company agreeing to their terms.  Just like Bob signed a contract with
AOL.  So what's your beef???

Where's the crime again?

Hey, you're the one that claimed that the needs of humans outweigh those
of a corporation.  So by that logic, not that I agree with it, should you
need a stapler, you should be able to take one from AOL.  Of course it's
assinine.  That's what I'm trying to show you.  That your arguement is
full of shit.

The 1st ammended prevents >CONGRESS< from limiting the freedom of
speech. More precisely from creating laws that do so.  It does not limit
private or public companies from doing so.  The 1st has nothing to do with
this.  You're clueless.

And you have no contract with either AOL or that friend.  Like I said, you
have no right to interfere in AOL's business.  If you can convince their
subscribers that AOL sucks, and they chose to cancel their service, that's
fine, that's wonderful - though if AOL finds out, they may sue you for
loss of business.

Yes, you did.  As soon as you hit the send button in your mailer and had a
To:, CC:, BCC: header containing @aol.com.  Your actions caused your email
to be sent to AOL's mail servers, which - as you already expected since
you knew, caused them to be deleted.

Further, I would urge you read your ISP's terms of service.  There's no
place in there that they guarantee delivery of email to an end user of
another ISP.  Because they can't.  So you have no such expectation.


I'm done with this, you're too clueless to continue.  Come back when you
get some brains.
