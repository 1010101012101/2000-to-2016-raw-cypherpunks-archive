SakhrSoft, the manufacturers of the software behind
the ajeeb.com Web site, are undisputably the experts
in machine translation (MT) between Arabic and English.

Unfortunately, they don't seem to be very interested
in selling software.  I've sent two inquiries to their
US sales office, and have yet to hear back.

Their translation is generally very good, though fraught
with typical MT challenges, such as identifying
proper names.  A standard (and often amusing) test of 
MT software is to translate, then translate your
translation back.  The results seldom have the
same meaning as the original input, and are often
good for a chuckle.
