This I feel is very unfair. While I do think that the Fbi and Secret Service 
could be closed and their tasks combined and given over to the NSA ,Marines 
and other law enforcement agencies, I think that overall the agencies did the 
best they could.

This is utter bullshit. The US knew that Bin Laden was a threat and had been 
conducting covert operations with NSA against him for some number of years 
prior to 9/11. NSA was erasing the various bank databases that Bin Laden's funds 
were in and they were messing around with his wire transfers. Hell, Intel was 
even playing taped conversations of Bin Laden with his mother to impress 
Congress all prior to 9/11.

Bin Laden choose the WTC as a symbol of American financial imperialism and as 
a punishment to our screwing with him...The failure IMHO is that rather than 
in engaging in largely harassing techniques-We should have gone after him in 
much as the same fashion as we are today-It isn't like we didn't have ample 
warning.

What I'm saying for the hearing impaired is that our Intel agencies made the 
threat worse by playing games that enraged the attacker (Bin Laden) rather 
than neutralizing the threat.
