AU has a national health scheme,I used it to have a graft on my eardrum 
several years back.Didnt cost a cent.
There are gaps in the system such as long waiting lists and poor dental 
cover,its also under pressure from the economic
'rationalists' esp in the liberal party.The only reason I mention such a 
creation of the hated state is that it could  soon be a matter of life or 
death for many septic tanks.The foot and mouth outbreak in Britain would 
have been nipped in the bud a lot quicker had computerized tags been 
used.There's some scrambling around now in the US to shore up sagging 
public health infrastructure.What's probably really needed is something 
like I seem to remember Lady C proposing.I'm boosting 2 things here that on 
the surface may seem anathema to anarchists.IDs for all and socialized 
medicine.Am I wrong to?
