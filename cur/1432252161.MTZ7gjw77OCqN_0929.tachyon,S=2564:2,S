   That doesn't jive with the statutes:

 TITLE 10 > Subtitle E > PART II > CHAPTER 1211 >
 Sec. 12407.

 Sec. 12407. - National Guard in Federal service:
 period of service; apportionment

(a)

 Whenever the President calls the National Guard of a
 State into Federal service, he may specify in the
 call the period of service. Members and units called
 shall serve inside or outside the territory of the
 United States during the term specified, unless
 sooner relieved by the President. However, no member
 of the National Guard may be kept in Federal service
 beyond the term of his commission or enlistment.
