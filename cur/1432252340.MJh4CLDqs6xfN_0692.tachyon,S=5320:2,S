Just ask Bill Binney how well that system worked at the NSA, or
Jessica Radack at Department of Justice, or....

The US Constitution makes no guarantee of the right to privacy. (I
seem to recall the US Supreme Court recognized it as a construction of
two other amendments back in 1860s, but I can't find the reference).
Even if the right to privacy was recognized, it would only apply to
government. Corporate would be free to spy on us and then sell it to
the government.
