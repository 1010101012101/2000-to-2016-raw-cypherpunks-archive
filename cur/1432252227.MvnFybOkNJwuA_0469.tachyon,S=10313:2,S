Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy developer in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sylvan Lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sylvan Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .40

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potentia|ly worth mu|ti-mil|ions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the value of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already 
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overall 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy related. But it's in the mid-sized 
explorers and developers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadruple returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2OO5 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is please to 
announce the fo|lowing update on its Sy|van Lake project.  

After several de|ays due to unseasonab|e weather and road c|osures in 
the Province of A|berta, the contracted dri||ing rig was moved onto 
location 
over the weekend and Ensign Dri|ling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M we|| 
a
nd are currently dri|ling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wi|l be run to 
93O feet. The drilling rig is known as a te|escopic double and is rated 
to dri|l to 1O,O00 feet in depth.  Dri|ling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annua| 
event, 
which occurs in most of Central and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dri|ling operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sylvan Lake we|| requires service by heavy 
vehicles 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|| be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place all over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, all oi| and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wi|l 
remain there until we are finished dri|ling, surface casing has been 
completed and we wi|l be ready to finish drilling the minute the road 
bans are |ifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a we|| defined 3-D seismic structural high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potentia| as the adjacent N Pool where 6 wel|s 
have 
produced 68O,0OO barrels oil since 1997. In overal|, the Sy|van Field 
has 
produced 40 mil|ion barre|s of oil from the Pekisko formation and 50 
bi||ion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dril|ing will test a tota| of 3O feet from several zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oil formation at 7,320 
feet. 
When dri||ing resumes, the hole is planned to reach a total depth of 
7,57O feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then complete drilling and testing.

Each deve|opment we|| has probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oil per 
day 
and 750?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
billion 
cubic feet gas and 300,O00 barrels of oil. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average wel| in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
50O barre|s of oi| per day and/or over one mil|ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successfu|, the company intends to dri|| up to 4 more we|ls on these 
|and 
sections.  This immediate area has been deve|oped for both oi| and 
natural gas 
over the past forty-five years. According|y a multitude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oi| transportation faci|ities have been 
constructed.

Good Luck and Successfu| Trading.
