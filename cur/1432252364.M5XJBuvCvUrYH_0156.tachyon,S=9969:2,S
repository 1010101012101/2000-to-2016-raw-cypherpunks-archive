U.S. Wants to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet

By CHARLIE SAVAGE

WASHINGTON b Federal law enforcement and national security officials are
preparing to seek sweeping new regulations for the Internet, arguing that
their ability to wiretap criminal and terrorism suspects is bgoing darkb as
people increasingly communicate online instead of by telephone.

Essentially, officials want Congress to require all services that enable
communications b including encrypted e-mail transmitters like BlackBerry,
social networking Web sites like Facebook and software that allows direct
bpeer to peerb messaging like Skype b to be technically capable of complying
if served with a wiretap order. The mandate would include being able to
intercept and unscramble encrypted messages.

The bill, which the Obama administration plans to submit to lawmakers next
year, raises fresh questions about how to balance security needs with
protecting privacy and fostering innovation. And because security services
around the world face the same problem, it could set an example that is
copied globally.

James X. Dempsey, vice president of the Center for Democracy and Technology,
an Internet policy group, said the proposal had bhuge implicationsb and
challenged bfundamental elements of the Internet revolutionb b including its
decentralized design.

bThey are really asking for the authority to redesign services that take
advantage of the unique, and now pervasive, architecture of the Internet,b he
said. bThey basically want to turn back the clock and make Internet services
function the way that the telephone system used to function.b

But law enforcement officials contend that imposing such a mandate is
reasonable and necessary to prevent the erosion of their investigative
powers.

bWebre talking about lawfully authorized intercepts,b said Valerie E.
Caproni, general counsel for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. bWebre not
talking expanding authority. Webre talking about preserving our ability to
execute our existing authority in order to protect the public safety and
national security.b

Investigators have been concerned for years that changing communications
technology could damage their ability to conduct surveillance. In recent
months, officials from the F.B.I., the Justice Department, the National
Security Agency, the White House and other agencies have been meeting to
develop a proposed solution.

There is not yet agreement on important elements, like how to word statutory
language defining who counts as a communications service provider, according
to several officials familiar with the deliberations.

But they want it to apply broadly, including to companies that operate from
servers abroad, like Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of BlackBerry
devices. In recent months, that company has come into conflict with the
governments of Dubai and India over their inability to conduct surveillance
of messages sent via its encrypted service.

In the United States, phone and broadband networks are already required to
have interception capabilities, under a 1994 law called the Communications
Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. It aimed to ensure that government
surveillance abilities would remain intact during the evolution from a
copper-wire phone system to digital networks and cellphones.

Often, investigators can intercept communications at a switch operated by the
network company. But sometimes b like when the target uses a service that
encrypts messages between his computer and its servers b they must instead
serve the order on a service provider to get unscrambled versions.

Like phone companies, communication service providers are subject to wiretap
orders. But the 1994 law does not apply to them. While some maintain
interception capacities, others wait until they are served with orders to try
to develop them.

The F.B.I.bs operational technologies division spent $9.75 million last year
helping communication companies b including some subject to the 1994 law that
had difficulties b do so. And its 2010 budget included $9 million for a
bGoing Dark Programb to bolster its electronic surveillance capabilities.

Beyond such costs, Ms. Caproni said, F.B.I. efforts to help retrofit services
have a major shortcoming: the process can delay their ability to wiretap a
suspect for months.

Moreover, some services encrypt messages between users, so that even the
provider cannot unscramble them.

There is no public data about how often court-approved surveillance is
frustrated because of a servicebs technical design.

But as an example, one official said, an investigation into a drug cartel
earlier this year was stymied because smugglers used peer-to-peer software,
which is difficult to intercept because it is not routed through a central
hub. Agents eventually installed surveillance equipment in a suspectbs
office, but that tactic was brisky,b the official said, and the delay
bprevented the interception of pertinent communications.b

Moreover, according to several other officials, after the failed Times Square
bombing in May, investigators discovered that the suspect, Faisal Shahzad,
had been communicating with a service that lacked prebuilt interception
capacity. If he had aroused suspicion beforehand, there would have been a
delay before he could have been wiretapped.

To counter such problems, officials are coalescing around several of the
proposalbs likely requirements:

B6 Communications services that encrypt messages must have a way to unscramble
them.

B6 Foreign-based providers that do business inside the United States must
install a domestic office capable of performing intercepts.

B6 Developers of software that enables peer-to-peer communication must
redesign their service to allow interception.

Providers that failed to comply would face fines or some other penalty. But
the proposal is likely to direct companies to come up with their own way to
meet the mandates. Writing any statute in btechnologically neutralb terms
would also help prevent it from becoming obsolete, officials said.

Even with such a law, some gaps could remain. It is not clear how it could
compel compliance by overseas services that do no domestic business, or from
a bfreewareb application developed by volunteers.

In their battle with Research in Motion, countries like Dubai have sought
leverage by threatening to block BlackBerry data from their networks. But Ms.
Caproni said the F.B.I. did not support filtering the Internet in the United
States.

Still, even a proposal that consists only of a legal mandate is likely to be
controversial, said Michael A. Sussmann, a former Justice Department lawyer
who advises communications providers.

bIt would be an enormous change for newly covered companies,b he said.
bImplementation would be a huge technology and security headache, and the
investigative burden and costs will shift to providers.b

Several privacy and technology advocates argued that requiring interception
capabilities would create holes that would inevitably be exploited by
hackers.

Steven M. Bellovin, a Columbia University computer science professor, pointed
to an episode in Greece: In 2005, it was discovered that hackers had taken
advantage of a legally mandated wiretap function to spy on top officialsb
phones, including the prime ministerbs.

bI think itbs a disaster waiting to happen,b he said. bIf they start building
in all these back doors, they will be exploited.b

Susan Landau, a Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study fellow and former Sun
Microsystems engineer, argued that the proposal would raise costly
impediments to innovation by small startups.

bEvery engineer who is developing the wiretap system is an engineer who is
not building in greater security, more features, or getting the product out
faster,b she said.

Moreover, providers of services featuring user-to-user encryption are likely
to object to watering it down. Similarly, in the late 1990s, encryption
makers fought off a proposal to require them to include a back door enabling
wiretapping, arguing it would cripple their products in the global market.

But law enforcement officials rejected such arguments. They said including an
interception capability from the start was less likely to inadvertently
create security holes than retrofitting it after receiving a wiretap order.

They also noted that critics predicted that the 1994 law would impede
cellphone innovation, but that technology continued to improve. And their
envisioned decryption mandate is modest, they contended, because service
providers b not the government b would hold the key.

bNo one should be promising their customers that they will thumb their nose
at a U.S. court order,b Ms. Caproni said. bThey can promise strong
encryption. They just need to figure out how they can provide us plain text.b
