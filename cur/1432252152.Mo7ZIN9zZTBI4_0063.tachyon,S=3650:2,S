 I am in the U.S.A. I have been here since 1989 ... I believe  in the Communist  Revolution. 

  I am in Miami and in the process of recruiting more members  to my Communist Party unit here. I do it very openly .. I am  not afraid of death. 

  We must fight ... AND FIGHT NOW ... let's be Satans and we  must FIGHT NOW !

 I have told my story on the USENET bulletin board: alt.politics.org.cia  --- read my messages .. I am the main contributor. 

 Please, email my message to all Communist Party representatives around the globe .... WE SHALL FIGHT ... WE SHALL FIGHT TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT OF OUR SOULS, HEARTS AND MINDS ... !
