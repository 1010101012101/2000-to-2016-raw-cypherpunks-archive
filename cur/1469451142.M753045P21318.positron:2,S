You should check out the When Gravity Falls trilogy by George
Effinger, classic cyberpunk written in the late 80s...
Very reminescent of Gibson's sprawl stuff, except the central conceit
is that Western society has collapsed and the Islamic countries
have come to dominance. Its been a while since I've read them, and
obviously they are just as dated as Neuromancer, but I think the
books hold up pretty well... (Neuromancer still holds up quite well,
IMO)..
