You want to spend ten thou on pizza?  Bloody hell, that's  excessive.
Any company selling you that much would lay themselves wide open to 
being sued because they got you addicted to fatty pizza and made you
/obese/.  They could be liable for millions! No respectable company
could possibly allow that to happen. There should be a law against it!
Our legislators must act to defend vulnerable corporations against
predatory customers like you who spend too much money!

in his part of London on the basis of which postcode database they use,
because most of them think he lives in the wrong street)
