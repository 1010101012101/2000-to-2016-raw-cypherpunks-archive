'Except for official or business purposes' is a hole big enough to drive
a HAZMAT tanker through, privacy-wise. It means that any business
that want to can snarf the data, legally. I recently bought a car - every
dealer photocopied licenses before handing us a movable, disposable
asset worth several $10^4k to take away for a test drive.

I'd have been suprised if they hadn't.

All this does is provide the LEOs with yet another line in the laundry
list of violations they paste on accuseds, to up the time in jail if they
manage to get a conviction.
