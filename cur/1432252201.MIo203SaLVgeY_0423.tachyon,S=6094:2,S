Thank you. Useful info for those to whom it would come as a surprise,
and for those who have some trust in corporations which are, by decree
of their constitutions, for hire to the highest bidder (in almost but
not quite all cases).

What we need is to create within ourselves and our communities a
culture of awareness that "if you don't run it, you don't control it,
and it will most likely be working against your interests; ipso
comprendo, run your own".
