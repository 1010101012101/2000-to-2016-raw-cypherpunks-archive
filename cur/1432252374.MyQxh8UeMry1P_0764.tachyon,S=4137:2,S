In earlier ATMs, such as Citicorp manufactured models, all the I/O 
components were separate and the signals between them could either be 
captured by a Y-cable or a cable with a small hidden xmitter or by their 
unintended RF radiations.  Newer ATMs, I believe, integrate the keypad with 
the crypto processor and attempt to reduce opportunities for PIN 
interception.  ATM magstripe reader data, since it is available to any 
stripe reader on a credit authorization terminal, may not be as well 
protected.  Though since you need both to pull off a card spoofing scam, it 
would seem prudent to secure that data as well.
