The latest in a series of bombings in China has killed one person and 
injured 30.
The explosion ripped through a McDonald's outlet in the western city of 
Xi'an at the weekend. The blast, timed for the evening meal rush-hour at 
6.30pm, has been blamed on "international terrorism".

  The story of Mark and Jacqueline Hinchcliffe is so dark, so bleak, and at 
times so vile, as to be almost unimaginable. What's extraordinary is that 
we know it from their own mouths, because in the months leading up to the 
killing of Wright, Perth detectives were legally intercepting calls on Mark 
Hinchcliffe's mobile phone.
