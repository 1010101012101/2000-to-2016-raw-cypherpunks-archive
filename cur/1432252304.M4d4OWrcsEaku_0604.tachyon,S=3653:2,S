[I'm sending this to those who have expressed interest in the AES
Development Effort over the last several years. Thanks.  Jim]

AES ANNOUNCEMENT:
Monday, October 2, 2000

NIST will announce its selection which will be proposed for the Advanced
Encryption Standard.

NIST Director Ray Kammer
Acting Chief of NIST's Computer Security Division Ed Roback

WEBCAST:
Anyone who wishes to view a real-time webcast of the press conference may
do
so by accessing <http://real.nist.gov> and then clicking on "LIVE
BROADCASTS." That site also contains links to various streaming media

OTHER:
Following the announcement, NIST will be posting its "Report on the

<http://www.nist.gov/aes/>.

Additionally, the number and name(s) of NIST's selection for the AES will
NOT be announced before the official announcement (so PLEASE do not
contact
me with that question, because I will not be able to respond).
