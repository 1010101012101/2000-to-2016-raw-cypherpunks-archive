Blinded coins prevent the server from knowing which IP address they are
issued to (that is, it knows it issued _a_ coin to the address, but it
doesn't know which one). When it sees an unblinded coin, yes, it knows
which IP address that is presented by, but since it doesn't know who had
it in the first place, that doesn't help. Of course, the unblinded coin
is immediately replaced by a blinded one, thus restarting the cycle.

Errr - so how do you get money into the system in the first place? Note
that blinded coins solve this issue, too - the server can have a list of
where all the money came from in the first place, but after that it
knows nothing.

Cheers,

Ben.
