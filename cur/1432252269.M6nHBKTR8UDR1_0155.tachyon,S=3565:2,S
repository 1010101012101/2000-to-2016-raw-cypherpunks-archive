Let me try give some more details behind this.  The idea was to create
separate modules that can be separately shipped and sold.  Freedom 3.0
"privacy & security tools" is the first of those.  It has a subset of
the functions in freedom 2.2 (cookie management etc), but some of
those functions have new features or have been improved.

Declan's interivew with Austin and Ian's comments on slashdot and here
cover the aspect of the story that the current freedom network which
was the support infrastructure behind the anonymous browsing and mail
part of Freedom 2.2 was decomissioned.

Other consumer software related plans are not public.
