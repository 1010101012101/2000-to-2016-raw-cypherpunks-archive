I too use Bitmessage.ch by their hidden service address (SSL). I use
Torbirdy with Thunderbird.

When I send emails to people I just enter a name into Thunderbird and
that's the name a recipient sees. The email address of course is long,
but I haven't found anyone that seemed to care.

I dont send big files though, the 2 mb limit is low.

A trace of an email sent through Tor and then Bitmessage and then to the
recipient shows Tor exit node IP address, without usable metadata AFAIU
what Bitmessage.ch does for metadata.


There's a new Tor Mail Gateway coming online and it sounds bad ass:
