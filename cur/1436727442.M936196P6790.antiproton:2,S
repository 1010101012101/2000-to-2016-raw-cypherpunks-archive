This 'extension' principle doesn't always work. =C2=A0In 2012, the Supreme =
Court ruled (US v. Jones)=C2=A0https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/united_state=
s_v._jones_%282012%29=C2=A0 that police could not place a GPS tracking devi=
ce on a car without a warrant. =C2=A0One argument that has been rejected in=
 lower-court cases was the idea that in principle, a car's movements could =
be tracked with an army of police, one per street corner, so that a GPS tra=
cking bug simply automated that process. =C2=A0One problem that argument is=
 that society not only doesn't have the resources to accomplish such a blan=
ket coverage of an area, and that even if practical, society may not necess=
arily want such an intrusive system to exist.
This issue was (secretly) quite relevant to me. =C2=A0Federal authorities a=
pparently installed a tracking device on a car I used, probably in about Ap=
ril 2000, without a warrant. =C2=A0Presumably, if challenged they would hav=
e been claiming to follow a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 1999=
, =C2=A0U.S. v. McIver, which had allowed the placement of a GPS tracking d=
evice on a truck seen at the location of a marijuana growing operation. =C2=
=A0The problem with this justification, however, is that at least in McIver=
, there was an actual crime involved, and the truck was plausibly involved =
in that crime. =C2=A0In my case, after my release from prison in April 2000=
, nobody alleged that I was engaging in any crime. =C2=A0The McIver case di=
dn't rule that police could simply choose to place a GPS tracking device on=
 ANY car, for no reason, and even without 'probable cause' or 'reasonable s=
uspicion'.
What was particularly devious (and I call illegal) was that later, probably=
 in October 2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant for the placement of=
 ANOTHER tracking device on the same car (which, of course, may have ended =
up being the same device!) WITHOUT telling the judge that a tracking device=
 was already on the car, and had been so since at least as early as April 2=
000. =C2=A0Why the subterfuge? =C2=A0They later used the result of the trac=
king device (at least, the portion taken after the October warrant) against=
 me in court. =C2=A0But they continued to conceal the fact that a GPS devic=
e had been placed since perhaps April 2000. =C2=A0Presumably, they conceale=
d that because they would have had to explain, in court, why they were trac=
king me, without a warrant, and despite the fact that they had no 'probable=
 cause' nor 'reasonable suspicion' to do so. =C2=A0To conceal that, they ob=
tained the warrant, making it appear that the GPS surveillance started in O=
ctober 2000. =C2=A0This was fraud, because in order to obtain a warrant, th=
ey have to explain WHY they need the GPS device installed. =C2=A0Clearly, s=
ince a GPS device was already installed in the car, there was no need to pl=
ace one. =C2=A0THAT misrepresented the need to the judge.
You might ask, "Jim, why didn't you complain about this during the trial". =
=C2=A0As you might know, I was given a long series of lawyers who, rather t=
han being the first line of defense for me, were actually the first line of=
 OFFENCE for the government. =C2=A0What the average person doesn't understa=
nd is that a defense attorney, colluding with the government, has virtually=
 unlimited power to sabotage his client's case, and that was precisely what=
 happened to me. =C2=A0The crooked attorney was Robert Leen.
And it turned out that the government had a powerful motivation, or at leas=
t some of its employees: =C2=A0They had faked an 'appeal' case in the 9th C=
ircuit, 99-30210, forging at least two filings as if I had done them 'pro s=
e', as if I was bring that case. =C2=A0I did not, and I wasn't aware of the=
 pre-May 2000 existence of that faked case until June 2003, when I first sa=
w that case's docket. =C2=A0The crooked attorney who concealed this from me=
 was Jonathan Solovy.=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Jim Be=

v. McIver, which had allowed the placement of a GPS tracking device on a tr=

. &nbsp;In my case, after my release from prison in April 2000, nobody alle=

 that later, probably in October 2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant=
 for the placement of ANOTHER tracking device on the same car (which, of co=

hat a tracking device was already on the car, and had been so since at leas=
t as early as April 2000. &nbsp;Why the subterfuge? &nbsp;They later used t=
he result of the tracking device (at least, the portion taken after the Oct=
ober warrant) against me in court. &nbsp;But they continued to conceal the =
fact that a GPS device had been placed since perhaps April 2000. &nbsp;Pres=
umably, they concealed that because they would have had to explain, in cour=
t, why they were tracking me, without a warrant, and despite the fact that =
they had no 'probable cause' nor 'reasonable suspicion' to do so. &nbsp;To =
conceal that, they obtained the warrant, making it appear that the GPS surv=
eillance started in October 2000. &nbsp;This was fraud, because in order to=
 obtain a warrant, they have to explain WHY they need the GPS device instal=
