What I'd like to see is a P2P telephony that also supports end-user 
gateways to the POTS.  I'm not certain, but I think there are some MS 
certified modems which have a generalized A/D-D/A capability sufficient to 
handle voice.  Although it opens up the possibility of end-user 
eavesdropping some of this might be thwarted by randomizing user node 
selection and detecting/reporting line impedance changes (indicating an 
extension going off-hook) to the 'client' wising to use the POTS. I 
suggested this idea to Jeff Pulver, now a VoIP champion, in 1999 but he 
thought it was too out of the mainstream to be interesting.  Now that P2P 
is beginning to branch out from file sharing maybe this is no longer a far 
out idea.
