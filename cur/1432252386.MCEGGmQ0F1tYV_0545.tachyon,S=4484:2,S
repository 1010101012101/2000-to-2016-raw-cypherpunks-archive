I most strongly disagree.

Solutions that provoke acts of domestic terrorism, rather than preventing
them -- are not "solutions," no? While these groups may not hold legitimate
opinions in the eyes of most Americans, they are legitimate threats. (I have
used some responsive commentary in here to make this point elsewhere.)

In my opinion, some of these proposals not only "trade security for
privacy," (their words) they are going to "trade privacy for terrorism." I
think that's a bad deal for everybody.

Part of our problem in regard to U.S.-based domestic terrorism and militia
groups has been our prosecutorial or military "snatch" mindset. We need to
attack their strategy, rather than engage in actions that legitimize their
world views, incite action, encourage radicalization and facilitate
recruitment.

This is a WAR On Terrorism -- not a Keystone Cop chase. I believe that any
responsible analysis of proposed solutions should squarely address the issue
of domestic incitement. Polls with CitizenQ-like opinions express American
sentiment....but they can be damning for domestic terrorism policy if we do
not pause to examine the implications.

Would it be ironic if, in our efforts to "stop" the unthinkable, we give
rise to it? Would that be good policy?

In addition to "concerns" over the erosion of civil liberties, one message
Congress desperately needs to get: "DON'T FEED THE BEARS."
