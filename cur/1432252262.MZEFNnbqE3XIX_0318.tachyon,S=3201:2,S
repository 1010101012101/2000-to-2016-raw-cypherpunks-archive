     Huh, that's interesting -- I'm using NS as well, ver. 4.75, on a
Mac, and Riad's message worked fine - as they usually do. I'll look at it
later at work with NS 4.75 and NS 6 on linux and see if there's any
difference. Could try Mozilla as well. I've noticed recent versions of NS
do weird things with outgoing email -- at least the linux version, but
not the Mac. Forwarded mail sent as an attachment either goes as a blank
page or as unreadable hex. Inline forwards work fine. And posts sent to
usenet from linux NS show up as mime or hex as well, and are unreadable
with some readers. And I somehow sent a html message to this list the
other day with NS6, although it hasn't done it since. Very strange
behavior. One thing that NS for Mac does that I wish it did on other
platforms is that it interfaces with pgp very nicely.
      Also will be looking at the "True Names" site from there too --
altough a kind soul sent me the zipped copy.
