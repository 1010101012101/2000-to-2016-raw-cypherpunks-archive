WASHINGTON  Microsoft's newest version of Windows, billed as the most
secure ever, contains several serious flaws 
that allow hackers to steal or destroy a victim's data files across the
Internet or implant rogue computer software. The company 
released a free fix Thursday.

A Microsoft official acknowledged that the risk to consumers was
unprecedented because the glitches allow hackers to seize 
control of all Windows XP operating system software without requiring a
computer user to do anything except connect to the 
Internet.
