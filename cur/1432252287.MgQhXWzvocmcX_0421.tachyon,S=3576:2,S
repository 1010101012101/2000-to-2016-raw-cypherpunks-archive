I've encountered a number of people with education approaching, or beyond
their ability to comprehend.  They tend to be verbose, and nonsensical.

Take your statement above, for example.  I'm not only very educated, but 
not educable?  Well, knock me over with a feather.

As for what might be proved by remaining silent, fuck that.  Fuck you too.
