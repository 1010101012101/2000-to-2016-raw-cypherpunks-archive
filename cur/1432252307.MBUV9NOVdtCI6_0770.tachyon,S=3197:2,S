The fact that he uses a constant exit remailer does not show that 
he is using a single hop.

I always come out of the same remailer at the end, even though I 
always use about three randomly selected remailers between myself 
and the constant exit remailer.  I always select the same end 
remailer to avoid confusing the audience, and I selected a less 
used exit remailer for the same reason.
