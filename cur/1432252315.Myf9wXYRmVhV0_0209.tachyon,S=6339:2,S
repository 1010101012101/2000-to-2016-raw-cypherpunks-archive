The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bu|| market,
our specia|ty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oi| Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, Apri| 22- Emerson Oi| and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dri|ling programs in Wyoming (USA), as wel| 
as A|berta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
include existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson wi|| 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing 
programs involves existing production of oi| and or gas opportunities, as 
we|| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current dea| flow it wi|| be ab|e to build a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing al| possib|e 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We be|ieve that in many 
situations we will have the 
0pp0rtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dril|ing program, which 
wi|| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."


Symbol - EOGI
Price - .O9

The value of EOGI's shares wi|| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is sel|ing for less than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
exp|orers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particularly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparab|y small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia|ly with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But a|l that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equally exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Wel| we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
slightly, you will stil| make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares wil| surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oi| and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wil| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bul|etin.
