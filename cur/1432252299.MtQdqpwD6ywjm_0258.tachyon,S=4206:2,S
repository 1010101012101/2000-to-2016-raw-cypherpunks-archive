It was the first cite I cam across that mentioned the 'gets so small that
nobody cares' aspect...suited my purposes just dandy. Within that sentence
is another whole aspect of the 'fair n-slice problem', for example; how
does it get small? Consider the situation where you have a cake and
n-people and use a scale to measure the slices. The goal being to get them
all weighing the same <i>within some measure of error</i>. An associated
question is, given a starting quantity (q), a number of players (n), and
a given error (dq), what is the maximum number of 'slice and dices' you
will need to go through? How does that change when it's a fixed percentage
by volume error (ie %g/g)? Or perhaps (as likely with people) a fixed
minimum volume that one can resolve (while this reduces for homogenious
quantities, what happens when it's heterogenous)? From a applications
perspective this seems like a pretty important issue.
