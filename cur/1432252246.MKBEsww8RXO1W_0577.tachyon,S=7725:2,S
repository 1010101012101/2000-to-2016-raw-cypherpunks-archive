Nobody can recode closed source but them. I would offer [pluggable]
open source alternatives and let gravity move the closed ones
over time.

Nothing proprietary being made here, all open source, hack and use freely.

Yes, great, we're now moving towards strict and PFS encrypted transport.
That's not much of a complete achievement since it does not solve any of
the other snowden-ish issues recent p2p threads are meant to encompass...
- [secret/trollish/illegal] orders against centralized mail servers/services
to store and disclose all metadata and [unencrypted] content, including
transport headers and pesky to/from/subject/etc headers.
- voluntary 'cooperation' to do the same.
- capability for messaging over encrypted anonymous p2p overlay networks
so that the only real place left to compel is the investigated user themselves
(or millions of users if you want to fight up against free speech / privacy).

Don't say on others position until you are their shadow.
