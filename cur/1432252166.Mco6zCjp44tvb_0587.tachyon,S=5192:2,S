Steve suggested (see below) that anonymous cash may be useful to hide the 
identities of contributors from the party/candidate they contribute to. I'm 
afraid this won't work: e-cash protocols are not trying to prevent a 
`covert channel` between the payer and payee, e.g. via the choice of random 
numbers or amounts. Furthermore even if the e-cash system had such a 
feature, it would be of little help, since (a) there will be plenty of 
other ways the payer can convince the payee that it made the contribution 
and (b) in reality, candidates will have to return the favors even without 
knowing for sure they got the money - kind of `risk management` - I'm not 
sure what we want is to allow big contributors to gain favors while not 
really making as big a contribution as they promised...

Best, Amir Herzberg
