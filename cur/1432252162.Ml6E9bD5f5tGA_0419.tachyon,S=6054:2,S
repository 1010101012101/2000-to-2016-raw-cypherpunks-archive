Right, reading it literally. But the supreme court has interpreted the "due 
process" clause to include rights granted under the bill of rights (using the 
incorperation doctrine). I know it isn't in the 14th itself, but the way the 
court has interpreted it has given it this meaning. Look at New York v. 
Griswold (i think) for a good example of this. The court applied unreasonable 
search and siezure to a state using the 14th. The same goes for free speech.
