 Middle school student arrested in poisoning

  JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Sept. 12 (UPI) -- A 15-year-old Jacksonville, Fla.,
 boy was arrested Tuesday for allegedly putting rat poison in salsa served at
 his schools cafeteria, resulting in the illness of 34 students, WJXT-TV
 reported.

  The name of the Paxon Middle School student was not released.

  The teenager was charged with poisoning food or water, a first-degree
 felony that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. A 12-year-old
 student was also questioned but had not been charged. Jacksonville Sheriffs
 Office Sgt. Gordon Bass said authorities have no motive for the crime.

  Investigators said 25 grams of Talon-G, an anti-coagulant, was put in the
 condiment during lunch Tuesday. Fifteen students were taken to hospitals
 complaining of nausea, headache, vomiting and stomach pains, while the
 others were treated at the school.

  Some parents said they cant afford to pay for the hospital treatment
 their children received and they want the school board to cover the cost.
