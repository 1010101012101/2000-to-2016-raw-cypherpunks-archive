By default they perform all the default logging....

Yes, it can be.  I used to have a script which parsed nntpd
logs to watch an individual's browsing (individual host that is).
With access to the dialup/radius database, the ISP could match
the IP to the account and thus to the real name.

The same info can be obtained for email on an ISP via POP/IMAP logging
combined with the sendmail logs (and looking at the emails in the queue
to get the content).

Fortunately most ISPs don't have the time to do this just for fun,
unfortunately a lot of them would do it if requested to do so by police.

Only by running your own mail or news server can you prevent the
ISP from monitoring your email or news reading.
