Bob,

What's all the confusion about the Digicash-Chaum patents? They are now all
owned by Infospace. The important one expires mid-2005, which is pretty soon.

The ec-logix stuff looks like nonsense. They display bitmaps of the old
Digicash wallet GUI, and I expect they will be hearing from Infospace.
