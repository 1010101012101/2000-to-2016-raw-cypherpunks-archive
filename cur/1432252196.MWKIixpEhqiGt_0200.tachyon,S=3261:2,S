 Bush Announces Do-Not-Wiretap List
 by Scott Ott

 (2005-12-19) - Just days after the New York Times released classified
 information about eavesdropping by the NSA on Americans linked to
 international terrorists, President George Bush at a news conference today
 announced creation of a new website which allows people to voluntarily
 exclude their phone numbers and email addresses from NSA wiretap lists.

 The new National Do Not Wiretap Registry (DoNotWiretap.gov) follows the
 successful DoNotCall.gov model of allowing citizens to opt-out of
 harassment by electronic means.

 "If you're concerned that your civil rights might be violated simply
 because some al Qaeda member has your information in his cellphone or
 computer," the president said, "then go to DoNotWiretap.gov, enter your
 contact phone number, email address, and names of terrorists who might have
 you on speed dial and we'll let the National Security Administration know
 that you don't want them eavesdropping on you."
