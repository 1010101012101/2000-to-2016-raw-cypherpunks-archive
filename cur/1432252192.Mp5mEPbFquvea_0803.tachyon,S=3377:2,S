Damn, sent that by mistake while editing.

I'm also concerned about the effect of "routinely" having uniformed
soldiers out standing guard or running patrols or whatever. Even if
they're National Guard rather than federal troops, it accustoms the
public to seeing soldiers on the streets, on the borders, in the
airports, everywhere. That makes the next step, federal troops
everywhere, more likely and less noticeable.
