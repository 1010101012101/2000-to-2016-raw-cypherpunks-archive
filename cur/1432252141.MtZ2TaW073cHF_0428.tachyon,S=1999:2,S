That's a deployment issue, not a technical issue.  D-H key exchange, for
example, would be just fine.  It just so happens that the SSL creators had
a particular business goal in mind:  e-commerce, with a "certificate"
re-assuring the nervous customer that they were handing their credit card
to jcrew.com, not, jscrew.com.  Yes, SSL was invented to solve a
particular problem.  They did a reasonable job at it.
