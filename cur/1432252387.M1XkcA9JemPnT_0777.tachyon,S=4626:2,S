I am merely using murder as the most extreme and unambiguous form of 
harm.  The word "evil" has two senses.  Harm suffered (morally neutral 
sense of the word "evil") and harm unjustifiably and willfully done, or the 
danger of such harm.  (Moral sense of the word "evil")

Situations often arise where it is not obvious what is "unjustifiable" and 
"willful", where such judgments are necessarily subjective, but in most of 
the cases that we care about, most of the time, it is perfectly 
objective.  Someone is going about his own business, and out of the blue, 
someone robs him, assaults him, or someone denounces him as a class enemy, 
race enemy, class traitor, race traitor, etc.
