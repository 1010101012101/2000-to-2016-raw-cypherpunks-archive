"efforts are better spent developing the technologies and markets in such a 
way that maybe Joe Sixpack will someday follow. "

Technologies like quantum computing could be to late/impossible/to 
expensive.Markets seem more promising even in freeloaders heaven,the 
web,plenty will pay for games.Theres a take off of the IMF/WTOvs 
demonstrators battles so why not
a cypherpunks vs the evil feds game on X-box or gameboy?Some of the more 
exciting and futuristic applications of cryptoanarchy could be on the 
higher levels.The base game simply being how much you can get away with 
before being frogmarched off to 'happy fun court'.
Ive got a funny feeling that P-P hordes are about to descend on crypto like 
locusts,anyone else?
