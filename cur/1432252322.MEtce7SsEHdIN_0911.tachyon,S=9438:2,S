    Someone should suggest the use of Putrescine to Lt. Mathers... The
chemical odor of decaying bodies is so sickening that Glade couldn't stand a
chance. Anyone know a readily available way for synthesizing this stuff? A
dead body lets off very small quantities of it, awful in itself. Distilled
Putrescine would reduce the most stalwart of us to dry heaves.
