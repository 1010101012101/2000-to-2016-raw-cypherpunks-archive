True, but if a communication involves "information relevant to a matter of
national security" and crosses national borders, US citizens are fair game.
- From what little I've seen about it, it seems like if someone decided it was
worth the effort to intercept all private communications about remailers and
crypto, the language is ambiguous enough to allow for a pretty large loophole.
So setting up shop in Canada might do the trick, unfortunately. 

Back to remailers: this might have a boneheadedly obvious answer, but is there
a role for non-publicized privately-run remailer networks to serve as 
a "privacy buffer" before putting messages thorugh the public remailer system?

For example, if I had the hardware, software, phone lines, internet connections
and time to run multiple autonomous mixmaster remailers out of my basement to
route my own messages (and dummy traffic) around before funneling them to a
public remailer, would there be any way to keep all-but-the-last box entirely
shut off from view? Could you achieve this degree of anonymity from running
Reliable? What would it take to keep a private remailer network truly private?

Not that I really expect anyone to talk about it here, but it's an interesting
set of questions to mentally kick around, at any rate. Maybe a link to a white
paper or two would put me out of my misery. ;)

And what about the idea of surreptitiously installing this kind of private
remailer network via piggybacking a stripped-down highly-anonymous version of
remailer software onto other people's badly-maintained networks--free POP
accounts to hold the traffic, maybe along with some sort of remote
administration tool for maintenance. A tiny trickle of traffic has all the
obvious problems, but is it possible that a "single user" scheme like this
might be sufficiently under the radar to go completely unnoticed? Little
invisible pinprick remailers that pop up all over the place, and dissappear
almost as fast as they spring up. Mosquito Remailers? Just a thought.
 
Nothing but 100% hot air on my part, but I hope somebody finds something
interesting enough here to take it and run with it.
