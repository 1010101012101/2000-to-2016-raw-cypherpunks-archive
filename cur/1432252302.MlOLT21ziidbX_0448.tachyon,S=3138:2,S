it might be free in america - but it isn't here in the UK even at low 
bandwidths - say, 56K. The sort of bandwidth a professional spammer uses 
doesn't come cheap on any scale, and back when I was on dialup, the 
amount of spam I get now (expressed in bytes) would probably have been 
about 1/3 of my *total* traffic back then.
These days of course I can be content to watch my filters remove the 
majority of it - but I still don't appreciate having to waste bandwidth 
downloading it.

True - so what you are saying is that we aren't *actually* taking the 
spammer's $80, but money they took from some poor sucker who got spammed 
earlier?

I am trying to think of a reason why this would be a bad thing.

I agree that spamming 419'ers don't deserve being out on the streets 
with nothing - but only because I would prefer to see them (and all 
spammers) being slowly disembowelled with red hot hooks......

Ah. ok, that Explains it then - I am not a visionary anything :)
