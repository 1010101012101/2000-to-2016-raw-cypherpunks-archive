I've been actively reading posts on this list for about two years now, and
I'm in he process of actually trying to design/implement a data network
where security is of the utmost priority. Where is a good starting point to
find out about packages using algorithms which are unbreakable as of yet.
All of the traffic will remain domestically within the US. The traffic will
be SMTP.

It would be illmatic if someone could reccomend a good reading list
(current) on the bleeding edge of cryptography.

Tks. in advance.
