After bloody crashes between palestinian police
and palestinian demonstrators, Palestinian authority
today asked Israel for riot gear, according to 
Zionist tv tonight.

The Zionist defense department may or may not
go along with the request, which includes
teargas grenades.

Today the palestinian authority ordered an
investigation on the riots.
All schools in Gaza strip were ordered to
remain closed today.
