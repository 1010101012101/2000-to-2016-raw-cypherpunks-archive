You may be thinking of babelfish. 

to portugese:
Voc pode pensar de Babelfish.

portugese to english:
You can think of Babelfish.

http://world.altavista.com/ seems to be the URL.

Oddly enough, while they have "Russian to English", they don't seem to
have "English to Russian." So can't try to old "Wine is fine but the flesh
is rotten" trick...

agradeca-o,
