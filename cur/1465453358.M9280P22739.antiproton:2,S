Perhaps. Though I think tor's basic design and inertia
may be unsuited to GPA resistant mods, such that new
project[s] would be better ground for trialing that. Doesn't
mean that current nets can't be drawn from.

For quite some use cases, just not all use cases.

Gov's don't self suicide. However they may piss other
folks off, who then rise to kill them. Replacing them
with yet another govt. Of course twisting their own
original tools for military comms superiority against
them is always fun, and yes, seen as ironic.

There are also too many places in the world where
govs still have effective control over it... censorship
events, etc... such that govt survival mechanism will
be effective nationalization under "exigent state of emergency".

It may take another 20 years before the race condition
between govts and freedom of the net yields a real winner,
or a real meltdown.
