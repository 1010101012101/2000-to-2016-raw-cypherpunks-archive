Tech pundit/gadfly Robert Cringely has come up with a pretty damn good idea 
for creating a RIAA-crushing music file-sharing system. Instead of 
concentrating on technical issues, he has tackled the problem using 
existing legal structures for corporations.

There's probably more than a few problems with his idea, especially the 
legality of applying divided interests in a mutual fund-like vehicle 
without limits to the benefit tied to that divided interest, but it's an 
interesting read nonetheless.
