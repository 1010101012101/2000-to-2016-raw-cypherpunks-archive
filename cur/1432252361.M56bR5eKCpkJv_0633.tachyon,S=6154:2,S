forgot to mention: this fractional taxation that could be individually
routed to issues then could be a way of funding basic science or studies or
research outside of existing political frameworks and providing oversight
or for 'increasing support' for agencies such as the GAO in the US, via
what programs are given more prominence within policy (for instance if
issues of EMFs and cancer and telephony were put into policy via directed
tax funding).

also: the income-based structure of whatever this 'routable tax percentage'
may be called, would need to address vast income inequality, such that each
citizen has a certain proportion though some citizens should not have a
million-times more vote if wealthy and taxed. perhaps more of their taxes
would go to the general system fund allocated to basic government
operation, or some other way to keep the vote distributed by unique
individual views versus dominated by those with most all the money,
circulating and non-circulating.

(which brings up the issue of paper currency as ultimate
surveillance/monitoring system, if taking into account traffic analysis of
money from points A to B to C ... to N. while credit and debit is more
transparent about this, it is difficult to imagine a more useful model for
flow of money through a chain than tracking paper currency in exchange and
using this for all it is worth statistically, pre-internet, though
computer-dependent to parse all the data.)
