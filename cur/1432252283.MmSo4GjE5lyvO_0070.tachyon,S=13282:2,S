Subject: REAL MONEY STILL RULES

        Every State(2) has a Money of Account Provision (I'll bet)       


        I just figured CaGovC 6850.

        Real money is provided for so the "judges" and the public
employees can decline to accept transfer of debt (They do not have to
allow their "checks" to "clear"). They can require gold or silver from
the Controller and/or the Treasurer!

        This must be so even though 3 USC 1- 21 makes the States(2) (and
all county voting precincts ) = the District of Columbia. The
administrative governments for the 50 provinces (States(2)) must
accommodate the 50 union States(1) respectively. When we invoke (if we
know how) their State(2) courts onto the law side, the judge and jury are
deemed capable of being paid real money.
        (If we don't invoke the court in forma pauperis but transfer debt
for fees we will get the fiction-equity-UCC State(2) court regardless of
what we plead.)

        Got spare change? Run an ad in your local Shopper.
        JURORS Get your ($)25 per day in Gold
        [Your phone # and/or e-mail or web page]
        Provide a networking source, forms and information to enable
jurors to demand and obtain their real money.
        ( ) for $ is because in CA jury service is now 5 dollars a day
(There is talk of raising it). So 5 dollars are "purchased" for about 25
in ($), i.e., in FRNs. I figured for silver because I have a general idea
of the exchange value, but "gold" is a better trigger for an ad. (I get
the foundation for principles settled then I can adjust the particulars
-That's how I work!-JS)
        
        Jurors are summoned by ALL CAPS "commercial names" so they must
be voir dired for the capacity they will accept for sitting as jurors.
They can still accept transfer of debt but they must affirm they will
judge the evidence in their flesh and blood capacity (They must be
educated on the fly that they have a fiction identity and a real
identify. -Such education is never permitted on the fiction-equity-UCC
side of the court.)

        So how are Money of Account provisions rationalized when the
treasurers, court clerks, county collections receive "cash"!!!!? For
checks I imagine they are accounted for as dollars but once the county
accepts the privilege of letting the debts be discharged over at the bank
how are the bank balances reported back in the county controller's
office!!!!!? Oh! Maybe they just report the amounts they sent over and
are oblivious to what has happens. They just write checks and warrants to
pay out but folks keep accepting discharge by transfer of debt but the
county never catches on!
