Over on Dave Farber's IP list, it's been pointed out that there
is a pre-existing, live, real-money market in futures on these
types of events. Go over to www.tradesports.com, and click on
'Current Events' under 'Trading Catagories' on the left. Drill down
and you'll find things like 'WMDs will be found in Iraq on or before
Sept 31', the value of which has dropped from 80 to 25 over the
last few months.
