Dear Multex Investor Member,

The Multex Investor Challenge is gearing up for the Summer Edition. 
Manage a $100,000 virtual portfolio and see if you have what it takes 
to beat the dog days of summer and maybe win your share of $25,000 and

Just like a flight simulator, the Multex Investor Challenge allows you 
to experience online investing without the risk.   It's fun. It's 
educational. It's free.

The third round of the Multex Investor Challenge begins in less than 
a week!  Don't be left out.  Register today at 
http://www2.investmentchallenge.com/multex
