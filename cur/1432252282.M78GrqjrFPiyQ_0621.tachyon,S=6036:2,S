The Microsoft Penny Black system (not to be confused with the 
IBM Penny Black paper) is supposedly limited by memory /speed/ not 
memory size.  The only nice thing about that is that memory speed
doesn't vary as much between machines.  About 5 to 1 vs. 100 to 1.

I don't understand this equation at all.

It's the rate limiting factor that counts, not a combination of
stamp speed + bandwidth.

Assuming 128Kbps up, without a stamp it takes about .6 seconds to
send a typical 10K spam.

If it takes 15 seconds to generate the stamp, then it will take
15 seconds to send a stamped spam.  It won't even take 15.6 seconds,
because the calculation can be done in parallel with the sending.

Not according to the best estimates I have.
The average email address receives 20-30 spams a day (almost twice 
what it was last year) and there are only 200-400 million 
email addresses, which works out to less than 10 billion spams per day.


But there's a much easier way to do the math.

If 1% of the machines on the internet are compromised,
and a stamp takes 15 seconds to generate, then spammers can send
50-60 spams to each person.

(86400 seconds per day / 15 seconds per stamp * 1% of everybody = 57.6)

You can reduce that by factoring in the average amount of time
that a compromised machine is on per day.


I fully expect that stamps will rise in "price" to several minutes,
if camram actually gets any traction.

Custom hardware?
I can buy a network ready PC at Fry's for $199.

If it takes that machine 30 seconds to generate a stamp, and I leave
it running 24/7, and replace it after 5 months, then the cost
of a hashstamp is still less than 1/500 of a snail-mail stamp.
Granted it's a significant increase in costs over current email,
and therefore potentially a vast improvement, 
but it's still not expensive.
