Really, this sounds awfully whiny.

The answer to this kind of silliness has always been anonymous
posting/emailing.

In the end if you can express your view on a bullshit privacy-invading Big
Brother product and have the company get a summary of the public sentiment
in a form even a dot-com CEO can read perhaps they might actually hear the
winds of the market changing and adjust accordingly.

Avoid repercussions in the usual fashion: Mixmaster and/or header spoofing.
