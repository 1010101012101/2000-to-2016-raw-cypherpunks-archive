If you didn't patent it and you published it publicly, you effectively gave it away for anyone to use.  It is also now prior art, so 
finding a link that proves it was published would be useful.  And you have bragging rights to inventing it if you were first.

So, the $5000 would have been a good deal since you didn't have any value to sell, since everyone already "owns" a license to use it.

                a low measurement bandwidth (a frequency band of less
                than 100 kHz around a<br>
                carrier under 2 MHz) even when attacking multi-GHz
                CPUs."<br>
                <br>
                If that doesn't mean much, this might help: The
                researchers can extract keys<br>
                from GnuPG in just a few seconds by measuring
                side-channel emissions from<br>
                computers. "The measurement equipment is cheap, compact,
                and uses<br>
                readily-available components," add the researchers.
                Using that philosophy the<br>
                university team developed the following attacks.<br>
                <br>
                Software Defined Radio (SDR) attack: This comprises of a
                shielded loop<br>
                antenna to capture the side-channel signal, which is
                then recorded by an SDR<br>
                program installed on a notebook.<br>
                <br>
                Portable Instrument for Trace Acquisition (PITA) attack:
                The researchers,<br>
                using available electronics and food items (who says
                academics don't have a<br>
                sense of humor?), built the self-contained receiver
                shown in Figure A. The<br>
                PITA receiver has two modes: online and autonomous.<br>
                <br>
                Online: PITA connects to a nearby observation station
                via Wi-Fi, providing<br>
                real-time streaming of the digitized signal. 
                Autonomous: Similar to online<br>
                mode, PITA first measures the digitized signal, then
                records it on an<br>
                internal microSD card for later retrieval by physical
                access or via Wi-Fi.<br>
                <br>
                Consumer radio attack: To make an even cheaper version,
                the team leveraged<br>
                knowing that side-channel signals modulate at a carrier
                frequency near 1.7<br>
                MHz, which is within the AM radio frequency band. "We
                used a plain<br>
                consumer-grade radio receiver to acquire the desired
                signal, replacing the<br>
                magnetic probe and SDR receiver," the authors explain.
                "We then recorded the<br>
                signal by connecting it to the microphone input of an
                HTC EVO 4G smartphone."<br>
                <br>
                Cryptanalytic approach<br>
                <br>
                This is where the magic occurs. I must confess that
                paraphrasing what the<br>
                researchers accomplished would be a disservice; I felt
                it best to include<br>
                their cryptanalysis description verbatim:<br>
                <br>
                "Our attack utilizes the fact that, in the
                sliding-window or fixed window<br>
                exponentiation routine, the values inside the table of
                ciphertext powers can<br>
                be partially predicted. By crafting a suitable
                ciphertext, the attacker can<br>
                cause the value at a specific table entry to have a
                specific structure.<br>
                <br>
                "This structure, coupled with a subtle control flow
                difference deep inside<br>
                GnuPG's basic multiplication routine, will cause a
                noticeable difference in<br>
                the leakage whenever a multiplication by this structured
                value has occurred.<br>
                This allows the attacker to learn all the locations
                inside the secret<br>
                exponent where the specific table entry is selected by
                the bit pattern in the<br>
                sliding window. Repeating this process across all table
                indices reveals the<br>
                key."<br>
                <br>
                Figure B is a spectrogram displaying measured power as a
                function of time and<br>
                frequency for a recording of GnuPG decrypting the same
                ciphertext using<br>
                different randomly generated RSA keys. The research
                team's explanation:<br>
                <br>
                "It is easy to see where each decryption starts and ends
                (yellow arrow).<br>
                Notice the change in the middle of each decryption
                operation, spanning<br>
                several frequency bands. This is because, internally,
                each GnuPG RSA<br>
                decryption first exponentiates modulo the secret prime p
                and then modulo the<br>
                secret prime q, and we can see the difference between
                these stages.<br>
                <br>
                "Each of these pairs looks different because each
                decryption uses a different<br>
                key. So in this example, by observing electromagnetic
                emanations during<br>
                decryption operations, using the setup from this figure,
                we can distinguish<br>
                between different secret keys."<br>

                <br>
                Any way to prevent the leakage?<br>
                <br>
                One solution, albeit unwieldy, is operating the computer
                in a Faraday cage,<br>
                which prevents any spurious emissions from escaping.
                "The cryptographic<br>
                software can be changed, and algorithmic techniques used
                to render the<br>
                emanations less useful to the attacker," mentions the
                paper. "These<br>
                techniques ensure the behavior of the algorithm is
                independent of the inputs<br>
                it receives."<br>
                <br>
                Interestingly, the research paper tackles a question
                about side-channel<br>
                attacks that TechRepublic readers commented on in my
                earlier article, "It's a<br>
                hardware problem, so why not fix the equipment?"<br>
                <br>
                Basically the researchers mention that the emissions are
                at such a low level,<br>
                prevention is impractical because:<br>
                <br>
                Any leakage remnants can often be amplified by suitable
                manipulation as we do<br>
                in our chosen-ciphertext attack; and Leakage is often an
                inevitable side<br>
                effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms.<br>
                <br>
                Something else of interest: the National Institute of
                Standards and<br>
                Technology (NIST) considers resistance to side-channel
                attacks an important<br>
                evaluation consideration in its SHA-3 competition.<br>
