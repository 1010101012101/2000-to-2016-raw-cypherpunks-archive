Regular vinyl is (was) also recorded with all kinds of filters, too,
including the lowpass ones.

If you cut vinyl (or metal) through a signal chain that didn't
impose the filtering, perhaps the ultrasonics would remain,
which is perhaps the analogophiles claim.  You would need
a special vinyl cutter though.  Some of the filtering imposed
on vinyl was to not fry the cutter, or otherwise deal with its inertia.

some folks just don't get digital..)
