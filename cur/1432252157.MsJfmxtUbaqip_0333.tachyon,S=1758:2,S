Fighting an unwinnable war always seems to produce the same type of rhetoric,
whether it's the war on some drugs, the war on anyone Bush doesn't like, or
the war on anything non-German.  The only thing that changes over time are the
identities of the bogeymen that are used to justify it.

(Do you seriously think the war on bogey^H^H^Hterrorism can ever be won?
 Leaving aside the obvious debate that you can't even tell who you're at war
 with, how do you know when you've won?.
 
 We have always been at war with Terroristia)
