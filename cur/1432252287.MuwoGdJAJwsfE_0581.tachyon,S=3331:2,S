Man dies playing playstation
 From AAP
29nov01

A FISHING boat deckhand playing a computer game was electrocuted when a 
huge wave smashed through the window of the trawler's wheelhouse off the 
southern Queensland coast, according to police.

Richard Wells, 19, of Innisfail, in north Queensland, was playing a Sony 
Playstation and sitting at a metal table when the wave smashed through the 
cabin glass of the trawler Arrow Sea near Fraser Island yesterday.
A police spokesman today said a post mortem examination had determined the 
man had died of asphyxiation caused by electrocution.

"It was the combination of water and electricity and metal," he said.

"A huge wave came over the bow of the vessel and smashed through the cabin 
windows."

The spokesman said three other crew members also suffered shocks and minor 
burns as they attempted to help Mr Wells, who was trapped in the wrecked cabin.

The crew set off a satellite distress beacon after the accident and a 
rescue helicopter went to the scene.

But the crew was able to get the trawler to Bundaberg under its own power, 
where it docked early today.

Police have impounded the trawler until their investigations are complete.
