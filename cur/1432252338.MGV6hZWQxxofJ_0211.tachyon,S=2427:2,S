No, they don't. The electron beam scans across your screen in a VERY
tightly sychronized dance. Vertical retrace, horizontal retrace, etc. Each
scan line data, etc. Television has all sorts of methods to sychronize the
emission of photons. There is a sampling window issue here related to
responce time of the eye as well. Then let's not forget that the rays your
eye gets are all closely parallel also.

If you think this doesn't matter play with a time delay and a television.
Pay attention to standard high voltage technique.
