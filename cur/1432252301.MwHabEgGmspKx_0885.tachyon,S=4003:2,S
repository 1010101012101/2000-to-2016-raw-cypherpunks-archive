Likewise stupid quote:

Congress has decided that basic fundamentals of energy policy as practiced 
by virtually every other nation are off-limits," says Pietro Nivola, a 
senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. "Where is it 
written that Americans have a Constitutional right to dollar-a-gallon 
gasoline?"


Gas taxes were high in Europe before anyone thought of having an energy 
policy.  They were a luxury tax on cars - driven only by "the rich" in 
Europe at the time.  A better question is why, if we are going to have 
taxes at all, should some goods and services be taxed more than 
others.  And don't feed me that "neighborhood effects" bullshit or I'll 
suggest punishingly high taxes on Congresscritters so that their antisocial 
activities can be discouraged.  [Concept stolen from Heinlein - TMIAHM]

Why have an energy policy in any case if we don't  have a Pokemon Card policy?
