I think the problem here is that material which John Ashcroft, Jerry
Falwell, and Pat Robertson think is wicked, may not be what Ross Anderson
or I think is wicked.  After all, to some people Howard Stern is
disgusting and obscene.  To others, he is merely witty and slightly
burlesque.

Well, it's good to know Professor Anderson values the opinion of an
organization that won't even use the term "child pornography" to refer to
the things that offend Ashcroft, Falwell, and Robertson, but demands
everyone use terms like "pictures of children being abused" and "child
abuse pictures."

As those who flog the Sex Abuse Agenda are well aware, 90% of successful
propaganda is owning the vocabulary.  I am reminded of the changing of the
term "statutory rape" to "child rape" a few years ago, which I am sure we
will all agree is a less than accurate description of a 20 year old who
has consensual sex with a streetwise 17 year old crack whore.

I think Hakin Bey's suggestion that plastering pictures of naked children 
everywhere is a great form of political theatre has merit.  All the right 
wing crackpots will have to hide in their homes to avoid having strokes, 
and the well-balanced representatives of the Forces of Reason can finally 
live their lives in peace and quiet. 

Perhaps we can have Public Service Announcements by the Coalition for a 
Prude-Free AmeriKKKa.
