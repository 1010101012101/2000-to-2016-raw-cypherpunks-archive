Well, the other possible interpretation is that the Feds are not
black-at-heart, Big Brother, neo Stalinist fascist JBTs 
pouncing on any opportunity to make confetti of the Bill of Rights;
but rather are actually trying to respond to 9/11 with a minimal
impact on US Citizens.

...but of course, that would be an unpopular interpretation on
this mailing list.

The truth probably lies somewhere in between.
