  FC'07: Financial Cryptography and Data Security
  http://fc07.ifca.ai/

  Eleventh International Conference
  February 12-15, 2007
  Lowlands, Scarborough, Trinidad and Tobago

  Submissions Due Date (EXTENDED): October 16, 2006, 11:59pm, EDT (UTC-4)

  Program Chair: 	Sven Dietrich (Carnegie Mellon University)
  General Chair: 	Rafael Hirschfeld (Unipay)

  At its 11th year edition, Financial Cryptography and Data Security
(FC'07) is a
  well established and major international forum for research, advanced
  development, education, exploration, and debate regarding security in the
  context of finance and commerce. We will continue last year's augmentation of
  the conference title and expansion of our scope to cover all aspects of
  securing transactions and systems. These aspects include a range of technical
  areas such as: cryptography, payment systems, secure transaction
architectures,
  software systems and tools, fraud prevention, secure IT infrastructure, and
  analysis methodologies. Our focus will also encompass financial, legal,
  business, and policy aspects. Material both on theoretical (fundamental)
  aspects of securing systems,and on secure applications and real-world
  deployments will be considered.

  The conference goal is to bring together top cryptographers, data-security
  specialists, and computer scientists with economists, bankers, implementers,
  and policy makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC'07 program will
  feature invited talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations, and
  panel discussions.

  This conference is organized annually by the International Financial
  Cryptography Association (IFCA).

  Original papers, surveys, and presentations on all aspects of financial and
  commerce security are invited. Submissions must have a strong and visible
  bearing on financial and commerce security issues, but can be
interdisciplinary
  in nature and need not be exclusively concerned with cryptography or
security.
  Possible topics for submission to the various sessions include, but are not
  limited to:

  Anonymity and Privacy
  Auctions
  Audit and Auditability
  Authentication and Identification, including Biometrics
  Certification and Authorization
  Commercial Cryptographic Applications
  Commercial Transactions and Contracts
  Digital Cash and Payment Systems
  Digital Incentive and Loyalty Systems
  Digital Rights Management
  Financial Regulation and Reporting
  Fraud Detection
  Game Theoretic Approaches to Security
  Identity Theft, Phishing and Social Engineering
  Infrastructure Design
  Legal and Regulatory Issues
  Microfinance and Micropayments
  Monitoring, Management and Operations
  Reputation Systems
  RFID-Based and Contactless Payment Systems
  Risk Assessment and Management
  Secure Banking and Financial Web Services
  Securing Emerging Computational Paradigms
  Security and Risk Perceptions and Judgments
  Security Economics
  Smart Cards and Secure Tokens
  Trust Management
  Trustability and Trustworthiness
  Underground-Market Economics
  Virtual Economies
  Voting system security

  For those interested, last year's proceedings are available from Springer.

  Submission Instructions

  Submission Categories

  FC'07 is inviting submissions in four categories: (1) research papers, (2)
  systems and applications presentations, (3) panel sessions, (4) surveys. For
  all accepted submissions, at least one author must attend the conference and
  present the work.

  Research Papers

  Research papers should describe novel scientific contributions to the field,
  and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions
will be
  included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag
  Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series after the conference, so the
  submissions must be formatted in the standard LNCS format (15 page limit).

  Systems and Application Presentations

  Submissions in this category should describe novel or successful systems with
  an emphasis on secure digital commerce applications. Presentations may
concern
  commercial systems, academic prototypes, or open-source projects for any
of the
  topics listed above. Where appropriate, software or hardware
demonstrations are
  encouraged as part of the presentations in these sessions. Submissions in
this
  category should consist of a short summary of the work (1-6 pages in
length) to
  be reviewed by the Program Committee, along with a short biography of the
  presenters. Accepted submissions will be presented at the conference (25
  minutes per presentation), and a one-page abstract will be published in the
  conference proceedings.

  Panel Sessions

  Proposals for panel sessions are also solicited, and should include a brief
  description of the panel as well as prospective participants. Accepted panel
  sessions will be presented at the conference, and each participant will
  contribute a one-page abstract to be published in the conference proceedings.

  Surveys

  A limited number of surveys presentations may also be included in the
program.
  We encourage submissions that summarize the current state of the art on any
  well-defined subset of the above listed submission topics. A limited
  description of visions on future directions of research in these topics would
  also be appreciated. Survey submissions can be significantly shorter than
  research paper submissions.

  Preparation Instructions

  Submissions to the research papers, systems/application presentation
  categories, and surveys must be received by the due date. Papers must be
  formatted in standard PostScript or PDF format. Submissions in other formats
  will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according
to the
  instructions and forms found on this web site and at the submission site.

  Authors should provide names and affiliations at submission time, and
have the
  option of including or not names and affiliations in their submitted papers,
  that must include on their first page the title of the paper, a brief
abstract,
  and a list of topical keywords. Accepted submissions will be included in the
  conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in
  Computer Science (LNCS) series after the conference, so the submissions
must be
  formatted in the standard LNCS format (15 page limit). Authors of accepted
  submissions will be required to complete and sign an IFCA copyright form. A
  pre-proceedings volume containing preliminary versions of the papers will be
  distributed at the conference.

  Questions about all conference submissions should be directed to the Program
  Chair at fc07chair@cert.org.

  Paper Submission

  Authors should only submit work that does not substantially overlap with work
  that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to a
  conference with proceedings or a journal.

  To submit your paper, use our online submission service..

  The Rump Session

  FC'07 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings
  in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short
(5-7
  minute), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and
  any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is
  welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced).
  This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the
presenter, and,
  if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail, or
  submitted in person through the Monday of the conference.

  Associated Workshop

  There will be a Usability Workshop held in conjunction with FC 2007.
