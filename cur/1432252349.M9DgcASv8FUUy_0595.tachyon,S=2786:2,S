   from the odd-distinctions dept.
   leviramsey writes "The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
   (covering Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island) has
   ruled that [1]e-mail providers are not violating the law by reading
   users' e-mail without the user's consent. The [2]decision finds that
   the Wiretap Act does not cover interception of communications where
   the communications are being stored, not transmitted. Perhaps OSDN
   should send the defendant, accused in 2001 of reading users emails in
   order to find out what they were interested in purchasing from Amazon,
   a [3]T-shirt from ThinkGeek?"
