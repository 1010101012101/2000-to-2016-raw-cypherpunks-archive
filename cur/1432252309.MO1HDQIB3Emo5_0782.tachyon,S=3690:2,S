$30 billion in "debt forgiveness" to the Pakistanis, which will cause a 
dozen other countries to condition their support for anti-terrorism 
activities on debt forgiveness....gee, maybe the South American 
countries can get in on the act, convincing Sindero Luminoso to crash a 
747 into DisneyWorld so that Brazil and Argentina can sign on and have 
_their_ debts forgiven?

$30 billion to Pakistan, tens of billions to Israel and Egypt EVERY 
FUCKING YEAR, payoffs to Albana to keep on killing Macedonians and 
Serbs, a $10 billion bailout of the airline industry...the money just 
keeps on flowing!

(Not to mention the $30 million given last week to Afghanistan. But, 
hey, at least they bought Stinger missiles with U.S. aid money! And if 
they use those Stingers to shoot down U.S. jets and helicopters, that'll 
help the war machine, and the defense industry, so everybody's happy!)

Don't worry, be happy!

Hey, I'm chortling. This whole thing is turning into a cluster fuck of 
epic proportions. It may bring on the collapse of the whole house of 
cards.
