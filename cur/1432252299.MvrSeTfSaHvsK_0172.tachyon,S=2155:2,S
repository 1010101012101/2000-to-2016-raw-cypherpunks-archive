Gimme an intel IXA network processor and no problem.  ATM is fixed
size data, not as tricky as IP decoding.  Predicatable bandwidth.
Stream all into megadisks, analyze later.
You need to tap the MPLS  label assignment service (or watch all the
egress ports and correlate to endpoints) too to know which ATM chunks
went where.
