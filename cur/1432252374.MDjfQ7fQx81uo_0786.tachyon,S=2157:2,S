My Google Galaxy Nexus already has NFC, and being 6 months old is close to
obsolete. It is very likely the next iPhone will support NFC as well.

Not even considering the future possibilities of Bitcoin, it is fairly
clear that everything in your wallet, credit cards, photo id (retina or
thumb scans using your phone's camera, anyone?), tickets,  cash, etc. will
be integrated into your smartphone within the next 5-10 years.

Peer to peer decentralisation  and strong encryption is the way to keep big
brother out of all of it.
