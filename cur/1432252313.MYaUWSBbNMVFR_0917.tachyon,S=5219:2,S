Nobody ever said the CDR was Usenet. Choate is tilting at windmills
again, a crazed smile on a manical face as he bounces around his
padded room.

Nevertheless it is similar in one or two respects. People posting to
cypherpunks offer an implied license for people to archive and
redistribute for the purposes of transmission and redistribute on an
archive site their copyrighted works. This is not the same as giving
up copyright (I'm sure I've sold some articles that I've posted in
preliminary draft form to cypherpunks at one point or another).

I vaguely recall that this is one of Choate's pet topics, worms have
burrowed deep into his skull and preclude even the usual state of
gibbering nonsense. So I doubt I'll say anything more here.
