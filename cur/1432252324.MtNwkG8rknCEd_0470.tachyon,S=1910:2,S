That would be a neat trick considering the variety of likely signal path
lengths to be found in the terrestial telephone network or the terrestial
Internet.  All in all, there are so many varibles in such conjecture as to
make the hypothesis largely indeterminate.

But it is amusing to consider the potential existence of the CIA Orbital
Alien Mind Control Laser Cannon(tm).
