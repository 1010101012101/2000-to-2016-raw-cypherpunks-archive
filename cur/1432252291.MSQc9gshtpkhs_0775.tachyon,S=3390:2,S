This is one of the most revealing videos of the New War in America.  It's
a painful self examination of the horror that America has become after
9-11.  New Yorkers discuss how lives have been affected - not only pain,
but the confusions and uncertainty of the future.

I think it's time to put on the seatbelts and get ready for the sixties on
estacy.  New Yorkers are grieving in many ways.  There is a graveyard in
the middle of NYC and that is drawing powerful emotions which are examined
in detail in this vidio.  You will require a real audio player to view.

Regards
Joe Baptista
