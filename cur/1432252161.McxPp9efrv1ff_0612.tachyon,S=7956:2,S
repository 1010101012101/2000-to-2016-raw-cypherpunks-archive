Mexico: New Drug Gang Alliances May Spread Overseas
7 August 2002
Summary

Mexico's drug-trafficking industry is evolving into smaller, more 
compartmentalized and discreet criminal enterprises in which alliances 
between rival gangs are being viewed as more profitable than trying to kill 
each other off. This new preference for alliances instead of gunplay may 
soon lead to expanded associations between Mexican gangs and organized 
criminal groups from other Latin American countries as well as Europe, 
Russia and Asia.

Analysis

Mexico's illegal drug-trafficking industry is restructuring rapidly into 
smaller, lower-profile criminal organizations following the death earlier 
this year of Ramon Arellano Felix -- leader of the Tijuana drug cartel -- 
and arrest of his brother Benjamin, The Associated Press reported Aug. 3. 
At the same time, the center of power of Mexico's drug-trafficking industry 
has moved from Tijuana in Baja, Calif. to Ciudad Juarez in the state of 
Chihuahua, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.
Mexico's evolving drug-trafficking organizations are smaller, more compact 
networks in which competing drug lords now seek to work cooperatively 
instead of killing their rivals, as the Arellano Felix brothers were fond 
of doing. Moreover, the shift in power to Ciudad Juarez means there likely 
will be a significant surge in narcotics smuggling from north-central and 
northeastern Mexico into the states of Texas and New Mexico. But southern 
California may see a drop in narcotics smuggling from Tijuana.
