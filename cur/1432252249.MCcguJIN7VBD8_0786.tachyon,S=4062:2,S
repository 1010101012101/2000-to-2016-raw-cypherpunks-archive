There's a distinct difference in purpose, theoretically speaking, 
between "invading to control" and "invading to punish and destroy".

Your operational requirements are significantly different, so I'm 
told by several military folks I've talked to, none of whom attempted 
to play down the Afghan resolve, but simply pointed out that if we 
didn't care about "keeping it", we would not encounter (all of) the 
same difficulties Ivan did.
