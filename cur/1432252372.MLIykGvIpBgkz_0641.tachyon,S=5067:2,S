I certainly would never attend a Cypherpunks meeting held at a police 
training facility!

A bizarre development in the history of Cypherpunks, that's for sure.

Specificity matters. If someone with some ability to influence urges his 
followers to "Kill Jews," and some of them begin to, expect an 
"incitement" (and perhaps "conspiracy") charge to stick against the 
speaker. If someone mere opines that Jews should be killled, protected 
speech.

I just said very little. When they asked me for ID, I said nothing. When 
they asked me for my name, I said nothing. When they said they wanted to 
search my bag, I said "No."

Didn't happen, though. No arrest.

Also no return gigs at her class...for whatever reason. If I recall the 
years right, it was in '95 that I first spoke, then in '97 when the 
incident occurred. We've had no contact since. Maybe I wasn't the 
speaker she wanted, maybe she'd heard enough from me, maybe my run-in 
with the Securitat was enough for her.

(And Larry Lessig is now at Stanford, so maybe he's taken over teaching 
the cyberlaw class.)
