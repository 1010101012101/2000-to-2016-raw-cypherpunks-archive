Actually, for the last one or two years it's already illegal to sell or re-sell
(even used) VCRs without macrovision shit.

What will determine the outcome of this war is future availability of universal
openly-programmable computing platforms (aka pee-cees). We will probably see
regulations following those for handguns: for the first few decades everyone
sported them, then they became heavily regulated.

So expect a 5-year federal care for possession of an "unlocked" PC within one
mile from schoolyard or an airport.
