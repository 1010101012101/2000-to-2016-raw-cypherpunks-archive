Nah. Right now the executive branch is more worried about spooking the 
public than lobbying Congress over a fight they've already won. Also, 
senators' minds were made up long before the late-afternoon news of this 
"skyfall" release got out. Besides, how much more support do they need? A 
vote of 94-3 instead of 90-7?
