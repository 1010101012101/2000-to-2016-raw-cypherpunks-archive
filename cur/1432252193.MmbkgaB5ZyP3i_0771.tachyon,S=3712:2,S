Sharon Shea-Keneally, principal of Mount Anthony Union High School in
                   Bennington, Vermont, was shocked when she received a
letter in May
                   from military recruiters demanding a list of all her
students, including names,
                   addresses, and phone numbers. The school invites
recruiters to participate
                   in career days and job fairs, but like most school
districts, it keeps student
                   information strictly confidential. "We don't give out
a list of names of our
                   kids to anybody," says Shea-Keneally, "not to
colleges, churches,
                   employers -- nobody."

                   But when Shea-Keneally insisted on an
                   explanation, she was in for an even bigger
                   surprise: The recruiters cited the No Child Left
                   Behind Act, President Bush's sweeping new
                   education law passed earlier this year. There,
                   buried deep within the law's 670 pages, is a
                   provision requiring public secondary schools to
                   provide military recruiters not only with access
                   to facilities, but also with contact information for
                   every student -- or face a cutoff of all federal
                   aid.
