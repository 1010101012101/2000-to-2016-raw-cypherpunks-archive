  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SECRET SEARCH ON AMERICANS -- WITHOUT COURT ORDER

 Bill Clinton Signed Executive Order that allowed Attorney General to do
 searches without court approval

  Secret searches of Aldrich Ames's office and home in June and October
 1993, both without a federal warrant.

  Clinton, February 9, 1995: "The Attorney General is authorized to approve
 physical searches, without a court order"

  WASH POST, July 15, 1994: Extend not only to searches of the homes of U.S.
 citizens but also -- in the delicate words of a Justice Department official
 -- to "places where you wouldn't find or would be unlikely to find
 information involving a U.S. citizen... would allow the government to use
 classified electronic surveillance techniques, such as infrared sensors to
 observe people inside their homes, without a court order."

  Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick, the Clinton administration
 believes the president "has inherent authority to conduct warrantless
 searches for foreign intelligence purposes."

  1982: COURT SAYS U.S. SPY AGENCY CAN TAP OVERSEAS MESSAGES

  By DAVID BURNHAM, SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES (NYT) 1051 words
 Published: November 7, 1982

  A Federal appeals court has ruled that the National Security Agency may
 lawfully intercept messages between United States citizens and people
 overseas, even if there is no cause to believe the Americans are foreign
 agents.
