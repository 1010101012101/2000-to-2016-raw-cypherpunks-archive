.. but s/he is apparently unfamiliar with the events described in

_United States v. Schenck_ 249 US 47 (1919);
_United States v. Debs_ 249 US 211 (1919);
_Abrams v. US_ 250 US 616 (1919);
and _United States v. Pierce_ 252 US 239 (1920);

all of which are US Supreme Court cases upholding convictions of people for 
the crime of criticizing existing government policy and/or urging 
noncooperation with war-related activity. There were approximately 2000 
prosecutions and 1000 convictions for violations of the speech-related 
Espionage and Sedition acts during World War I.

Nomen quoted Ashcroft as saying "We need honest, reasoned debate; not 
fearmongering" - but Nomen and Ashcroft's call for debate which occurs 
after decisions are made and people are jailed, not before, puts them 
firmly in Beyond the Looking Glass territory, to wit -

sound familiar?
