Its the blue *helmets* not uniforms that one should worry about :-)

Not sociopath dogs, just guard-like dogs that would hassle an agent
hanging out on your front bench.  A nice slobbery dog with a loud
voice and some reasonable sense of territorial sovereignty.  Maybe
some hostility to men in suits.

My cat agrees that dogs are in general useless noisy and annoying but 
consider how useful they are in secure installations (jails, mil bases,
gulags, etc.)  
For physical security and alarms, dogs are pretty good.

Dogs are drunk football players.  

Cats are considered *public good* and allowed to roam freely, in Calif.  
Cats also reduce the incidence of allergies (by altering
immunoglobin levels differently from other antigens like mites) among children
living with them (as reported in _Science_).  And of course they have
hackernature.

Or work.  Many companies have private rules against that, but otherwise
its legally protected.  Lots of gun store employees wear open carry at
work, not many
others.  Pilots I suppose, now.
