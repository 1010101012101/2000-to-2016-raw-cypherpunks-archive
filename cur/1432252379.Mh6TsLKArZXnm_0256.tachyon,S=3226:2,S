EETimes 25 Oct 04 has an article about how 
the testing structures on ICs makes them 
vulnerable to attacks.  The basic idea is
that to test a chip, you need to see inside
it; this can also reveal crypto details 
(e.g., keys) which compromise the chip.  

This has been known to us with an interest
in both crypto and IC design for some time,
but its nice to see it exposed in the public
lit.  There are methods that avoid this,
such as BIST, but they are less popular.
