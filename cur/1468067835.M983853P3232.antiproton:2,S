"Invasion" of Crimea by Russia in 2014? Please!

If the actions of Russia in the face of the Azov battalian's "peace
train" to Crimea, a referendum, secession and joining to Russia, without
a single bullet fired, is supposed to be a "Russian invasion", then the
world does not have much to worry about with Russia.

I guess it would also be "assumed fact" that Russia continues, for over
2 years, to "invade" eastern Ukraine/ Donbass - I tell you this, if I
had family living in Donbass who would struggle to defend themselves
against various Ukraine "battallians", to defend their families,
children, houses, friends, I would most likely have been fighting with
them to help them defend the rest of my family, their house, friends
etc.

ISIS invades Syria, entering from Iraq, Turkey and other surrounding
areas, provided weapons and training by CIA, and takes over towns and
cities; THAT is an invasion.

As it is, we in the West can sit back so comfortably, armchair war
generals, declare with the CIA that Al Nusra, Daesh and other Wahabbi
extremists entering/invading Syria are actually "freedom fighters" as
they invade towns and cities, raping, killing and destroying, because,
you know "Assad must go", whilst those families defending themselves and
their houses in eastern Ukraine against their own supposed "government"
are "terrorists".

Saying black is white don't mean shit!

A good point here. Let's see how things play out over the next couple of
years.

We Westerners are well fed, well entertained, well schooled (not
educated) and sadly very compliant with external authorities.

Golden cages do -not- make for an honourable humans!

I would hope humans worthy of that noun, strive for something higher
than a new car, 5 bedroom house and footy tickets.

Yes, I keep dreaming.
