Actualy you mis-represent. The fundamental issues that trouble this
country are not an effect of the war on drugs, but rather it an effect of
them. There are many.

A few,

The acceptance by the rank and file of Lincoln's 'fundamental law of
nations'. This has laid the basic groundwork for the ever
increasing 'federalism' (and as a consequence socialism/fascism). 

The change in life style (e.g. loss of state power) we see a loss of
power in one of the fundamental component pieces of our democracy.

An increase in technology that has placed the ability to harm a large
group of poeple in the hands of the individual like no previous time in
history.

etc.
