Networks Suing Super VCR Associated Press
Three major television networks are suing the maker of the first
Internet-ready
personal digital video recorder, saying the ReplayTV 4000 lets people
make and
distribute illegal copies of television programs.

NBC, ABC and CBS filed a lawsuit Wednesday in federal court in
California against Sonicblue, claiming the ReplayTV 4000 would violate
their copyrights by allowing users to distribute copies of programs over
the Internet.
