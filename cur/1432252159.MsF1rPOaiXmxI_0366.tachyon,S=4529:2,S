Do a search on her name in Google. Essentially no signs of her on the 
Net until _early 2001_. She appears on several libertarian-oriented 
lists, including an Extropians list, PGP Users, and a Cypherpunks list, 
asking leading questions about possible actions. Prior to early 2001, 
little that I can find. (Maybe she changed her name, maybe she didn't 
even have her "pobox.com" account, or maybe she only got active when she 
attached herself to so many crypto and libertarian groups...which would 
be really strange, given her expressed antipathy to the goals. Not a 
very good agent provacateur!)

And this in Waco, a few miles from where the Bush team has been setting 
up at the Crawford ranch. (Waco is where most of the agents actually 
live, there being no real apartment buildings in Crawford or Prairie 
Chapel!)

She drops hints about the "prime rib" she's now getting "down the 
street" from all the SS agents in town. She gets active in provoking PGP 
Users, Extropians, and Cypherpunks just as the Bush boys are moving into 
Waco and Crawfod. Coincidence?

She posts comments here designed, she apparently thinks, to "out" us.

My strong hunch is that she's either tied-in directly to the SS staff in 
Waco, is assigned to the area by the FBI, or is is doing her own 
independent entrapment so as to present us to them the way a cat 
presents a mouse to its master.

Aimee suddenly gets involved in "pro-liberty" mailing lists in Jan-March 
2001, despite being obviously anti-liberty. Aimee apparently has a "sole 
proprietor" offices in Waco, just where the SS has set up camp, and only 
8-10 miles from the Bush ranch.

Aimee now thinks that I, Tim, have "committed suicide."

Fed-lovers in Waco certainly ought to understand the phenomenon.

So, Aimee, low-paid GS-14, or even lower-paid GS-12?

(Jeff, Agent Farr is way too stupid even to work for the FBI!)
