On SKYKING (8992 or 11175 kHz USB) a call sign called "COLLAPSE" which
has not been heard since 2001 has just broadcasted 4 messages to
numbered stations/units in the last few minutes.

"FUXEBOX" and "Reykjavik," have also broadcast in the last few days
and they haven't been heard since 1991 (collapse of the Soviet Union).

"COLLAPSE" has sent 3 messages in the last few minutes.

COLLAPSE message one: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1hGyA2GR6HI

Collapse message Two: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ETZ3l9fp0G

Collapse message Three: http://vocaroo.com/i/s03ZI6ui70LY

Message Four from "FLATTOP!" (ANOTHER STATION NOT HEARD IN YEARS!):

We do not know what these codes mean, but it considered

These are alerts to "All Stations" before the codes are sent. I did my
best to record all these but missed recording "the alert phrase" where
they said "All stations, all stations." This has all happened in the
last half hour (0230-0304 EST). I didn't record these or write this up
btw, this was a thread from 4chan that popped up on /pol/ Edit: Go
