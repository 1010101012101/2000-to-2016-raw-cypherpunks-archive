I can, barely, and, no, I didn't.  But I get your point.

The card punching machines I used did a good job of punching a clean
hole.  And I noticed on my Texas ballot just how cleanly the holes were
punched.  If there were many chads hanging about then either the
punching equipment, the cards or both were faulty.  Maybe the butterfly
wasn't the only flaw in the design of the ballots.
