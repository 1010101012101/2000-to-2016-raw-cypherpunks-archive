6th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies
(PET 2006)

Robinson College, Cambridge, United Kingdom
June 28 - June 30, 2006
http://petworkshop.org/2006/

Special Events:
* Keynote speaker: Susan Landau, Sun Microsystems Laboratories
  on "The Missing Link", (Abstract at the end of the email.)
* PET Award 2006 ceremony and reception at Microsoft Research,
  http://petworkshop.org/2006/award.html

Co-located with:
* The Fifth Workshop on the Economics of Information Security
  (WEIS 2006), 26-28 June, http://weis2006.econinfosec.org/
* IAVoSS Workshop On Trustworthy Elections (WOTE 2006)
  29-30 June, http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/wote2006/

Privacy and anonymity are increasingly important in the online
world. Corporations, governments, and other organizations are
realizing and exploiting their power to track users and their
behavior, and restricting the ability to publish or retrieve
documents. Approaches to not only protecting individuals and groups,
but also companies and governments, from such profiling and
censorship include decentralization, encryption, distributed
trust, and automated policy disclosure.

This 6th workshop addresses the design and realization of such privacy
and anti-censorship services for the Internet and other communication
networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from
around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives.

Early registration by May 12 at:

Keynote speaker:

               The Missing Link

               Susan Landau

In recent decades, we have seen significant progress in the development of
tools to protect privacy.  We have similarly seen various policy
developments, e.g., the 1980 OECD Guidelines on Privacy Protection and 1997
application to the Internet.  But

             Between the conception
             And the creation
             Between the emotion
             And the response
             Falls the Shadow.
                    (T.S. Eliot, "The Hollow Men.")

One shadow is that while privacy policies abound, when data is collected,
there are few or no rules governing its security (which is a crucial
requirement for data privacy).  A current instance of this concerns the
recent requirement for data retention by the European Union.

This talk discusses what is needed to get to:

             Between the conception
             And the creation
             Between the emotion
             And the response
             Falls the Action.
