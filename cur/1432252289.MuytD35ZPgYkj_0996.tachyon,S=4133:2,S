A bunch, something like 5000 years of recorded history.

Please demonstrate a government that in general make 'arbitrary decision'.

Not that doesn't mean decisions you don't like, or reasons you don't like.

lasts longer, if it fails it doesn't last as long.

You're free to hypothesize to your hearts and brains content. Fortunately
a hypothesis is worthless until it's tested.
