Bittorrent, alone, starves users who leach without
reciprocating, but only in certain very limited ways.

As a result of that and swarming Bittorrent has far more
bandwidth available than any other file sharing network.  You
can download big files faster.  If you want to download big
files, use Bittorrent, or hell will freeze over before your
files complete.  But it does not have more files available,
indeed it has fewer, because there is no reward to users for
making a wide range of files available.

The enormous success of bittorrent, and its limitations, should
tell us that the principle of rewarding uploaders and storers,
and starving leachers, is pretty much central to the success of
a protocol and its software.
