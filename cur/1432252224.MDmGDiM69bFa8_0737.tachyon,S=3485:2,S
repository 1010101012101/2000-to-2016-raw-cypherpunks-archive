Google chief: Only miscreants worry about net privacy

'If you don't want anyone to know, don't do it'

If you're concerned about Google retaining your personal data, then you must
be doing something you shouldn't be doing. At least that's the word from
Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you
shouldn't be doing it in the first place," Schmidt tells CNBC, sparking howls
of incredulity from the likes of Gawker.

But the bigger news may be that Schmidt has actually admitted there are cases
where the search giant is forced to release your personal data.

"If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines
- including Google - do retain this information for some time and it's
important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the
Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made
available to the authorities."

There's also the possibility of subpoenas. And hacks. But if any of this
bothers you, you should be ashamed of yourself. According to Eric Schmidt.

Gawker highlights the irony of Schmidt's typically haughty proclamations.
After all, this is the man who banned CNet for a year after the news site
published information about him it had gleaned from, yes, Google.

But the larger point here is that Schmidt isn't even addressing the issue at
hand. Per usual. When the privacy question appears, Google likes to talk
about the people asking the questions. But the problem lies elsewhere: with
the millions upon millions blissfully unaware of the questions.

If you're concerned about your online privacy, you can always put the kibosh
on Google's tracking cookies. You can avoid signing in to Google accounts.
And, yes, you can avoid using Google for anything Eric Schmidt thinks you
shouldn't be doing. But most web users don't even realize Google is hoarding
their data.

CNBC asks Schmidt: "People are treating Google like their most trusted
friend. Should they be?" But he answers by scoffing at those who don't trust
Google at all.

Not that you'd expect anything less. As always, Schmidt's holier-than-thou
attitude is wonderfully amusing. Except that it's not.
