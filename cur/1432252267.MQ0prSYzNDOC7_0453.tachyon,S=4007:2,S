Maybe there is nothing special about my site. And I don't mind
junkbusters users going elsewhere. I just do not want them to waste my
precious bandwidth.

Well, they are pretty useless to me anyway.

They cannot use many features of my site without cookies anyway.
These features include a linear algebra workbench (a unique service
as far as I was able to determine), standardized testing, "My Homework"
and so on. These features store a lot of session information about the
users and use cookies to reference the stored data.

I am not interested in a war of wits. I think that if 1) I indeed
have a nmeasurable part of bandwidth being used by junkbusters users,
and 2) junkbusters are easy to detect, then I woul dlike to do it and
kick them out.

I do not have the mania grandioza to believe that Junkbusters will
do anything just because Algebra.com found a smart ass way to detect their
users.
