Interesting looking case coming up soon - an employee (whose motives are
probably dubious, but still :) installed a keyghost onto his boss' pc and
was charged with unauthorised wire tapping.
That isn't the interesting bit. the interesting bit is this is IIRC exactly
how the FBI obtained Scarfo's PGP password, waybackwhen - *without* a
wiretap warrant.

be interesting if his lawyer decided to call an FBI expert to explain why
this device isn't wiretapping, wouldn't it? :)
