Once again, the RSA Conference is upon us, and many of the 
corrospondents on these lists will be in San Francisco. I'd like to
see if anyone is interested in getting together. We've done this
before.

At past conferences, we've had various levels of participation, 
from 50 down to 3. Since the BAC Physical Meetings seem
to have pretty well died out, I'd like to propose that those
of us who are interested get together for lunch or dinner 
at some point.

I'll be arriving on site Monday afternoon, and leaving Friday
morning. Thursday night, at least, is already spoken for.

At the moment, it looks like Monday or Tuesday night 
may be the best, though a lunch is also possible.

Any takers?
