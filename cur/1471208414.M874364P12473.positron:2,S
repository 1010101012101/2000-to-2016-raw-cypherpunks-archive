As a QA and document control guy, I can't read something like that
without processing it like this:

"We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is
open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we
will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them
open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where
open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be
especially vigilant in our peer review by project members."

Translation:  We believe in and practice an open, accountable
development process, except when we don't.  The public is allowed to
see how TOR works, except when the public is not allowed to see how
TOR works.  Trust us, what you don't know won't hurt you.

"We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online
freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human
rights -- particularly their rights to free speech, freedom to access
information, and privacy -- can be preserved when they use the Internet.
"

Edit to include:  The TOR project believes in human rights, except the
rights of persons accused of crimes to be held innocent until proven
guilty, and to publicly confront their accusers in a neutral, public
Court.  The TOR Project believes in and exercises the rights of
risk-averse employers to discipline and discharge victims of malicious
office gossip and/or anonymous denunciation as an expedient conflict
resolution method.

"We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the
capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with
using them. Every user should be free to make an informed decision
about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should
use it."

Edit to include:  "The TOR Browser ships with NoScript installed but
disabled.  Users must enable it themselves to obtain protection
against de-anonymization at will by any malicious or compromised
website.  We do this as a convenience for naive users who may not
understand what NoScript is or what it does."

With TOR, one can have exactly as much "freedom and security" as one
can steal.  Just like real life.
