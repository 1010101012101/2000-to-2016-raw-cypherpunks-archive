Jeffrey Rosen's _The Unwanted Gaze:  the destruction of privacy in
America_ is a good general read on this topic, and is generally
recommended.

It doesn't cover the issue of "privacy in public" in depth, though the
issue is really more one of moving anonymously (or at least largely
unrecorded) through public spaces.

Rosen does discuss privacy at home and at work, and in cyberspace.  The
index doesn't specifically list "public spaces", though there's some
discussion of anonymity.  Brandeis and Warren wrote a law review article
in 1890 in the _Harvard Law Review_.

Rosen does touch on expectations of privacy in public spaces:

    In _The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera describes how
    the police destroyed an important figure of the Prague Spring by
    recording his conversations with a friend and then broadcasting them
    as a radio serial.

The other interesting discussion is of the Olmstead case (the original
wiretap case).

I would raise objections on the basis of the Fourth and Forteenth
Amendments.

Peace.
