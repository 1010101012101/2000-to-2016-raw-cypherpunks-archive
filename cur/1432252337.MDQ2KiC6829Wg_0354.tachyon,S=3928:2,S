  12 SMARTCARDS GO MISSING IN TENNESSEE; CONTROL ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES

  Fri Nov 03 2006 10:09:31 ET

  Political insiders have expressed alarm after 12 voter smartcards have gone
  missing from one Shelby County, TN early vote location!

  The cards are used to activate electronic voting machines.

  The location at the center of the controversy is Bishop Byrne High School
  on E. Shelby Drive in Memphis.

  The polling place started out with 25 cards. By Wednesday, 11 were missing,
  says an eyewitness.

  The location was given 5 more smartcards on Thursday.

  And another card went missing!

  Someone possessing a smartcard could use 'off the shelf equipment'
  [equipment that reprograms the card] and alter it to be used multiple
  times, and cast multiple votes.

  One concerned insider explains: "Shelby County Board of Elections has been
  notified. They said is was 'not a big deal' because, they said, the cards
  are deactivated. But the reality is, you can buy the equipment at computer
  stores to reactivate them. It's on the Internet how to reactivate the
  cards!"

  Meanwhile, The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is reviewing reports by
  the Shelby County Election Commission that two people voted twice during
  early voting in Memphis.

  Dist. Atty. Gen. Bill Gibbons said he's referred the cases to the TBI for
  investigation along with other matters he declined to discuss.

  Poll watchers are expected to turn out Tuesday to observe voting in
  Tennessee's heated U.S. Senate race between Chattanooga Republican Bob
  Corker and Memphis Democrat Harold Ford Jr.
