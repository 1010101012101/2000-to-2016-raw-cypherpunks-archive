> A new technical note on Adi Shamir's "TWIRL" design for integer 
> factorization has just been posted on the RSA Labs site, at 
> http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/technotes/twirl.html.
> 
> Executive Summary: The popular 1024-bit key size for RSA 
> keys is becoming the next horizon for researchers in integer 
> factorization, as demonstrated by the innovative "TWIRL" 
> design recently proposed by Adi Shamir and Eran Tromer. 
> The design confirms that the traditional assumption that a 
> 1024-bit RSA key provides comparable strength to an 80-bit 
> symmetric key has been a reasonable one. Thus, if the 80-bit 
> security level is appropriate for a given application, then TWIRL 
> itself has no immediate effect. Many details remain to be 
> worked out, however, and the cost estimates are inconclusive. 
> TWIRL provides an opportunity for review of key sizes in 
> practice; RSA Laboratories' revised recommendations are 
> given in Table 1 below.
