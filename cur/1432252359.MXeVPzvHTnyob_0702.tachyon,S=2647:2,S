A copy of the indictment is here:

Nicodemo S. Scarfo, the defendant in this case, is the son of the
former head of the Philadelphia-Atlantic City mob (who has been in
jail himself since 1991); Nicodemo is currently out on bail and
awaiting trial. His attorney was going to file a pretrial motion on
the crypto issue, but was replaced today  (conflict of interest rules)
with a new attorney, with whom I have not yet spoken.

So if you don't like this kind of FBI black bag job, you'll want to
root for Mr. Scarfo. :)
