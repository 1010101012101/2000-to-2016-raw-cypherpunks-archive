Thats a small dick.  I assume it has growth potential.

But my recommendations are not to use your dick for the explosives.  Use
your asshole.  You can stuff a whole wad of explosive materials up
there.  And there is a precedent for that sort of thing.  Prisoners have
been using their assholes for centuries to move contraban.

I can see it now.  Airports everywhere employing teams of proctologists
while passengers bend over for the safty checks.
