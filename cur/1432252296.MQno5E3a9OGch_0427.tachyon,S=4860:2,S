I have presented examples of Chomsky citing vaguely specified sources that 
supposedly provide evidence for all sorts of astonishing things, supposedly 
provide evidence for the then Soviet line, yet strange to report, no one is 
able to produce this alleged evidence. When the Soviet line changed, no one 
continued to claim these things were true.  In particular, no one continued 
to claim the existence of "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were 
false"

I have looked for this alleged evidence, and not found it.  It does not 
appear to exist.  It is the job of Chomsky's fans, not my job, to find 
these "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false", and the rest.

That was an example of evidence that Chomsky claimed existed, but which 
does not exist.

Chomsky before 1979:  (falsely purporting to be quoting "highly qualified 
specialists")
: : 	executions have numbered at most in the thousands; that
: : 	these were localized in areas of limited Khmer Rouge
: : 	influence and unusual peasant discontent, where brutal
: : 	revenge killings were aggravated by the threat of
: : 	starvation resulting from the American destruction and
: : 	killing

Chomsky after 1979, in the documentary film "Manufacturing Consent: Noam 
Chomsky and the Media" called the Khmer Rouge the perpetrators of the
: : 	worst atrocity of the modern era.

Of course a film citation is almost impossible to check.  I could be making 
up that citation in the same way that Chomsky makes up most of his 
citations, locating the bogus citations in hard to check places.  In fact I 
have never seen the movie and do not intend to see it, but fans of Chomsky 
endlessly cite those above words as evidence that Chomsky is not a 
supporter of the Khmer Rouge.  Just do a search for "worst atrocity of the 
modern era" in Deja News.  And indeed, what they claim is true:  Once 
Soviet policy changed, Chomsky was no longer a supporter of the Khmer Rouge.
