120 digits is about 400 bits, and while the computer is respectably fast,
it's just 4 processors.  (Remember that Alpha MHz != Pentium MHz.)
10 weeks of preprocessing, plus about 12 hours per key afterwards.
So 512-bit Diffie-Hellman is pretty close to toast,
at least if you re-use the modulus, and likewise 512-bit El Gamal.
