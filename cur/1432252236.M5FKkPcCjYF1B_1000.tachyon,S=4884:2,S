At Wired News, we've compiled a list of the technology voting records of 
each member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

That meant picking seven tech bills and grading all 435 legislators -- at 
least the ones who showed up those days -- on their floor votes. If they 
chose to take a hands-off approach, they got a "1", while regulatory votes 
got a "0." (If you disagree with us, flip the scale around.)

Here's the list sorted by last name (scoll down to find your legislator):

Sorted by score, with the two California reps with 100 percent at the top:

And a summary of the results, with some methodology:
   http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,39625,00.html

Some interesting results: Purported privacy advocates like Democrat Ed 
Markey didn't score well, getting a 33% of 100%, in part because of his 
opposition to financial privacy legislation. Republican Bob Goodlatte, 
Internet caucus co-chair, got just 43% because of his support for speech 
and gambling restrictions.
