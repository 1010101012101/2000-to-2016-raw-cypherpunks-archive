My home has a security system. I wonder what would happen if I let,
say, young relatives stay here and they triggered, say, five false
alarms.

Most likely outcome: A severe talking-to by the local constabulary,
and many fines. Not, oh gosh, and back-slapping among comrade LErs.

Like you said, more equal than others.

It would be interesting to read up on the laws re: false alarms of
Fairfax County.
