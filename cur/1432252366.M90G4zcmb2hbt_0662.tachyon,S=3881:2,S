Roger,

Thanks for the quick reply and links.  Although this happened over six months ago I had not seen any discussion about it. 

A few questions...

- How did Steven Murdoch and Richard Clayton tracked down the operator? How did they determine it was an innocent mistake?  Even if the operator is benevolent, that capability with so few nodes is disturbing.

- How were 9 nodes apparently able to touch 11% of all Tor traffic?  Have changes to the code since then reduced this vulnerability?

- Do you think there needs to be activity (perhaps "collusion" between a group of good guys), similar to what's on Bit Torrent, to identify and blacklist nodes (discussions about the risks and legality of such things can be left till later)?

- Is there a transcript of the talk those slides were given with, or at least a video?

Yeah. This happened in mid 2006. I don't know why some random person
just picked it up now.

We (mainly Steven Murdoch and Richard Clayton) tracked down the fellow
running them. It turned out to be an innocent mistake. He's still running
quite a few, on the same network, but now he sets the MyFamily torrc
option on them.

This issue also prompted us to speed up the fix/feature in 0.1.2.1-alpha:
"Automatically avoid picking more than one node from the same
/16 network when constructing a circuit."

For a more interesting (and more conclusive imo) method of deciding
they're the same, check out slide 28 in Steven's slides from his CCS
paper and 23C3 talk, where he investigated these servers:
