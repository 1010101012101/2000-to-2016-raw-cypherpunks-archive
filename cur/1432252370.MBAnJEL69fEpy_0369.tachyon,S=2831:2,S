Subject: Re: [IP] CA State bill could cripple P2P


actually, taken at face value, this outlaws all
network protocol stacks I know about, even terminal
emulators with things like x-modem and even file redirection.

it's patently bogus, but it could do an immense amount of mischief
done before it gets undone (assuming it ever gets done).

What i'd like to see is a bill punishing legislators for
introducing unconstitutional bills.  if a bill is declared
unconstitutional, the sponsors of the bill would do prison
time for an assault on the public freedom.
