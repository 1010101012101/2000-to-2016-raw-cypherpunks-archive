Probably not surprisingly to anybody on this list, with the exception of
potentially Anonymous, according to the TCPA's own TPM Common Criteria
Protection Profile, the TPM prevents the owner of a TPM from exporting
the TPM's internal key. The ability of the TPM to keep the owner of a PC
from reading the private key stored in the TPM has been evaluated to E3
(augmented). For the evaluation certificate issued by NIST, see:

It appears the days when this was true are waning. At least in the PC
platform domain.
