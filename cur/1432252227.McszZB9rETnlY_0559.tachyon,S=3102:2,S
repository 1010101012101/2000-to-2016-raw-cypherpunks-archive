Peter,

Thanks for the tip on that.  I'll be looking out for it, although at
that price, it's cheaper to buy a dedicated PC and run SpeakFreely, as
you point out.

Linux PDAs with good sound chips are just around the corner,
apparently, and it seems that it shouldn't be too big a feat to get
SpeakFreely or something similar running on them.  These PDAs are a
lot cheaper than the dedicated encryption hardware, such as Starium,
which was going to price at around $500, last I heard.  Also, because
everything in the PDA is open source, it would be easier to trust it.
Maybe when I have time and money to do it, and the PDAs with the
necessary hardware are really shipping, I'll do some project like
this.  Basically, all it needs would be a full-duplex sound chip, and
a built-in modem, and a reasonably fast CPU.

It's just a shame that we have encryption all over the place, except
for the one medium which we probably use the most: voice.
