Dear Joyce,

How about buying yourself a two Breitling watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
http://www.maymap.com/

Take an extra 15% off your purchase during month of January (2009).

Our Breitling have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Shoemaker
