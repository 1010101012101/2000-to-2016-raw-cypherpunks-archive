Stamps.com Technology Helps Improve Mail Security


Internal Task Force to Focus on Further Utilization of Internet Postage Security

SANTA MONICA, Calif. - October 24, 2001 - Stamps.comTM (Nasdaq: STMP).
Stamps.com announced today that it has appointed an internal task force to
explore new applications that further harness and utilize the security inherent
in its Internet Postage solution. Traditional stamped mail offers limited
security information. Stamps.com's Internet Postage service, on the other hand,
can provide extensive information regarding the sender's identity, point of
origination and the path taken through the mail system. Stamps.com intends to
develop new features to further improve mail security for its customers.

Stamps.com's Internet Postage solution utilizes Information Based Indicia, or
cryptographic two-dimensional barcodes, as a replacement for traditional
postage. This "intelligent" postage, which can be printed using standard PC
printers, contains important mail processing information that can provide
valuable assistance to authorities investigating inappropriate postal
activities.

"Stamps.com's secure technology provides mail recipients greater peace of mind,"
said Stamps.com CEO Ken McBride. "Each piece of mail sent using Stamps.com is
unique and traceable by authorities to its sender, thus serving as a deterrent
to those intent on using the postal system to do harm. Mail sent using the
Stamps.com service is also associated with an individual credit card or checking
account, which can further reduce the opportunity for abuse."

A trusted, efficient, and secure mail system has always been a cornerstone of
the American economy. Enhanced adoption of advanced technologies, such as
Stamps.com's Internet Postage service, can promote a higher level of security
within the mail system. Stamps.com continues to work with postal authorities to
encourage greater usage of Internet Postage.

"With a two-dimensional barcode on the envelope or package, recipients can feel
more assured today that the mail is traceable and secure. For the sender, a more
secure and professional looking mail piece will encourage the intended recipient
to open the package or envelope," said McBride.

About Stamps.com
Stamps.com (Nasdaq: STMP) is the leading provider of Internet-based postage
services. Its flagship product, Stamps.com Internet Postaged, enables customers

connection.<...>
