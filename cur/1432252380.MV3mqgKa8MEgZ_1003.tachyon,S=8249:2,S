The Four Horsemen of the Frankfort 
School  (english)

The White Trash Gun Nut
In his new book "The Death of the West" Patrick J. Buchanan examines the 
origin of what he contends is the modern decline of America. He asserts 
that while Soviet style Marxism is largely dead, our society remains 
enthralled by Cultural Marxism, which is strangling our freedom, and 
threatening our future. This threat to our culture and way of life 
accelerated to a deadly speed with the establishment, in 1933 at Columbia 
University, of the Institute for Social Research, originally called "The 
Institute for Marxism." This institution became known as the Frankfort School.
The destructive nature of the Frankfort School, founded in New York after 
it's theoreticians fled there from Frankfort, Germany when Hitler came to 
power, is obvious from even a cursory examination of its primary texts. The 
four horsemen of the school were music critic Theodor Adorno, psychologist 
Erich Fromm, sociologist Wilhelm Reich and professor Herbert Marcuse. Their 
ideas, echoing through the halls of academia and from the ink stained hands 
of writers and journalists, would lead to, as Buchanan calls it, the 
establishment of today's politically correct catechism.
The original strategy to destroy America, employed by the Frankfort School, 
came from Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci who realized that in order to 
achieve a Socialist victory, cultural institutions would have to be 
infiltrated and subverted. Gramsci realized that America, steeped in 
traditions of freedom and liberty, would never to succumb to a frontal 
assault and its workers were too busy accumulating capital to allow 
themselves to be used as cannon fodder for a bloody revolution.
Theodor Adorno
The Frankfort School would patent the familiar "Critical Theory" which was 
accurately defined by a student as the "essentially destructive criticism 
of all the main elements of Western culture, including Christianity, 
capitalism, authority, the family, patriarchy, hierarchy, morality, 
tradition, sexual restraint, loyalty, patriotism, nationalism, heredity, 
ethnocentrism, convention, and conservatism." Under Critical Theory, 
anything emanating from the west is to be libeled and attacked over and 
over again while at the same time, anything emerging from a "progressive" 
country or group is to be applauded including the murder of over 100 
million people. All blame for societal and economic ills are to be shifted 
to the west.
The saturating drumbeat of Critical Theory would lead to "Cultural 
Pessimism" which is when a person grows to loathe the society, which 
nurtured him and provided him unprecedented levels of success. This 
describes the attitude of so many leftists living in comfort and safety yet 
viewing America, the society that made their lifestyle possible, with 
hatred and contempt. I am amazed by the degree in which both Critical 
Theory and Cultural Pessimism has been internalized by all of us.
Erich Fromm's "Escape from Freedom" and Wilhelm Reich's "The Mass 
Psychology of Fascism" and "The Sexual Revolution" are central texts of 
Critical Theory according to Buchanan, who also calls "The Authoritarian 
Personality" by Theodor Adorno the "altarpiece of the Frankfurt School." 
Adorno's thesis is that anyone imbued with middle class, conservative, or 
Christian values is a racist and a fascist. Charles Sykes, senior fellow at 
the Wisconsin Policy Research Center, says Adorno's book is "an 
uncompromising indictment of bourgeois civilization, with the twist that 
what was considered merely old-fashioned by previous critics was now 
declared both fascistic and psychologically warped." This libelous 
indictment of the American people is comparable to Hitler's equally 
libelous indictment of the Jews of Europe.
Wilhelm Reich
The Frankfurt School introduced the idea of psychological conditioning as a 
means of changing the culture to fit their image. This would largely 
replace the traditional American approach to learning which was rational 
philosophical argument. Buchanan calls this the root of the "therapeutic 
state" where "sin is redefined as sickness, crime becomes anti-social 
behavior, and the psychiatrist replaces the priest." To Adorno and his 
comrades, all Americans who refused to conform to the new morality were 
viewed as mentally ill and in need of treatment. The Soviet Union offers a 
clear example of this philosophy in action with it's millions sent to 
gulags for "mental" maladies such as "anti-social" attitudes.
Herbert Marcuse
The forth horseman, Brandeis professor Herbert Marcuse, was the pied piper 
of the sixties as he fostered the development of, as Buchanan points out, 
"radical youth, feminists, black militants, homosexuals, the alienated, the 
asocial, Third World revolutionaries, all the angry voices of the 
persecuted 'victims' of the West." In "Eros and Civilization" Marcuse 
encouraged sex and drugs and introduced "polymorphous perversity" where all 
moral and cultural order is rejected. Marcuse coined the slogan "Make love 
not war" and was a cult figure on College campuses. His book "i" advocates 
educational dictatorship. He calls for "Repressive Tolerance" which means 
"intolerance against movements from the right, and toleration of movements 
from the left." When the left speaks of tolerance, this is what they mean.
The Frankfurt School would mainstream the dicktat of the Moscow Central 
Committee laid down in 1943. This declaration, right from the horse's 
mouth, illustrates exactly what were up against:
"Members and front organizations must continually embarrass, discredit and 
degrade our critics. When obstructionists become too irritating, label them 
as fascist, or Nazi or anti-Semitic...The association will, after enough 
repetition, become 'fact' in the public mind.
