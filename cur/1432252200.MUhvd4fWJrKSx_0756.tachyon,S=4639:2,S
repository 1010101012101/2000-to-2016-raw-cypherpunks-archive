I'll bite this one.

Anarchy won't work unless _everybody_ cooperates in good faith.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  It is more likely that a state of actual anarchy would result
in a minor restructuring of the democratic pattern of two wolves and a sheep
deciding what to have for dinner.

Ideally, intellectual property (or more properly, knowledge) would always be
in the public domain.  For that to be viable, something, perhaps a gift
economy, would have to replace currently competing systems.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  Too many people enjoy not only the simple material benefits of
capitalism (to name one), but more importantly, the power which it gives them
to manipulate their environment to suit their will; and which includes, of
course, people.

Patterns of domination and so forth are obviously far too deeply ingrained in
the human psyche to make viable any meaningful change towards flattening
somewhat bottom-heavy wealth and power hierarchies.


We now return to the ongoing coverage of the American Anthrax Attack.
