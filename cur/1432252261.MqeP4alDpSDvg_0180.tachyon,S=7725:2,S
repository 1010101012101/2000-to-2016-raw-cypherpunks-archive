The interesting thing about this is the new crackdown on non-classified
information in the private sector under the umbrella provision "persons in
other organizations that support DoD." Of course each contractor has the right
to set what's acceptable and what isn't from their employees in terms of
talking to the media etc., but the way the Wolfowitz policy is being
implemented in certain quarters really takes it to a whole new level. To my
mind, either information is classified or it isn't. Preventing leaks is one
thing, but why private citizens who happen to do THINKINT on terrorism--for
example--should be silenced and subjected to these harsh new provisions is less
than obvious.

Wolfowitz, Calling For "Great Caution," Limits DoD Employees' Discussions

Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz has forbidden all Defense Department
employees from talking about their work in common areas and public spaces, on
unsecured telephones or networks, and while commuting to and from work.

In an Oct. 18 memo, Wolfowitz says U.S. military and civilian lives, as well as
DOD operations, facilities, resources and critical information, are "at risk
for an indefinite period" following the terrorist attacks against New York City
and Washington, DC. He cites the national emergency President Bush declared
Sept. 14 and the military's contribution to "wide-ranging efforts to defeat
international terrorism" as putting DOD's places and people at risk. The memo
is addressed to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, service secretaries,
top leaders in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, directors of defense
agencies and several other senior DOD officials. The guidance also applies
to "persons in other organizations that support DOD."

"We must ensure that we deny our adversaries the information essential for them
to plan, prepare or conduct further terrorist or related hostile operations
against the United States and this Department," the memo states. Wolfowitz
directs employees not to discuss their work where they could be overheard by
anyone outside the department, and he cautions against releasing much of the
information DOD uses to conduct its business.

Using italics for emphasis, the deputy secretary's memo says it is "vital that
Defense Department employees, as well as persons in other organizations that
support DOD, exercise great caution in discussing information related to DOD
work, regardless of their duties.

"Do not conduct any work-related conversations in common areas, public places,
while commuting, or over unsecured electronic circuits. Classified information
may be discussed only in authorized spaces and with persons having a specific
need to know and the proper security clearance," states the memo.

Wolfowitz says even unclassified defense information, which usually is subject
to far fewer restrictions and oversight, may require protection "because it can
often be compiled to reveal sensitive conclusions. Much of the information we
use to conduct DOD's operations must be withheld from public release because of
its sensitivity. If in doubt, do not release or discuss official information
except with other DOD personnel."

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said today the release of any classified
information about the military's actions in Afghanistan and against terrorists
worldwide could threaten the lives of U.S. troops and the results of the
military's actions abroad. He called the disclosure of operational information
to the news media last week prior to U.S. special forces' arrival on the ground
in Afghanistan "terrible" and "irresponsible" and said it is a violation of
federal law.

"We cannot and will not provide information that could jeopardize the success
of our efforts to root out and liquidate the terrorist networks that threaten
our people," Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon press briefing today. "To the extent
that the Taliban and the al Qaeda know the goals and the purposes of our
operations, they will be in a better position to frustrate those goals and
those purposes. It is not in our country's interest to let them know when, how,
or even why we're conducting certain operations."

Wolfowitz directs in his memo all major DOD components to review the
department's "operations security program" and to "ensure that their policies,
procedures and personnel are in compliance" with it.
