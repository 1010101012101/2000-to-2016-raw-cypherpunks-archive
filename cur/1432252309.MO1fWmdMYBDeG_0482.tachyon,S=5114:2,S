if this is true ($100K to launch) I'd help defray some of this cost just as
a mechanism to distribute/manage my own keys.  but i suspect the satellite
itself is pretty expensive.  when I looked into this a few years back the
annual management of a satellite was about $250K.  I assume it's less
expensive now?  also key management can be handled from the ground pretty
well.  i wouldn't use the satellite as the source of the key, i'd use it as
a kind of reflector instead.

instead of launching a dedicated satellite why not rent time on several
existing satellites and use them as reflectors?  it's a lot less expensive
and key management can be handled from the ground.

Look into experimental rocketry and 'can satellites' (there's a link on /.
about the later). The cost to put a bird in space is probably around
$100k right now.
