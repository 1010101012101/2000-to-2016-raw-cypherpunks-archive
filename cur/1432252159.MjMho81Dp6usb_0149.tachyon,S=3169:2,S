What's your application, exactly? A rocket? 

I don't know about rapid decompression, but one problem is
with the disk drives - the heads rely on entrained air to
maintain separation from the disk surface. Most drives are
not hermetically sealed, and have a (filtered) port to the
outside to equalize air pressure.

Some drives *are* sealed, and will operate at low pressure.

I've seen this issue disscussed in the context of computers
and laptops at high-altitude astronomical observatories:
most machines will suffer head crashes if you try to use
them at > 10,000 feet (jets maintain an internal pressure
altitude of about 5,000 feet). 



Some applications use solid state drives to get around
this:

Some displays may also be a problem. This is more an 
issue for big plasma displays. Sony makes a special 
plasma TV for high altitude use:

A useful article is at

You might want to look at the Itronix GoBook Max.

This device supposedly meets MILSPEC:
http://www.dtc.army.mil/pdf/810.pdf

which is a USG survivability spec. It includes an explosive decompression
test, but not to high vacuum.

...and of course, all this gets pricy.
