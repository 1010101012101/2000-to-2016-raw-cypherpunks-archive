The list should be coming back on the air of the next few days. I'll
be approving a large batch of recent posts in a few hours, and then
most of the rest next Tuesday. (Don't expect new posts to be approved
over the weekend, though I'll do it if I can get to it.)

sound overly Sirius Cybernetics about it...
