        [Image]Business Summary                          [Image]

         [Image]Imark Corporation is a diverse multi-media
                company that is based in Toronto, Ontario
        Canada and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
        Imark’s business units are currently active in four
        distinct communication channels: Business-2-Industry
        (B2I) on a virtual private satellite network,
        distribution and audio content delivered over the
        Internet, books on tape and television production.

        eHighwayman.com is a B2I (Business-to-Industry)
        solution, being developed with Computer Associates to
        address trucking industry issues that relate to
        managing a mobile, geographically dispersed work
        force.

        Audioeverywhere.com is a division of Imark that
        delivers digital audio content on demand.

        DH Audio is a provider of books on tape and Imark’s
        signature unit as the company’s first business
        endeavor.

        Imark also operates Animazing Entertainment, which
        produces and distributes the ‘The Swamp Critters of
        Lost Lagoon™’ children’s television programming.
        Animazing also provides live ‘Critters’ characters at
        two U.S. theme parks and sells Swamp Critters
        merchandise.


        [Image]Brand Names and Business Units            [Image]

         [Image]eHighwayman.com is a business-2-industry
                virtual private network.

        eHighwayman.com will provide a complete and
        comprehensive, Web-enabled, private-satellite-network
        designed for truck drivers, fleet owners/operators and
        others in the transportation industry. The eHighwayman
        communication portal will allow users to access and
        retrieve critical information, download audio, enhance
        their safety knowledge, expand fleet-to-driver
        communication and reduce driver turnover. Imark is a
        leader in marketing fixed media audio content to the
        trucking industry and a synergy with its audio business
        will give truckers enhanced access on the eHighwayman
        site.

        eHighwayman.com will provide Web-enabling services
        through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which will be
        designed and deployed with the best of breed technology
        partners. This will allow Imark to provide its product
        and services in a two-way, secure environment to its
        customers.

        Strategies and Objectives for eHighwayman.com

        eHighwayman.com will target fleet operations, primarily
        in the U.S. and will provide truckers with critical
        information such as road conditions, weather forecasts,
        hazardous materials regulations, driver safety data,
        communications with fleet managers, message boards and
        chat rooms in addition to personal and entertainment
        content.

        eHighwayman.com will be a complete, one-stop portal
        that provides truckers with the latest hourly
        information and day-to-day updates. The site will
        enable truckers with real-time access and provide them
        with intelligence to specific changes that affect their
        business day.


         [Image]Audioeverywhere.com is in the beta development
                stage to deliver audio content on demand.

        Audioeverywhere.com is a functioning site that
        leverages Imark's existing business infrastructure,
        content and customer relationships while capturing
        additional value in the supply chain by avoiding the
        cost of physical distribution to the consumer. This
        model will provide access to content and the
        gratification of immediate delivery.

        Strategies and Objectives for Audioeverywhere.com

        Audioeverywhere.com will act as an "audio hub" for
        niche target markets, providing specific content to
        each market and will also supply audio to the different
        portals, which Imark will develop with its technology
        partners. The audio hub enables Imark to provide it's
        own content as well as others to customers through
        either hand held portable audio download players such
        as the Diamond Rio 500 and the RCA LYRA or through the
        recently announced iRadio from Motorola.


         [Image]DH Audio offers more than 1,400 audio titles on
                tape and CD.

        DH Audio provides “Books-on-Tape” to thousands of
        listeners and regularly posts a positive annual revenue
        growth rate. DH Audio has strategic alliances with
        Harlequin Enterprises and Bloomberg Press and is well
        represented in categories such as mystery, westerns,
        science fiction, romance, action adventure, humor,
        women's fiction, classics, and cast radio productions.

        Strategies and Objectives for DH Audio

        DH Audio consistently adds to its product line and
        offers its audio titles both in standard retail outlets
        and in unique, market-niche environments. Imark has
        established direct synergies between its DH Audio unit
        and all of its other business units in varying
        capacities. The company continually seeks to build on
        its audio library and take advantage of marketing its
        product-line through other Imark units.


         [Image]Animazing Entertainment Inc., is the owner of
                the licensed rights to
         The Swamp Critters of Lost Lagoon™.

        The key creator behind Animazing Entertainment is
        singer/songwriter/director Bobby Goldsboro. Mr.
        Goldsboro originated "The Swamp Critters of Lost
        Lagoon™" characters and musical TV series out of a
        search for wholesome, values-based children's
        entertainment. Imark has produced a total of 52 ½ hours
        of episodes, which air five times a week on the
        Inspirational Network reaching 30 million television
        households. A further 3.5 million households are
        reached as the series airs in both English and in
        Spanish on the Sky Angel Satellite Broadcasting
        Network.

        The show quickly gained a distinctive broad identity
        both because of its content and Mr. Goldboro's
        distinctive musical talents as song composer as well as
        writer and director for the series. The show was also
        awarded the Seal of Approval from the prestigious Dove
        Foundation, which identifies and promotes quality
        programming suitable for family viewing and was also
        awarded The Parents Choice Gold Seal for quality family
        content.

        Animazing Entertainment has also signed a licensing
        agreement with Jazzland Inc., a national-level,
        140-acre destination theme park developed by theme park
        giant Ogden Entertainment Inc. Jazzland opened in New
        Orleans on May 18, 2000. The Jazzland deal will build
        on the Swamp Critters brand recognition, as the
        characters will be interactive with the expected 1.8
        million park visitors per year.


        [Image]Corporate Strategies                      [Image]

        Approximately 90 percent of Imark's revenues are
        derived from the United States. Imark’s central
        marketing efforts are U.S. based and the company
        intends to apply for trading representation on a U.S.
        stock exchange.

        Imark's mission is dedicated to delivering its products
        at below-competition prices to audiences that are
        carefully defined and meticulously targeted. The
        company adopted a growth strategy last year that has
        established it’s positioning this year. Imark is poised
        to make use of the newest digital technologies in a
        manner that will maximize value and convenience to its
        various constituencies of customers while minimizing
        distribution costs to the company.


        [Image]Management & The Board of Directors       [Image]

        Imark’s management and Board of Directors offer an
        extensive and diverse background. The board consists of

        telecommunications, information technology and
        marketing. Brian Neill, President, CEO and Director,

        and a leading provider of direct-to-home television
        services in Canada. In 1998 Mr. Neill was nominated for
