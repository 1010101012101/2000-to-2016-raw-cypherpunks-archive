Today, there was yet another manufactured scandal involving the media. =C2=
=A0Apparently Trump
made a comment about Hillary Clinton and the NRA, which the mainstream medi=
a is portraying
as some sort of a threat against her. =C2=A0No doubt that media is unaware =
of the Supreme Court
case Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), =C2=A0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand=
enburg_v._Ohio=C2=A0 =C2=A0 According
to Wikipedia, this=C2=A0decision held that "The Court held that government =
cannot punish inflammatory
=C2=A0speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to i=
ncite,=C2=A0imminent lawless action.
=C2=A0Specifically, it struck down Ohio's criminal syndicalism statute, bec=
ause that statute broadly
=C2=A0prohibited the mere=C2=A0advocacy=C2=A0of violence."=C2=A0
This decision has never been overturned, although there are probably many s=
ubsequent cases, mostlydistrict court and appeals court, which cite it. =C2=
=A0This decision is important to me especially: =C2=A0I wrotemy Assassinati=
on Politics essay, and because of Brandenburg I am supposed to be Constitut=
ionallyprotected even if I advocate violent crime, unless it will involve "=
imminent lawless action", such asa riot.
I think the mainstream media (MSM) should be flailed (figuratively speaking=
, of course!) for"interpreting" Trump's statement, choosing the interpretat=
ion they conclude will be considered most=C2=A0outrageous, and then pushing=
 that as if it is somehow accurate and relevant. Do they ever do thatfor hi=
s main opponent, Hillary Clinton? =C2=A0Not very often, if at all.
Another thing that should be done is to criticizing the news media for impl=
icitly valuing HillaryClinton's life higher than that of other people. =C2=
=A0While it may seem odd to value a life, courts do thisfrequently, often i=
n the context of a civil lawsuit based on a wrongful death. =C2=A0For examp=
le, ifa life is 'worth" $100,000 per year and actuaries can state how much =
longer than life would last, say 30years, if that person wrongfully dies, t=
he damage is 30 x $100,000, or $3 million.
If, when elected, Hillary Clinton will waste, say, $500 billion per year, t=
hat amounts to theequivalent of: =C2=A0 $500 billion/$3 million, or 167,000=
 lives per year. =C2=A0The kind of people who would criticizeDonald Trump's=
 "NRA" statement involving Hillary would presumably claim that all human li=
fe isequal in value: =C2=A0If they really believe that, they should realize=
 that they must not value Hillary's lifeover that of a typical citizen. =C2=
=A0How does the value of 1 life compare with 167,000 lives, the latter in=
=C2=A0each year over four years? =C2=A0(No doubt that others will believe t=
hat Trump will also waste money;=C2=A0however, the numerous examples of new=
 spending Hillary has proposed would have to result in=C2=A0huge tax increa=
ses, or at least enormous deficit spending, which is merely delayed taxatio=
n, or inflation.)
I believe that the public should be able to protect themselves against corr=
upt and incompetentpoliticians. =C2=A0Naturally, those politicians won't ag=
ree.
