No, but to shut them down you have to know where they are, and to make
your intent known to operators of such.

The remailers could reside in a state with a weak mutual enforcibility
(Eastern Block successor states, Israel, developing countries). The
remailers could be physically hidden in a large facility (of course, you
could always whip up a firewall filter blocking them), or be connecting
via 802.11b and successors. The remailers could be packaged as part of a
well-behaved worm, thus overwhelming detection and enforcement
capabilites.
