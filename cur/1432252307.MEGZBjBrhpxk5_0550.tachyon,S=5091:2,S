No, neither I or you have consented to any such thing. What I have done is
given permission to other CDR nodes to forward it to their subscribers.
Nothing in that consent can be implied to make it 'public domain'. I
haven't given them permission to archive it or otherwise use it outside of
that. At no point have I or any subscriber through SSZ given the
subscribers ANY permission to use it other than personal or educational
use. If they wish to use it for commercial gain then all rights still
revert to the original author.

See Section 17, Chapter 2, Section 204. Where is your 'instrument'? The
wording prevents 'implied' instruments since they can't have a
'signature'.

Chapter 1, Section 111 and Chapter 5, Section 512 applies to the CDR
operators themselves for example. There are other sections as well that
apply.

Depends on how long the message was.

Nobody, other than Declan, you, and other reading inhibited, is claiming
this.

Actually not most likely. The articles were not meant in any sort of
'commercial use' and forwarded only for 'educational' purposes (ie 'fair
use' to foster debate) as I only forwarded single articles and not entire
source content from the originating sites.

Had I known I could create even more bitching by forwarding just the URL's
I would have been doing that long ago.
