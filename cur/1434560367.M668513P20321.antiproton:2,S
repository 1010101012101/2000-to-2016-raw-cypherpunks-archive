When no straightforward reason for a government's foreign political
actions is evident, nor becomes evident over time, and this lack of
sanity evidences itself decade in, decade out, then what legitimacy
can said government truly have besides "might is right"?

"Tim," your rhetoric speaks loudly.

Perhaps a bit more reading for you? Or do you really intend to back
that the USA is the principled, honourable, fair and reasonable
example we (the rest of the world) should all be drinking from?

Nope. None here. Feel free to try some form other then sarcasm -
perhaps empathy, or rationality..

What I see is a world where the power players (lead by example
principally by the US since WWII) cause/foment much human strife
around the world.

Governments/ "other countries" are "pretty good at digging their own
graves" you say? My, what big rationale you have...

I missed the part where the US still holds the moral high ground?
Seriously ... I missed that part. I get that it might be difficult
looking out from within...

I so -want- those who hold power to live to a higher "moral" standard
- hell, any standard that we "mere peasants" (like, what the fuck
would we know?) can perceive consistently as being worthy of some, or
any, admiration.

I find the world a rather sad place, in far too many ways. It saddens
me greatly that the United States of America has sacrificed her
international good will to such an extent as is the case.

Expect hope and empathy from me, but no sympathy.  Individual humans
must wake up, and begin to take individual and human stands. Stands of
compassion, justice, principle.

Please. To the best of your ability, take the words of your founding
fathers to heart. Live as best you can in the heritage that was
intended for you. And encourage as many others to do likewise.

I suspect significant turmoil in the years to come, and I do not envy
any one who must suffer such consequences.  It's just a hunch I have.
When power fails and the lights go out, people get scared of the dark,
of the uncertainty.

Everything has cycles, nations no less.

Good luck, you (and the whole world) may need it,
Zenaan
