This is not concrete, it is flawed.

You(!) first have to demonstrate that people and nations operate on the
same rules and laws.

They don't...

<PLONK>

Further, your 'distinction' actually begs the question in that your
example was built to lead to your conclusion.

<PLONK>

Further, you need to demonstrate that A's ONLY(!!!) offense is blocking
the driveway AND that that act did not itself perpetuate another event
which COULD lead to an unintentional death or murder. Why was A blocking
the driveway again?...
