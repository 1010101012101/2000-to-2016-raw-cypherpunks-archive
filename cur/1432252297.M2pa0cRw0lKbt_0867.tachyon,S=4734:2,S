Marcel - did the original posting to the mh_mirror or freenet-chat
lists indicate where the article was from?  If you removed it,
could you send me the originals?
It looks newspaperish, but doesn't indicate (AP) or (NYTimes) or whatever.
If it's a newspaper that takes replying letters to the editor,
or at least to the author, it deserves a reply.

The reason I ran a remailer was that it 
we can prevent violent people from telling others what they 
can and can't say, whether those violent people are
spouse-beating individuals or citizen-beating governments,
and any one person in the world can stand up to all of them.
That doesn't mean it won't be abused (of course it will,
and I eventually took mine down because of abuse, 
as most remailer-operators have), but we don't have to put up
with violence any more.

Yes, and if they worked, there wouldn't be a need for a 
National Coalition Against Censorship :-)
