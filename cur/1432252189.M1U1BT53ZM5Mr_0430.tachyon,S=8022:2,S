there are variations... i am afflicted with the contagious and acute
Entropus Major virus.  and now, any crypto system of which i am not
able to see the input randomness, by precision jitters or max rate
sampled freewheelers, or even that crazy faraday'ed up leadzone with
Geiger counter she told you about at BSides,

but hide that sweet sweet river of unrelated bits behind a bytecode
block??  that's just not cool!

until then, i've "borrowed" Peter G's d20's for a bit - hope he
doesn't need to roll them any time soon.
 ;P

i never considered prohibition as constraint on state of mind in public,
mainly thinking along monetary and covert economic activity angles.

but considering the public, and the multitudes of social scenes no
longer "lubricated" or under shadow of persecution, this would have a
direct and personal impact on many.

certainly a world removed from the producers and distribution
activity, which tends to monopolize the zeitgeist of the prohibition
era.

crypto-compromise as frantic inferno is not quite right.,
the impact is almost invisible, until it is dire and potentially life-ruining.

global compromise for ever-present surveillance is crypto-HIV
 sure, you're fine now.  probably a while, no concerning symptoms.

then OMGWTFBBQ punctuated equilibrium, over-reaction,
suddenly crypto-AIDS just ate your life and shat out
 terminal-solitary-confinement and/or financial ruin.

plenty of company with all the other susceptible individuals, more than
you imaged...  equally destroyed by a silent corrupter too easy to ignore

they call it "Tailored Access" and "Computer Network Exploitation" for
"enabling".
... when they aren't having the FBI violating domestic providers in
their NSL hole.

it's legit.



on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:
 "if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists"

NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.

so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal
bonafides judged according to public laws and applicable to all
persons on earth, not just tribal deference pointed inward.

the jury is out; there are encouraging signs... but first, back to
those raw samples!!

A much easier approach is to simply eschew safety altogether and use a
fixed AES key that's common to all chips.
