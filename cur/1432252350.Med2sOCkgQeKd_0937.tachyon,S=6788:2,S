Well, basically it's pretty simple. Someone will eventually recognize that 
the idea has a lot of economic potential and they'll go to Sand Hill and get 
some venture funds. 6 months later you'll be able to sign up for "Spam 
Mail". Eventually the idea will spread and Spammers, who are already 
squeezed via Men With Guns, will start running out of options and so will be 
willing to pay, for instance, 1 cent per email. After that, of course, the 
price will likely go up, except for crummier demographics that are willing 
to read email for 1 cent/spam.

Actually, this points to why Spam is Spam...Spam is Spam because it has zero 
correlation to what you want. Look at Vogue, etc...it's a $10 magazine 
consisting mostly of advertisements, but they're the advertisements women 
want. Pay-to-Spam will work precisely because it will force Spammers to 
become actual marketers, delivering the right messages to the right 
demographics..in that context the Price to send spam is a precise measure of 
Spammers lack-of-marketing savvy and/or information. Hell, if they're good 
enough at it they'll probably get women to pay THEM to spam 'em.
