I submit that if Joe Lunchbox is not spamming, he is unlikely to
need to change his habits regarding having his machine available
for a computational burden.  The mail he sends to people known to
him will not ordinarily trip spamfilters at the recieving end that
would make such requests.

Likewise, all the people who use remailers to send anonymously.  As
long as what they're sending isn't identifiable as spam, the remailer
won't get a CPU-time request.
