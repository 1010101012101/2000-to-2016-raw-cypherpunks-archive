"Wrong place at the wrong time."

This is the platinum defense Blackwater and the USG used to excuse
the murders. And the same used for any warfare collateral damage,
strategic bombing of civiians, WMD mutually assured destruction,
law enforcement killings, CIA killings, Mafia killings, drug kingpin
killings, husbands and wives killing of each other and their kids,
abortion killings, gun-lovers killings, slaughter of indigenous
peoples, military slaughter of all kinds -- why the very lament of
every killer who is caught red-handed, blood dripping with
body-armored thrill.

Indeed, this exculpation is taught in the drone operation schools,
top military academies, in special operations and covert operations
schools, in basic training to teach newbie killers to use force
against defenseless targets, in foreign policy universities and
think wankerages, in richest clubs of murderers gulping tankards
of blood-red wine toasting asymmetrical carnage of worldwide
finance, law and religion. Business schools most bloody-minded,
eminent domain and taxpayer subsidy for predation Course 101.

Millions of people have been, are, and will be, slaughtered by
this very rationale of repugnant cowards who are sexually
gratified by obliterating helpless creatures who happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even a small
percentage of the killers suffer this fate, but they are honored
with grotesques displays of bloodless sparkling uniforms,
weeping families, snoring encomiums of sacrifice, luxurious
caskets flag-draped, tooting of bugles and firing of rifles (!),
then dumped in the same ground as their hapless victims
to rot and be eaten by worms enjoying being in the right place
at the right time.
