Subject: [fc-announce] FC05 Preliminary Program Now Online
Sender: fc-announce-admin@ifca.ai
Date: Wed, 29 Dec 2004 11:37:27 -0500

The program and preliminary schedule can be found at:
   http://www.ifca.ai/fc05/program.html

   An official call for participation will be sent out as soon as
registration is open.  (We expect this to be early next week.)

   If you've yet to make travel arrangements, I would encourage you to stay
in Dominica on Thursday night (3/3) or longer to avoid a rush to the airport
after the morning program.  In the past, attendees who have stayed after the
conference have found that this is an excellent time to meet with others.
