Well, think positive because you're already screwed. If you have a
greencard, you're tax implications are the same (or have been for me
thus far) as a US citizen. if you have a green card, you can either give
it up (for the loss of legal tax juridsdiction of the IRS over you) or
get a US citizenship since you're already in their jurisdiction anyway.
