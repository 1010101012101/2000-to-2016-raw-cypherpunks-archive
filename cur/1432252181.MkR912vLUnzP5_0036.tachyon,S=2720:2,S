I've posted it before, here it is again.

Take the time to scoop into a separate file (simpletext?)
as flat text. Have the first line of the file be the URL,
and a blank line after that.

With Tcl installed, run this script:

Some sites, I think LATimes is one of them, also need
you to add a blank lines between the paragraphs first.

Take the 30 secs necessary to do this before posting
to the list.
