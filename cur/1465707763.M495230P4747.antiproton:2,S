Wonderful speech, Zenaan. Gives so much food for thought & actions...
In the past 4 days i have read so much powerful stuff from you... something
really great is going on in your head-heart-soul. DON"T STOP IT! :)

That's really great, Kurt. But Zenaan is asking WHY don't we
=E2=80=8B*=E2=80=8B*
* act*? Why do we live like SLAVES? and WHEN will we start putting great
words (like in the books you listed) *into ACTIONS*?

Knowledge is NOT ONLY about "knowing" it in brain, you know... It's about
incarnating it into actions =3D into ones physical life!

Even in this cypherpunk list, i believe there are 80% at least, who don't
need more "insights/education of how everything sucks and how one should
(at least try to) repair it".
*BUT*
as Zenaan says in his speech,- *self serving (egoismus) and self delusion*
get the victory over all our great intentions and insights.

*Cowards most of us.*
