Shortly afterwards the plane would have slammed into the ground because some 
idiot fired a gun on a plane. What's more, if everyone's free to bring weapons 
onto the plane I can see the terrorists carrying some pretty big guns

themselves and everyone in the vicinity away if there's a crime going on nearby.
