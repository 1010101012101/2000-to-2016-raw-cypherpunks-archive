Hardly.  One could put together a very slick "drop file here for
encrypted net storage"
script in a day.  One could even prototype this using any net mail
system like
Yahoo, albeit with a rather piddling storage capacity.

By including plaintext search tokens (meaning known only to you, perhaps
derived
from hashing keywords) you could use Gmail's search feature to find
stored data.

This uses local encryption and net-based storage & backup.  Sounds good
to me.

It would be rather telling if Google said "no encrypted email" wouldn't
it? :-)
