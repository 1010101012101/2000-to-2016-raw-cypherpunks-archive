What the hell...I see plenty of room for socializing-type talk, particularly 
if it's not inifintely removed from the concerns of the list.

Actually, in this case there was a subtext that was also of interest. May 
put 2+2 together and used publically available, easy-to-access search tools 
and was able to figure out what a secretive neighbor was doing. Makes you 
wonder if the TLAs really need to do much covert snopping these days.
