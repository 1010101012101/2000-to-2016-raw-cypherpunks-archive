The legislation will not be television.

Shjte, it won't even be published - it's so classified, not even the
president is allowed to read it.

First they came for the govmint, and I said nothing.

Next they came for the currency, and I said nothing.

Then they came for our freedoms, one by one, and each time I said nothing.

At hurricane Katrina they roamed the suburbs and demanded the guns,
and every house handed over at least one gun, rather loudly
proclaiming "you can take my gun from my warm and very much alive
fingers since I never had a real spine anyway".

Then they came for me...

Paraphrasing 'Atlas Shrugged'.
