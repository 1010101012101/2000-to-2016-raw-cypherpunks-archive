"In school yard politics this edge is normally a weapon
of some sort that can equalize the playing field (guns usually in the US, 
try going to an inner city public school for 2 years).  Saddam sees this and 
that is what let him to develop those WMD, to equalize against a superior 
foe / bully"

A good point from Mr Trei. I'd follow this up by saying that most kids, when 
getting that weapon, do not plan on using it, but hope that it's presence 
alone will act as a deterrent..."You c-c-can't push me around anymore 'cause 
I got THIS..."

At the very least, it changes the nature of the discussion at the bargaining 
table (this is precisely what Mao meant by "Diplomacy comes out of the 
barrel of a gun".

The problem with Saddam, however, is that he does have a track record of 
actually using such weapons, most notably with the Kurds (where he gassed a 
few 10s of thousands).

Not a great scenario, no matter how you look at it.
