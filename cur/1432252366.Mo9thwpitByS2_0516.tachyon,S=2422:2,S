Java is certainly an improvement for buffer overruns.  (The last estimate I
heard was that 1/3 of the penetrations were due to buffer overruns.)  Java
is still semi-intrepreted, so it is probably too slow for some
applications.  However Java is being used for server-side scripting with
web servers, where the safety of the language is a definite advantage.

Of course, when you cover one hole, people move on to others.  Server-side
Java is succeptable to SQL injection attacks for example.

Cheers - Bill
