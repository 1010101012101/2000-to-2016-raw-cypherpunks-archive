   from the papers-please dept.
   [1]NewbieV writes "The Washington Post [2]is reporting that "federal
   officials are developing government-wide identification card standards
   for federal employees and contractors to prevent terrorists, criminals
   and other unauthorized people from getting into government buildings
   and computer systems." The project is known as the [3]Personal
   Identity Verification Project, and is being managed by the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."
