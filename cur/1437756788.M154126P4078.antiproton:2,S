We were discussing this in chat.
Someone suggested "sooner or later sploits like this
will appear on black/gray sploits markets or even become
public". Then likely car accidents will go up and
maybe mainstream media will cry "car/hackers injure human"
(the other way is not news, it is statistics).

Won't sheeple think about their smart cars?

How will the stock go?

btw, Who are the owners/manufacterers of this jeep?
AMC?
