I'm far less concerned about Satoshi Nakamoto's ending up a trillionaire
than I am about central banks' ability to print money to enrich their
friends at will. It's also unrealistic to require that every alternative
currency that appears be able to absorb the entire world economy; why
can't a cryptocurrency just be one of many options available? I'm hoping
Bitcoin is even just one of many *cryptocurrencies*
available. Monocultures are fragile.
