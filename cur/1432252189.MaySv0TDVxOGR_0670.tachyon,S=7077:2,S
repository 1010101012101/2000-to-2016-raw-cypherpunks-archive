I'm not sure if many on this list recognize that the one such person, 
Patrick, replied to the "RE: Thanks for the living hell, and question about 
OpenSSL" thread yesterday.  His Lucrative, open source DBI, is the first 
serious cypherpunks mint/ewallet code produced since Pr0duct Cypher's 
attempt many years ago.  Unlike the earlier stuff, its object oriented and 
uses some of the most current middleware tools and techniques.  Those on 
the list who fashion themselves as more than armchair cypherpunks would do 
well to visit his site http://lucrative.thirdhost.com/ ,  join the 
Lucrative mail list and/or chat with him privately.

Patrick will soon have a configurable toolkit to create an "everyman an 
mint/underwriter" available soon.  Lucky has offered to provide offshore 
from U.S. hosting for test mint.
