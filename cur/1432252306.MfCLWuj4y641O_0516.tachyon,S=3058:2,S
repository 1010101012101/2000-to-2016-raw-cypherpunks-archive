Point of order: it's not at all necessary to use MIME in order to PGP
sign a message.

As far as the why: this is a carryover from the days of the LNE.com
node;  Eric's filter set was very popular and made for a very
maintainable node, and so I've continued to use it.

I suppose I might consider looking into making exceptions for
attachments with particular MIME types, but that's probably opening a
nasty can of worms.  Personally I'd rather forget that MIME exists and
continue to strip all of that crap.

Holy shit, I'm turning into Tim.  "MIME encrustations" indeed!
