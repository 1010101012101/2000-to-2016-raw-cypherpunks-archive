If that proves out, I'd say the US can now tell the Taliban, roll over
or be nuked, in accordance with long-held US policy. Same for any other
nation which assisted Osama bert Laden and his gang of merry thugs.

hasn't yet been tarred with the brush of incessant lying and bombing to
distract attention from his own shortcomings.)
