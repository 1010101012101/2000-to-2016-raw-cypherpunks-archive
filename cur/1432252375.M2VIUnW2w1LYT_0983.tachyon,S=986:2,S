Hello Royce

How about buying yourself a two Emporio Armani watches the same day? It's not impossible, mostly when you can get them for a couple hundred bucks
http://www.michneat.com

Get two deeply discounted watches and take an extra 15% discount.

Our Emporio Armani have all appropriate markings, wordings and engravings same as orginal.

Sincerely,
Mr Chacon
