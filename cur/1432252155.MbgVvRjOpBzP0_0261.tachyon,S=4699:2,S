   No, I am not confusing medical insurance with socialized medicine
   or anything else. I mentioned life insurance on purpose. That is a
   bet on when I will die, they bet later, I bet earlier. Money can
   be made - although never by me unless I cheat.

   Medical insurance is about maintenence of our lives. You do not
   need to participate, but I'll bet if you get hurt, you'll head
   to the nearest emergency room. The pool I speak of is simply that
   I may need the services now and you may need some later. We all have
   shared types of services and very specific service. I will most likely
   never need medical services for AIDS, but I have used them for broken
   bones. I will never need them for gyno or for giving birth services, 
   but I may need them for prostrate problems. We all use them when we are 
   born.

  Well, you probably don't need to explain the problems of socialized
  medicine, but I would like to hear about how you will do your own
  X-Rays or chemotherapy.

  Not any more. See life insurance. Also, please keep in mind that 
  insurance compnaies do not make their money from premiums, but
  from investments of all the premiums they collect and hold. Your model
  is not correct.

   This is a detour from my original proposition, but in answer to your
   question, you do not pay for rock climbing injuries. You pay for what
   you need and the rock climber pays for rock climbing risks. You may
   do something else risky or eat too many french fries that will cause
   a heart attack later. The rock climber will probably not have that
   heart attack. Opt out if you wish. I have opted out for a number of
   years by choice myself and have opted in as well.

   This scenario of testing for specific genes is already underway. Stay
   tuned.
