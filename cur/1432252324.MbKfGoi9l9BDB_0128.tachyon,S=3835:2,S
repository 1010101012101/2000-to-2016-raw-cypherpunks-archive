I don't think Castro is a bad guy either. Believe it or not but not 
everything that is not Freetrade made in America is bad.

Stalin has been dealt with. His empire has fallen. I am very well aware 
of the past. But my concern right now is the present and the future. 
Also, what you don't seem to get. This is not about Saddam, it is about

Ethics and morales are non negotiable. Either you have it or you don't. 
If you don't have them, fine, but don't pretend you act because of 
them.
