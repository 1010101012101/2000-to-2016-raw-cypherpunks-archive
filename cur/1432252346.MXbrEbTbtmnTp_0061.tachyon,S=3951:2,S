Technically ACTA could enter into force outside the EU when ratified by
its non-EU members. Politically it is cratered.

Commissioner Karel de Gucht argued the Commission would seek approval
("consent") again after an opinion of the European Court of Justice.
That won't happen, simply because the ECJ would probably dismiss the
case as the process is terminated, and even if they ruled it legal the
Commission couldn't reconsult.

That is the main step on the learning curve of successful Europarl
battles, a positive attitude towards representative democracy, escaping
defaitism. But we don't need insane campaigns for the impossible. In
early stages it takes very few persons and small resources. Four years
ago it was possible to put it asleep with approx. 10k and a bit
complicated technical voodoo.

What's hardly known is that this week, yesterday, the EU Parliament
strengthened the EU customs enforcement framework, the corresponding
element of the ACTA package in the acquis communautaire:

I sincerely hope people would not waste their capacity upon the INDECT
honeypot now.

Best,
Andri
