Any bench tech with access to publicly available documentation -
and the physical hardware - should be able to identify the RF
components in any automotive control system without too much
trouble.  ECM units are fairly well RF isolated, so those that
talk to the world should normally have easily identified
connections to external antennas.  High frequency transceiver
components usually have their own RF shielded areas on the board
as well.  Cutting one wire or IC pin per unit (antenna or IC
power) should isolate it from remote access.  If necessary
functions fail, undo the mod and try elsewhere until the desired
results are obtained.

In the U.S., getting hold of ECMs to play with presents some
inconveniences:  Junk yards pull ECMs and sell them back to their
manufacturers - some nonsense about "intellectual property" seems
to be involved - so there aren't many available on the open market
to play with.  But where there's a will, a few dollars and a small
pile of pointy tools, there's a way.
