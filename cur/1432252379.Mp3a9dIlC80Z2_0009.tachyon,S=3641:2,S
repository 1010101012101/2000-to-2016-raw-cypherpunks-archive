You can, there are at least two connectivity maps for the net out there.

It would describe the complexity of the equivalent graph. As the network
becomes more complex the routing issues become more complicated as the
number of potential paths increases. So the closer the fractal dimention
gets to 3 the more 'saturated' the network becomes with respect to
routing issues for example.

Admittedly it wouldn't be much use for the leaf node, but for those
managing 'common' services (eg name resolution) it would at least give a
model on which to base future expansion plans.
