Now take it in context.  Do you really believe that he didn't want people to
think he was instrumental from the beginning (since he created it) in the
Internet?  Or that he was simply another GC, working off an architects
plans?

I think people took it the right way the first time.  Sure, I agree its
importance is way overblown; I mean, name one politician who *hasn't* taken
credit for someone else's work.  But don't be an apologist.  If he wants to
run for president, he's got to deal with his record, just like kerry (did I
or didnt I throw away those medals) or bush (i know those national guard
records are here somewhere).

Yeah, he was in there on John Postel's CC: list for RFC evaluations.
