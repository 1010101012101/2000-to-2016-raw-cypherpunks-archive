If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, you are not alone. 
In fact, more than half of all men over forty have difficulties getting or maintaining an erection. 
This condition, called erectile dysfunction (ED), occurs with younger and older men as well, 
but there's a safe, effective and easy method of treatment: Viagra.

When the time is right, you'll always be ready.

 to and you don?t have to schedule your love making. 
You and your partner can relax and take time to choose the moment that?s right for you,
 whether it's right now, or later on. You've got time.
