you make lots of false dichotomies here, neglecting the variations in
exchange value between these possible altcoins and forks.

"will have nothing" is not correct.
  maybe a little, maybe a lot, but more than "nothing".

totally screwed - this is where the heated passions about a non-census
hard fork come in. lives on the line, in a not so exaggerated sense.

and by no means am i threating anyone with harm!  i am explaining that
when someone puts  the last half decade of their life and fortune into
a thing, messing with it will always generate inflamed arguments.
regardless of if you're ultimately right or not.

i don't care how you describe that messing, consensus or not, it's
poking in sensitive places all the same...

"not likely" - you're going to gamble livelihoods on a hunch that it's
not likely?

you can see why many are so reluctant - the due diligence is lacking
and the demeanor more experiment than careful transition...
