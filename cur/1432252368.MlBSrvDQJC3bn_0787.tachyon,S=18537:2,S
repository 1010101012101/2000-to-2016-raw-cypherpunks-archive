Concerned about a growing number of antitrust cases instigated by 
rival business firms, 240 distinguished economists signed an open 
letter to President Clinton that called for an end to speculative 
antitrust enforcement efforts. The ad, sponsored by The Independent 
Institute, appeared in the June 2, 1999, editions of The Washington 
Post and The New York Times.

AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON FROM 240 ECONOMISTS
ON ANTITRUST 
PROTECTIONISM

Dear President Clinton:

Antitrust is supposed to be 
about protecting consumers against higher
prices and other 
consequences of monopoly power.  Accordingly, the 
Justice
Department's Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade 
Commission, and state
attorneys general are vested with authority to 
defend competition and
protect the well-being of consumers.

The 
current spate of heightened antitrust activism seems to suggest 
that
anti-competitive business practices abound.  Headline-grabbing 
cases
against Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Visa and MasterCard, 
along with a
flurry of merger investigations now under way, would 
appear to demonstrate
the need for a vigorously enforced antitrust 
policy that will create checks
and balances to eliminate consumer 
harm.

However, consumers did not ask for these antitrust actions -- 
rival business
firms did.  Consumers of high technology have enjoyed 
falling prices,
expanding outputs, and a breathtaking array of new 
products and
innovations.  High technology markets are among the most 
dynamic and
competitive in the world, and it is a tribute to open 
markets and
entrepreneurial genius that American firms lead in so 
many of these
industries.  But, these same developments place heavy 
pressures on rival
businesses, which must keep pace or lose their 
competitive races.  Rivals
can legitimately respond by improving 
their own products or by lowering
prices.  Increasingly, however, 
some firms have sought to handicap their
rivals' races by turning to 
government for protection.

Where antitrust authorities respond to 
these protectionist demands, the
workings of markets are 
short-circuited.  Antitrust protectionism means
that market decisions 
about how to compete for consumers' favor are
displaced by 
bureaucratic and political decisions.  More of the energies of
firms 
are directed to politics, less to production and innovation. 

Successful innovators are penalized, scale economies are lost, 
and
competition is thwarted, not enhanced.  Instead of preventing 
prices from
rising, antitrust protectionism keeps prices from 
falling.

Many of these cases are based on speculation about some 
vaguely specified
consumer harm in some unspecified future, and many 
of the proposed
interventions will weaken successful U.S. firms and 
impede their
competitiveness abroad.  The cost-benefit test for 
antitrust has not been
met.  We urge antitrust authorities to abandon 
antitrust protectionism and
refrain from such speculative enterprises 
when actual consumer harm cannot
be shown.
