	Well, the scenario you paint is scary and looks a bit like
	science fiction. On one hand I do get your point. On the other
	hand I can't help but mention again that your
	iris-recognition-from-orbit can be defeated with $5 contact
	lenses. Other 'technologies' can certainly be more intrusive. 

	>The Smart Meter soon to be imposed 

	>Cars are soon to be mandated to implement

	Mandated by?...by jesus...or by the american government, which
	amounts to the same thing. 

	Anyway, all this is of course a political problem and so it
	requires a political solution. A solution that government,
	which is the driving force behind the problem, isn't going to
	provide.
