      Ah yes, the TVA -- wasn't that the bunch of fed assholes who stole
all the farms and homes of thousands upon thousands of American citizens
and at the same time taking away their livelihood, destroying the graves
of their ancestors, tearing apart old, old communities, all for the
purpose of .... hmm, of what? Flooding millions of acres of beautiful
land, creating environmental havoc over a large portion of Tennessee and
Kentucky as well as other states, drowning billions of animals?
      Wonderful, just wonderful --- and you want these cretins to do the
same things elsewhere -- only with nukes this time, eh? Great idea! I
got a better one ---
        Hey Tim -- here's another one that needs killin'.
