In labs an autoclave is used to sterilize everything.

Autoclaves are basically pressure cookers, high pressure steam at 121
deg. Celsius and ~2 Bar kill everything.

The effectivity of autoclaves is tested with spores from Bacillus
stearothermophilus, which is some of the most resistant there is, and I
suspect B. anthracium is quite heat resistant too, as most other Bacillus
species.

But I'd use a pressure cooker to kill the spores if I had the need (and
didn't have an autoclave, that is).
The paper probably wouldn't fall apart, though the ink might not be
readable after having been wet.


These things I know from having worked as a lab technician in a
microbiological lab once.

Have a nice day

	Morten
