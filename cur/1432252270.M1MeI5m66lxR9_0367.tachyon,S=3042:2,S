A colleague of mine just loaded a new root into IE, and pointed
out that when one does this, the new root is apparently BY DEFAULT
enabled for all purposes, including some interesting ones
like "Digital Rights" and "Windows System Component Verification."

I just tried this, and it appears to be the case.  (But I haven't 
yet tried to see whether Windows will happily use my root for these 
OS-specific purposes....)
