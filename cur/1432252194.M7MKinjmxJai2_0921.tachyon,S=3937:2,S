The push to do that should be aimed at the MTA authors and package
organizers.  If you can get it turned on by default, you're half way
there.  Last time I tried to fuck with this on qmail, I had to patch qmail
to support it.  Not something I'd like to do again - hopefully it's
changed a bit.  

>From 1st hand experience - it is indeed a pain in the ass.

But if you can get the big projects to turn it on by default for all/most
of the MTA's, then you can push the bigger fish to do so as well.  I'd
start with OpenBSD - they're likely to be friendlier to the idea.  Then
you can push FreeBSD, NetBSD, RedHat Linux, Mandrake, and so on...  Then
the MTA authors, then Solaris (which seems to be bent on copying whatever
Linux does) and so on....

Strangely enough, I recall that of all the entitites, out there MSFT had
implemented some sort of secure SMTP in somne version of IIS.. like
4.0...  Not sure about Exchange and its ilk...
