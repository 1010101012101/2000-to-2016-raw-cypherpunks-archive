     Where does it say in the Constitution or Bill of Rights that you
become a second-class citizen if you commit a felony? You might lose
the right to freedom for a period of time, but when that time is done
why are you still without rights? Who says you lose those rights, state
or fed? Has it been challenged? Seems a pretty bogus concept to me.
