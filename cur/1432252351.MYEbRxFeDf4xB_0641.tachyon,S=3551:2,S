me adverse to stiring up trouble?  I think you know me better then that
;-).  It's a good idea and I'm a firm believer in getiing the orient
involved in this.  there's alot momentum in the orient and asian countries
which I will definately take advantage of.  Another good region i'm
looking at is india.

Thank you for the heads up - appreciated.

regards
joe
