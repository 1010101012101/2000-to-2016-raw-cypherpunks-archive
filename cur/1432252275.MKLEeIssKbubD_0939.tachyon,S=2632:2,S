Removal of disguises  data fodder for CCTV

Clause 93 would insert a new section 60AA into the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994.  It  would allow police to remove any facial
coverings or disguises in a specified area for 24 hours following the
order of a senior police officer.  There is no provision for sensitivity
regarding religious articles.
