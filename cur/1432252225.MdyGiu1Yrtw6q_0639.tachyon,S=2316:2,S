   from the keeping-big-brother-out dept.
   quaker5567 writes "The Register is carrying the story that [1]Lycos
   Germany says it will no longer store dynamic IP addresses of its
   customers. According to the German Tele Services Data Protection and
   Telecommunications Act, ISPs are only allowed to store communications
   data for accounting purposes. Apparently, there is no requirement for
   German ISPs to keep a record of IP addresses. A decision by German
   ISPs not to keep logs on IP addresses would be extremely controversial
   as the entertainment industry is increasingly demanding that ISPs
   disclose the names of suspected file sharers."
