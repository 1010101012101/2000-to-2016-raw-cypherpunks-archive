[If you're not making a serious attempt at limiting access to information
about your on-line activities you're pissing into the wind.]

Officials in the UK are routinely demanding huge quantities of information
about what people do online and who they call, say privacy experts.

Police and other officials are making around a million requests for access
to data held by net and telephone companies each year, according to figures
compiled from the government, legal experts and the internet industry.
