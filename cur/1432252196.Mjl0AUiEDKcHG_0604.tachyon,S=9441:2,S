Cryptography followers are invited to attend this court hearing in
Washington, DC on November 4, opposing NSA's mass collection of
telephone records.  Observe government lawyers using twisted arguments
and new meanings of simple words to justify spooky outrageous
behavior!  Support civil rights attorneys using principled arguments
rooted in constitutional and societal norms to defend YOUR rights!
Perceive the wheels of justice or just-us grinding the constitution
into effect or into irrelevance!  Show the judges and the press that
the public cares whether NSA gets away with using totalitarian
methods!  See the constitutional issues around mass surveillance
actually be discussed in an open, public court that actually hears
from someone other than the government!  The good guys won this case
at the district court (the judge declared the NSA's actions
unconstitutional), and the government had to appeal it to stop the
ruling from killing off the program.  This case could be very
interesting, and these judges could make the final decision if the
Supreme Court decides not to review their decision.

Please be respectful, wear a costume (banker or politician duds
suggested), and arrive without contraband, weapons, penknives,
cameras, nor most other tools for resisting official oppression.
Bring either a lawyer (who can sign you in) or bring
unconstitutionally required identifying documents, or the US Marshals
at the door will not admit you to this "public trial".

I won't be there (wrong coast), but perhaps a DC local will organize a
nearby place to have lunch afterward and discuss the hearing.

Media Alert: EFF, ACLU to Present Oral Argument in NSA
Spying Case on Nov. 4

Court Should Rule That Mass Telephone Records Collection Is
Unconstitutional in Klayman v. Obama

Washington, D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
will appear before a federal appeals court next week to
argue the National Security Agency (NSA) should be barred
from its mass collection of telephone records of million of
Americans.  The hearing in Klayman v. Obama is set for 9:30
am on Tuesday, Nov. 4 in Washington, D.C.

Appearing as an amicus, EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn will
present oral argument at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit on behalf of EFF and the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which submitted a
joint brief in the case.

Conservative activist and lawyer Larry Klayman filed the
suit in the aftermath of the first Edward Snowden
disclosure, in which The Guardian revealed how the NSA was
collecting telephone records on a massive scale from the
telecommunications company Verizon.  In December, District
Court Judge Richard Leon issued a preliminary injunction in
the case, declaring that the mass surveillance program was
likely unconstitutional.

EFF argues that the call-records collection, which the NSA
conducts with claimed authority under Section 215 of the
USA PATRIOT Act, violates the Fourth Amendment rights of
millions of Americans.  Separately, EFF is counsel in two
other lawsuits against the program -- Jewel v. NSA and First
Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA -- and is co-counsel
with the ACLU in a third, Smith v. Obama.

What: Oral Argument in Klayman v. Obama
