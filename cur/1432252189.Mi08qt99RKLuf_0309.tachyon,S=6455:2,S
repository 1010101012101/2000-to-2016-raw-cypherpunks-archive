To wit, its download page is guarded by a long, non-free EULA:
http://uefidk.intel.com/content/minnowboard-uefi-firmware-eula
Some of the components also seem to be binary-only.

BSD-licensed TianoCore + heaps of binary modules that are currently
only available under NDA.
They'd also require some additional code (probably binary only?) to
make Tiano resembling something like a complete and secure
implementation.

coreboot is your only bet on x86 if you aim for open source firmware.
It can be combined with TianoCore to provide the UEFI APIs to the user
(read: Operating System), but TianoCore alone won't do since it lacks
hardware initialization drivers (that coreboot provides).

Personally, I wish people wouldn't wish for someone else to start
groups, but do it themselves for a change.

However that brings the risk of seeing that things aren't quite as
simple and might ultimately fail.
Of course, soapboxes and arm chairs are much more comfortable and
comparably risk-free.

"main open source distros" is not enough since it creates a gatekeeper
model. "Secure Boot" (which is really a Verified Boot) without
physical user override doesn't cut it.

ChromeBooks, using coreboot, provide a mostly* Open Source Verified
Boot model with physical user override (with two override modes: safe
via dev mode switch, and complete via jumper).

* (blame Intel)

tl;dr: Comparing coreboot, Lemote, UEFI and Tianocore isn't as easy as
people seem to believe.

Patrick
