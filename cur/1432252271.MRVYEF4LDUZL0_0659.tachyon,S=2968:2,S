And what happens when there's a network outage and a message gets stuck in
the queue for a day on another server?  You know a backup MX server when
yours is hosed?

Do you not accept the mail because the current day doesn't match what's in
the message?  Or do you accept mails from a day ago?  a week ago? a year
ago? 1922?

2nd, why wouldn't the spammer just adjust and send an email to each
recipient with a random, but properly hashed token to match the target
address + today's date?  More work for sure, but if enough targets start
adopting it, the spammer will adapt.  The token doesn't have to contain an
actual valid coin, and you'll only find out when you try to cash it.
