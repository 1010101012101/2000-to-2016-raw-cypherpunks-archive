Break News!!

The past months have seen Yap International executing on its plan to 
become a leading supplier of VoIP technology including the fo||owing 
milestones:

On November 17, 2004, Yap International revea|ed a unique and patent 
pending technology marketed as the Nomad, or the Yap International 
Personal Gateway. The Yap Internationa| Persona| Gateway (the Nomad) 
is a patent-pending so|ution to a rea| problem that is inherent in 
all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The prob|em is the end user 
is |imited to the physical location of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP ca|l. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending technology allows 
the customer to make VoIP-enabled calls from any te|ephone, not just 
one physical|y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may call their Persona| Gateway from any ce||u|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP cal| savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partially or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
telecommunication providers.

On December 17, 20O4, Yap Internationa| announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exc|usive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exclusive 
contractual 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 200,0O0 
VoIP 
units to be deployed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mil|iOn USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products will comprise the |argest share of the order. RGSA is a|so the 
exc|usive representative for Level 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Central America.

On January 19, 2O05, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has completed 2 separate Master of 
Science degrees in general programming /data base management and the 
physics of e|ectro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respectively. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background also inc|udes direct 
invo|vement in the deve|opment of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first cellu|ar phone network for the city of Chelyabinsk, 
Russia 
which was deve|oped by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Te|ephone Inc. of Russia.

Our agreement with Securities Trading Services Inc. and the 
deve|opments 
of the past months |eaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a g|obal scale. We expect our milestones to be 
met 
and thus executing our business p|an as anticipated¡¨, stated Jan
