If the server code were open, how would you know the server was actually 
running that code anyway? Having the protocol documented so thoroughly 
makes the task of writing an alternative server trivial if 
time-consuming. I'd obviously prefer the server were AGPL, and I hope 
someone will write an AGPL'd server and federation.

For now though, the client is open source, the crypto doesn't suck, the 
UX is excellent, and the threat model is pretty transparent. I'm *never* 
going to inflict PGP on friends, but I'll happily inflict this on them.
