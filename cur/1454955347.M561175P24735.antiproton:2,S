true!  last week i got back FOIA documents from DHS. it was the first
page of every classification guide they authored within the
department, guides which explain to those working with sensitive
information (even TS/SA, TS/ECI :) how that sensitivity should be
determined.

the front page also contains a list of superseded classification
guides and other deprecated materials - in turn useful for tracking
the lineage of surveillance and military programs within the
intelligence community.

and, the courts slapped down the FBI's refusal to hand over processing
notes for FOIA requests. this fabricated denial through a creative
interpretation was soundly rejected by the judge as outside scope of
FOIA statute itself. the Meta-FOIA lives on!

funny that FOIA restores faith in humanity, if ever so briefly... (^_^;)

first to global netwar win retains ever-after dominance?  perhaps an
ever more empowered individual gives world time; need only wait for
fight by the right watermeatbag to fill the role demanded...

i get what you're laying down.  i'm voting for Bernie too...  *grin*

there was a recent FOP leak, showing how union contract agreements
with municipalities and states force destruction of records indicative
of police misconduct.

certainly undetected corruption in rampant - who watches the watchers
conveniently empowered fully outside the legal constraints facing
every other citizen?

"Fighting a far more powerful adversary requires a completely
different way of thinking than dealing with one who has similar
capabilities to yours. "
 ^- this is also true!  however, you don't continue with a full
explanation of how to resolve this complication...  :)

indeed. i've enjoyed great conversation with people across every
corner of the political spectrum. there's more than enough common
ground to go around, if we can get past the habit forming narcotic of
outrage pr0n on media propaganda lambdas...

one side effect of such ideological purity purges in intelligence
community is the erosion of technical talent and capability. drunk
twice over on offensive suites too sweet for non-discreet, now is
reckoning with interest past due!


best regards,


[ maybe the forthcoming DoJ leak will shed more sunshine? ]
