So the interesting (and ominous?) question is which costs less:

1 mainframe

or:

10,000 distributed multi-terabyte hardrives to store 1 terabyte
of blockchain, and all the hashing power needed to secure the 
blockhain from attackers who can afford mainframes?


Second question:
Are you pricing in dollars or cryptocoins, cause it seems to
me you get divergent answers depending on which one you use.


Third question:
does the blockchain still work when it shuts down overnight
because the distributed power source sets? Or does control 
revert to the owners of the centralized power plants?
