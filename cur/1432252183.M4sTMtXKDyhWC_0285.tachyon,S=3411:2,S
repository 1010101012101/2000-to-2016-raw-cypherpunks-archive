EUISS: What ambitions for European defence in 2020, Jul 2009 From Wikileaks

September 3, 2009

Summary

This PDF file presents a 175-paged document entitled "What ambitions for
Europeans defence in 2020?". It was produced by the EU Institute for Security
Studies, an EU policy think-tank. The document covers long term EU security
strategy, including the problems of "hierarchical class society", with the
"elite" of the world on one side, and the so-called "bottom billion" on the
other. To avoid "global systemic collapse", the document suggests that the
"full spectrum of high intensity combat" to be used to protect what is called
"globalisers" from "localisers". Localisers, making up 80% of the world
population, include the "bottom billion", states in the Middle East and the
so-called "Alienated Modern States" like North Korea. Globalisers, notably,
include not only members of the OECD and "Rapid Transition Societies" like
China and Brasil, but also "Transnational Corporations"bthe "Fortune Global
1000".

In that context the paper elaborates on "barrier operations shielding the
global rich from the tensions and problems of the poor". It reads that "as
the ratio of the world population living in misery and frustration will
remain massive, the tensions and spillover between their world and that of
the rich will continue to grow. As we are unlikely to have solved this
problem at its root by 2020 - i.e. by curing dysfunctional societies we will
need to strengthen our barriers. It is a morally distasteful, losing
strategy, but will be unavoidable if we cannot solve the problems at their
root."
