         Do you seriously think that justifies suspension of due process? 
If you don't, why did you bring it up? That aside, I think it's been 
sufficiently demonstrated that you shouldn't treat people like collateral 
damage unless you wish to receive similar consideration...
         Did any governments that derive their being from the consent of 
the governed renege on promises to the 6000 in the WTC that they would have 
due process? Didn't think so. Work on one of the problems at hand, or shut 
the fuck up and crawl back under your rock, but either way, kindly refrain 
from further invoking emotion-laden irrelevancies. They get invoked more 
then often enough.
