I think Herr Hatch has a wonderful idea.... no really, think about it, all
of a sudden people will start THINKING about the security implications of
the garbage scumware they run on their machines and they'll have to
install things like firewalls and harderned operating systems.  

They'll also move out of Microsoft's paper-bag security of windblows in
droves.  Just to be able to run P2P clients and still remain secure, Linux
and *BSD's will become even more popular.

Even better think how wonderful the headline will be when some dork in the
army is running a P2P client on his work machine and the RIAA destroys
it.  Why that would be destroying and hacking into .mil property!  A
treasonous terrorist act against the government!

So RIAA will be in deep shit.  If some hospital drone does the same and
RIAA kills the machine, that's hacking and damaging a computer vital to
life support...  

The effects of such a law aren't all that bad. RIAA gets to die a nice
horrible death, as does Microsoft.
