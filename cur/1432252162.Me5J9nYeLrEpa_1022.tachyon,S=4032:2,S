Frustratingly, not in my experience.  Sure, the good guy (whoever you define
that to be) wins occasionally, but, as one supreme court justice put it, while
declining to free a clearly innocent convicted murderer because there was no
material error at trial: "The Constitution doesn't guarantee a correct
verdict, the Constitution guarantees due process."

Oh, really I'm just moaning out loud.  All such systems are imperfect by
definition.  The defining factor in the U.S. system is ex ante money.  The
victor usually spends the most up front.  (Though not always)  The defining
factor in Italy is political connections, the victor had the judge over a
barrel.  The defining factor in Mexico is ex post money (the loser buys his
way into an appeal or "escape.")

Choose your poison.
