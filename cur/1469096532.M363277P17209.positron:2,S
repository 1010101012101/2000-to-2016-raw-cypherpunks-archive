At this point, I'd settle for some disclaimers and warnings about
vulnerabilities, and links to resources for addressing them.

It ain't perfect, but it's better than nothing.

Not that simple. Maybe not "fancy", but there's a *lot* of data. And
when you look for correlation at such scales, false positives are a
*huge* problem.

I don't trust anyone :)

They did succeed in taking down the Soviet Union, by forcing it to
bankrupt itself and disappoint its population. But I think that they've
consistently fucked up in the Middle East. Generally, they focus too
much on short-term objectives, and set themselves up for eventual
failure. They count too much on brute force.

Short term, it's doing OK. Long term, probably not so good.

I suspect that the Chinese have pwned them hard.
