REQUEST SPEC SOONEST. IDEA RELAYED BUPERS SUBJECT APPROVAL COMMAND.


There are various synthetic languages, not the least of which is the 
form of "milspeak" used for quasi-literate military memos.

But of course people aren't going to learn new human languages for such 
an ephemeral and mostly useless reason as to hide their textual clues.

Kascinski got nailed because his rants were so long, running to many 
newspaper pages (as they were printed, at the FBI's request or his 
request, or both, I forget the details) and were filled with a lot more 
than just grammatical and stylistic clues: the rants had his political 
views, his analysis of history, etc. It's doubtful that K. would have 
had any interest in trying to write in some synthetic language, 
stripped of various stylistic choices and options.

Or that we would want to.

By the way, there was a book out a few years back by an academic who 
specializes in "forensic text analysis," e.g., analyzing the text of 
Shakespeare, Pynchon, etc. to do this kind of analysis. (He lived in 
Soquel, a town near me, and he analyzed letters by a "Wanda Tinasky" 
which were believed by some to be actually written by Thomas Pynchon, 
the famously reclusive author who, by coincidence (or not?) lived for a 
decade a couple of ridges over from me, in Aptos, also near Soquel. 
Small world. Google should turn up the author for those interested in 
finding the book.
