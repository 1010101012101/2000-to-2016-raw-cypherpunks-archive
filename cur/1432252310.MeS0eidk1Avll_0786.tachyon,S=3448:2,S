A nice essay, partially on the need to include technological protections
against human error, included the above paragraph.

IMHO, the problem is that the C language is just too error prone to be used
for most software.  In "Thirty Years Later:  Lessons from the Multics
Security Evaluation",  Paul A. Karger and Roger R. Schell
<www.acsac.org/2002/papers/classic-multics.pdf> credit the use of PL/I for
the lack of buffer overruns in Multics.  However, in the Unix/Linux/PC/Mac
world, a successor language has not yet appeared.

YMMV - Bill
