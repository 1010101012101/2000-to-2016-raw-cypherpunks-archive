	Depends on the soldier and the "war" they are fighting.

	Not all soldiers fight for honors, and some units 
understand/believe that certain fights in certain places are worth not 
getting all that much attention. I'm not saying that in *this* war that 
would happen, there is no need. The American public knows we are in this 
war, and they understand that there will be some casualties.

	Because in Korea and Vietnam we were fighting the enemies fight 
with largely the the same level of technology (yes, we had better 
technology, but not *that* much better).

	We are also fighting smarter these days.

	Not that I disagree much with this, but there is also the issue 
that the American public is much more sensitive to losses than in Korea 
or Vietnam. "We" are not  as naive as we used to be, and we don't trust 
Uncle nearly as much.

	This makes those at the top more careful about objectives and methods.
