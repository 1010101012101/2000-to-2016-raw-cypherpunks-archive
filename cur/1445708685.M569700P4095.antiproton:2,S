Dear travis

I am an anti feminist but i started feeling like a fucker saying mother
fucker all the time and ao i decided to call out the patriarchy of saying
mother fucker by saying father fucker which sounds really fucked up ... in
turkey i am yelled at for saying mother fucker and have had too many
conversations about it ... it is the worst thing you can say in turkish
language

Language is alive and i like to fuck it

Anymore questions?
