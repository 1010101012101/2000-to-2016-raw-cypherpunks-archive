I was living in Kenya during a general election there about 20 years
ago. (I could have voted but chose not to, so Daniel Arap Moi got in
without any help from me :-) If I remember correctly there was some sort
of dye used.  The general atmosphere of that election was, of course,
very different from a British one (I've never been in the US at election
time). The police, who were supervising things, get a lot less respect
and a lot more fear than ours do.  And the voters were (in the district
I lived in) almost all poor farmers who would be very unlikely to sue,
or even complain loudly, at any apparent misbehaviour from a government
official.  No doubt if you tried the same trick in the US someone would
claim that the dye was carcinogenic, or that the blotchy colour had
caused them to look bad at an interview & lose the job or something.

Doesn't have to be "high-tech", ordinary Indian ink would do (IIRC that
is just a fine suspension of carbon in water & a little alcohol?).
Anything that glows in the dark will lead to accusations about cancer.

And yes, if there are any white supremacist tunnel-rats reading this
from a secret sheep farm somewhere in Idaho,  black dye does show up on
African skin, even on the back of the hand.   I can't think of anyone I
know or meet regularly whose skin is actually black in colour.
