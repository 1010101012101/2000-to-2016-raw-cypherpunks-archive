Have there ever been any large-scale terroristic attacks where profit was
the only motive?

Bin Laden's organization has religious reasons. McVeigh had his own moral
justifications. I'm not sure we've ever seen such an action for a pure
profit motive. Can anyone think of examples?

Heh. Perhaps the suggestion that such terrorism could be stopped if
everyone were to be converted to Christianity wasn't such a crazy idea.

Nah. We'd have followers of Jerry Falwell attempting to smite San
Francisco.

That's a fool's wager. We will never know with total certainty whose work
this was.

I'm certain that our investigators will link these actions to bin Laden,
however. And I suspect they'll most likely be correct.
