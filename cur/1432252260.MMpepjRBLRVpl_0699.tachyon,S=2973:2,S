I've mostly been staying out of this stormy little teacup, but I'll 
concur that BU is overreaching himself. When he starts to claim 
that writing security software to best industry practices - erasing
sensitive data as soon as it's need has passed, clearing disks
and buffers, etc - all practices mandated for meeting certain
government FIPS levels, and widely documented as standard -
when he claims that writing programs correctly could get me
in trouble - then it's time to downgrade my estimates of his
knowledge and expertise.
