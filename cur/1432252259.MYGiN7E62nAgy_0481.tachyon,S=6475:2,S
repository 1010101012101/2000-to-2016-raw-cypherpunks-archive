Truly you have missed the point of the work then...

A battle which doesn't have to be fought is a superior strategy. Defeating
your enemies mind, versus his armies, is a superior strategy. Attacking
where your enemy isn't is a superior strategy.

Only a naive grognard would head for the main point of resistance given
any alternative at all (including waiting until another day).

Which is after all why(!) we have things like the 4th and 5th...

Keep this line of thought up and you'll be where I am, C-A-C-L doesn't
work because of human nature.

I can tell you haven't, wargamed that is. Always be unconventional, do
what your opponent doesn't expect.

I'd say you're certainly reaching. Oh, you're comment about 'can't see,
can't hit' isn't correct. The inverse, "What you can see you can kill" is.
Note that they are not equivalent (Hint: it has to do with your definition
of 'seeing').

Over what are we arguing? You've raised three seperate issues that are in
conflict in this example. Which one is futile? And if you think 'moral
indignation' doesn't have something to do with war then you truly don't
understand war.

Perhaps, but history is full(!!!) of examples where nations didn't do that
(consider Plan Orange & Plan Black and the verious strategies they
followed).

Actualy it isn't, the quote argues AGAINST your point, m'lady. There is a
difference between 'secure ourselves against defeat' and 'defeating the
enemy'. That disctinction cuts to the very core of your argument and
disembowels it like a Wakizashi.
