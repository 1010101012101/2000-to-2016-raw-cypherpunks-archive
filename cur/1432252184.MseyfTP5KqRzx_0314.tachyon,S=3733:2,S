In this case, yes.  When the program failed in the past it was usually due
to putting formally high rollers into dull middle class new lives.  They
were the ones who ended up outing themselves.  In contrast, giving some poor
wretch and his family $5 million would put them in the lap of luxury.

Anonymity does not require remailers much less untraceable digital cash.
I'm for both of those, but they are overkill for someone who turns in Bin
