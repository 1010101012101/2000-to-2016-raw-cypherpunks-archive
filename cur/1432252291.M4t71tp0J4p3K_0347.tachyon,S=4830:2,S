There are bits of infrastructure that the rest of us can set up, Amon.

The Zero State wants to use the Tor network to communicate, yes?  So,
let's set up Tor nodes.  All of us.

Not necessarily exit nodes or routers - not everyone's in a position
to do that - but to run a Tor hidden service you don't need to run an
exit node or router, just a Tor client.  Tor in client mode is
perfectly capable of making arbitrary TCP-based services available on
the Tor network, in fact that's how Torchat works.

There are some services we've been talking about for nearly a year
now, from a private link aggregator ala delicious.com to a distributed
software development and revision control system.  Let's set a few of
these things up as Tor services, spread the .onion URLs out of band
(i.e. not on this mailing list) and hammer on them.  For those of us
who use IRC, set up #zerostate channels if they don't exist already
(or join the ones that do) so we can have a presence.  Let's set up a
Tor-only Zero State IRC server, for that matter.

If you're involved in any projects (and a lot of us are) there isn't
any harm in stating that you're a member of the Zero State in addition
to being a dev on $project.

Again, practically all of us on this mailing list have projects
running in the background.  Let's collaborate on them.

Project Byzantium (my pet project) needs translators for the control
panel, the captive portal, and some other stuff.  We're refactoring
code right now but when we get i18n going I could really use some help
with that.  I'm willing to try out some transcranial
electrostimulation systems to see how well they work on my
non-standard neurology, plus I'm going to need to cram a few languages
for some overseas travel coming up, so I'd like to see if I can do an
"I know Kung-Fu" while under the electrical influence.

What else does everyone have?  What are we willing to put even two
hours toward on someone else's project?
