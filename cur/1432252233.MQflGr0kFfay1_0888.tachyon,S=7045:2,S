CHINA CRISIS!
I'm wondering whether China will use Linux for restrictive purposes - i.e. 
The Great Firewall of China ?

Perhaps they've found that Microsoft products are just too insecure for 
this purpose ? ;)
The German Government announced they will be switching exclusively to 
Linux. Chancellor Adolf Hitler declared Linux "the software of the 
Superman" and said that anyone caught using other operating systems will be 
imprisoned.
Microsoft Windows cd's and books on using Microsoft software have been 
publicly burned in ritualistic bonfires. A few resisters caught with 
Windows 98 on their hard drives have been beaten and tortured by the 
Gestapo, their pleas that "it was just for Counterstrike!" falling on deaf 
ears.
As of this writing, the computers that control the train timetables for 
transporting undesirables to death camps have been running Linux for three 
months now without a reboot.
