i'm curious how you use them.  care to share?

my two main uses for the C5P systems are loop-aes w/padlock and key
scrubbing for file storage and IPsec endpoints.

i'll use the entropy on the C5XL boards for key generation as well.

wow, i didn't think these were going to be ready till Q3.  did they
have any specs?  i'll look around today and see if i can find more
details.

yeah, i've been lusting after a dual proc board since they were
revealed back in Q2 '04.  perhaps the market just isn't there?  other
products announced later have made it into production before these SMP
boards...

the last 6-9 months seem to be a holding pattern of "working out the kinks".

i'm wondering if the Balance systems will be updated with a C7 when
available.  not a great laptop, but would work nicely as a crypto
accelerated endpoint:
