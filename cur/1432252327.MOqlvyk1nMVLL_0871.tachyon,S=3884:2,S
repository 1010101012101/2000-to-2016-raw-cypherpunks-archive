Supposedly, the tobacco companies have had commercial marijuana products 
ready forever (I've even seen photos, but I always suspected they were 
doctored up stoner's dreams).
The idea that the pharmaceutical companies would start actively researching 
new designer drugs is fascinating and scary...wait, scratch that "scary", 
because it can't be scarier than drug-related crime in the US.

The New York Times Magazine had a fascinating story years back on the US's 
marijuana industry. it's apparently the #2 export crop and US pot technology 
is in some cases extremely, uh, high. They described growers with strings of 
apartments in various US states connected with sesnors to the internet. If 
any of the apartments showed signs of entry, the grower would never return. 
(Each apartment supposedly had low levels of crops to fly under certain 
state laws if they were ever caught.) No doubt some of those growers are 
good customers of RSA products!
