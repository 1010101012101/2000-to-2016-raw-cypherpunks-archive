"All his social networks" being twitter? I have a LinkedIn somewhere, but I
don't publicize that.

I'm not sure what "sig" you mean. I don't have an email signature. On
that1archive.neocities.org ? Yeah, I have my contact information posted.

Of course, JYA also has his email and twitter posted there, but no
accusations about a profit based motive against him. No double standard
there.
