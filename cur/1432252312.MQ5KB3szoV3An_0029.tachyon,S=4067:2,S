The hologram trick is very interesting; could cause a lot of problems for
the adversary. Now the question remains, how to make a hologram within the
resources of a common person, to make the system suitable for wide use,
not only for a handful of high-tech geeks with closets full of
cutting-edge gears. Also, how to make sure the image got properly exposed,
so it couldn't happen that a mistake of the sender couldn't result in a
false alarm. (Maybe to develop part (half, stripe...) of the image and
then check under the red light, before using?)

The issue starts to look more complicated than it seemed on the first
glance. We have a resourceful adversary, who will quickly learn the
tricks. We need a low-tech technology that will be highly resistant
against undetected tampering by the adversary. Does anyone know if this
wasn't already being solved during the Wars, or the Cold War? I am pretty
sure many embassies had problems with adversaries going through their
diplomatic mail.
