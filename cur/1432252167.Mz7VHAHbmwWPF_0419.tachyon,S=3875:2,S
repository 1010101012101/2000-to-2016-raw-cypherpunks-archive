Agreed.  The port expander approach should be explored.  Also needed is 
WinModem control for smooth analog (clear) to digital (crypto) transition.

Several developers, including an ex-Starium engineer, and I have been 
talking about just such venture.  I sure between all of us we have the

Besides the half-duplex problem some changes to the SF protocol are desired
