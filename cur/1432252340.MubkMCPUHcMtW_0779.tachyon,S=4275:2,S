Which makes it no different from how telephone networks worked for
decades, in the pre-Caller ID dayze.

Time was, users were encouraged to contact the phone company immediately
after receiving prank, etc., calls. There is still no legitimate reason
to retain that data more than 90 days, if that long. Make it available
to the individual users and it is their responsibility to keep it, if
they want it. Feds stymied by that? It's because the victim on behalf
of whom they want to prosecute didn't keep records. Oops.
