 >>"the public responsibilities of >the press are a myth." It's entirely 
possible to reconcile that phrase >with the idea that a newspaper is a 
for-profit business.

Especially if your a two headed dog.I cant believe the crap assfluff,cheney 
and the drongo are putting over you people.
They tell you to fly ,fly, fly then warn you next day were all going to 
die,die,die.Of course its all a lie,lie,lie.
Assfluffs a stumbling peccary about to fall into the piranha pool.You can 
fool some people...
The lies about technology and the net remind me of wermacht soldiers at 
stalingrad giving a massive salute while saying
'the shit in berlin is up to HERE!"
