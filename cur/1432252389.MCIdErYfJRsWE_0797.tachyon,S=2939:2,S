No?

It gives the parent the right to tell other parties to leave the child
alone. It also means the parent has the responsibility of protecting that
child from harm, as the parent sees it.

As a business in a economic system, you have a responsibility to provide
products and services that the customer wants, not what you want. Not only
is the party a bad citizen, they're a bad economic partner as well.

What has lesbians kissing to do with a company selling adult theme games
to a 9 year old? Nothing. It's a shity straw-man.
