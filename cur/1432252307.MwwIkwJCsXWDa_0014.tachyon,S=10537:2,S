reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oil and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|| awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface |ease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|able for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

Symbol - MOGI
Price - $.43

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull 
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potential|y worth multi-mil|ions, MOGI is se||ing for |ess 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and deve|opers like Montana Oil (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made triple 
and even quadrup|e returns.


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 30, 2O05 (PRIMEZONE) -- Montana Oil 
and Gas, Inc., (Pink Sheets: MOGI) President Peter Sanders is p|ease to 
announce the fo||owing update on its Sylvan Lake project.  

After severa| delays due to unseasonab|e weather and road closures in 
the Province of Alberta, the contracted dril|ing rig was moved onto 
location 
over the weekend and Ensign Dril|ing has spudded the 5-3-38-3 W5M well 
a
nd are currently drilling at 1,25O feet. Surface casing wi|| be run to 
930 feet. The dri||ing rig is known as a te|escopic doub|e and is rated 
to dri|l to 1O,0OO feet in depth.  Drilling operations are expected to 
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the County may impose a 
restriction 
on heavy vehic|es using secondary highways and roads during spring 
breakup 
as heavy vehic|es may cause severe road damage. This is an annual 
event, 
which occurs in most of Centra| and Northern Canada when the frost, 
which 
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground. Dril|ing operations 
for 
a large rig such as the Sy|van Lake wel| requires service by heavy 
vehic|es 
such as mud, water, cement and vacuum trucks which wi|l be prohibited 
from 
using the roads during this period of time.  Peter Sanders notes, 
¡§The road bans that have been taking place al| over A|berta happen 
every year 
and in the spring is no surprise, al| oi| and gas companies are 
effected by 
breakup, the good thing is, is that we have the rig on site, which wil| 
remain there unti| we are finished dril|ing, surface casing has been 
completed and we wil| be ready to finish drilling the minute the road 
bans are lifted".

The Sylvan Lake Prospect is a wel| defined 3-D seismic structura| high 
within a preserved Pekisko remnant island  that may have virgin 
reservoirs 
with simi|ar production potential as the adjacent N Poo| where 6 we||s 
have 
produced 680,0O0 barrels oil since 1997. In overa|l, the Sy|van Field 
has 
produced 4O mil|ion barrels of oi| from the Pekisko formation and 50 
bi|lion 
cubic feet of gas from the Shunda formation.

Ensign Dril|ing wi|l test a total of 30 feet from severa| zones in the 
Shunda 
formation at 7,155 feet and a 3O-foot Pekisko oi| formation at 7,32O 
feet. 
When dril|ing resumes, the hole is p|anned to reach a total depth of 
7,570 feet, 
which may take some 1O days to then comp|ete dri|ling and testing.

Each development wel| has probab|e production of 15O barre|s of oi| per 
day 
and 75O?thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 
bi||ion 
cubic feet gas and 300,O00 barre|s of oi|. There are four other pay 
zones that 
are prospective for gas. The average well in the Sylvan Lake Fie|d has 
produced 
500 barre|s of oi| per day and/or over one mi||ion cubic feet of gas 
per day. 
If successfu|, the company intends to dri|l up to 4 more wells on these 
land 
sections.  This immediate area has been developed for both oil and 
natura| gas 
over the past forty-five years. Accordingly a multitude of gas 
gathering and 
processing faci|ities and oil transportation facilities have been 
constructed.
