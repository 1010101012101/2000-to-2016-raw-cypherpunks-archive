*I* think most, if not all of the current ideas for the FB are 
*technologically unworkable* (at this time anyway), but thats a *long* way 
from "stupid".  Sorry Ted, but by declaring everything as "stupid", it is 
*you* who are arguing from false authority (and with straw arguments no 
less).  Do you even listen to yourself?

As an "open" project, *everyone* is both encouraged and entitled to put 
forward their own visions of the FB - that said, the box *is* the dominion 
of the FBF, and their word *is* the last one.  The ideas put forward from 
"outside" the FBF are *not* "stupid" just because you don't believe they 
are (a) viable; (b) correct for the FBF's "vision"; (c) any other reason 
you can state.

"Stupid" is an attack term and nothing more. It doesn't add to the 
discourse, in fact, it just makes *you* look "stupid" for arguing from 
behind that curtain.

The list is specifically *designed* to solicit such input Ted.  Even 
uninformed or, to use your next ad hominem, "crazy" inputs: specifically 
because they *may* lead the FBF into new directions.

Um, PKB: see above.

And there's the trifecta. :-(
