Actually, not *entirely* useless.  Usually right after jim 
talks about an article and posts a link that doesn't point 
at it, someone else will post a correct link.  If Jim 
just shut up, some of these stories probably would escape 
our notice.  In the course of correcting his errors, people 
do provide useful information.
