Is it just me, or is Choate worth keeping around purely for 
comedic value?

(And here I was thinking it would be worthwhile to set up a
Choate-free node! We could send invitations to all the subscribers on
his node and then refuse to peer with it until he dropped the CDR:
silliness. But then we wouldn't see paranoid pearls like the below,
so never mind.)
