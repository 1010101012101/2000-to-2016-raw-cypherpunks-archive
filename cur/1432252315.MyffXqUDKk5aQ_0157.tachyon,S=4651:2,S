No, just a cold staying in bed for a week.


So here is the anouncemant:

A new CDR Node has opened at koeln.ccc.de. The machine is Located
in NRW, Germany and keeps logs.

To quote http://koeln.ccc.de/mailman/listinfo/cypherpunks

  About Cypherpunks

  This is a european node of the cypherpunks distributed
  remailer (CDR). Other Nodes can be reached at
  majordomo@ssz.com, majordomo@cyberpass.net,
  majordomo@minder.net, majordomo@algebra.com and
  listproc@openpgp.net. There is also the classical
  cypherpunks@toad.com node which is in an undetermined state.
  The koeln.ccc.de node feeds minder.net and ssz.com. It recives
  feeds from minder.net, cyberpass.net, algebra.com
  ano openpgp.net.

  This specific node drops messages bigger than 32k and every
  message with more than 17 recipients or just a line
  containing "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" in the subject. This
  node is also available read-only by nntp.

  There is some Information how Jim Choate sees CDR history at
  szz.com. Older archives can be found at inet-one, at
  venona.com and lanesbry.com. If you interested in physical
  meetings visit meetingpunks.

  To see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the
  Cypherpunks Archives.=20

I'm still not really happy with the software but it seems to work
without hickups. The nntp-part is still unstable but this
shouldn't affect the mail-part. One nice Feature is that you can
get a digest. Anonymous UUCP over TCP/ISDN/V.90 for cypherpunks
is planned but will take some time.

I still didn't get contact with algebra.com, openpgp.net and
cyberpass.net administrators to exchange backbone traffic.
