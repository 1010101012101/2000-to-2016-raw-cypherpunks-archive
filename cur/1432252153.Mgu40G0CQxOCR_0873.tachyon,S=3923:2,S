Never mentioned Bitcoin, and I would agree in principle.
Due to network effect and apparent good design Bitcoin may
last a lot longer than its detractors like to think, but 
it will fall, eventually.

I disagree there's palpable progress in QC inasmuch practical
computing is concerned, at least in the open literature.

DNA computers basically don't work.

You're sampling conformation space of a linear molecule with
lots of viscous drag. There is very little infinity in that.
