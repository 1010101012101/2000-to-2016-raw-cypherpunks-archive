   What is needed, seriously needed right now, is some good, open source
surveillance dectection software. Something that would find key-logger
software or hardware, something that would check your phone line thru
your modem, maybe even could be used as a frequency analyzer with a
usb or serial port "antenna" connection for laptops. 
    I'm sure this would be a really good commercial hit.  
Especially if the price could be kept under $500.
