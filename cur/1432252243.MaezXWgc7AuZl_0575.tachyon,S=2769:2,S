..."what the fuck does this have to do with cypherpunks? "

What the fuck does half the states trolls posts and spam have to do with 
cypherpunks.PLAY has a lot to do with getting crypto mainstream in GAMES.Am 
I playing in this surveilled strip mall till it closes...maybe.
Someone with your sig should know some GAME THEORY.Also a reminder of 
mortality like...

"Stupidity is not a sin, the victim can't help being stupid.  But
stupidity is the only universal crime;  the sentence is death, there is
no appeal, and execution is carried out automatically and without pity."
--Robert A. Heinlein
