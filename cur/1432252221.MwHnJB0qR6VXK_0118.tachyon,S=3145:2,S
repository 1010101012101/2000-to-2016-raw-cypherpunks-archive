Certainly, however, that's not something Tor is really designed to mask - 
Tor is designed to mask the people requesting services via Tor.  While Tor 
is likely quite secure in most respects, good intelligence does not 
necessarily require that the content of any request be known: there are 
many facets to any communication, and things like the existence of a 
particular target is certainly usable intel.  Tor is designed to inhibit a 
number of attacks, including traffic analysis, but there is *no* absolute 
guarantee that every possible attack is known, or even just coded for. If 
your life relies on anonymity services, you will likely be a whole lot 
more careful than if it's seen as something you "merely provide to others 
on extra bandwidth".
