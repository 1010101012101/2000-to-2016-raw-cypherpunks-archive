Warped indeed.  Maybe inChoate' capitalism means that.  As per
Merriam-Webster's, in this dimention and in the English language it means
the following:

Main Entry:	cap7i7tal7ism 
Pronunciation:	'ka-p&-t&l-"iz-&m, 'kap-t&l-, British also k&-'pi-t&l-
Function:	noun
Date:	1877
: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of
capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and
by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined
mainly by competition in a free market

(As cut and pasted from www.m-w.com)



Note the words "private" and "ownership" and "goods" which are not
possible in a fascist, communist, or socialist state.

Note the lack of the words "greed" or "belief that $$$ is the primary goal
in life" or "he who collects the most is the best."

All it claims to be is a system that allows private/corporate ownership of
goods where decisions are made by private (versus government) decision and
of course "free market."
