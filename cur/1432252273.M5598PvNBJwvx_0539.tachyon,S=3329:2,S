No.  Ever hear of Chaum's "Dining Cryptographers" [1]?  Anonymity
right there at the table.  Been around for almost twenty years.

Strong anonymity is available today using chains of random-latency,
mixing, anonymizing remailers based on mixmaster [2], of which there
is a thriving worldwide network [3].

Tor is indicted by its own documentation:

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination. [4]
