When cyberpass started messing up a few weeks ago,
I unsubbed there and resubbed at minder.net

Several times, I've noticed that messages I sent were
replied to long before I ever saw the original message
come back. 

Yesterday I sent a message around 11AM, and just
got the original back, over 24 hours later.

I'm used to a delay of an hour or so, but this is
ridiculous....

Here are the headers showing the delay taking
place at minder (I've obscured some local nodes).

Anyone else seen this?
