I think a larger problem is that we don't know how to build it.  Once
we build it, we may be able to market it.  But when you look at
building something for dissidents, you realize that you have very high 
stealth requirements, since using such software is likely to subject
its users to rubber-hose, and harsher forms of attack.

Productizing stealth systems is hard; the adversaries can take them
apart and find discriminators.  Not productizing stealth systems is
risky; your custom systems are likely to be of different strengths,
and the weak ones will provide your adversaries with training on how
to attack the hard ones, as well as insight into how you're producing
them.  (See for example, Enigma, increasing rotors; One-time-pad,
Soviet typewriters; British bingo cages.)

Also worth reading is "Traffic Analysis Attacks and Trade-Offs in
Anonymity Providing Systems" by Back, Muller and Stiglic, at
http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~stiglic/publications.html
