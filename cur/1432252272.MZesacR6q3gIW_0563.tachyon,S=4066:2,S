Did FBI Bungle E-Mail Evidence?
A Hotmail account used by suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui expired, 
and its contents lost, before the FBI has a chance to look at it. By 
Michelle Delio.
"...The FBI has openly admitted that its agents have difficulties 
collecting evidence from computers. FBI Director Robert Mueller told a 
House committee this summer that the agency lacks the technology skills and 
understanding that would allow agents to conduct complete computer 
forensics searches."
Paging chris McNorton,paging chris McNorton.
Hunter S. Thompson tells the Aussie radio program: "Overall, American 
journalism I think has been cowed and intimidated by the massive 
flat-sucking, this patriotic orgy that the White House keeps whipping up. 
You know if you criticize the President it's unpatriotic and there's 
something wrong with you, you may be a terrorist." ("The Media Report")
