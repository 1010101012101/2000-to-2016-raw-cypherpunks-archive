Read the definition of ordinary course of business - it implies good faith
by nature. You seem to think ordinary course of business means "shred away!"
Bzzt. Read Lewy. Lewy says you can't hide behind a policy and destroy
documents you KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN might be relevant in future
litigation - before you are served with suit or a preservation order. Yes,
courts are likely to differ in their application based on the unique facts.
However, if your ordinary course of business is to destroy or make
unavailable of records in specific anticipation of a law suit or criminal
complaint, you are probably not going to meet the good faith requirement.
The court has some room to reach here, and they increasingly have the
authority to do so. Whether they will be successful or not, I cannot say.

No, Sandfort, Unicorn and I are in agreement.

No, nobody has said that. It is pursuant to a written good faith retention
policy. Looking behind the veil the courts will likely see bona-fide good
faith.

You see an all-or-none proposition, when we are looking at the finer points
within a range of hypotheticals. Stop putting words in our mouths.
