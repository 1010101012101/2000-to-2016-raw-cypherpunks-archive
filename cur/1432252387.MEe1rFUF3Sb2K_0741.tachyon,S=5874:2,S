              WPI Cryptography Seminar

        Implementing New Public-Key Schemes

                 Prof. Berk Sunar
                ECE Department, WPI

               Wednesday, October 25
                  4:30 pm, AK 218
             (refreshments at 4:15 pm)


  ABSTRACT: In this talk "new" public-key schemes are briefly
introduced, namely Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptosystems, NTRU, and XTR.
Implementation aspects of related algorithms are analyzed and
complexity measures of the algorithms used in the implementation of
these new PK-schemes are discussed. The talk will conclude with the
presentation of future research ideas and implementation results of
current practices.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTIONS:

The WPI Cryptoseminar is being held in the Atwater Kent building on
the WPI campus. The Atwater Kent building is at the intersection of
the extension of West Street (labeled "Private Way") and Salisbury
Street. Directions to the campus can be found at
