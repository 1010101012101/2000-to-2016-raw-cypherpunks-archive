Everything that wikileaks has accomplished could have been done completely 
anonymously, with the public never having heard the name Assange.

If you are optimizing for leaks, you don't put yourself out there.

The fact that we know his name shows that he is optimizing for something 
else.  If the government really wanted to shut Assange up, they would give 
him a record deal or a starring role in a hollywood film.
