Market Update

3:30PM: Market is holding steady with the blue chip indices maintaining 
their ground in positive territory while the Nasdaq trades comfortably 
above the unchanged level... All in all, it has been an admirable 
performance by the market to this point, but it would be even more so if 
the financial stocks were in a more participatory mood and if the volume 
was on the heavy side...
Nonetheless, the notable lack of concerted selling interest in the face of 
disappointing sales reports from the retailers, and the not-so-impressive 
earnings guidance from the semiconductor sector, does speak to the market's 
underlying bullish bias... NYSE Adv/Dec 1495/1526, Nasdaq Adv/Dec 1970/1755
