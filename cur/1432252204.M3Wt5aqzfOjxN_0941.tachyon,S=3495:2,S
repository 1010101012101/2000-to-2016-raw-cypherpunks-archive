Weapons grade plutonium contains less than 7% of the non-fissile isotope
plutonium-240.  This is created if you leave the plutonium-239 in the
reactor after it is formed, and it manages to absorb an additional
neutron.  Small amounts of higher numbered plutonium isotopes are also
created by the same process.

For this reason, spent fuel from power reactors is not a suitable source
of weapons grade plutonium, although it is theoretically possible to build
a bomb from reactor grade plutonium if you use enough of it.  Bear in mind
you will have big thermal problems from short-lived plutonium isotopes if
that you employ plutonium from spent fuel, as well as problems from
neutrons getting soaked up by non-productive species.
