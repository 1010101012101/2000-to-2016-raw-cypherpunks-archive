Delta Air Lines is launching a new 'low cost' carrier called 'Song'.

Song (http://www.flysong.com) will use the same reservation system as Delta,
earning it the disdain of all Americans who believe in the US Constitution.

Song (and Delta) is collaborating in a test of the CAPPS II system, an
invasive and un-American program that forces citizens to undergo a
background investigation that includes personal banking information and a
credit check simply to travel in his or her own country.

http://www.donotflysong.com has been launched to punish Song for its
participation.  The site is affiliated with http://www.boycottdelta.org .

The CAPPS II system goes far beyond what any thinking citizen of this
country should consider reasonable.

Boycott Delta.  Boycott Song.  The democracy you save may be your own.
