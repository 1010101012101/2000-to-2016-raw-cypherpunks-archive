If you are inside the US, you do have full protection of US laws, including the First Amendment, although there are some specific 
exceptions.  Outside the US, it varies.  Ideally, a local law provides similar protection.  US companies will operate as if you do 
have the same rights, so in some sense and range of situations, the rights extend to everyone globally.
