Again, to what threat model?

I've only mention GPA, fix for which may involve, at possible minimum,
all nodes encrypting full fill traffic reclocked with jitter, under
some form of negotiated and enforced possibly dynamic traffic
contracts with peers.

I may also be on crack.

> What if they disrupt or slow X times your traffic to Tor?

That's an active attack, not a GPA trolling through packets.

Then your peers may de-peer you until things look normal.
Or it may take a while for you to get signal through.

And if they're already close enough to disrupt you
specifically, you've probably got other problems.

> This will be observable at the other end.

Not when every node is doing reclocking and de-peering
peers that seem to be misbehaving or dishonoring contracts.

Again, that's active, and application level, not GPA.

You mean like rooting a bunch of Linux nodes, 6+:1 ratio ...

6831 Linux
 696 Windows
 291 FreeBSD
  74 OpenBSD
  33 Darwin
   8 NetBSD
   4 ElectroBSD
   4 Bitrig
   3 SunOS
   2 DragonFly
   1 GNU/kFreeBSD
   1 CYGWIN_NT-10.0-WOW

Or compromising the repo or developers or 3rd party libraries...

Or asking your friends AT&T et al to help...

What's the threat?

>  "NSA can deanonimize some Tor users ...

Again, talk about whatever, but people need to specify the
threat model if they're going to really discuss solutions.

Nor is Tor the only active network currently subject to attack.

Do they and their court docs officially say that?
Or just some blogger reading 4chan?
