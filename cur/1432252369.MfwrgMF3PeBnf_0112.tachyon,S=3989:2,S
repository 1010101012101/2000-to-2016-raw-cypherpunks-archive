Here's an intersting Reuters blurb on arrests made because people failed
to grieve properly on their phone lines.

It doesn't say how many of these intercepts were with warrants, how many
were secret court/national security intercepts, how many were illegal, and
how many were routed offshore to be sniffed by our allies.

Interesting times.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Among almost 1,000 people being held in the United
States in connection with the hijacked-airliner attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon are people who made congratulatory telephone calls
minutes later, The New York Times reported in Sunday editions.
   
Although transcripts of the phone calls have not been made available, the
Times reports that officials have said some of the calls were
"congratulatory, even gloating."
   
These suspected associates of Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden's al
Qaeda organization are among 977 people held on various charges related to
the September 11 attacks, which killed almost 5,000 people in New York,
Washington and Pennsylvania.
   
The paper said it had been unable to determine whether those who made the
jubilant calls were participants in the hijack plot or merely rejoicing
over the attacks.
   
FBI agents intercepted telephone calls, moved in and made arrests, holding
the bulk of those arrested on immigration or criminal violations and a
smaller group on material witness warrants, the newspaper reported.
   
Their identities and those of most of the people being held have not been
released by the Justice Department.
   
The newspaper said officials would not say how many people were detained
through the telephone intercepts, nor would they discuss evidence that any
of them proved to be members of the group organized by bin Laden,
Washington's prime suspect in the attacks.
