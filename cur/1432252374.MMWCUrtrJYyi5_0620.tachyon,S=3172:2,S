Dude, do you read _Communications of the ACM_ ? Professional licensing of
"software engineers" is a fact in Texas. Not an issue goes by without
someone piping up about how great it would be if every state followed that
lead. 
Some discussion and context from licensing of other kinds of engineers is
at http://www.construx.com/stevemcc/gr-badges.htm

An "American Programmer's Association" may be closer than you think.
