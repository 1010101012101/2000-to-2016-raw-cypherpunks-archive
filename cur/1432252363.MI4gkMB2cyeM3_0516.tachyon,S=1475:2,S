hello,

the election commision of india had a proposal to the
govt. that the voter should be able to vote for 'none
of the above'. Though one can predict that such a
proposal will never be approved by the government, it
makes a lot of sense. Is any other democratic country
seriously thinking of implementing such an option?

Sarath.
