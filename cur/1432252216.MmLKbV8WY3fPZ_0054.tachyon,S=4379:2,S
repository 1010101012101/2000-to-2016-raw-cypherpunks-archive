*IF* killing people (this way) is the definition of evil, and there is
no other way to be evil but by being a murderer, *THEN* you are
perfectly right.

I still think murder and "evil", while touching each other, are not
identical. I still think you're overly simplificating the problem, and
that's exactly why it works so good in these extreme cases.
