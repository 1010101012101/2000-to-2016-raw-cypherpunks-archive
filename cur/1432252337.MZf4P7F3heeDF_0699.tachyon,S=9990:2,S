GCC yes, but what about Visual Studio? The LLVM which ships with XCode?
Javac?

Those are much jucier targets than say, Debian's GCC. If I worked at the
NSA, I'd make backdooring Visual Studio my 20% project.

If anybody with Snowden cache access who is reading this could do me a
quick favor and grep for 'compiler,' and then publish the output, I'd
really appreciate it.

Thanks,
