The quote "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death 
your right to say it" is widely attributed to Voltaire, but cannot be found 
in his writings. The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of 
his attitude. It appeared in The Friends of Voltaire (1906), written by 
Evelyn Beatrice Hall under the pseudonym S[tephen] G. Tallentyre.
