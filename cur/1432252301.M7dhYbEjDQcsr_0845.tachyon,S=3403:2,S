From: http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_11_14.php#004074  :

This weekend Congress was working on a massive $388 billion omnibus spending
bill that will cover all manner of federal spending. But at the request of
Rep. Ernest Istook of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Appropriations
Transportation Subcommittee, a special provision was inserted into the bill
which allows the Chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
or their "agents" to review any American's tax return with no restrictions
whatsoever.

Specifically, none of the privacy law restrictions -- or the criminal and
civil penalties tied to them -- would apply when the Chair or anybody he or
she designates as his or her "agent" looked at your tax return.

The exact language of the provision is as follows ...

"Hereinafter, notwithstanding any other provision of law governing the
disclosure of income tax returns or return information, upon written request
of the Chairman of the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations, the
Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall allow agents designated by
such Chairman access to Internal Revenue Service facilities and any tax
returns or return information contained therein."

The provision was slipped into the bill at the last moment. And, at least on
the Democratic side, no one was told about it until some Dems caught it at
the last moment.

Senate Republicans quickly backtracked, calling the provision a mistake or
snafu and insisting they knew nothing about it. You can see some of the
back-and-forth that took place on the Senate floor in this AP piece at CNN.

Sen. Stevens of Alaska, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,
originally blamed the provision on a 'staffer'. But later, according to the
AP, Sen. Frist and "congressional aides" said it was inserted at the behest
of Rep. Istook.
