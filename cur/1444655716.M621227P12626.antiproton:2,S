I tried to list their motives under the GCHQ/UK motives, who would be more
likely to fake the slide anyway and are the ones alleged of having leaked
documents to the Independent on behalf of JTRIG, are a fairly likely
candidate. Faking a slide like this would be a good way to inspire paranoia
and divide a community, no? It got Cryptome to post a notice on their site
for a week or two, alerting people to the possibility that they'd been
targeted by GCHQ by visiting Cryptome. Sounds like JTRIG-ish paranoia, no?
