I was thinking along similar lines, given that "Fuck you, I do what I 
want" is as good a working definition of Punk as any.  On the other hand 
there is the Cypher- component of the title, so herding the anarchists 
in that general direction topic-wise is a community service in the 
category of maintenance:  A thankless menial task that makes the rest 
possible.

Anarchy is a journey, not a destination, so there is no point at which 
one can hang up a "mission accomplished" banner.  But Dilbert's pointy 
haired boss just got orders from /his/ boss to put back doors in the 
company's crypto-enabled products:

Also this:

"Michael Hayden, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, thinks the US 
government should stop railing against encryption and should support 
strong crypto rather than asking for backdoors."

https://motherboard.vice.com/read/former-nsa-chief-strongly-disagrees-with-current-nsa-chief-on-encryption

vs. https://tinyurl.com/gpoxmhl

It would not be accurate to say that the Cypherpunks have won the Crypto 
Wars that too is a journey, not a destination.  But damn.

Meanwhile, kicking around some of the "real world" topics that make 
crypto-anarchy relevant and necessary IRL seems appropriate to me, as 
long as the crypto- side of the equation doesn't get drowned out by the 
-anarchy side.  Subscribers who air their passionate ignorance on the 
political front serve as a reminder that propagandists see "smart 
people" as nothing but another demographic with exploitable weaknesses, 
an object lesson for all the "rebellious" folks out there.
