None.  I was glossing over how you should measure your (e.g., camera's)
LSB stats then shape your ciphertext distribution that way.  I also
didn't mention the work by [???] on detecting stego, and about countermeasures
to this detection.  I also didn't mention how some stego does not use
raw LSBs but interstitial places in complex encodings (e.g., mp3).  I was
only 
explaining the principle of how you don't need a 'secret method' to hide
the existence of messages.

Of course not uniformly distributed, you have to cook any source of
noise to distill the pure stuff we covet.

Yes.  And as you point out correctly, doing this requires knowing something
*clever* about the covertext.  But it does not require *secret* algorithms, 
which is well known for not being robust.
