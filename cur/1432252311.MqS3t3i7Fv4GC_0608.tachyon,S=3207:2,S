Did you even read the message which explained WHY remailers need to
know about each other, and why they need to treat traffic from remailers
different from that from unknown addresses?  Your message shows no sign
of it.

Rather than issuing your blanket statement that remailers don't need to
know about each other, you need to explain how to deal with the issues
which presently require the contrary.
