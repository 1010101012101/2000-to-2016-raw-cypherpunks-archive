The Forbes 400, listing the 400 most wealthy Americans, is on the newstands
right now. While I don't have it at hand right now, the self-made men
significantly
outnumber those  who inherited all or part of their wealth.

The cut-off point this year is $725M.

The list can be browsed at http://www.forbes.com/400richest/ ,
but doesn't include the self made vs inherited data (which is in
the dead tree edition).
