This particular script that is currently being hyped up on Reddit as
"de-anonymizing most Tor hidden servers" simply makes too many
assumptions to be feasible.

Yes, this sort of attack is feasible in principle, and this script will
probably work if you find a hidden service that is also a relay and is
also a publicly reachable HTTP server, but saying it can be carried out
against most hidden services is simply false as a matter of fact.

Hidden services don't need to be reachable from the Internet. They don't
need to have accurate clocks. And as a result, a lot of them aren't
vulnerable to a program on the Internet that is being marketed as
reliably de-anonymizing hidden services.

To summarize:

      * This is not a novel attack
      * This particular variant of the attack ("clockskewer") is not
        effective against many if not most hidden services
      * The people claiming it does on Reddit are scare-mongering Tor
        for karma, and that irritates me as someone who likes Tor and
        wants people who need more-secure systems to research Tor and
        see the stable, well-tested tool that it is, rather than hype
        from Reddit.
