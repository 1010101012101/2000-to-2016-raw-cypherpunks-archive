I would craft the rules for prosecution so as to cut Leahy a break on 
this, as it was the _first_ time the "morphed child-like images" law 
was tested. (Assuming for the sake of argument this was in fact the 
first such law...I dimly recally morphed images being outlawed half a 
dozen years ago in another law.)

My main point was not to criminally prosecute those who pass laws 
_later_ found to be unconstitutional, when tested for the first time, 
but to prosecute those who keep passing the same unconstitutional laws. 
They know the laws "won't pass constitutional muster," as the lingo 
goes, but they get enough other career criminals to sign on anyway.

None of this is going to happen, we all realize, but the point is 
valid. Passing obviously bad laws ought to have the consequences that 
cooking the books does with with corporate fraud.
