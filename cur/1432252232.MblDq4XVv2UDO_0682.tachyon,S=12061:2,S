Hmmm lets see, if I remember right that actually was not an air raid shelter
it was a military hold which the people of the community were told was
"safe" to hide in...  Or am I just to believe that is our own government
propaganda?

Hmm I guess all the Kuwaiti's that the Iraqi's killed brings nothing into
this equation of yours? Including the removal of Kuwati babies from their
incubators so the iraqis could take the equipment.. Oh yea and the Kuwaiti
commanders that were hung at the main gate of Al Jaber AB and their body's
left there for several days for everyone to see..  And before you say that
both of these did'nt happen I have been there twice for several months and
have seen the photgraphs and personally talked to the people that were
witness to it.. It did happen.

Apparently you have never been in the military... Because you have no real
idea how the common soldier is taught or trained.. You probably have all
your training from watching Full metal jacket baout 40 times....

Too bad the government has'nt deprogrammed you yet.... Because your cheese
done fell off your cracker... (Okay so I stole that line from the Green Mile
:)

Ohh I get it so we should'nt mourn over these individuals?   Ok they
deserved it because they were working there... and the kids across the
street at the day care center deserved it too....  Interesting though the
people in waco were given the chance to come out on their own several
times..   Do I believe that the government got together and decided to kill
everyone at the Waco compound? NO... Do I believe the governement made a
mistake at Waco... YES...  Do I believe Timothy McVeigh sought out to kill
everyone he could at the federal bldg... YES..

Now going with your logic... I accidently and by bad judgement caused a
wreck in my car.... I killed some people.. Should I be disciplined..  Most
likely.. Should I die?.. Most probably not.   Now you saw the accident and
decided that because I was working for this certain company when I did it
that your going to take your car and purposely run everyone traveling in
that a company's van off the road and whne you do it you cause a 6 car
pileup killing even more people..  Does this makes sense..  Certainly not..
Unless your insane....

Drove him?  Drove him how?   You think the only way to make change in this
country is to do violent acts?  He was not a soldier who malfunctioned.. He
was a man who made a decision and know he must pay for it..  Executions
should be public just like the trials.. Otherwise we are no better than
other countries where even the accused is represented by someone who works
for the government... Hmmm.. I guess you did'nt learn everything you needed
to know about life in kindergarten...
If you wanna make change... Then become a public a voice.... Do you do
anything more than sit in here and talk.. Does change happen overnight..
Hell no....  All that the violence is doing is giving the government more
ammo to say "See.. told ya so"

Probably will.. After all there are thousands of insane people out there...
