   I'm an admin for a lot of groups. Those groups are run on Yahoo,
Google, as well as some that are run on private mailman machines. The
question keeps coming up... what is the alternative?

   This looks very interesting. Thank you, i will have to look into it.

   But, back to the question: How/where can someone run a simple
(ignoring the sign-up required by Yahoo/Google/etc.), public, free
(both ways, because paying would require identification) forum,
allowing for anonymous posts (but not allowing it to be overrun by
trolls), that has a simple searchable (and findable - as in searched
by Google, Yahoo, etc.) archive?

   You still have to trust a privately run forum. Trust, as in, will
it be censored, altered, still there after the volunteer gets tired of
it, etc.?

   In other words, if you want a private discussion group about
Privacy, then yes, keep it small and secret... somehow. But if you
want a public discussion, what are the alternatives to
Google/Yahoo/etc.?
