And per the topic... what was the positive/negative effect in cases where
that data wasn't available for a request? Who did the encouragement?
Why? And what stick did they wield? Were such requests even legal
court orders?

Putting some thought into how to aggregate and
roll them up into what amounts to anonymous RRDB
summary metrics is that hard and costly? No one likes
deleting source data out of fear of not being able to produce
some miracle report that will make them 10% more profit
someday. But in the end, this is technology biz, if you can't
come up with that edge within a year or less of raw data,
you're already too old and slow and don't need it anyways.
You could just continue keep rates higher and buying your
entrenchment.
