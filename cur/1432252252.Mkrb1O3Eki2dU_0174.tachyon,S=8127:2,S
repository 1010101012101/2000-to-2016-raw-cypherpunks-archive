Did you bother to read either of those websites before citing them?

The first one states that PGP/MIME support in Outlook is "Unknown to the
author."

The second states that it isn't supported, though the author of the page
has "heard a rumor" that it is. Do you routinely start debates based on
second hand rumors?

I'm unclear on what you are trying to demonstrate by referring us to those
pages. They contradict your beliefs.

It is not possible to do PGP/MIME with these apps. Take a look at M$'s
mail plugin API, and you will see why.

Very good. I'm glad you know what the acronym stands for. That doesn't
change the fact that RSA doesn't have any "patent on PKI". [Though yes,
I'm sure they have a slew of patents on specific features of their PKI
apps. If I don't say that, someone's going to nit.]

My apologies. I sometimes forget that people can't hear me snickering when
I am sending email. You weren't expected to answer that question.

Seasoned members of the cypherpunks list are intimately familiar with
RSA's crypto patents.

> There were doubtless other issues.  The patent didn't help.

No, the patent was completely irrelevant. For non-commercial apps, there
was RSAREF. For commercial apps, BSAFE was available with a license. For
those who didn't want to deal with the RSA patent, there were other public
key algorithms. The Diffie/Hellman/Merkle patents expired years ago.

RSA (the company)'s patents may have caused developers to use algorithms
like DSS, ElGamal, and Diffie-Hellman rather than RSA (the algorithm), or
limited the adoption of Rivest's later algorithms (which were not nearly
as ground-breaking), but saying that a patent on one algorithm prevented
(or even significantly impacted) the adoption of cryptographic functions
in email clients is patently absurd.

BTW, S/MIME (with, *gasp*, RSA) has been available in most commercial mail
clients for years.

That isn't what this discussion is about. We've been talking about
arguments against signing in a manner incompatible with the tools the
majority of your readers are using, not arguments against signing in
general. Though there are plenty of those as well.

And again, my pointer: http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/ in conjunction
with google.

Once again, you're confusing the issue. MIME *handling* isn't what we are
discussing. MIME *creation* is. I am going to, and do, avoid sending MIME
attachments to public lists.

Proof? No proof. All I see is hyperbole.

First of all, there is nothing insecure with the way RFC 2440 specifies
message creation. The benefits that PGP/MIME offers mainly take effect
when MIME is already being used for other reasons -- i.e., signing of
messages with attachments, etc.

PGP/MIME offers no benefits when it is a plain text ASCII email being
signed.

People who march around the net using incompatible, irrelevant, or
otherwise inconvenient protocols and subject others to the cruft these
protocols generate, all in the name of "standards compliance" and
"standards evangelization" are in fact hurting the greater cause.

Saying "My email client follows the RFCs to the letter, yours is broken,
so it's not my problem that you can't read my mail" *harms* attempts to
facilitate wide-spread adoption of crypto technologies. Joe User sees this
sort of thing happening, and decides to stay far away from PGP because "it
breaks email." You're being obstinate and foolish.

I'm sure you do.

Was this in your rant tarball? I didn't download it.

It has nothing to do with crypto.
