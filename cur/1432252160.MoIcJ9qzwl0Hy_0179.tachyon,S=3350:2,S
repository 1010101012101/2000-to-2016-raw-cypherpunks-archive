Bitmessage

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages
to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate
authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a
message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the
sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those
running warrantless wiretapping programs. If Bitmessage is completely new to
you, you may wish to start by reading the whitepaper.

Download

An open source client is available for free under the very liberal MIT
license. For screenshots and a description of the client, see this
CryptoJunky article: "Setting Up And Using Bitmessage".

 Download for Windows

If you are looking for someone to message, visit the forum or send me a
greeting. Here is my address: BM-BcJFNZDyzQKXCVJZtBJGqoon2f7GKo6s

Source code

You may view the Python source code on Github. Bitmessage requires PyQt and
OpenSSL. Step-by-step instructions on how to run the source code on Windows
or Linux is available here.

Bitmessage should run on any OS though it is only lightly tested on OSX. The
start-on-boot and minimize-to-tray features are only implemented for Windows
thus far.

Security audit needed

Bitmessage is in need of an independent audit to verify its security. If you
are a researcher capable of reviewing the source code, please email the lead
developer or send a bitmessage to the address above. You will be helping to
create a great privacy option for people everywhere!

Forum

Visit or subscribe to the Bitmessage subreddit.

A community-based forum for questions, feedback, and discussion is also
available at Bitmessage.org/forum.
