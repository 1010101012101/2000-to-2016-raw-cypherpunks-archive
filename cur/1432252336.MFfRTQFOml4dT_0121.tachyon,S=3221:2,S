Not necessarily. It is a well documented phenomenon that people show up at hospitals with even some seemingly real conditions whenever there is a particular panic in the media, even in cases where it is simply not possible that they were made sick by the incident.

(Assuming of course that even the reports of treatment are themselves accurate, which is doubtable under the circumstances.)

<----- Original Text ----->

The press was reporting that some dozens of people went to
hospitals after encountering shuttle parts,
and about 8 were actually treated for something,
between lung or skin problems (presumably chemical burns of some sort.)
So it's not totally harmless.
