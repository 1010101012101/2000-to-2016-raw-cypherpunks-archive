Russian police say they have arrested seven members of an organized 
crime gang after they tried to sell about one kilogram of uranium to 
undercover officers. 
FULL STORY:
http://cbc.ca/cgi-bin/view?/news/2001/12/06/uranium011206

... and only a few days ago we were discussing this sort of thing.  Fancy
that.

I would be interested to know if american broadcasters pick this up.

There is not much detail in the story.  They failed to report what type of
uranium it was - U-235?  If anyone has more details on this please advise.

regards
joe baptista
