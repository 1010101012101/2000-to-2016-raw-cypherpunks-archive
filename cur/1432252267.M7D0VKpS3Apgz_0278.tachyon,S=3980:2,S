To the consumer, a computer is an appliance.  It is purchased to do some
specific set of things, with OS and applications pre-loaded.  Its software
and hardware are never upgraded, and when it isn't new and shiney any
more, it is traded in and a newer model is acquired.

To expect the consumer to do anything complicated to his computer is like
expecting the owner of a TV to upgrade it from Comb Filter to Comb Filter
Pro, and to add additional RAM and a line doubler.

Comsumers aren't going to use any security that isn't on the machine when
they get it.  Just like they aren't going to use an OS other than Windows,
because it isn't on the machine when they get it.

No, it sounds suspiciously resonant with "I understand that the appliance
market is different from the government, commercial, and educational
markets."

We call these people hobbyists.  The size of the hobbyist market will
never be more than a fraction of the size of the appliance market.
