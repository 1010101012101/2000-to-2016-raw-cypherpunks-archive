This is probably quite true... from his particular vantage/access point
and social network. Yet however much we may know about that side
being relatively open and shary and the capabilities there, it is not an
exclusive answer to the crypto question. None of the Snowden docs to
date are or show any real details about the crypto side of the house. He
either had no interest (unlikely), had no time, found it too risky (whether
to pull off without being caught, or over concern about some element of
grave damage), or simply had no access.

These sort of things may be important indicators. Yet to prove
them as such you'd also have to analyse the history of
FUD making, grab attempts and so on to interpret.

It could be that selective crypto is not dark, but merely expensive
to scale into being "see all" as desired with the old in clear. So
you would have to analyse the costs there. Electricity, rainbow
disk storage, real estate, cooling. How do you know the disk
makers and their suppliers do not have black wing budgets. Or
that there is not a multi billion fab lab buried under some mountain
powered by a ground radiator / aquifer cooled nuke reactor?

Yes, that's one... who is tracking where all the brilliant maths and
others go after high school? The student names in known friendly
colleges and programs? The ones that seem to drop from the
public scene? What media is publishing interviews with them?
Where are known adversary retirees that may have something
to say when invited?

To know the adversary you must continual analyse all potential
aspects, and not just aspect itself but their inputs, dependencies
and output/result chains. Then maybe you can answer some
questions. After all, the adversary is doing analysis upon you.

> Right.  I'm surprised Android sells any phones in USA market.

It's surprising that maybe no one has yet reverse engineered the binary
blobs/drivers in android to provide a fully open software stack there.
And although more difficult, same goes for the firmware blobs.
Regardless of effectiveness, it would show market demand.

Knowledge, and knowledge dichotomy within capacity of biology as

As with Google, they hire a lot of Maths and others, and have been
at it for decades longer. Even generations of maths born into now.

There is too much silence from these workers.
Especially when society could probably get along just
as well without so many organizational level secrets
everywhere (wars), and now potentially against peoples
if you believe that sort of thing.

More Snowdens Please.
