Good idea.  If you were to stand in front of it, you'd probably lose the
other eye.

No, we're talking 'self-defense', this is the US, not the UK.

Jimbo, you ignorant slut, do you even know what a "straw man" argument is?
DEADLY FORCE may be used in SELF-DEFENSE when one is in reasonable fear of
death or great bodily harm.  That's black-letter law.  (There are some
refinements, such as "to oneself or another," but they are not germane to
the instant hypothetical of someone trying to bash you with a fire
extinguisher through your car window.)

Don't know about 'couldn't, but I certainly wouldn't.  Your verbal reasoning
skills suck.

"...don't confuse me with the fact"?

Yeah, we can see that by the quantity and quality of your posts.  God, what
a chicken shit way to turn tail.  You've got all kinds of monetary offers to
take the LSAT and you wimp out.

Cluck, cluck, cluck.  The victim in the car doesn't get to know what sort of
extinguisher the rioter will use.

After take a long paragraph to blame the victim Jimbo asserts:

Actually, it would fall under the definition of "great bodily harm," whether
you think so or not.  This is not a self-serving definition, you idiot, just
a legal one that you happen to disagree with.

Yup Jimbo, you're right about that.

You really should become a lawyer or even a judge.  You seem to already have
figured this one out by ESP or something.  Wow, I'm fucking impressed with
your legal acumen.

Is THAT what cops swear to?  I'd like to see a citation on that piece of
bullshit.  There is established case law in the US that says the police have
no specific duty to protect anyone.

How convenient.  Now don't you forget to "share" that with us tomorrow

Did you pull that out of your ass or someone else's?

This guy is a laugh riot.  Where does he dig this stuff up?  What a moron.
