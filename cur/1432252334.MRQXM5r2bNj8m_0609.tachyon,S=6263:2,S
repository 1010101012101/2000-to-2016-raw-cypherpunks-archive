Definitions depend on context.
You mix "rich" and "intelligence" in one sentence --
in this context the majority/almost all of this list is likely
not rich, though they may have sufficiently money.

Also "intelligence community" appears non-standard definition.

Intelligence is military organization -- soldiers follow
orders depending on their rank. This is not the civil
definition of "community", maybe unless you consider
Obama "community of one".
