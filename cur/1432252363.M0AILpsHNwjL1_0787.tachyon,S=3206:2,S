Spying on the Home Front
coming May. 15, 2007 at 9pm (check local listings)

(60 minutes) FRONTLINE addresses an issue of major consequence for all
Americans: Is the Bush administration's domestic war on terrorism
jeopardizing our civil liberties? Reporter Hedrick Smith presents new
material on how the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance  
program
works and examines clashing viewpoints on whether the president has  
violated
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and infringed on
constitutional protections. In another dramatic story, the program  
shows how
the FBI vacuumed up records on 250,000 ordinary Americans who chose Las
Vegas as the destination for their Christmas-New Year's holiday, and the
subsequent revelation that the FBI has misused National Security  
Letters to
gather information. Probing such projects as Total Information  
Awareness,
and its little known successors, Smith discloses that even former  
government
intelligence officials now worry that the combination of new security
threats, advances in communications technologies, and radical
interpretations of presidential authority may be threatening the  
privacy of
Americans.
