hi,

Did any one say the US system works based on logic :-)

The news here is that on an average one US soidler
dies per day to a iraqi sniper particlually in crowded
areas where you cant blow of  a whole builiding
immediately.Maybe this is the wierd logic that the
iraqi's follow.Even they too have the right to follow
their own logic.
Only problem is that innocent soldiers on both sides
are the sufferers due to a bunch of intelligent people
who say they are doing it in national interest while
they are doing it for themselves in both nations.


Sarath.
