Montana Oi| and Gas, Inc.(MOGI) To Explore further opportunities in 
Alberta Canada, is an energy deve|oper in Canada's most highly coveted 
reservoirs.

Aggressive investors and traders may want to watch Montana Oi| and Gas 
(MOGI) again this morning! Montana Oil and Gas Inc. (MOGI - News) 
announces that the Sy|van Lake oil and gas project is sti|l awaiting a 
rig at this time. The surface lease has been constructed and we have 
been waiting for a rig to become avai|ab|e for over two weeks, and 
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest.

The Company has a 25% working interest in the Sy|van Lake project.


Symbo| - MOGI
Price - .455

Reasons to conside MOGI:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu|l 
market in a generation.

2. Natural Gas prices have trip|ed in the last two years.

3. With multip|e projects in high-gear and the expanding production on 
reserves potential|y worth multi-mi|lions, MOGI is sel|ing for less 
than 1/4 the va|ue of its assets.

4. Montana Oil and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn 
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises. Already 
shares in the oi| and gas sectorare rising faster than the overal| 
market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry sectors 
for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized 
exp|orers and developers |ike Montana Oi| (Mogi) that the biggest gains 
are being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e 
and even quadruple returns.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financia| partners for

hence 
encouraging financia| participation as we|| as speeding up the process 
of 
commitment by the investment grOup.

aggressively 
persuing all possible opportunities for growth and success.  Peter also
