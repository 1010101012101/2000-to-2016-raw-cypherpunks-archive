It seems to me that John is taking the first steps toward a general 
argument: That police should not be allowed to do undercover work. His 
argument, taken to its logical conclusion, would prevent police from 
infiltrating criminal organizations in meatspace (let's assume, for the 
moment, that we're talking about serious criminal acts against property and 
person, not victimless crimes).

I propose that all anonymizers adopt a code of practice that

What happens when Anonymous Software Inc. sells its prepaid 300-minutes of 
anonymous browing kit through CompUSA and PC Warehouse? And, as others have 
pointed out, the people you most want to catch with this rule would have 
the strongest incentive to evade it.

Anonymous remailers and browsing technology is user- and value-neutral. As 
a practical matter, it makes sense to assume that the Feds are using it.
