Congresscriminals are already calling for restrictions on public speech 
in other countries. A bandwagon of support for banning whispering 
(crypto) is building. "Choose your escrowed diary provider!" say the 
apologists for fascism.

Here's what I expect will happen in the coming weeks:

* a massive military attack on Afghanistan and possibly "rebel bases" in 
many parts of the Mideast

* a series of hastily-passed new laws restricting communications (with 
remailers targeted specifically because they by their nature are not in 
"compliance" with CALEA)

* on the day the war begins, next week or in the weeks thereafter, a 
series of raids on those operating remailers, those who have identified 
these repressive measures, and those who have spoken against the 
American Jihad or who have publically opined that the WTC bombing 
resembles the Reichstag Fire

* these raids will be done in the usual pre-dawn, ninja-clad storm 
trooper way: flash-bangs, shoot anything that appears to move, put the 
perps _down_!

* many of those arrested in the raids may not actually be prosecuted, as 
even pliable courts will find little or no constitutional basis for 
prosecution, though some fraction will die while "resisting arrest" (a 
few highly-publicized "barricade situations," a la Waco, should help 
with the terror campaign)

* those not arrested, shut down, kicked off their ISPs,  or killed will 
be driven underground, or, in most cases, will "promise not to do it 
again" and will meekly become the Carnivore Administrators for their 
systems

* Robb London and Jeff Gordon and their ilk will be promoted to new 
positions within the National Unity Government and will be asked to 
detail their successful prosecutions of notorious cypherpunk terrrorists

* Congress will hold endless hearings reminiscent of the House 
Un-American Activities Committee hearings. Activists and crypto 
advocates will receive subpoenas. The media, even the newly-fascist tech 
media, will villify them.

* Someday, perhaps in 20 years, wiser heads will realize that shredding 
the Constitution in support of some Zionists who pushed Arabs (called 
"sand niggers") off of their lands was not a good idea.

War is coming. Against us, against liberty, against the Constitution.

If I stop posting in the coming weeks, you'll know why.
