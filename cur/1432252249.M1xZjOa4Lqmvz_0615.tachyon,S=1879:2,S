TACOMA, Wash. -- A 13-year-old Lacey boy is accused of child pornography
by taking pictures of himself and posting them on the Internet.

The boy was arrested Wednesday by investigators from the State Patrol's
Missing and Exploited Children task force. They also seized three
computers.

The boy is being held in juvenile detention without bail. Prosecutors
expect to file charges by Monday.
