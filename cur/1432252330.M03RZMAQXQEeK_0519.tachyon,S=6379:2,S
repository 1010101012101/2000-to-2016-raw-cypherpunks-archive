It is the common belief of anarchists and communists of all likes to oppose 
property. Intellectual property is also shunned by extension. So there is a 
question of why(?!?) it is that these anarchist and communist works are 
today being copyrighted. Furthermore, the two main radical internet 
archivists (Marxist Internet Archives and Anarchy Archives) threaten to sue 
those who use their content. MIA and AA are also selling CDs of their 
content ($25 and $10), which is a direct exploitation of theory. MIA and AA 
have degraded themselves to the level of Hot Topic, selling the revolution. 
Anarchy for sale, $10. Be a Communist, only $25! But I faintly remember: 
the revolution will not be televised.
