Is not the goal of AP to take out the mark, or at least to estimate
the perceived value in doing so. So whatever happens before or
after that to the bidder and contractor is irrelavent, they evaluated
their risks and endeavoured to conduct a mutually beneficial
transaction. If their evaluation of risk was not sound, that's their problem.
But for the transactions that do execute, the mark is still dead
and both goals have been met.

As Jim alluded, there is often a free speech component to any
non-executed prediction. And a market can be any number of markets
containing any number of offers, including 1 offer in each of 10 markets.
Some markets will see user traffic, others will be shutdown. Maybe some
will be purely p2p with reputation of makers and takers floating in signed
metadata.

A side goal of AP is to put enough money into it such that people
do research, develop and deply a suitable marketplace that will
withstand investigation. Right now there are at least 10 viable darknet
markets offering a variety of sex, drugs, money, contraband, kopimi,
and guns... and business is booming by all accounts.
Actions up to and including murder aren't that much distant from
those in terms of what politicians claim to be repulsed at and "at war"
with. In fact, the penalties for those now are often more than for
being a party to killing someone.
