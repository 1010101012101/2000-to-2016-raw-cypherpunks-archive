BTW, there's been a lot of recent work on electromagnetic launchers. 
Accelerating buckets in tubes, using electromagnets. (Outlined in 
Heinlein's "Moon is a Harsh Mistress," more than 35 years ago. Also 
outlined in several recent novels, and of course in technical papers on 
"mass launch" systems.)

An electromagnetic accelerator could accelerate small masses to speeds 
beyond what explosives could ever accomplish. Imagine the new designs 
using even less fissionable material (up to certain basic physics 
limits, of course).

Accelerate a small slug of Californium and splat it against a hard 
target...ah, now _that's_ a basement nuke!
