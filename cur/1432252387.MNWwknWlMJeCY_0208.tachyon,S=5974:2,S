Life in plastic, it's fantastic,legal fight to protect parody and 
commentary on the pop culture that shapes our society. Marketers can't be 
allowed to pre-empt the marketplace of ideas.

Bush to Welfare Recipients: Drop Out of School.
Lost in the flood of big news stories--Iraq, the financial scandal, Israel 
and Palestine, fast track--was a little gem from George W. on the subject 
of welfare reform.
Speaking in Charleston, South Carolina, on July 29, Bush castigated Senate 
Democrats for trying to take some of the nastier edges off of his welfare bill.
"Under the way they're kind of writing it right now, out of the Senate 
Finance Committee, some people could spend their entire five years--there's 
a five-year work requirement--on welfare, going to college," Bush said to 
applause. "Now, that's not my view of helping people become independent. 
And it's certainly not my view of understanding the importance of work and 
helping people achieve the dignity necessary so they can live a free life, 
free from government control."
