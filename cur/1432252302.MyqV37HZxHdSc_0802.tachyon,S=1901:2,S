Do all the newly electronic voting places have UPS?  I doubt
it.  Think of the fun you could cause if you downed a few
substations or poles.

>> And because elections happen all at once, there would be no means of
recovery.  Imagine if, in the next presidential election, someone
hacked the vote in New York.  Would we let New York vote again in a
week?  Would we redo the entire national election?  Would we tell New
York that their votes didn't count?

>>What we need are simple voting systems--paper ballots that can be
counted even in a blackout.
