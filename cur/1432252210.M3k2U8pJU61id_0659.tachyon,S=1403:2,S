   A guy just told me that he got stopped for a minor traffic 
offense and the cop spotted a "how to grow pot" book on his
car seat. Suddenly there were six cop cars there, they searched
him and the car, found nothing, but busted him anyway for 
"possession of paraphernalia", and he was convicted, given
a $200 fine.
