Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them did have nightmares about the
Constitution. Not as a piece of paper dancing around on Mickey Mouse legs or
whatever the hell you're getting at, but as an idea repersenting the rule
of law that was going to lead to them being jailed for murder. Which
unfortunately never happened, but so it goes.

I'm sure anyone who speaks English as a first language didn't find it odd or
have a problem understanding such a common expression. It's an idiom, not a
metaphor. Your English is generally great, but you might want to have a look at
various online ESL dictionaries of idiomatic usage if you have time, it probably
would make things a little easier for you here.  

The language issue might also explain why you missed my original point. No
hard feelings; I'd rather talk about issues than quibble over this sort of
thing anyday. I'm sure if I were trying to do this in French or German instead,
I'd be having the same sort of trouble myself. 

So here's hoping miscommunication doesn't -->stand in the way of<-- getting on
with a perfectly interesting thread. ;)
