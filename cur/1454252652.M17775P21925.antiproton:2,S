The main worry is when =E2=80=9Cgleeful roasting=E2=80=9D slips into bullyi=
ng and irreversible harm. It's easy for a collective group to shout someone=
 out for the wrong reasons.=C2=A0




Censorship is not the answer to this. But having plain, honest, thoughtful =
conversations might be.=C2=A0

If you create an environment that is conducive to only one socioeconomic cl=
ass, you lose individuals who are strong technologists, but whom don=E2=80=
=99t fit a certain race/gender/economic profile.




It is a loss for the community when strong technologists leave because they=
 do not fit the socioeconomic culture of the majority. Especially when cons=
idering what this group is fundamentally trying to resist.=C2=A0




>From my own personal experience- when a group is diverse, one=E2=80=99s own=
 race/gender/economic background matters less and fades into the background.




This is the ideal- to not even have to talk/think about socioeconomic issue=
s, and focus on common issues- on how to reverse the end of privacy, on wri=
ting code, on ensuring strong cryptography.

No, there is nothing begrudging. I=E2=80=99m here because I want to be usef=
ul to ensure that privacy and personal liberty and privacy continue to exis=
t. And to learn.




This is the ask: =C2=A0don=E2=80=99t let this be a space where someone has =
to struggle between alignment to the cypherpunks ideology (writing code, en=
suring privacy and liberty, preserving cryptography) and alienation because=
 of one=E2=80=99s socioeconomic background.




Also, let us not forget who the real enemy is.




Thank you.
