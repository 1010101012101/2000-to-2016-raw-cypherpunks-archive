Anyone with CA/package signing opsec clue willing to help Linux
distros with advice to improve package signing security?

Then don't assume that all distros have this type of problem please.

And it makes automated builds an almost impossible thing to achive, so
it's not realistic.

Agreed, and I think that other distros already do this, Debian might be
the exception :(

Projects almost always gladly accept patches and review, what's stopping
anyone from doing this today?  I know of a handful of people who started
doing this for the Linux kernel a few years ago and instantly got job
offers to continue doing this full-time.  Some of them accepted and have
been working very well on fixing a huge range of issues.  Some decided
to stay where they were and continue to churn out great tools that let
us fix these issues (academia is a good place for stuff like this.)

Those tools work on all projects if they wish to be used, it's only a
matter of the developers using them.

Have them go to FOSDEM, where all the distros have a multi-day track to
work on issues that encompass them all.
