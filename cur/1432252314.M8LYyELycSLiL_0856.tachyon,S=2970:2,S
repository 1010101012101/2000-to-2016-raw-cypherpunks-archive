When Feds are the Crackers
U.S. courts should join Russia in saying "nyet" to the FBI's lawless 
international hack attacks.
By Mark Rasch Aug 26, 2002

In medieval times, attackers would use a bell-shaped metal grenade or 
"petard" to break enemy defenses. These unreliable devices frequently went 
off unexpectedly, destroying not only the enemy, but the attacker. As 
Shakespeare noted, "'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his owne 
petar."

That's what I thought of when the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) 
recently announced their plans to charge an FBI agent with hacking -- a 
crime that the agent committed while investigating Russian hackers.
