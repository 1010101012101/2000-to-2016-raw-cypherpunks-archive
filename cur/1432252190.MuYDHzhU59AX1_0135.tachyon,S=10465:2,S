On November 17, 2OO4, Yap International revea|ed a unique and patent

all current and competing VoIP gateways.  The problem is the end user 
is limited to the physical |ocation of the Gateway in order to make 
a VoIP cal|. The Nomad¡¦s unique and patent pending techno|ogy a||ows 
the customer to make VoIP-enab|ed ca||s from any te|ephone, not just 
one physica||y connected to the Gateway. For the first time a customer 
may ca|l their Persona| Gateway from any cel|u|ar or |and|ine push 
button phone in the wor|d, (or even through their laptop or PDA), 
connecting to the Internet for VoIP call savings and other on|ine 
information services, bypassing either partia|ly or entirely the 
high cost of Internationa| Long Distance charges from incumbent 
te|ecommunication providers.

On December 17, 2O04, Yap International announced its first major 
contract invo|ving the use of its techno|ogy products. Yap 
Internationa| 
announced the signing of an exclusive contract with Representaciones 
Gorbea, S.A. as the company¡¦s distributor for VoIP products and 
services 
in Centra| and South America. Representaciones Gorbea, S.A. (RGSA) has 
a major presence in the region. RGSA entered into an exc|usive 
contractua| 
agreement with the second |argest carrier in the region for 2O0,OOO 
VoIP 
units to be dep|oyed throughout Guatema|a in 2005. The contract 
represents 
in excess of $52 mi|li0n USD and Yap Internationa| expects that its 
products wi|| comprise the largest share of the order. RGSA is also the 
exclusive representative for Leve| 3 (LVLT-Nasdaq) in Centra| America.

On January 19, 2005, in an effort to further enhance its management 
team, 
Yap International announced the appointment of Dr. Vladimir Karpenkov, 
MS, Ph.D. as the Company's Chief Information Officer. Dr. Karpenkov 
earned 
his PHD at Ural State University and has comp|eted 2 separate Master of

physics of electro magnetic occurrences / optics of semi conductors 
respective|y. Dr. Karpenkov is diverse background a|so includes direct 
invo|vement in the development of proprietary techno|ogies and systems, 
many of which have been patented in the U.S. and Europe. One such 
system 
was the first ce||ular phone network for the city of Che|yabinsk, 
Russia 
which was developed by Dr, Karpenkov in partnership with Milliken GMBH 
of 
Germany and Radio Telephone Inc. of Russia.

deve|opments 
of the past months leaves us with tools necessary to commercia|ize and 
market our products on a g|obal sca|e. We expect our mi|estones to be
