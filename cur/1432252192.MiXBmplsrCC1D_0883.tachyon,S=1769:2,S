Not sure if the old Keyser Sose was limping or not,
but he came out last week to give George Bush's campaign a helpful
"Booga booga booga" to remind the sheeple that he's still there.

Bush's speech had bragged that Osama could "run, but he can't hide",
and Kerry neglected the chance to remind the public that
Osama ran, and he's hidden real well, and that Bush has been
too busy with the war on Saddam to bother catching him.
