Well, I do find Juan's input to be far more interesting than Cari's.
But I'm fully capable of ignoring anything. And storage is cheap.

Also, the whole "tribal rolls" thing is bullshit. Maybe now, with
affordable genetic analysis, it could become objective. However,
heritage is a fundamentally racist concept, except in the limited
context of establishing tribal membership and treaty rights.

And finally, it's laughable for someone to claim membership in some
tribal roll via anonymous remailer. I do appreciate the sentimental
value of remailer posts to cypherpunks. But seriously?
