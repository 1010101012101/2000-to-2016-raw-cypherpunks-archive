OK Steve, so you got me to thinking on this, and I went back to the source
docs for some study.  And I found this:

13th Amendment
<huge snip>
slavery in all of the United States. Once the CSA was defeated, approval
of the 13th Amendment was a requirement for readmittance into the United
States. Proposed on January 31, 1865, it was ratified on December 6, 1865
(309 days). All of the CSA states except Mississippi ratified the 13th
after the war; Mississippi ratified the amendment in 1995.


is this true?  Missisippi wasn't a state until 1995???  Anyone heard about
this???  the mind reels at the possible judicial implications!

'The right of self defence is the first law of nature: in most governments
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest
limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of
the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext
whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the
brink of destruction.'
