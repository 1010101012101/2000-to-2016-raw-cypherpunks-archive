Yes, this batch seems to sway in the collective wind.

Which actually suprised me...despite the source of appointment of Suter, I 
remember reading at the time about his track record somewhere and was 
actually under the impression that he was a very 'conservative' interpreter 
of Constitutional law...and by conservative I mean really does not stray 
from clear precedent unless it's called for...he actually seemed to have 
some kind of weird integrity.

But I was wrong. Where's the coal...
