Remember, the Government isn't speaking English, they're speaking
Bureauspeak,which is a more verbose version of Newspeak,
so most of us here are non-native speakers.

There'll be lots of *questions*, like "Who's getting baked?"
and "When can we impeach the Vegetable?", and
"Oh, my, what absurdly offensive thing will they come up with this time?".

On the other hand, the announcement only says that the _media_
need to have Government-Issued ID and Official Press Passes
and come in the Embedded Servants' Entrance.
Wear your overalls and bring a box of pumpkins and cabbage
and you can walk on in the front door with the other farmers.
Probably have to leave your pitchfork behind,
because even the Bush League gets nervous around peasants with pitchforks,
but no problem if you've got your cell-phone/camera/recorder.
Too bad it's past tomato season on the East Coast....
