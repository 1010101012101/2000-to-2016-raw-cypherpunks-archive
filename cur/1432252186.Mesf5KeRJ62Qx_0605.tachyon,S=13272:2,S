It's an enduring disappointment to those of us too security/privacy conscious to install Google Play that Moxie refuses to distribute signed APKs through any other channel. It also confuses the heck out of me that someone who makes an app *explicitly* to guard against intermediaries doesn't actually understand why I might distrust Google as much as my network provider.

Anyways, without a Google account Redphone performs very poorly, so I don't use it, but I've got a good network of Textsecure users going based on self-compiled, unmaintained APKs, precisely the outcome Moxie claims Google Play helps prevent. Bad Incentives, I guess.
