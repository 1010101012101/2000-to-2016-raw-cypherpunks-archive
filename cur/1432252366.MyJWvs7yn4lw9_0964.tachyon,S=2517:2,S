[Note from Matt Gaylor:  I've been on this list for a couple of years and on
occasion I find the discussion lively and interesting. It's coming from Kent
State University, the place where actual real assault rifles were used May 4,
1970 to wound 9 and kill 4 student war protesters. Ohio Guardsmen opened fire
during a noontime demonstration.  For a chronology of the shooting please go
to: http://members.aol.com/nrbooks/chronol.htm. I can think of no better way
to
remember the fallen, than by discussing liberty via the school they
attended.]
