BIND-PE is a "personal use" automatically installed DNS (Domain Name 
System) caching only name server. Similar to (but more efficient) than 
using your default ISP DNS servers.

BIND-PE is a complete DNS Server based on the "ISC BIND 9.2.1" engine. 
BIND-PE once installed will act as a fully recursive and caching 
multi-threaded DNS Server (default), with persistent cache capabilities 
(cache will be maintained between reboots), this will speed up your 
Internet resolving queries and make name resolutions much more reliable. 
BIND-PE Version 1.0 distro is aimed at home/SOHO users on WinNT4 SP6, 
Win2000 and WinXP workstations.
BIND-PE simplifies the task of installing and correctly configuring the DNS 
service using a completely custom BIND compile for WinNT Operating Systems 
with an automated "One-Click" setup process for Dial-up, Cable modem, and 
DSL networks for workstations. Post-install manual changes to 
configurations are compatible with the standard ISC BIND 9 configuration 
syntax and examples. For your convenience, a Control Panel similar to BIND 
8 versions is active and included with on screen data details (instead of 
write to file).

All standard as well as new TLD's (.aero etc.) are included and accessible 
for DNS name resolutions and browsing. Alternate TLD's like http://BBC.news 
and http://Atlantic.Ocean (almost 200 additional TLD's) websites which were 
not normally available in Legacy setups will now be viewable in browsers.
