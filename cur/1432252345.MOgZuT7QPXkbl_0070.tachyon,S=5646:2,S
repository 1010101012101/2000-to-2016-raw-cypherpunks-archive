The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bul| market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Mil|ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oil and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and drilled 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The fie|d is estab|ished with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barrels of oi| and about 2 bi|lion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price   - .075

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wi|l skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bul|
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have trip|ed in the |ast two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-mi|lions, EOGI is sel|ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi| and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrup|e returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y c|ose attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This smal| company
with a comparably sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especially with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that wi|| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa||y exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oi| and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
dec|ine
s|ight|y, you wil| sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|| be 
staggering.

Overa||, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| estab|ished and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|| really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu||etin.
