Data point: My mom is a deputy working as a county jail guard in upstate
New York. New inmates are kept in isolation for a few days. They get a
TB tine test as soon as the nurse gets to them, usually about a day,
then stay in isolation for three more days until the test is done. They
also have a medical history screen, but that's just paperwork. Blood is
not drawn as part of in-processing. Female inmates also get a pregnancy
test, but that's pure butt-covering; some NY county recently had legal
trouble because a preggo wasn't identified; details unknown to me.
