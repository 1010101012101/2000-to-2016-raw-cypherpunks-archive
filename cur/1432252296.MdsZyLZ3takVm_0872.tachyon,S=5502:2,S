Translate this semantic debate into "bomb-making instructions." There 
are various forms of the recipes for making a bomb, ranging from a 
very high-level description to a highly-detailed recipe that nearly 
any moron could follow. At which point is the description illegal 
under the Feinstein type of proposal?

And where does Felten fit into this spectrum? Felten and his 
co-workers say they were threatened with a DMCA suit (civil, I 
presume) if they went ahead and presented their research. (The 
recording industry claims they had no plans to sue...)

The language of the DMCA, which several people have been debating 
here for the past week or so, certainly suggests that Felten and Co. 
could have been sued, even prosecuted criminally, under the DMCA. 
This is my reading.

To get back to the "high level" (source code) vs. "low level" 
(executable) point, there is no meaningful difference between the 
two. Just a mapping, via either "knowledge" or a "compiler." If 
detailed bomb-making instructions are banned, then the law will have 
to "back up" into more general instructions and then back further.


The critical point is that Congress is now in the business of 
criminalizing mere speech. mere research. Whether one quibbles about 
whether hackers "understand" the instructions on how to bypass crypto 
protections, or whether bombz d00dz "understand" the chemistry and 
physics of their bombs, the new outlawing of crypto instructions and 
bomb-making instructions is the issue.
