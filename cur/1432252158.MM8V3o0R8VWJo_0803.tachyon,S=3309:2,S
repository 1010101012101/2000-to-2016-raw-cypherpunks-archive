Possibly related is this:

Let's say you are in some garden variety Ubuntu and as of May 5 or
thereabouts, you were happily sitting on the best version available of
OpenSSL which would be (as of April 2014): OpenSSL1.0.1g 7 Apr 2014
And then sometime late on May 5, 2014 you decided to do this in your
terminal...

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Oh, well that was interesting

Now go back in and do this

openssl version -a

Wait a minute...

yes, most people are going to have to go back in and

curl https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1g.tar.gz | tar xz && cd
openssl-1.0.1g && sudo ./config && sudo make && sudo make install

History repeats itself
