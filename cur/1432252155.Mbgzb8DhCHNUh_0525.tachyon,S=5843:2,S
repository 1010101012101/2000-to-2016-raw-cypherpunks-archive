|

| 
| On one hand you're bitching that you have to use Microsoft software on the

| want to and don't care to and won't upgrade to it.
| 
| You want to make a difference?  Go ahead, wipe every bit of Microsoft

| 
| Right now all you're doing is bitching that you're forced to buy and use
| Microsoft Office.  I say that's bullshit, and you know it.
