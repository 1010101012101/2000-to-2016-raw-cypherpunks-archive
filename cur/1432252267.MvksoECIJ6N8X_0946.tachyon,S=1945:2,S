In Missouri you'll find that dead people are quite real - hell, we elected
a dead guy recently :-)

As for *kids*, we recently had an 11 year old bride (legal here with
parental consent) who was on the news for being the youngest *divorcee* at
12!  Why not give her the vote?  She can't do any worse than the rest of
these rednecks.

Yours, From Sunny Wonderful Missouri...
