vs. rebranding them and transferring them to the next front in the
U.S. led "globalist" economic conquest of the world, as was done with
the "Peace Loving People of Libya" who pushed the Libyan army 2/3 of
the way across the country in a couple of weeks with U.S. close air
support and tactical direction.  The more "portable" elements of that
mercenary force were shifted to the Iraq/Syria border, both to get
them out of the way of pacification operations in Libya and to further
the National Interest through murder and terrorism in States that
"need to fail" before they can be properly looted.
