Right. Pay cash, and don't lodge any "want list" with the dealer, or
anything else that would reveal your identity.

I believe that there exists, or existed, a debit card on the prepaid
phone card model. Show up at a retail "card store," give them cash and
get a debit card with a "credit limit" equal to the value of the card.
The card behaves like a credit card for retail purchase purposes, but
doesn't have your name on it or associated with it in any database.
Anybody know if this is still being offered?

Sort of a private Poste Restante. Neat.

Unfortunately, the Postal Service puts pressure on the retail mail
outlets to have their customers complete a Post Office form that
"identifies" them. I can't remember whether the outfit I used actually
asked me for ID, though.

Relatively easy to defeat, in any case. If the identifying feature for
picking up the parcel is a number or code, rather than a biometric
feature, the simplest disguise would do the trick. You would not have to
look like anyone in particular, least of all yourself. I predict a spike
in the sale of Groucho Marx masks.

Hmm. Fundraising activity, anyone?
