Holy Shit!

I point I made back in the May days was that a Blacknet able to accept 
anonymous trades would really have a major impact on the business world. 
Imagine getting early wind of some acquisition and then you could start 
trading on that? That would eliminate a lot of the bullshit 'arbitrage' such 
deals are often made out of, based on the rest of the world not knowing. For 
the deal to make sense, it could only survive on the basis of really being 
accretive to both companies.

This can't possibly be too anonymous, though. But one wonders if clever 
endpoints might be able to augment Liquidnet's own anonymity a bit!
