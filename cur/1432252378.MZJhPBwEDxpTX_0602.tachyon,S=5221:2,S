Holding terror suspects breaches rights, rules tribunal
July 31 2002
A British tribunal today ruled that detention without trial here of nine 
foreign terror suspects under emergency laws imposed after the September 11 
attacks breached European human rights regulations.
The Special Immigration Appeals Commission said Britain's new 
anti-terrorism powers, rushed through in December, were "not only 
discriminatory and so unlawful ... but also disproportionate".
In a ruling which dealt a blow to the government, commission chairman 
Andrew Collins said the laws were unfair because they allowed the detention 
of foreign nationals only, even though British citizens may have been 
equally involved with terrorist organisations.
It therefore breached the European Convention on Human Rights.
