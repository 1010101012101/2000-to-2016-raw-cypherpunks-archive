Capturing and analyzing the traffic between the browser session and the bank
would be a good place to start.

I believe there is a tool for Windoze that will let you packet sniff (even a
PPP) connection.

My employer blocks certain versions of browser's from going through our
firewall because
of reported security vulnerabilities. Yeah, I know it's easy to spoof, but
it insures that our "less sophisticated" users upgrade.

The bank may have been concerned about a security problem in the version of
the browser you were using.

<Conspiracy theory mode=ON>

Then again, they could of just said that, I guess (unless they were doing
the "security through obscurity"  bit).

You could try getting the source for Mozzilla, verifying it,  compiling it,
and then trying to access your bank.
