To Members and Friends of the Los Angeles Gerontology Research Group:

B B B B B B B B This just in from Chris Peterson, VP of the Foresight
Institute... -- Steve Coles

Dear Foresight members and friends,

B B B  We've launched a new project here at Foresight b the Open Source
Sensing Initiative:
http://opensourcesensing.org

The sensors are coming and they'll be greatb&

B B B B B B B B As you know, nanotechnology is enabling ever-smaller,
ever-cheaper sensors b ultimately able to detect and report on
basically everything that happens, down to the molecular level.
This can be a huge benefit to medicine, the environment, and security.
 Imagine being able to locate and tax pollution, instead of having to
tax income, for instance.B  Consider being able to easily tell if
bioweapons are present.

B B B B B B B B But therebs a potential downside b such sensors would be very
useful in the control of civilian populations.B  Think of your least
favorite governments: wouldn't they appreciate such a tool for
detailed monitoring of the actions of a population?

B B B B B B B B Some of us have become resigned to a new age of total
surveillance, seeing it as inevitable.B  Others feel that privacy is an
important tool in the protection of civil liberties, and are willing
to sacrifice other benefits to maintain that privacy.

We can have the benefits without the downsides, IF webre smart about it

B B B B B B B B But as the graphic on the Open Source Sensing home page
suggests, we may not need to give up either security or privacy/civil
liberties.
Consider the lesson of electronic voting: we have learned that the
software and data handling need to be open, but the raw data b who
voted for whom b need not be public, as long as we understand and
trust the voting process itself.B  It need not be public, and it should
not be public.B  Itbs the process, not the raw data, which should be
open.

B B B B B B B B  This same principle can apply to sensing when privacy is
impacted: letbs make the process open, not the raw data.B  All we need
is the desired answer (bIs bioweapon X here?b), not total knowledge of
all events (bJohn just attended an unapproved political meetingb or
bSusie's been smoking something naughtyb).

We need clever systems design: how to get it?

B B B B B B B B  How can we make this happen?B  Foresight membership overlaps
heavily with the software profession, especially the open source
community.B  These groups grapple daily with the tradeoffs between
security and privacy, and have come up with useful tools and processes
for teams to use in working through the technical implementation of
these values.

B B B B B B B B  The Open Source Sensing Initiative proposes to apply the
tools of open source software to this new domain, to advance the
immense practical benefits for the environment, health, and safety,
without crossing the line into unnecessary total disclosure of every
aspect of individualsb lives.

Your role and Foresightbs role

B B B B B B B B  If webre successful, open source sensing will grow far beyond
any one organization, just as open source software has.B  At this early
stage, to get it off to a strong start, Foresight is playing the
coordinating role.
Itbs a huge project, but itbs the right way to go as we move into the
Sensor Age.B  You can help: see the website at
http://opensourcesensing.org, check out the slides and video linked to
on the home page, let us know of your interest, and consider donating.

B B B B B B B B  Because although this is an open source-style project, and we
hope for lots of volunteer help, we are dealing here with physical
systems rather than software, and costs will be much higher than for
software projects.
Like all open source projects, this is bbottom-upb b it depends on
help from a wide variety of people.B  We hope to get your assistance:
your ideas, skills, and donations.

Best wishes,

Chris Peterson
VP, Foresight Institute
Coordinator, Open Source Sensing Initiative

PS:B  Please, before you move on to your next task, take a few minutes
now to check out opensourcesensing.org, visit the blog, and hit the b
Make a Donationb button.

If youbre considering a major donation, phone +1 (650) 289 0860 ext
255 or E-mail <peterson@foresight.org >.
