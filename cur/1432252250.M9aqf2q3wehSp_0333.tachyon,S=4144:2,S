	What is the real threat model?

	Everybody has different worries. I'm not a bookie, I don't do 
work for the mob, I don't spend more than I earn. My biggest threat 
is (1) financial (stolen credit card numbers, or other form of 
credential fraud) (2) Political--that comments here and other places 
get me the list of "People To Take Care Of Later".

	The first threat can be dealt with by "cheap" crypto deployed 
everywhere--to co-opt one of RAH's phrases--a "Geodesicly  encrypted 
network. In a network where every single stinking bit on the wire is 
encrypted at as many layers as possible, even with "10 cent" crypto 
will virtually eliminate (by making it more expensive) many of the 
low level financial threats. Yes, big banks and large financial 
institutions need stronger crypto, but they can multiple-encrypt, 
write their own protocols etc.).

	The second threat would be made much harder by the encrypt 
everything all the time type of network, if I weren't so thick headed 
as to insist on using my Real Name. This is presumably what the "PGP 
Community" veered off towards. Unfortunately, they've done a 
half-assed job so far.
