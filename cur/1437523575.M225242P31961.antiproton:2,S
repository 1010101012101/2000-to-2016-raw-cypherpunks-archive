	Thanks coderman. I was slightly annoyed thinking I might have
	to search the archives to back my claim  but you've fully
	embarrassed yourself (yet again). Appreciated.

	Of course. If I were murdering people left and right, or
	commiting any of the endless list of crimes your government
	commits, they you'd be quite sure that I have GOOD intentions.


	But, since I'm not buying any of your stupid propaganda, you're
	not sure if I'm an outright terrist...or somebody sitting at a
	desk near you, right?

	Ah yes. You are right. The real problem with the NSA and the US
	gov't  in general is that 'now' they allegedly started spying on
	AMERICUNTS! 

	How did jesus allow such monstrosity to happen? I mean, burn
	brown people abroad? Of course. Fun and profit!

	But spy on white anglo saxon AMERICANS??? How did fucking g-d
	let that happen.

	We all pray for the NSA to go back to its defensive
	anti-terrist activities.

	Sure. Google and the cloud now are password protected. Nice.
