First we should thank Eric for doing an absolutely spectacular job of
running his node. I've been running moderated and unmoderated lists
since 1994, and, take it from me, dealing with administrative stuff
is a thankless task. You're far more likely to deal with people who
are angry than thankful.

I like Bill's suggestion, and perhaps it's possible to use disposable
email addresses (cp-20030512@lne.com?) for replies? 

But I don't understand why an extra 100 messages a day or even 1000
messages a day would be a big deal for a server with a fast Net connection.
If it's DSL or cable modems, that makes sense.

But if it's on a server with bandwidth charges, and that's the issue,
does it make sense to take up a collection to offest the cost? (I'm
thinking of asking for the same thing with Politech, since server
hosting is getting expensive.)
