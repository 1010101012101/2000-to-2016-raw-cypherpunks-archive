No, I was really quibbling over the terrorist bit.  Even the
government can no longer make a straight-faced claim they're
terrorists.  Now, they need to explain how they're ignoring the civil
rights of people, who, as you point out, are being held incommunicado, 
and, in my non-lawyerly not-really-all-that-humble-opinion, how their
action differs from kidnapping.

Indeed. Amazing how quickly we can lose the value of so many
hard-fought precedents.
