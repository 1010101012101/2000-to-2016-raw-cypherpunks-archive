As you note later, most recent releases to the Net are often lower quality 'cams' shot with consumer quality camcorders.  But not all.  A number of individuals or groups have managed to consistantly create and distribute VHS or better releases.  While not DVD in quality on smaller screens (say below 27-inches) they are more than adequate, sometimes better than the average quality of analog cable reception.  See www.vcdquality.com for recent releases and quality ratings.
