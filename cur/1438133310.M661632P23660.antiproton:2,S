Of course you're going to fail if you keep saying no and FUDding yourself.
Is anyone building "cars" or is it such a big task that...

Competition, so what? Leech what's been done before you.

You don't need a $50B 1Msqft setup to start making chips, you need
a floor in a warehouse and some people who believe.

Universities have always had fabs too.
The cost to get a basic line going at some tech level is not prohibitive,
it's an adventure.
Open is your differentiator and your ROI, even private runs will come
paying to you because they know your ground up construction and
monitored production process can't inject warez in their silicon.
Can you as a reasonably learned hobbyist go observe an Intel run
through GloFab from start to finish? What about for the chip inside
your phone? Your makerbot? Your RPi? Your USRP? Your own mask?
No? Well... that's a problem.
