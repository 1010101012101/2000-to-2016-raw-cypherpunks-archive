The Victorian police being in possession of my cs latitude dell laptop and 
the e-mail adress proffr@fuckmicrosoft.com
and the passwords to all the steg Ive stored online,seem intent on trying 
to entrap me by posting fake threats,calls to
brake various laws in various places and so on.They are even tampering with 
forwarded material and inserting mistakes
and gratuitous insults in a manner that reminds one of the CoinTelPro days 
of yore.Father forgive them for they know
not coco-nuts.
Stephen Cough and Leigh Gassbag are eminent Victorians that simply want to 
exclude Mexicans.Anyone in Cali will
understand that.They no more deserve to be assassinated than Governor 
Greyshite and Dianne Veinstain do.

This type of buggery must surely wipe out the fascist United States as 
surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The 
views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers, associates, 
or others. Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of those people, I 
doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the first place...
