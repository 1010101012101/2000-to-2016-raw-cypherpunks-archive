So, what can be done with that Tor node once it's set up?  It can't be
used interactively (i.e. with low latency) because that "permanent
record of all of your transactions in Internet-space" can be used
today or tomorrow or "next year or next decade or ..." to correlate
packet timings and destroy whatever anonymity the Tor node might
otherwise have had.  And if the Tor node is configured to respond to
instructions anonymized by a remailer network, the remailer network
might as well have by used by itself in the first place, without the
Tor node in the picture at all.

    Long, random latency is part of the price of Internet anonymity.
