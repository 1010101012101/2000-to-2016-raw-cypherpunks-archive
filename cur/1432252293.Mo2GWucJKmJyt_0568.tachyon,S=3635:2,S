Before you start, save all the important stuff you're working on. 
But don't save it in any format (such as .doc, .xls, etc) that 
can include executable code.  Just go for plain text or comma-
delimited ascii.  Put that on a floppy disk.  Once you've done 
that: 

1) Run out and buy a Linux distribution.
2) Stick the bootable CD in your hard drive. 
3) turn the machine off and then back on. 
4) follow the prompts.  Answer "Yes" when it asks whether you 
   want to repartition/reformat your hard drive. BE SURE you 
   tell it to use the whole drive.

This will not only get rid of your virii (plural), it will 
make your machine run faster and make it more stable.

PS. You realize that attached to the message you sent was 
another Macrovirus, don't you?
