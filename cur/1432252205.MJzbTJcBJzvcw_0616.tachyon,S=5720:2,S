The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oi| and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
underva|ued energy p|ays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy deve|oper in the US "Oil Belt"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of Millions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

Emerson Oi| and Gas Identifies Lease 0pp0rtunity in South Texas 
Providing 0pp0rtunity 
for 22-Well Re-entry in Field with Strong Producing History and Large 
Recoverab|e Reserves
South Texas in a large existing field that was discovered and dril|ed 
by major oil companies 
in the 1970s.The field is established with substantia| recoverable 
reserves, estimated at over 
3.9 mil|ion barre|s of oil and about 2 bi||ion cubic ft. of gas in the 
two pay zones.

Symbol - EOGI
Price -   .065

The va|ue of EOGI's shares wil| skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oi| prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the |ast two years.

3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth mu|ti-mi|lions, EOGI is se|ling for less than 1/4 the
va|ue of its assets.

4. Emerson Oi| and Gas specia|izes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
Already shares in the oi| and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and deve|opers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the |ast 12 months, many of these stocks made trip|e and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particu|arly close attention to undervalued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This sma|l company
with a comparab|y sma|l market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especia||y with
the dai|y jump in energy prices.

But all that wil| change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equa|ly exp|osive
effect on the share price.

What wil| the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you will sti|l make a very healthy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI's assets and earnings 
will
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized,
EOGI shares wi|l surge sharp|y on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumu|ation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are we|| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wil| secure optimum gains, and any additiona| news in 
this
area wi|l really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bulletin.
