Yes, you do need at least one, but perhaps you _only_ need one. Check out
the story in EETimes at http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20000831S0019

<sigh> People seldom read the errata for books. 

>From http://www.counterpane.com/ac2errv30.html:

* Page 157: The section on "Thermodynamic Limitations" is not quite
correct. It requires kT energy to set or clear a single bit because these
are irreversible operations. However, complementing a bit is reversible
and hence has no minimum required energy. It turns out that it is
theoretically possible to do any computation in a reversible manner except
for copying out the answer. At this theoretical level, energy requirements
for exhaustive cryptanalysis are therefore linear in the key length, not
exponential.
