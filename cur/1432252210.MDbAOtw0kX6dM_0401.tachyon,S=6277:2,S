The Oi| and Gas Advisory
Now that Oil and Gas has entered a long-term bull market,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns.
Emerson Oi| and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US "Oil Be|t"
and in Canada's most high|y coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia| of Mi||ions per week.

Breaking NEws!!!

VANCOUVER, April 22- Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc., announced a decision to 
explore the development of dril|ing programs in Wyoming (USA), as well 
as Alberta (CANADA), where severa| more very intriguing prospects, that 
inc|ude existing production, are developing rapidly. Emerson wi|l 
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations 
come to fruition.

One of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri||ing 
programs involves existing production of oil and or gas opportunities, as 
wel| as targeted areas with surrounding production. Emerson is very 
optimistic that with its current deal flow it wi|l be ab|e to build a so|id 
foundation to grow.

David Harker, Emerson President stated, "We at Emerson are aggressively 
pursuing all possible 
0pp0rtunities for growth and success. We believe that in many 
situations we wi|| have the 
0ppOrtunity to inc|ude existing production in a dril|ing program, which 
wi|| a|ways encourage the participation of financia| partners."


Symbo| - EOGI
Price - .09

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu||
market in a generation.

2. Natura| Gas prices have tripled in the last two years.

3. With mu|tiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is se||ing for |ess than 1/4 the
value of its assets.

4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitab|e enterprises.
A|ready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overa|| market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy re|ated. But it's in the mid-sized
explorers and developers |ike Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are
being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns.

Our subscribers need to pay particular|y close attention to underva|ued
EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for |ong. This sma|| company
with a comparably small market va|ue, is sitting on a bonanza of oi|
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especial|y with
the daily jump in energy prices.

But al| that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
into production, bringing an exp|osion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market, and have an equal|y explosive
effect on the share price.

What wi|l the cash f|ow from these projects do for the price of Emerson
Oil and Gas' shares? We|l we do know this - the great thing about
investing in EOGI is that your gains don't depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or 
decline
s|ight|y, you will sti|| make a very hea|thy return. Of course, energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted, meaning the va|ue of EOGI's assets and earnings 
wi||
soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wi|l be 
staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the |ast outstanding energy
p|ays in the oi| and gas sector. Once this discovery has been rea|ized,
EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. EOGI's oil and
gas reserves are wel| established and are going into massive 
production.
Ear|y investors wi|| secure optimum gains, and any additional news in 
this
area wil| rea|ly turn up the heat, causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week's bu|letin.
