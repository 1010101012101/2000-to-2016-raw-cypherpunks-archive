I'm torn between this "social retardation" explanation and the feeling that
Jim is obnoxious simply to get attention.  In either case, his social skills
certainly are INCHOATE (look it up, Jim).  I used to be pissed off by the
guy.  Now, I mostly just feel pity for him.

Yup, I don't have a kill fill, per se, but I've come to expect a very low
level of Cypherpunk relevance from Jim's random URLs as well as extremely
poor analytical skills when he does write something.  Jim either says too
little or way to much--and it's usually garbage.  I delete 95% of his stuff
without reading it.
