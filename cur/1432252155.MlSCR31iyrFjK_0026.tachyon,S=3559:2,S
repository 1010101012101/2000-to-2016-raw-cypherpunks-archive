The fact is that if clonning research is stopped then the low success rate
will continue. A self-fulfilling prophecy. If it is allowed to go forward
in a very short time (a year perhaps) the problems will be ironed out and
the success rate will exceed 'natural' (Grrrr Judeo-Christian ethics)
rates of success.
