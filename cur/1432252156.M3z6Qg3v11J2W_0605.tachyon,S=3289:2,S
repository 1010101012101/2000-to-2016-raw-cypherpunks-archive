Controversy Grows Over Judge Indicted For Possessing Porn

              Orange County Judge Gets Signed Petitions To Run For
Re-Election

                   LOS ANGELES -- Controversy is growing over an Orange
County
                 judge indicted for possessing child pornography.

                 Despite the indictment, Superior Court Judge Ronald
Kline is running for
                 re-election after getting signed petitions from some
fellow Orange County
                 judges, according to a CBS2 report.

                 Some of the judges pleaded ignorance, while others said
that Kline is
                 innocent until proven guilty.

                 In response to the petitions, attorney Gayle Sandoval
has launched a
                 write-in campaign to defeat Kline in the election.
