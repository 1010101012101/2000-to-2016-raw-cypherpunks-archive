More to the point, "piracy", meaning the auctioning of *any* copy,
for bearer form internet cash using protocols everyone on these lists
know by heart, is *desirable*, and, I would claim, inevitable.

Inevitable because it's cheaper, it already is, :-), but I mean
risk-adjusted transaction cost compared to book-entry DRM markets,
and, in addition, will put more revenue in the pockets of actual
innovators of new content.

Cheers,
RAH
