Yup, more info on U.S. congressional child rapists and other criminal acts  
and
collusion here
https://www.corbettreport.com/the-real-hastert-scandal-pedophilia-drug-money-and-blackmail/

Latest update: The U.S. District Judge on this case, a piece of shit fuck  
known as 'Thomas M. Durkin' colluded with the prosecution and defense to  
keep details of Hastert's crimes sealed via a plea bargain deal.

BTW, Durkin gave to Hastert's campaign and before he became a judge he  
worked in private practice with Hastertâ€™s son, Ethan. No conflict of  
interested there.

Amazingly, Durkin offered to recuse himself from the case but as you would  
expect both the prosecution and the defense said 'no'.

Forget about Jim Bell's Assassination Politics, what we need now more than
ever is "Castration Politics", where Darknet bounties for the genitals of
these sociopathic child rapists and their protectors are raised and then  
'harvested' by snatch
'n' snip teams.
