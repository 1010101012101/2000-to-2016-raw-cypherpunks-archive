FWIW, the other system we were referring to - TCP-MD5 - works at the TCP 
layer. It rejects packets within TCP, before any further TCP processing, 
that don't match the MD5 hash. It isn't BGP authentication.

This is why I refer to it as TCP-MD5 rather than BGP-MD5, even though 
the latter is more common.
