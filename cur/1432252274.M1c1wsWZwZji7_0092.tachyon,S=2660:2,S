The really peculiar thing about Bush's speech was that while he was
giving his war talk, you could see through the window behind him that
people were flying kites in the park.  How bizarre to juxtapose the
fragile innocence of kite-flying with the harsh reality of warfare.

And anyone notice that Rumsfield is losing it?  At his last press
conference he was shaky, he wasn't answering the questions, he was
trailing off and losing his train of thought.  Reminiscent of Reagan in
his second term.
