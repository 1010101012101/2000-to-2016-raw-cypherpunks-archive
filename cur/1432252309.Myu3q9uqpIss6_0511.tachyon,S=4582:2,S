"...It blows my mind that these VC guys, who spent 20 years blathering 
about Ayn Rand capitalism, don't just admit that they live and work in a 
stagnant monopoly. What a bunch of limp-wristed sissies these captains of 
industry turned out to be, all these swaggering mercenaries so eager to 
punch out the bureaucrats in the free market. They're a race of slaves! 
They're like deer in the market's headlights, they creep around like mice."
funny talk from bruce Sterling.
