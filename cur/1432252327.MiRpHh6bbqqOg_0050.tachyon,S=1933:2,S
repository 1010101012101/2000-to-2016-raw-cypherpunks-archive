Probabilistic Analysis of Anonymity
by Vitaly Shmatikov

Abstract: We present a formal analysis technique for probabilistic security 
properties of peer-to-peer communication systems based on random message 
routing among members. The behavior of group members and the adversary is 
modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain, and security properties are 
expressed as PCTL formulas. To illustrate feasibility of the approach, we 
model the Crowds system for anonymous Web browsing, and use a probabilistic 
model checker, PRISM, to perform automated analysis of the system...
