I don't think there is any doubt that people can die because of breached  
communications.  No need to look at the Iranians, just look at the US CIA, 
and the intel feeding into drones.

The question of causality is one that is very difficult to determine,  
absent some pattern revealed by WikiLeaks (who have been accused as well).

However causality is also very important.  Without some historical pattern 
of facts, we're all speculating to a greater or lesser degree. How 
confident are we of that?

This is a sadly inaccurate statement.  Most people working actively and  
aggressively against unconstrained governments know diddly squat about  
tech.  The communities have frequent roll-over, frequent recruitment. The 
techies working with them are under considerable pressure to deliver, and 
often make basic mistakes.

Yes, definately.  Open question:  did the 9/11 guys use HTTPS?  Or just  
HTTP?  I'm still searching for a case where it makes a clear difference.

(Their main counter-intel coup was to understand that the threat model  
better than their enemy.  Their technique was to open an ordinary Yahoo  
style account, share the account, then open up a draft email, and share  
that!  Never send it, just edit and delete, over and over.  The NSA which 
were presumably hoovering all sent emails ... never saw a thing.)

! OK, I'll bite.  How does one offload liability by using the cloud?



(Note that liability is the keystone to the PKI debate....  Understand the 
liability transfers and you understand why it's SNAFU.)
