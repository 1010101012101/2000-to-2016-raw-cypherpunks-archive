See the followup message with the exact text of the articles that I sent do 
you and the list. It's over 40KB, so while you received it, majordomo 
bounced it (perhaps the lne.com admin will approve).

True, but it's a pretty extraordinary quote that seems to have allegedly 
taken place in a private meeting; extraordinary claims require 
extraordinary proof, no?

Your faith in the American small-town journalistic establishment is 
heartening, but probably misplaced.
