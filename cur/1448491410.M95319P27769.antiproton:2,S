A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. =
(AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani)=20
Four days after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that shook Paris, Pavel Durov=
, the founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram, posted a photo on Inst=
agram of himself on a balcony in France. In the image, he is dressed in bla=
ck and looking off to the side, the Eiffel Tower in the background framing =
his stoic expression. If you saw it at a glance, you=E2=80=99d think it was=
 a tribute to the mourning nation. But then there=E2=80=99s this caption:=

r North African immigrants. It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of s=
hortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place.=E2=80=9D=20

Though otherwise confusing, the statement made one thing clear: Durov would=
 rather blame the tragedy that had befallen Paris on French taxes than call=
 attention to the way members of the Islamic state have taken to using his =
encrypted messaging app to communicate.=20

Funny that obviously everyone is convinced ISIS would use encryption and th=
e only solution being mass surveillance. The opposite is the case, they do =
everything in the open, for everyone to read. Example: http://worldanalysis=
.net/14/2015/02/dabiq-issue-7-content-warning/ page 72.=20
The lead terrorist of Paris Abdelhamid Abaaoud giving an interview and anno=
uncing the attacks.

Maybe the intelligence services should simply read the news.
