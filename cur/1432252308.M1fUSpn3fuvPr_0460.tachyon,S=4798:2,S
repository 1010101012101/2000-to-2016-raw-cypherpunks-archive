New World Coffee a NJ-based coffee and bagel (it bought Manhattan Bagels a 
while back) franchise company is seeking a TRO in New Jersey state court on 
Friday to try and shut down two disparagement sites.

www.NewWorldCoffeeFraud.com

www.NewWorldFraud.com

The company is claiming breach of franchise agreement by franchisees who 
are supposedly  saying unkind things about it.  It is also claiming that 
the domain names newworldcoffefraud.com and newworldfraud.com are likely to 
confuse innocent surfers looking for coffee.

The sites claim that NWC is guilty of fraud in selling franchises and lack 
of support for franchisees once they buy in.

The defendants have no lawyers and are proceeding in pro se.  The sites may 
be gone Friday night if the judge rules against them.

Get them while they're hot.
