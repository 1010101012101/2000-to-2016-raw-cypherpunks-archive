"Stolen code" isn't really an issue most of the time, but can be legally if a lot is used in a way that conflicts with a license. 
Reusing code snippets is, to a large extent, not really a copyright issue and often fair use or use of something that isn't really 
protected by copyright.  In any case, it is a legal issue separate from the security implications.

The FUD in question is whether there are security problems of some kind lurking in code, and whether it is easier to compromise a 
binary when you have source to start with.  The flip side is that it is easier to hide back doors in code that has limited access to 
source code.  Security mistakes, deliberate malware, and detection are possible in both cases, but in different ways, with different 
numbers of actual or potential people looking and with different likelihood of active positive or negative collusion.
