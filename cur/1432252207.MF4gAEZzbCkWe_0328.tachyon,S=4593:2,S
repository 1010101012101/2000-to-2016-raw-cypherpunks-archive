And you're proud you don't have to listen to folks before you stick 'em in
a box? Bullshit, Libertarians choose to call themselves by that label,
it's a self imposed box. Your criticism is without merit. Or perhaps the
ghost of Wittgenstein will walk through you...

Further, you misrepresents what he says. Check the archives, various
folks have made the distinctions between the various components of CACL
quite clear, it's why I always make it clear what the particular 'common
character' I am refering to when I 'lump 'em into one box'. It is also
clear that a global critique of one 'view' isn't necessarily applicable to
the other. In other words, there are a variety of issues with a
concomitent multiplicity of views that get pushed into 'libertarian'. His
point that this makes it hard to understand the fundamental characters to
qualify for 'libertarian' is valid. It also happens to be a valid critique
of its practitioners.

Exactly, and if the philosophy can't stand on it's own two feet despite
this then it deserves the ignomy it will receive.
