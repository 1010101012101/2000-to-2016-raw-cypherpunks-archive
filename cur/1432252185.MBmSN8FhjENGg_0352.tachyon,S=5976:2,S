Note the line: "the Court denied Simkanin the opportunity present any expert
defense witnesses or legal evidence".  

This is what our country has come to.  Secret courts; incarceration with no
lawyers, trials, or even charges; "trials" where the defendants are
prohibited from presenting any evidence; "Sneak & Peek" secret searches...

"The Terrorists" have indeed won: they are running this asylum.

Employer Simkanin Prosecution Ends in Mistrial 

Judge Stymies Both Jury & Defense 
DOJ Intends to Retry Simkanin ASAP

Jury Hung at 11-1 Favoring Acquittal 

After almost 6 months of incarceration in isolation awaiting his federal
trial, non-withholding employer Dick Simkanin's trial ended this evening
in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on federal
charges that Simkanin failed to Withhold taxes from his employees. 

Simkanin, a successful Bedford, Texas business owner, had been charged
with 12 counts of Willful Failure to Withhold employment taxes for his
employees and 15 counts of filing False Claims for requesting refunds of
tax pre-payments that had been made by Simkanin on behalf of those
employees.   

Facing years in federal prison, his trial lasted only hours, beginning
and ending yesterday - largely because the Court denied Simkanin the
opportunity present any expert defense witnesses or legal evidence
regarding the contested legal obligations under US income tax statutes.
Jury deliberations started this morning and the mistrial was declared
around 6 PM Central time.  Reports from sources close to the Simkanin
team was that the jury hung 11-1 in favor of acquittal.  (continued...)
