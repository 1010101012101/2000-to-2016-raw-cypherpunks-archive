Subject: [v-nv-mobilize] Gap's New Image

> Gap's New Image
>
> On Monday, June 18th Gap unveiled a new promotional
> display at stores nationwide.
>
> Faded black jeans hanging in front of an anarchist-red
> banner, the words "INDEPENDENCE," "FREEDOM," and "WE
> THE PEOPLE" scrawled across display windows in fake
> black spray paint.
>
> Despite the fact that Gap makes their clothes in
> sweatshops, and have been subject to many
> demonstrations across the nation, they believe that
> the growing movement against corporate power is now
> large enough to begin marketing on. Now the protest
> itself can be essentially sold to consumers as an
> image.
>
> However ridiculous this new marketing scheme seems at
> first, due to the tremendous power of corporate
> advertising over consumers, Gap just might pull it
> off, trivializing the movement against free trade, and
> selling jeans at the same time.
>
> The effect that this new marketing could have on the
> movement is tremendous. If Gap succeeds, it will mean
> that every protest that is staged will be building on
> their new image, in effect turning protestors and
> activists into living, walking ads for Gap. Further,
> if Gap succeeds it may become a trendsetter, and other
> corporations might follow.
>
> Currently, the majority of consumers are unaware of
> how Gap stands on "independence" and "freedom."
>
> Gap inc. is the corporation under which Gap, Old Navy,
> and Banana Republic exist. All three companies have
> been notorious for paying sweatshop workers as little
> as 11 cents per hour in the third world, denying them
> basic health care and the right to form unions, as
> well as harassing, beating and forcing contraceptives
> on them. Sweatshop workers generally work 12-14 hour
> days (although sometimes 24) and can be as young as 12
> years old.
>
> Although many of Gap's clothes say "Made in USA" they
> are actually produced in Saipan, a US territory where
> normal US labor laws do not exist.
>
> The Fisher Family that owns Gap also owns Mendicino
> Redwood Company, an active logging company that is
> deforesting the valuable redwood forests in Mendicino
> County, California. The Fisher family also has a
> notorious reputation for lobbying for privatizion of
> education and other public works in their home state
> of California.
>
> It appears that to Gap inc., "Freedom" and
> "Independence" only applies to the market, not the
> people.
