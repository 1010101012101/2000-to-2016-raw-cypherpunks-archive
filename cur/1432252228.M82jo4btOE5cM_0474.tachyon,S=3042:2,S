They claim to no longer need to prove that a person was planning a  
terrorist act. They claim that merely having terrorist tools is enough.

There are several pending examples of this, discussed here. One guy up  
in the Northwest is facing terrorism charges for possibly thinking  
about possibly making ricin, possibly to poison his wife. No, I'm not  
talking about Jim Bell. Here's a URL:

"Olsen would face life in prison if convicted of the federal charge of  
possession of a biological agent or toxin for use as a weapon. "

A good thing Bell was not being charged during the Permanent War.

(Also a good time to get rid of those teflon-coated frying pans. P.S.  
Don't do a Google search in this area, especially in the area of making  
Sarin and other agents using home kitchen and garage ingredients unless  
you are aware that Google has hired many former spooks to help  
coordinate their very voluntary snooping and narcing on user searches.)
