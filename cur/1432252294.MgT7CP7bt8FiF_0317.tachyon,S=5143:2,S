A Capsule History of the Dutch Provos
By Teun Voeten provos It's no secret that Holland has the most liberal drug 
laws in the world, especially when it comes to cannabis. What you may not 
realize, however, is that these laws were enacted thanks to the efforts of 
the Dutch Provos. The Provos set the stage for the creation of the Merry 
Pranksters, Diggers, and Yippies. They were the first to combine 
non-violence and absurd humor to create social change. They created the 
first "Happenings" and "Be-Ins." They were also the first to actively 
campaign against marijuana prohibition. Even so, they remain relatively 
unknown outside of Holland. Now, for the first time, their true story is 
told.
