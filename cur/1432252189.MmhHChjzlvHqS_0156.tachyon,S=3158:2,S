I think you mean so that the CA/IBE server even though he learns
pseudonyms private key, does not learn the linkage between true name
and pseudonym.  (At any time during a show protocol whether the
private key issuing protocol is blinded or not the IBE server can
compute the pseudonyms private key).

Seems like an incremental improvement yes.

Note PFS does not make end-2-end secure against an adversary who can
compute the correspondents private keys, as vulnerable to MITM.  Could
say invulnerable to passive eavesdropper.  However you might have an
opening here for a new security model combining features of Hidden
Credentials with a kind of MITM resistance via anonymity.  What I mean
is HC allows 2 parties to communicate, and they know who they are
communicating with.  The CA colluding MITM however we'll say does not
apriori, so he has to brute force try all psuedonym, attribute
combinations until he gets the right one.  Well still not desirable
security margin, but some extra difficulty for the MITM.
