hmm.. we're still talking about hamburg here, right ? you're right in so
far as since this is the first european cypherpunk meeting one can have
absolutely no idea how many people will be showing. depending on how well
announced the meeting is i'd guess > 50 people however (maybe the bay area
people can give us a rough count on how much people are showing to an averge
meeting there and we can try to extrapolate something from that - cultural
difference nonwithstanding :)... there were physical meetings in non-west-coast
places as well, dunno remember where however. the numbers for those should be 
a little bit more of a benchmark/pointer to us).
A cafe sounds like a good idea, we might try meeting at a mall, on a public
place or somewhere else however.
