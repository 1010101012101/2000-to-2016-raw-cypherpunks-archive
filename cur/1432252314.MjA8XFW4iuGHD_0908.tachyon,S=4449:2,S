Rinse, pre-soak over night, most beans cook in a reasonable time.

Water condensing on a cool surface may add heat quickly but many common
inks are water soluble. It is the heat that does the killing. With mail,
the problem is poorly conducting, but very thin materials. Dry roasting
ought to work. Temperature TBD, 160C+ from other info.

True, but then life is one great big microbial soup ain't it? What lives
on that leg of lamb when you throw it in the pan?

True, but you'd have to experiment with the stability of inks at high
temperatures - I was just musing that the chances of still being able to
see them would be better if oxygen were not available.

H2O2 is also a damn good bleach. Just look at Hollywood.
