I.e. you have to predict what the people want. Sane engineering, wouldn't
you say?

After which the one who gets the proportions right wins the game. The
others follow suit as soon as they can predict/acknowledge that their
prediction wasn't as accurate as it could have been. It's called
competition. Where's the problem?

You seem to be forgetting the costs of setting up the service in the first
place. If you factor those in, the producers certainly should be on the
receiving end.

OTOH, prices should be dynamic (derived from what is actually happening
inside the system), and should always permit negative values as well, to
account for unexpected flows of income. I think this is what you're after,
basically. One shouldn't determine beforehand who pays who, even if the
rates themselves are floating.

>Ideally the publisher should be able to pay the author for the work.

This is true, also. Price discovery is something not easily implemented
algorithmically. Perhaps MN should bill the services differentially based
on demand and blocks reserved? If there was a more lucrative author to be
served, the author whose blocks are currently being stored would have to
pay?
