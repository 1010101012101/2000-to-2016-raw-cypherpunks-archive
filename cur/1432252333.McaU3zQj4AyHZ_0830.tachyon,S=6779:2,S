Dear Diane & Larry:

I thought you'd be interested in this company, who perhaps could donate the technology to complete the tasklist for tagging the citzenry.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      AgInfoLink utilises leading data tracking and transfer technology to
       record, analyse, report and deliver information. These technologies make
       the process of data collection easier, faster and more accurate than ever,
       allowing high-speed and real-time capture of accurate data, and on-time
       transfer of information among individuals or networks.

Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID)

   A Radio Frequency Identifcation Device (RFID) is a device used
   for electronic identification. An RFID ear tag can be applied to
   an animal's ear in the same way as a visual ID tag. The RFID
   contains a microchip with a unique identification number and
   specialized micro-electronic circuitry (a transponder) for
   communicating this unique number to an RFID reader. 

   The RFID is called a passive communication device because it
   does not contain a battery. Rather, it uses electromagnetic
   energy received from the RFID reader to power the transponder
   and send a radio signal containing the unique identification
   number back to the reader. This number can then be fed directly
   to a computer for recording.

   RFID technology works in dirty, dusty and moist environments
   and does not require a direct line-of-sight to work. This means
   the technology works exceptionally well in livestock and
   carcase processing environments.

Barcodes

Barcodes are used extensively in many applications around the
   world, including on tags and labels. Barcoded eartags are available
   for individual animal identification. 

   Information is stored in the barcode by making parallel lines with
   certain thickness and gaps. When a barcode is scanned using a
   barcode reader, the reader decodes the barcode to reveal it's
   unique identifying number. The barcode scanner can be linked to a
   to a computer to record these unique numbers.

Genetic (DNA) Traceback

Every animal has a unique genetic makeup (it's DNA). Genetic testing to determine an animal's unique DNA profile can be used to trace the identity of meat products back to individual animals for source verification and quality assurance. 

DNA diagnostics can also be used to determine the parentage of animals to allow sire or pedigree testing and for the selection of livestock with desirable traits.

Via strategic partnership, AgInfoLink can offer our clients a number of DNA based
processes and services. These products include Gene Marker Technology, for carcase and meat quality, plus DNA services fingerprinting for parentage and traceback. An important part of these service includes DNA sample gathering and storage labels, for both meat/blood samples and for hair samples, plus services to store and analyse these samples.

   Example 1  Bull Selection.
   For cattle producers, selection of bulls is critical to introducing or modifying specific traits of progeny. It is not usually achievable to directly link performance of progeny animals and carcases to bulls because of multiple sire mating. Not all performance characteristics of stock and carcases can be attributed to genetics, however, genetics do play a major factor. If producers can be presented data that highlights animals as being exceptionally good or poor performers, it would be very beneficial to be able to know what bulls could be    linked, thus enabling replacement bulls to be selected that mirror the bulls linked to exceptionally good progeny. Bulls linked to poor performing progeny would be culled. To achieve the outcome of objectively based bull selection, AgInfoLink offers producers DNA sampling and Storage tools to gather DNA from Bulls at a property level and to gather DNA from progeny at a carcase level. AgInfoLink systems can be used to gather and store!
 live animal data and carcase data, plus, link the DNA sample numbers for live animals and carcases to eartag numbers carcase ticket numbers.

   Using AgInfoLink's reporting tools, key performance data can be reported to show exceptional animals (good or bad) and list their DNA sample numbers. Producers can identify progeny of interest. Using the DNA sample numbers stored in the AgInfoLink system, a DNA parentage test can then be undertaken DNA from carcases is then linked to bulls.
