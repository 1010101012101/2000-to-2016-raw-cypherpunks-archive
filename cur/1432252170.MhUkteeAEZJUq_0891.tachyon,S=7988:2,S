Damn it, Reese, I didn't say that. Can anybody here read between the lines?

That is not my attitude at all, Reese. I obviously like Tim's Blacknet.
However, I don't like it being characterized as a subversive tool, and damn
sure not in terms that might indicate a criminal conspiracy for shopping out
secrets to Libya.

Again, I was speaking within the confines of a very limited application
where authentication can be rather critical.

As I stated, I was examining it in the context of an _intelligence
application_. I wonder if that's a good contract, but obviously not....why
do I even bother? *sigh*

I was merely pointing out that people that crypto does not "beam" product.
Solve the ship-submarine ditching problem if you want to help that scum.

They've caught on to our "slow-the-conversation" tactic!! Oh, whatever shall
we do now? *slap to side of face* "Run some numbers?" What?

I flag posts in here that might qualify for Title I interceptions. This
month is looking to be a record-breaker.

Excuse me, my "handlers" are calling.....Sorry, I'm not allowed to talk
about this.

Damnit, I'm not censoring anybody. I believe in the First Amendment. It's
such a good source of intelligence and so often leads to probable cause.
