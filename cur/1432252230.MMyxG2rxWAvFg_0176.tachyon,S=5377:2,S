So why isn't it open for review *before* it's finalized?  Might it
give too many people an idea of what's really wrong with it?

Let's see it now.  Not after it's finisihed.

I want the drugs you are on dude.  You have a very rosy picture, and
it seems all your inputs have been hijacked by supreme chemicals!

And in the mean time the user can't control their own computer.

Very nice drug induced rant.  Too bad reality doesn't work that way.
Who owns the hardware?  The user or the RIAA?  True hardware protection
means the user is protected from Microsoft, not the other way around.

Palladium changed to NGSCB and will morph to something else and something
after that.  It won't ever fly because the user can't control their own
machine.

Trust is a two way street.  Until Microsoft learns to trust their
customers, nobody will trust Microsoft.  What we do in person we can do
on a computer.  We can con each other in person, so we'll be able to con
each other with computers.  That's how reality works, and no hardware
or laws is going to change that.

Instead of trying to wave a magic wand while everyone is on lsd, it'd
be better if Microsoft and the RIAA came out with their own hardware
for the specific purpose of DRM sales.  Everyone would know who owns
the hardware because they'd just rent it instead of buying it.  IBM
is already on the right track for this.  Microsoft has yet to get it.

Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
