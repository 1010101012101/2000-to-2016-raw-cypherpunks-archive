Electromagnetic bombs, or E-Bombs are a large threat to the United =
States as well as other countries. E-Bombs do exist and do cause =
catastrophic destruction. What they do is wipe out all electricity in =
the target area. They are just like a normal bomb, except they have a =
large coil of wire surrounding the explosive chemicals. Then there are =
generators that produce a large electromagnetic pulse. When the =
chemicals detonate, they explode outward touching the coil of wire which =
has current running through it. This causes a moving short circut. With =
the moving short circut and the magnetic pulse, the consequence is a =
lightening bult of electomagnetic pulse which sends waves of pulses that =
destroy all electric current running in any and all metal or electronic =
object. The result is a civilization which has lost all use for the =
technology it has had for 200 years. This has distressed the pentagon. =
The United States has taken many precautions to ensure the safety =
including equiping its bombers with the E-Bomb. Another fact that =
guarantees a threat of the E-Bomb is that the bomb is being sold on the =
black market to terrorists for $400. The E-Bomb demonstrates a new era =
of world terrorism and wars. And the reality is that no protection is =
possible for the E-Bomb at the current time. And any terrorist could =
attack at any time. Saddam is known to be researching this bomb and =
putting billions of dollars into it. I hope i answered your question =
