Depends on what you mean by "harm." If I can't pay my rent, I go bankrupt,
I can't put my kids through college, I lose my life savings and my respect
in the community, and get divorced, etc. -- some folks might count that
as harm. I would not say it is harm that has a legal cause of action.

(What am I doing wasting my time correcting Choate? Sigh.)
