I haven't said word one about 'what I expect other people to do'
(anarchist, troubelmakers, Baptists, or not). As a matter of fact, I
haven't even stated what I personaly believe to be the 'right thing to
do'.

The only statement of personal intent that I've made in this entire
discussion is that I don't intend to give permission for commercial use of
any cypherpunks material that I hold ownership of.

You should talk to Declan, with your ability to misrepresent and misquote
you're a natural for a job in the 'press'.
