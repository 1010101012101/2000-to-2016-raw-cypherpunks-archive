I thought it was "The news media will do anything for a story, even if they
have to manufacture it themselves".  Given that the US is currently obsessed
with terrorism, creating a sensationalist story related to it is a sure-fire
winner, even if the more accurate wording of "ABC ships expensive yacht
ballast to US" would get less attention.

(Come to think of it, I'm sure I could raise at least a moderate stink over
 here by letting it slip that some of the America's Cup yachts that were here
 earlier in the year may have had (shock, horror!) dangerous radioactive
 uranium in their keels, in violation of the government's anti-nuclear
 stance).

Peter.
