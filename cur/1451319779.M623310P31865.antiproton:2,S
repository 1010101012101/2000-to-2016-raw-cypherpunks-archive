I have this discussion with local social activists quite a bit. The=20
'roles/titles and position' ARE the important thing. The names change.
Structure doesn't. If you're a social activist and all you have going
for you is other people's personalities as a target you ain't got shit.
It's their FUNCTION that's important.

Extreme example? There's a local houseless person's 'activist' around
here that still writes leaflets containing info about how a cop that
hasn't been on the force for two years now abused people. Most of the
homeless people reading it then file it in the nearest trashcan.
