Now, if Penn and Teller had done the same thing, they'd say
"Of course it's a trick!  We fooled you guys,
and you couldn't catch how we did it!
People only use 10% of our brain capacity,
but we're using 15% of ours and you're using 5% of yours,
so tricking you is *easy*!  And we can do it again,
with Teller hanging upside down in a straightjacket
over a bed of nails!"

Occasionally you can see how they do their tricks,
usually in the "Mofo the Psychic Gorilla" schtick,
but that's because while you're catching them doing one trick,
they're actually setting up another one.  Mofo knows.....

BTW, Penn did a nice anti-Clipper rant in his computer column
about N years ago.
