Hi Honey Pie! 
I missed you! Where have you been?

I thought you would like to know I have a bunch of pictures 
of the girls at my school getting naked!! 

I set up my very own LOCKER ROOM CAM; You won't believe the 
shots I got! 

 >> Dildo pictures of experimental young things finding their 
    'hot-spots' for the 1st time!

 >> Tons of titties from tiny to massive… I never knew nipples
    could range from button sized to hubcaps!! WHAT A TREAT!

 >> Close-up pussy shots of bent, spread cheerleaders getting 
    it on with each other…

 I will send them to you soon! 
 As always, I'll be thinking of you!
 
   ~~> XOXO Heather
