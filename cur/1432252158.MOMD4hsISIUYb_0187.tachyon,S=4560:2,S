You still ratted on him, Sandy. There's no point in giving idle feds extra
angles to enter people's homes, preventably so. Even if nothing's there,
you can always plant envidence, if the person is deemed sufficiently
obnoxious by the authorities. (No, I don't know, and I don't want to
know).

Even if they just pay a friendly visit, I think there are much more
interesting ways to spend one's afternoon than having to deal with nosy
feds.

There's always a certain amount of testosterone flowing, and some
posturing on cpunx. These are males' natural weaknesses, and exploiting
them just because you can is usually considered bad personal style.

How is that relevant?

Oh yeah, I ratted on you, and you're solely to blame for that.
Makes sense.

Nothing goes over a little bit of comic relief. Haw! Haw! Haw!

I think you should keep these names and stories to yourself, even if they
do contribute to the local colorit.
