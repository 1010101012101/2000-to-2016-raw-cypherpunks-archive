if only one target uses an insecure configuration, it is still
potentially useful, especially given the ease of proxy bypass
techniques.

and for watering hole attacks, anything larger than zero hits is a win :)

clearly relevant.

not obfuscation; recognition of the defender's disadvantage.

as attacker (NSA) any vulnerability is relevant and potentially actionable.

it does; competence is not universally high and evenly distributed in
intelligence organizations.

the most technically accurate and detailed and informed information is
also the most sensitive, sadly. thus until ECI compartments get
spilled moving beyond the executive summary level presentations
difficult.

there are techniques for finding bugs in rich attack surface like the
whole of Tor Browser, Tor, Tor Launcher, OS integration of same which
can grant exploit developers a reasonable confidence of finding
exploitable holes.

in a minimal, hardened Tor relay configuration these same techniques
may never find an exploitable vulnerability. it is another order of
magnitude harder, and exploits here require leveling with novel
attacks or techniques, typically.

exploiting foreign servers? sure; but highly sensitive. e.g. TAO CNE.

legal hacks of domestic servers - FISA court would have to approve?

both of these are legitimate restraints, though we may argue about
their effectiveness.


over to Juan for retort,
 preferably with more substance to justify opinions this time :)
