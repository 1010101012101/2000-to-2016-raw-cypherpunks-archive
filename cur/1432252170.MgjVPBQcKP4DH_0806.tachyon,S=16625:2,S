i am a fucking anarchist which by the words you use in your writing that
point to your low level concepts - you probably have no clue about

you are a capitalist - making frames for others to fit your fucking lame
ass argument - pathetic

an anarchist DOES NOT generally have one goal - capitalists think that way
anarchists are node based thinkers capitalist are monolithic thinkers and
often frame things in a dualistic or black and white manner which is very
christian religion in form and thought pattern

capitalism is an economic model that has severe ramifications for society
it is no different than having a monarch really there is a degree of
difference regarding poverty but ... i heard today that if you are dying of
cancer in uganda you have a 10% chance of having access to morphine ...
they give cancer patients paracetamol ... thats your great capitalism i
find it disgusting

i dont think you understand that capitalism is well beyond an economy -
watch naomi klein

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka3Pb_StJn4

with capitalism the iraq invasion happened within its frame

black sites torture sites around the globe where conducted within the frame
of capitalism > gitmo 'lives' inside the frame of capitalism

i dont think you understand anarchy or anarchistic thought processies at all
