Many evolved diseases _DO_ kill their hosts. Look around.

It is true that there are tradeoffs in lethality, time to death, and 
virulence, and that a disease which kills too quickly and too many 
won't spread adequately, but quite clearly all of the diseases of the 
past were evolved (until recently, none were created) and yet they 
often killed their hosts.
