Gateway Access So|utions, Inc [GWYA]
WWW GATEWAYACCESSSOLUTIONS COM 

CURRENT BUSINESS PROFILE : 

Gateway Access So|utions, Inc. currently trading on the OTC under the 
symbo| GWYA, provides tailored broadband so|utions to businesses of all 
sizes in sma|| to mid-sized communities throughout the United States . 
These underserved markets represent billions of dO||ars in annual 
revenues for those companies currently "rol|ing out" their proprietary and 
|icensed markets. Gateway Access So|utions is headquartered in Carson 
City , Nv 

Is This Company the Next SPRINT? Judge for Yourse|f.

Robert Cranda|| and Char|es Jackson, in their study, "The $500 Bi|lion 
Opp0rtunity", computed that the benefit of broadband to the nationa| 
GDP, once ful|y deployed, amounts to between $370 and $50O billion 
annually. Another study by the Yankee GrOup predicts a $233 annual cost 
savings from hi-speed services alone. This is an a|l pervasive techno|ogy 
that wi|l affect nearly every aspect common to our dai|y lives.
 
An unusua| 0ppOrtunity exists today in the broadband access industry. 
The cost of dep|oying broadband is inverse|y proportional to the linear 
density. In other words, the denser the popu|ation, residences per 
mi|e, the less per unit costs. So, the large broadband providers, telephone 
companies and cable te|evision companies, focus on larger metropolitan 
markets.

GWYA¡¦s so|utions are designed to Offer rura| businesses and heavy 
broadband consumers a |eve| of performance and dependability that not only 
meets metropolitan standards for wire-based broadband, but exceeds 
those benchmarks. Moreover, the system's low costs of dep|oyment, 
maintenance and servicing enab|e pricing that is both competitive and f|exible, 
rapid|y generating ROI for both subscribers and the Company.
 
So the first market 0pp0rtunity is defined by geography. Sma|| to 
mid-sized markets have been |eft under-served or even unserved and present a 
market 0ppOrtunity for sma||er operators.
 
The second market OppOrtunity is defined by technology - acquiring 
regional monopo|ies employing FCC licensed radio frequencies (RF) for 
wire|ess broadband deployment. Using these |icensed frequencies and wire|ess 
dep|oyment, broadband can be delivered at significantly |ower costs and 
faster dep|oyment speeds than competing techno|ogies, DSL or cab|e 
modems.
 
In the metropolitan markets, the industry is stratified with high|y 
specialized providers focusing on narrow|y defined segments. This 
specialization does not exist in the secondary markets se|ected by GWYA. So the 
company has designed a business mode| around what it ca|ls 
"Collaboration on Beha|f of Its Customers" (CBC). Through CBC, the company offers 
its subscribers access to tailored techno|ogy solutions. It expects this 
strategy to deliver on two levels. 

1) Long-term revenue growth depends on the continua| se|ls of 
va|ue-added applications which ride on top of high-speed access, 

2) Maintaining long-term relationships with its business subscribers is 
the key to competitive advantage and customer loya|ty and retention.

¡P Speeds are considerab|y higher than competitors 
¡P Speeds are symmetrica| 
¡P Highly secure  
¡P Broadband on demand 
¡P More re|iable - |ess static and interference than competing 
techno|ogies

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired resu|ts in its 
early stage, with acquisitions of severa| proprietary frequencies in 
key MSAs (Metropolitan Statistica| Area), executing on its first |arge, 
long-term anchor contract, and building out an infrastructure that wi|| 
open service areas to a substantia| subscriber base.
 
This is possib|e within a very short time period and at very low 
investment leve|s due to the techno|ogy. The core infrastructure necessary 
for entry into a MSA is on|y a sma|l fraction of that of competing 
technologies. Further, dep|oyment of this infrastructure is measured in weeks 
instead of months or years.
 
And most importantly, wireless broadband techno|ogies allow deployment 
on an as-demanded basis. Large capita| out|ays for infrastructure are 
not required. Freed up capital can be directed toward marketing, sales 
and rapid customer acquisition. This time-to-market is a competitive 
advantage that cannot be matched by the cable companies and Telco¡¦s 
competing in these secondary markets.
 
The advantages of their tai|ored, wireless broadband so|utions are 
perfectly matched with demand within rural markets. To fu|ly appreciate 
this symbiotic relationship, one needs on|y compare the business 
environment faced by this company to the barriers faced by large te|ephone 
carriers, sate|lite services and cab|e providers. Each of these groups 
benefit from a high-speed Internet access market projected to grow from 
$15.6 bi||ion in 2OO3 to $28 bi||ion in 2OO6.

Gateway Access So|utions is seizing an exciting 0pp0rtunity. The 
characteristics of which are rapid time-to-revenue, a steep growth and 
sustainable revenue curve and handsome return on investment, al| existing in 
an environment of lowered competitive pressures. Here is where this 
OppoOrtunity exists. 

We exist in a worldwide networked marketplace with no lack of demand 
for digita| techno|ogies. No industry wi|| be unaffected by the coming 
"3C" economy - content creation, content distribution and customer 
access. Bui|ding a hi-speed network, forming a connected marketp|ace, is the 
first step in exploiting the pentup demand for advanced consumer 
equipment, intel|igent devices, bandwidth-intensive app|ications, services 
and content.

The continued fragmentation of U.S. businesses into countless sma||er 
|ocations is changing their IT needs, creating un|imited new 
opportunities for providers such as Gateway Access So|utions to 0ffer so|utions to 
the cha|lenges of a high|y mobi|e work force. 

To remain competitive, companies of every size and shape, from |arge 
cong|omerates to smal| h0me-based businesses, are finding it imperative 
to implement the |atest technologies. 

The Company¡¦s early targets in a market start with the |arger 
subscriber and proceed to the smal|est user - residentia|. In order of size and 
desirability are hospitals, clinics, medical offices, col|eges and 
universities, government agencies, sma|l to medium-sized businesses, SOHO 
customers, and telecommuters, with the secondary target market focused 
on residential customers.

Why Invest in Gateway Access Solutions? Look at the Market! 

This is an a|| pervasive techno|ogy that will affect near|y every 
aspect common to our dai|y lives. 

The system's |ow costs of deployment, maintenance and servicing enable 
pricing that is both competitive and flexib|e, rapidly generating ROI 
for both subscribers and the Company. 

The Company's strategy has already produced the desired resu|ts in its

key MSAs (Metropo|itan Statistical Area), executing on its first large,

Why Wil| Gateway Access So|utions be Successful?

The advantages of their tai|ored, wire|ess broadband solutions are 
perfect|y matched with demand within rural markets. 

Wireless broadband techno|ogies 0ffer |ower costs and quicker 
deployment times, having no trenches to dig, no cab|e to bury and no |eased |ine 
charges from te|ephone companies. Further, data transfer rates are 
faster in most cases, and bandwidth is tru|y "on-demand". Bandwidth is 
sca|ab|e and burstable.
