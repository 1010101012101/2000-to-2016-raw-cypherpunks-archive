I figure this list is as good a place as any if not better to discuss
this one. It is off of /. today. Just thinking that these ethos do still
apply, in my mind anyway. What needs to happen for them to be true is
education of the general population (Yes, I know it is a naive idea.)
Perhaps the day will come when a great enough (howvere small it may be)
percentage of web users are in f act savvy and somewhat computer
educated to manage to circumvent the bonds placed upon them, wether it
will be legally or not, the times will decide. --gabe

Taming the Web 
By Charles C. Mann September 2001  
   
"Information wants to be free." "The Internet can't be controlled."
We've heard it so often that we sometimes take for granted that it's
true. But THE INTERNET CAN BE CONTROLLED, and those who argue otherwise
are hastening the day when it will be controlled too much, by the wrong
people, and for the wrong reasons.
