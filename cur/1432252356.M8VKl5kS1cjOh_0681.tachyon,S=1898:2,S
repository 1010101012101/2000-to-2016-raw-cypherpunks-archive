There may be a solution but it requires a change in government 
structure.  For anyone who has looked, there does not appear to be any 
democracies that followed the American system after The Southern Rebellion 
and Lincoln's misbehaviors.  They all chose parliamentary systems where the 
elected leader is subject to a vote of 'no confidence' for removal (a 
process more akin to a civil trial than impeachment which is the equivalent 
of a criminal conviction).
