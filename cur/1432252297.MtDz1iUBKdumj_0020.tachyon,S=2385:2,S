 Cryptography regulations threaten OSS in SA
Published on: Tuesday, 28 September 2004, 19:40 GMT

South Africa's Electronic Communications and Transactions (ECT) Act of 2002
is a controversial piece of legislation. It attempts to address a whole lot
of issues at once, without seeming to do a good job of any of them.
Sections include a national e-strategy, e-government, electronic documents,
cryptography, authentication, consumer protection, the .za domain name
authority, and cyber crime.

 Chapter 5 deals with cryptography. It specifies the compulsory
registration of all "cryptography providers" with the Department of
Communications. The Act states in 30(1): "No person may provide
cryptography services or cryptography products in the Republic until the
particulars ... in respect of that person have been recorded in the
register..."

[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to
experience." -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'
