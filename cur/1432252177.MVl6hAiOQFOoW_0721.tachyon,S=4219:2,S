Actually it's not, it's a strawman to draw in more income.

If the auto vendor was really concerned about their vehicle they'd install
a govenor (like they did on the '64 1/2 Mustand for example) that would
limit the RPM's of the engine. Quick, easy, simple. A lot(!!!) less
expensive (about $20) and more reliable than a GPS receiver.

It's the typical bait and switch (typical of capitalist/libertarian goals
that is).

What's an example of why this process won't work? Consider the GPS is set
for 55MPH and the customer is doing exactly 50MPG (hence not being shown
as a speeder) but is in a 30MPH zone.
