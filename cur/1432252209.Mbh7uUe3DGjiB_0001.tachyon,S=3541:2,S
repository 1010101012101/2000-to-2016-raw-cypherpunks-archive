Phone set to speed dial an answering machine recorded police abusing and 
beating black man in Chicago.Cops fired.
Phone with vibrating silent alarm fished out of young womens rectum in 
Taiwan."We were experimenting"faustine chong said.Then there was the one 
that give's you a splitting Israeli headache.Thats in the archives 
already.(thanks jya.)
SMS,DoCoMo style texting is an official "killer app".All yakuza hitmen now 
check contracts and prices by cellphone now.
Soprano waste management is importing the technology.See New Jersey 
IMC.mattd in OZ used to get regular empty cellphone calls on his 
messagebank.0417 531 548.everytime he said "Kill the President"He wants the 
service reinstated.
Phonecalls on the web were tried by Taylor last year.He called NZ and it 
was like ham radio,with a satellite 1 or 2 second delay.Another net 
revolution but I digress.Faustine please call mattd for aural sex on 03 
5422 7207.check 17 hr timeslip.

  Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.
