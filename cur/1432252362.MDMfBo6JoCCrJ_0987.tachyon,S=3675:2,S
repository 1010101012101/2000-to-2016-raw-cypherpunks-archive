I think the capabilities claimed are bogus. What they claim for now is
describing bleeding edge functional neuroimaging, involving a clinical
setting with trained operators and lots of calibration, multi-Tesla
research fMRI imaging, and the like. Not a cheap setup, there are only a
few labs in the world who can do this.

It's hard to see a plain EEG (not even FFT EEG which at least can tell
which color you're thinking of, after lots of calibration) operated by
knuckledragger operators can achieve anything better than an unbiased coin
flip.
