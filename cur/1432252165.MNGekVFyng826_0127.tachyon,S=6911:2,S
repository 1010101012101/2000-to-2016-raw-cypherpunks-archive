The original laws and cases concerning wiretapping predate the case your 
talking about by quite a bit. California's law concerning intercepting 
telegraph communications, passed in 1862, made wiretapping illegal before 
the advent of the telephone. The first Supreme Court case dealing 
explicitly with wiretapping is Olmstead v. U.S. (1928) where the Court 
decided that wiretapping was not a trespass. (The reasons for this are to 
convoluted to go into here.) This precedent held until the late 60's when 
the Warren Court made two decisions that forced the Feds to implement an 
actual law that dealt with wiretapping.  The case you're talking about is 
Katz V. U.S. (1967) where the FBI put a tap on a phone booth without 
obtaining a court order.  This precedent was important because it held that 
the Fourth Amendment protected people, rather than places, and that 
wherever someone has a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as in a 
closed phone booth, is protected.


>Interesting to see what
>they say now.  Segues nicely with the CALEA/cellphone locator tech too.
The Court decided on essentially the same facts in U.S. v. Knotts when they 
held that placing a beeper in a drum containing chloroform used in the 
manufacture of illegal drugs was constitutional because it only extended 
the legal practice of physically following someone.  I doubt that the 
Rehnquist court is going to overturn that precedent. There was a case 
decided in 2001 which held that using a thermal imaging device to detect 
patterns of heat consistent with growing marijuana indoors was a search and 
needed a warrant. They do have some qualms about the cops using technology 
that's not available to the general public but I doubt they'll come up in 
this case.

The cell phone locator is getting shoved through the back door in the E911 
specs to save those people who get stranded in the East River while their 
drunk or drive off a cliff.  It's all for the good of the people of course.
