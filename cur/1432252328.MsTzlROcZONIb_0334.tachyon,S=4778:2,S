The actual credit card companies have never, that I know of, been 
implicated in any of the Net porn cases (I don't mean "child porn," I 
mean the various cases we have heard about over the past dozen years, 
a la "Amateur Action').

This may say that they have a good team of lawyers and that local DAs 
like to cherry-pick their cases to go after less well-lawyered 
targets. Or it may say that there is an element of scienter involved.

Scienter, i.e., knowledge. On the other hand, "ignorance of the law 
is no excuse."

Note that hotel operators are not held to be co-criminals when their 
hotel rooms are used for drug-dealing, prostitution (*), planning of 
crimes, etc.

(* Unless the hotel and/or its managers were knowingly involved, as 
is sometimes the case with hotels. But, still, if a murder or theft 
or whatever happens in a hotel room, the hotel owner is seldom 
charged.)

There should be similar inkeeper's exemptions for ISPs and payment 
intermediaries.

There are many examples where credit card companies are used in 
transactions which turn out to be illegal. So?

And the issue is not really whether the CC company "knows" what is 
being bought.

If I buy a gun with a CC number, and it turns out this was an illegal 
transaction, and the CC company clearly knew that a purchase was of a 
gun, does this implicate them?

How about CC numbers being used at flea markets, where a substantial 
portion of the goods being hawked are stolen? Or pirated (CDs)?

The notion of arresting those who act as financial intermediaries 
should be tested in the courts.
