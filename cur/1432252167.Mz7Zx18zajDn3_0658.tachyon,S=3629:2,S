Let's start with a set of sentences. Each of those sentences is a sequence
of connective, operators, and values that reduce to binary values. Our
job is to determine the truth or falsity value of each sentence in that
set. I further see no reason to suspect that the sentence set itself is
even countable (and even if it is it is still infinite in extent).

What you propose isn't possible. There are logical statements in the P
& NP class which are not provable. There is no way that you can say that a
set of sentences can at the same time contain insoluble members (and there
isn't a way to tell them apart since the test may itself be unprovable)
and have an algorithm which will solve all of them because you can solve
one of them.

Now if you restrict the problems to specific domains (since NP contains P
I'll talk only to NP) then we are injecting a distinction of class in
the NP and there goes our "if I can prove one of them I can prove all of
them".
