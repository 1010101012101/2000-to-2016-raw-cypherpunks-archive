- Present Status -
EnenKio is a sovereign state
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio was established in 1994 under
authority and by direction of Head of State and the hereditary
Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands. The Constitution of EnenKio established and set forth
the authority and responsibility of the government and established
duties and succession protocol of the Monarch and Royal Family. 
EnenKio is a Limited Constitutional Monarchy.  Representative
citizens, acting as Founding Fathers, ratified the Constitution,
recognized His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as Head of State, affirmed
their resolve in the Declaration of Sovereignty and determined the
boundaries of the new Kingdom of EnenKio. 
Notice that EnenKio was a new sovereign state was sent to
representatives of the Republic of the Marshall islands, United States,
United Nations General Assembly, UN Security Council, South Pacific
Commission, NATO, world media, Pacific Island nations and other
nations.  Legal action was then taken to set forth the claim against
the foreign occupational forces of the United States, which failed to
ever answer any actions and now stands in default with respect to
demands for compensation and for illegally occupying of the king's
ancestral lands.  The effect of legal demands filed in U.S. federal
court, unanswered complaints and failure to reply now have the force of
law in commerce, under national and international laws and conventions.
EnenKio is an "offshore haven for criminals and money launderers"
Actually, the United States did reply — not directly to EnenKio, but
with an insidious merciless campaign of disinformation broadly dispersed
across the Internet and to its trading partners.  One glaring example
is a U.S. Department of State Report which compares EnenKio to the likes
of Thailand, Colombia and Russia under the topic of "Money Laundering
and Financial Crimes".  This official report — International
Narcotics Control Strategy, 1998 — categorizes EnenKio as an Offshore
Financial Center.  This is a curious label as EnenKio has no bank, no
financial center and no money to launder.  It goes on to refer to
another state and "Enenkio" (sic) as "...mere figments of fertile
imaginations...", and as "...entirely fraudulent in intent and
practice."  The United States offers NO proof nor is it known to have
ever found any.  In fact, in February 2001, the Securities & Exchange
Commission, together with other federal agencies of the United States,
concluded an exhaustive investigation that failed to turn up even one
shred (or hanging chad) of evidence of impropriety — in intent or
practice.
EnenKio exists "only in cyberspace"
Such a claim might be made for Yahoo™, Windows Magazine™ or any
number of "dot.coms".  Why, the United States itself claims over
25,000 web sites hosting millions of pages.  Is this not a criteria
for existence in cyberspace?  EnenKio as a state has its roots in a
1987 document, but really, it is founded upon more than 2000 years of
historical lineage preceding the ascendancy of the Hermios Marshallese
family to their rightful, recognized traditional post.  The EnenKio
web site did not appear until 1998.  It is a mystery how any
reasonable person could examine the few dozens of posted documents, laws
and letters — thousands of pages are not posted — and then say:
EnenKio exists only in cyberspace.
Today's Challenge for Tomorrow's Future
Every avenue is being explored to raise capital for projects described
in the development plan. Bond, stamp and shipbuilding programs have
commenced.  Applications are invited for passports, business licenses
and ship registration.  For those qualified individuals who wish to
join this effort or encourage us to gain recognition among states of the
first order, we have a need for Consuls and Diplomatic representatives
in foreign offices, Trade Missions and other diplomatic posts.
Additional human resources and people knowledgeable in international
policy, diplomatic protocol, spaceport and aircraft operations,
telecommunications, shipping, manufacturing, chemical engineering and a
host of other disciplines will be required to design and attract
development projects and implement envisioned programs.  Contractual
arrangements for professional consultation and services in law, finance,
commerce, economics and others are being actively sought.
All who have an interest and are so moved, you are encouraged to submit
a Personal Involvement form.  By submitting the form, you will be
advised of the latest developments, provided an outline of needs and may
at some point be invited to actively participate in development and
promotion of EnenKio and to become a citizen of the fledgling nation.
Salutation
On behalf of the Second Monarch, His Majesty King Remios Hermios, His
Royal Highness Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios and all representatives and
citizens of EnenKio, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sincerely
acknowledges your involvement, interest, prayers and support.
