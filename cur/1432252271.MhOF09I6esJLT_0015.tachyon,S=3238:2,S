TCPA and Palladium can be forced to restrict 90%+ of all applications at the whim of Bill Gates, 
or the United States government.

Kitchen knives, on the other hand, are under non-uniform and widely-distributed, uncoordinated 
control. Even Bill Gates and the United States government acting in concert cannot make all knives 
become murder weapons, nor make all knives become non-murder weapons.
