Haaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaahaaa!!!!!!!

Craig said, the current situation is referred to as capitalism.
You asked, who refers to capitalism as socialism?

No one, they refer to it as capitalism, except it isn't really,
was what Craig said.

I pointed out, you munged what Craig had said.

Your reply, something about "it" being communism, is complete hogwash, 
since the original post was about the current system being _called_ 
capitalism, and your mistaken reply, "who calls capitalism socialism?"

I'll retract my earlier admonition:  You don't need to learn to read, you 
need to learn to comprehend what you read.
