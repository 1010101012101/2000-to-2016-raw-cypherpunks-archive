By Retaking Raqqa Syrian Army May Upset 'Federalization' Plan
http://sputniknews.com/politics/20160610/1041140173/syria-raqqa-kurds-federalization.html


I don't think Kurdistan in any form will come out from this particular CIA
initiated war in Syria - there are too many regional fears of an expanding
Kurdistan (into Turkey and Iran for example, not to mention Iraq and Syria
of course), and there appears to be some genuine understanding that
religious based government becomes quite intolerant of minorities, and
therefore a greater desire in the people for a separation of religion and
state, if nothing else than for to maximise longer term stability.

In all areas of Jihadistan, I can only agree.

And it's hard to not oppose Exceptionalistan (USA) on principle these
days...

And it certainly does not look like Russia will let Syria 'fall', being a
long term strategic partner.

Doesn't change the fact though of the existence of the YPJ and the
potential longer term cultural catalytic effects they may cause - here's
hoping.

Good luck humans
