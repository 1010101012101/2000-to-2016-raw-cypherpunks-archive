also gotta say:

i think the surveillance system has created the unique conditions
necessary for a grand-inquisitor like interrogation of each and every
view and belief, from any and every angle, eventually.

beyond just panoptics of a prisoner, if this technical omniscient
observation provides a form of accounting, assessing and checking the
truth of a given statement against known truth versus known falsity,
perhaps a potential liminal condition (if purgatory) for willful
error-correction or else, then it may create the perhaps unbelievable
scenario whereby people can no longer get away within lying.

that is, making the world impossible for liars to exist within, in
their beliefs and actions, within most biological (versus programmed)
behaviors that may involve tells or indications of falsity &
deception.

think of how that could benefit humanity, if liars could not be
allowed to continue lying via loopholes and must account for the
situation in terms of actual truth as combined from all viewpoints
total. that this is the place of citizenry, not held outside of it,
denied this condition of shared truth in which to exist.

every last idiot view and false beliefs could be taken down in their
hierarchical 'superior' positions, held to account and checked against
larger truth than just whatever is narrowed as finite justification.
in that truth would have to be accounted for, in the equations and
people capable of dealing with it, not denying it and gaming the
system for self-benefit via corruption and continual rigging of the
game which is not a game for those dying and suffering in misery due
to such malice and mendacity.

how many times has the wall that is encountered, the barrier, involve
the power of ignorance and use of denial of truth to enforce limits,
to devolve relations and interactions. what if surveillance has a
positive attribute in terms of accountability beyond just witness,
also as analyst. someone tends to move through the world via lies and
exploitation of others around them, and fights against those who seek
accountability and use of reason to mediate issues, who then become
enemies, and actions taken against these people accounted for
systematically, judiciously, yet never accounted for in a context of
greater truth of situations. peoples lives destroyed so others may
rise, truth lost in the process. what if all of it was captured via
surveillance. what if a person was held to account for their
observance and service to truth, versus exploitation of this, say to
gain power, prestige, money, by subverting truth.

it seems like every last word and utterance, phone, articles, emails,
chats, would allow such analysis especially of known false views and
beliefs and ideologies. maybe just the daydreams of executioners.
though it would be interesting if there is a running naughty and nice
list that grounds differently than 'the many' perceive it will, once
the bubble pops and the scenario is reversed, the nightmare begins...

(meaning, if the state is full of traitors, hostile to and subverting
constitutional governance, that would be an issue necessary to deal
with world-over, to allow for a correction, to get humanity back on
track)
