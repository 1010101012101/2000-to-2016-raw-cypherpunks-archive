Hate to break this to you, Justin, but Tim may be too old to recognize that one
unless he had younger siblings or friends with TV-watching kids...
My sister who was born in 1963 watched it; I don't think my brother who was
born in 1960 watched it much.  If Tim's parents were early adopters of 
television,
he'd be more likely to recognize Howdy Doody and Mickey Mouse Club.
