Sickening.

To average folks - this is what you consent to by default as you continue
to fail to oppose, as you continue to do nothing to rights these and so
many other wrongs, as you continue to put your mortgage and your kids
football practice ahead of any sanity in your own government, your own
country's systems of control, domination and bullying.

THIS is what you are leaving to your children as they grow up.

The road to chaos is being well and truly laid in America, and tacitly
consented to by the majority of humans in that country.
