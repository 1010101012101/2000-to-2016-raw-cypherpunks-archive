This is a problem with the defence lawyers, not (just) the judges.

'willfully' and 'substantialy certain' are the bail-out phrases. Unless
there is some proof that you intended to destroy the documents, not as a
matter of policy, but as a matter of obfuscation then you're goose is
cooked. If you're policy is 'never keep the records' or 'destroy all
records in a timely fashion' (exempting legaly required documentation)
then the charge is going to be a lot harder to make stick all by itself.

> records if they are destroyed (under the second part of the Lopez test where

The 'conclusion' actualy begs the question. The point you and the courts
seem to be jumping right over isn't the 'spoliation' per se but rather the
environment that indicates 'willful' and 'substantial certainty' in the
consequences of those document destructions. It isn't the document
destruction per se but rather your motive to destroy them to hide your
crime.

Maybe not. At least with the charge real evidence must be presented. With
the simple jury instruction a inference, without chance of rebut mind you,
is made. This in effect pre-disposes the jury to consider you guilty.
