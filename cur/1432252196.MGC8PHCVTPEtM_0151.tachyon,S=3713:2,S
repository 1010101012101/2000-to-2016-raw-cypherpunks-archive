parmenides.zen.co.uk was on spam blocklists until very recently - see

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=212.23.8.69+group:news.admin.net-abuse.*&hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&selm=aij5pl%2414guph%241%40ID-66783.news.dfncis.de&rnum=1

for a discussion of that, or

http://www.dsbl.org/listing.php?ip=212.23.8.69

for the literal details including results of relay tests;

and see

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=212.23.8.69+group:news.admin.net-abuse.*&hl=en&lr=lang_en&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d&selm=001901c1ead6%24c6bd9a20%244fcf44c6%40default&rnum=4

for an example of spam that was relayed through that server.

It's the recipient, or someone acting on their behalf, who's deciding what 
to do with
*their* mail, at least from the recipient's perspective.
