	Well, I don't care too much about 'educating' people lately and
	I certainly know my method is far from perfect...

	
	As far as doubts regarding political anarchy go, no I don't
	have any doubts. 

	I don't care about 'utilitarian' arguments. It doesn't matter
	if some people think that they can get allegedly 'better'
	outcomes by taxing, kidnapping and killing their neighbors.
	Pro-government people don't have any legitimate authority and
	can't even prove that their preferences are 'better', most of
	the time.

	Anarchy is the only system that can be morally justified. And
	funnily enough, the very theoretical premises of 'western'
	'liberal' 'democracies' are anarchistic. 'Liberal'
	'democracies' pretend to be 'representative' governments based
	on the 'consent of the governed'.

	
	"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
	created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
	certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty
	and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights,
	Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
	powers from the consent of the governed," 


	The 'religious' language is bullshit - the doctrine of
	natural rights is actually that, natural (rational), not based
	on any 'supernatural' scam.

	And what does 'consent' mean, exactly? It means choice and the
	ability to accept or reject any proposition. 

	So, since government is based on 'consent' it is perfectly OK
	to NOT consent to be 'governed' and thus live under 'anarchy'. 

	Of course, the guy who wrote that 'declaration of independence'
	and his accomplices were incredibly sick pieces of shit who
	used libertarian political theory as facade for the
	'foundation'  of a literal slave society. Freedom is slavery.
	Good old Orwell wasn't just talking about the future...


	Anyway, anarchy is simply statist theory correctly applied.
