Could explain the P4 hypeburgers.
PC owners sue Intel, OEMs over P4 claims
August 19 2002
Intel, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard face a class action lawsuit filed 
against them by a group of computer owners who allege the companies misled 
them into believing the Pentium 4 is a superior processor to the Pentium 
III and the AMD Athlon.
A report in PC World says the complaint was filed in the third judicial 
circuit in Madison County, Illinois. A ruling has yet to be made on whether 
the case comes under state or federal jurisdiction. PCWorld said it had 
received a copy of the complaint from an anonymous source.
The complaint claims that the public were deceived by the marketing of the 
P4 and alleges that there is no benefit to consumers who choose the P4 over 
the PIII. It also alleges that the P4 is slower and less powerful than the 
PIII or the AMD Athlon.
