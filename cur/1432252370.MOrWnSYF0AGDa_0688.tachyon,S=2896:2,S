> update on HavenCo

I'll probably be showing up to the meeting, provided it is held someplace
interesting (Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Copenhagen are interesting; Osnabrueck
is NOT.)  I've started attending London 2600 whenever I'm in London,
and might go to a CCC event if I pick up some more German between now
and then.

I can bring some cool toys (legal in Europe) for people to play with, too.

If you get any UK attendees, they'll probably want to talk about RIP,
which is a mind-crushingly boring topic.  I think an update on
publius/freenet/mojo/etc. would be quite interesting, however.
