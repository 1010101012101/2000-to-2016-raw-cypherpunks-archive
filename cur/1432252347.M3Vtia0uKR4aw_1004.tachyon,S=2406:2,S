Referred to by his spy masters only as "Tim," this spy has been getting 
those who want more tax money stolen to give to the so-called 
minorities to reveal their plans to him in Internet chat rooms. He 
gains their support by denouncing freedom and free trade, by agreeing 
with their whines that tax rates ought to be raised on the wealthy so 
that "persons of color and other marginalized peeples" can receive more 
money to stay at home and eat Doritos while watching Oprah Winfrey.

Experts point out that at least 18 of these socialists who this spy 
"Tim" made contact with have been executed by members of freedom 
fighting groups. He says that while he does not support the "christer 
superstitions" of groups like Aryan Nations, their willingness to 
liquidate race traitors and socialist tax enthusiasts is "admirable."

"Tim" was quoted in one forum, untraceably of course, saying that his 
ultimate goal is to see the 22 million non-working layabouts given a 
chance to repay what they stole, with interest. If after 36 months they 
are not on schedule, they would face 5 years in a work camp, working 
off their debts. Those who failed to repay their debts on this schedule 
would, he said, have their organs harvested as partial repayment of 
their debt.

"Sometimes they just have to go up the chimney," he added.
