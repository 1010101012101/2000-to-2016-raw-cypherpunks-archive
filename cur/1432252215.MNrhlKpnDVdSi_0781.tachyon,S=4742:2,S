The negro mobs and hooligans, led by the usual corrupt drug barons, are
seeking Uncle Sugar's handouts. Billions in aid for Haiti. Fuck that.

Money stolen from U.S. taxpayers should not be sent to Haiti...or to
Egypt, Iraq, Sudan, Taiwan, Israel, Russia, India, or any of the other
hundred satrapies we "bail out" (translation: most of the stolen money
the U.S. government gives them in "grants" and "development loans" is
sent into Swiss and Cayman Island bank accounts).

Let the Bloods and Crips of Haiti battle it out for the scraps of food
looted from the few remaining stores. Let the cannibals swing their
machetes, necklace their opponents, burn down their neighborhoods in
the same way the negro ghetto mutants burned down their neighborhoods
in South-Central LA, in Oakland, in Liberty City (lots of Haitians
there, not surprisingly), Watts, and Detroit.

The U.S. has a _stated_ national debt of $7 trillion
($7,000,000,000,000), and an _actual_ national debt of approximately
$35 trillion, counting "unfunded liabilities," loans which are are not
carried as debt but which stand a nil chance of ever being repaid, the
Socialist InSecurity black hole, and various other "suicide with a
fountain pen" co-signing agreements on loans which are worthless.

This $35 trillion national debt represents an amortized personal debt
of about $125,000 for each of America's roughly 275 million
citizens/residents (no longer the same thing, but I digress).

However, not all of those 275 million are taxpayers. Many are children,
many are prisoners, many are spouses or other non-filing family
members. And many simply don't file tax returns.

Approximately 100 million taxpayers are visible, meaning the above
$125,000 number is actually about $350,000 for each actual taxpayer.
(Further, most taxpayers pay very little--60% of all taxes are paid by
the wealthiest 3%. The debt load is thus enormous on our most
productive members.)

Uncle Sam has been Uncle Sugar for too many of the nations of the
world. And he has been Uncle Sugar for too many bums and layabouts and
welfare breeders who think money miraculously is owed to them so they
can sit at home, in subsidized apartments, collecting welfare checks
and listening to Oprah Winfrey and Jesse Jackson tell them that have an
"entitlement" to their handouts.

Meanwhile, a $7 trillion official national debt, and a looming $35
trillion _actual_ national debt.
Corporations are moving jobs out of this collapsing house of cards as
fast as they can. This will make the coming generation of burger
flippers and Starbucks latte slingers carry the full burden of paying
for the retirement of the Baby Boomers...and paying 80% taxes on their
meager service economy salaries to pay off the ever-mounting national
debt.
And to send more billions in aid dollars to Haiti, Egypt, Israel,
Poland, Sudan, Georgia, Kazhakstan, Baluchistan, India, Thailand,
Taiwan, South Korea, North Korea, and a hundred other countries.

It's not a sustainable situation. The chickens are coming home to roost.
