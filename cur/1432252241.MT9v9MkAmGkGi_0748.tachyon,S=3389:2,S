Certainly not now, which is why I said I was talking about five years or so 
in the future. Going through the "work" can be something as simple as an 
attachment to a spending bill; unless it's controversial, it's truly not 
that difficult to do.

Your point about ISPs as the targets for a "code of conduct" is a 
reasonable one, but the same analysis applies. Offshore ISPs will continue, 
at least at first, to host remailers, then perhaps be pressured into 
abandoning that plan if governments in other jurisdictions get sufficiently 
mobilized.

Another point of attack, although more far-fetched, is restricting the 
sites to which network providers can carry traffic. A restriction like 
"knowingly providing connectiviting to a service that provides anonymous 
re-mailing capabilities." Then the helpful Feds will provide daily lists of 
offshore remailers.
