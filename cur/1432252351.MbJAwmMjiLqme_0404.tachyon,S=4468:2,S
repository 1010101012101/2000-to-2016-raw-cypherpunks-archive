Vote late and often!    It's especially useful if there are enough
Nader votes that the Democrats need some 
last-minute metabolically challenged voters to help out.


After the 1990 census, New Jersey was redoing the gerrymander to
help solidify Republican and Democrat districts.
They wanted to make a majority-Hispanic district, so they expanded
the boundaries of one district to include Rahway Prison,
which has a lot of blacks and Hispanics in it.....
Who are mostly convicted felons, and can't vote.


				Thanks!
