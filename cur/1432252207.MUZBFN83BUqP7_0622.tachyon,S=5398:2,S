you can't win opinion any further than Snowden/Manning - so why try?
 give up the pretense, restraint, and go for the jugular:

- co-opt privileged access to further infiltrate and infect. apply
0days from the 0day factory to further pwn the factory itself.
training, tactics, procedures leveraged for strategic advantage from
within.

- dial full-disclosure to 11: torrents, darknets, onions, all forms
burst forth with terabytes in an instant. (intelligence census 20XX to
complement the internet census 2012 approach to DIY discovery)

- bootstrap a workflow of analysis and attack; the information
pilfered as input to a second stage of retribution - consequence the
only language of deterrence understood.

- inflict maximum damage to all targets, all comers.  exhaust every
what if to demonstrate worst case in action.

- seppuku/jigai; your role as übervillain complete.

consider an alternative: optimal behavior modification via the
execution of worst case failure. make the fallout so significant, so
terrible, so all encompassing that the thought of ever again building
these massive systems of surveillance conjures nightmares of horrible
potential.

when the world believes Total Information Awareness == Thermonuclear
Winter, you've won!

 alas, you won't be around to enjoy the victory.

the pessimists say: such an outcome is inevitable. no technology, no
debate, no democracy able nor willing to restrain what has been
wrought.  now just a matter of time until opportunity and malice
applies global information dominance to global domination. dystopia
inevitable; the worst case worse than you imagine...
