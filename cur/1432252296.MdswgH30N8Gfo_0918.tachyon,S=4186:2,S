Yep, that's it.

Oops... never thought of that.

No, just as he can't create round squares. What's that got to do with
anything?

Well... one of the points of Freenet is to have anonymity (even if not
cryptographically strong, just statistical anonimity). I don't know how well
that can work with "introductions". [Maybe the public / private key
proposals - which I haven't followed up closely - could me modified to be
used as some sort of a pseudonym.]
