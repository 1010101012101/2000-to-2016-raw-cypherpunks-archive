Been a while since I played with it, but IIRC OpenCA (www.openca.org) is a
full implimentation of a CA, in perl cgi, with no admin intervention
required.  Obviously, that involves browser-based key generation.
If you want server-based key generation, then take a look at
http://symlabs.com/Net_SSLeay/smime.html

If you are iis/asp rather than perl, then there are activex components that
will give you access to x509 certificates - EBCrypt is probably the easiest,
but there is a activex wrapper for cryptlib too, iirc.
