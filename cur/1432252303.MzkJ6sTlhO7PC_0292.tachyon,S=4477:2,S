ADL COMMENDS YAHOO FOR ACTION BANNING
NAZI MEMORABILIA AND OTHER HATEFUL ITEMS ON ITS AUCTION SITE

New York, NY, January 3, 2001 ... The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today
commended Yahoo! for its decision to take steps to remove hateful materials
from its Internet auctions, calling it a "creative solution to combat the
flood of Nazi memorabilia and other offensive and hateful items being hawked
for sale to the highest bidder in their online auctions."
	Glen A. Tobias, ADL National Chairman, and Abraham H. Foxman, ADL
National Director, issued the following statement:

				We commend Yahoo! for its decision to ensure
that hateful materials do not appear in its online auctions.  We believe
Yahoo! has come up with a creative solution to combat the flood of Nazi
memorabilia and other offensive or hateful items being hawked for sale to
the highest bidder in their online auctions.

				While there is no law in the United States
against selling these items to the public, they were clearly offensive to
many individuals who frequent the auction site.  Yahoo! has recognized this
public concern and demonstrated corporate responsibility by establishing
guidelines for users who wish to sell items online and actively monitoring
auction rooms for inappropriate or offensive content.  Yahoo!'s decision
means that the Internet provider is taking a more proactive role in
enforcing its own "Terms of Service," which forbid the posting of content
that is hateful or otherwise objectionable.

				The Internet is a great tool for education
and communication, but it continues to pose complex issues, requiring
Internet companies to walk a fine line between free expression and
inappropriate or hateful conduct.  Internet companies need to be continually
on watch for hateful content and, when appropriate, to respond with similar
solutions.


The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world's leading
organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services that
counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.
