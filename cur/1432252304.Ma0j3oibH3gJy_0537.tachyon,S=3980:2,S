Some of the leading PV panels are those from BP (British Petroleoum). 
These can be ordered, along with those from Kyocera, Astropower, 
Siemens, and others, from many sites. Use Google to find them.

My brother worked for one of these companies at their Simi 
Valley/Thousand Oaks site about 20 years ago.

The issues are complex, but have zero to do with leftie fantasies about 
oil companies suppressing technologies.

There is no way to control fundamental breakthroughs, whether PV 
conversion or "caburetors that violate the laws of physics!." Any of 
the above non-oil companies (and one can add Texas Instruments and 
others to the list) which develops a more efficient, cheaper to 
manufacture PV system will find success.
