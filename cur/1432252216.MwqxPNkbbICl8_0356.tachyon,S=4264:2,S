This message appeared on coderpunks a few days ago -

... and I just got a press release from ZKS this morning trumpeting the 
virtues of Freedom 3.0; sounds like maybe they're abandoning the network 
and shifting their consumer-product focus to software alone. I looked at 
their website after seeing Ben's message and was struck by how much they've 
shifted away from selling service to consumers at $49 each, and are now 
targeting businesses who are allegedly concerned about their customers' 
alleged concern about privacy. They did appear to be willing to sell the 
consumer software, but it clearly wasn't the focus of their business as 
presented by the website.
