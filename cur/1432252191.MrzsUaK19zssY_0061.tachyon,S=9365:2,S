The Client's Perspective
Recruiters and corporate HR execs are on the same team?but do they know
it? Find out if these matchmakers are all-for-one or going one-on-one in
Part I this Multi-part feature.
by Lisa Micali 

In a perfect world, recruiters and HR executives would have shared
goals, mutual respect and a completely trusting relationship with the
company's short- and long-term objectives in mind. Yet, the perception
that recruiters are merely commission-hungry sales people still exists,
despite solid gains in professional advancement, training and
development. 

In order to better understand how changes throughout the industry are
impacting this symbiotic relationship, Recruiter.com asked HR
professionals to share their views and forecasts.
