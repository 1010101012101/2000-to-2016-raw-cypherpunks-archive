But a short, simple and commonly used subject line is almost 
impossible to filter automatically without triggering a large volume 
of false positives.  Yes, there are better ways to filter out this 
stuff, but if that was so easy why is this piece of e-performance art 
so widespread?  The social engineering lies in the interminable 
curiosity of the human beast, in spite of Management's best warnings.
