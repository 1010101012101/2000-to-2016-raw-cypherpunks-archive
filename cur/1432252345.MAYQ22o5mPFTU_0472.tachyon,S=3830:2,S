Google also Mayfield v. Dalton, 109 F.3d 1423 (9th Cir.1997) which
challenged a military DNA repository as violating the Fourth Amendment.
Between the district court and the appellate, the military made some
changes...shortening the holding period from 75 to 50 yrs, allowing for
individualized destruction upon request after military service, delineating
permissible uses, etc.-etc.

Compare to the Brits, who are experimenting with chipping their soldiers:
dog tags to pet chips.

Although I'm on the consortium list, etc. My RAND pubs notice did not
include the online version. Thanks, Faustine. Saved me some $. I always read
your contributions.

PS: Although elementary for many in here (but you are quite unusual),
Understanding Surveillance Technologies by Julie K. Petersen, available on
Amazon, has some "handy stuff" in it for a broad overview of surveillance
technologies. (I always appreciate private notes to papers/refs on
surveillance topics.)
