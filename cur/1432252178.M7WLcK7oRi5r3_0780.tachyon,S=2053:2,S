Save the extra electrons...

Now that Lally is gone (well, *going*.), there's only a handful of us left
to bother with anyway.

Let's see: there's you, and me.

And Eugen and Riad and Tyler Durden.

Ben Laurie and Steve Bellovin.

'The right of self defence is the first law of nature: in most governments
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest

the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext
whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the
brink of destruction.'
