"Police blotter" is a weekly report on the intersection of technology
and the law. This episode: Feds' location-tracking rebuffed.

What: In the first case of its kind, a federal judge chastises the U.S.
Department of Justice for trying to constantly track a cell phone user's
location without providing any proof of criminal behavior.

When: Decided Aug. 25 by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in
Central Islip, N.Y.

Outcome: Justice Department's Patriot Act surveillance request was denied.
