Abstract. In this paper we analyse the security of a new key exchange
protocol proposed in [3], which is based on mutually learning neural 
networks. This is a new potential source for public key cryptographic 
schemes which are not based on number theoretic functions, and 
have small time and memory complexities. In the first part of the paper 
we analyse the scheme, explain why the two parties converge to a 
common key, and why an attacker using a similar neural network is 
unlikely to converge to the same key. However, in the second part 
of the paper we show that this key exchange protocol can be broken 
in three different ways, and thus it is completely insecure.
