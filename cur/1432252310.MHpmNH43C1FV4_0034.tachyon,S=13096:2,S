juan it is common knowledge that the snowden so called fucking leaks are
given to the US gov before publication

always remember and never forget gg was fully behind the war in iraq and
why was he fully behind it ? revenge ... that tells you the mind that is
working on the so called leaks

also laura she was an embed journo in iraq - something an activist journo
wouldnt even think about doing lets not even fully talk about that she
blindly backs the assange wikileaks 'merger' into one entity

and jeremy scahill did a selfie (among other ethical violations against
woman) in samalia with a dead body in a morgue for his little movie, again
something journalists dont do - even pond scum journalists dont get their
picture took with dead bodies for camera - these are the ethical parameters
of the people working with the info
