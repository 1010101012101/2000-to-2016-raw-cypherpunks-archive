I never said I proved the slide is fake, Travis. In fact, I've said several
times that I've all done is prove that it could be fake. I said it in the
mailing list and in the original posts on my site.

*Please* try to read what you're criticizing/arguing/responding to. I know
it can be hard, or boring, or frustrating, but it's essential to a dialogue
that you respond to what the other person/side/position said and not
confabulate something (as is human nature) or worse yet, build a strawman.

Forcing your targets to *ahem* 'go dark' by instilling paranoia is exactly
> the opposite of what 'an IA / TLA' wants.


So categorical, monolithic and single minded! One might even say "overly
so" lol

 doesn&#39;t seem like a strong argument -<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially for a non-NSA slide. And again - *=
Snowden himself* has<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; accused<br>

 that *he says he<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Likely the NSA would distribute fake slides just t=

&gt; Snowden.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does Snowden deny the authencity of this slide?<br=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This slide appeared in _too many_ news AFAICT to g=
