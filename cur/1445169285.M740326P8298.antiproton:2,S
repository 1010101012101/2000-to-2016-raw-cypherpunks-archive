Right. But it's best if you start with a mass-market popular VPN

Of course not.

True. All of it, arguably. But it won't be useful if you've
compartmentalized well enough, through different channels. Some of my
personas probably look a lot more like some of your personas than some
of my other personas. Or if not you, others who are reading this.

Only if you haven't compartmentalized well enough.

No problem. Compartmentalize!
