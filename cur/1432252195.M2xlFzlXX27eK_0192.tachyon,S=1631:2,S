All,

A quick note to let you know that I had some unexpected downtime on the
jfet.org/al-qaeda.net node (the last remaining one, sadly) due to a
change in my mailer configuration whose impact I had not anticipated.
My sincere apologies, and thanks to J. A. Terranson for pointing it out
to me.

Enjoy,
