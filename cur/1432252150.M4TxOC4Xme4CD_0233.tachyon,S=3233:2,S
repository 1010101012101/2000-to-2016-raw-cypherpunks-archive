Anthrax scare evacuates Sydney Airport


Parts of the International Terminal at Sydney Airport have been evacuated
following the discovery of a suspicious package.

A Qantas spokeswoman says the international counter was closed after a white
powder-like substance was found in some meal vouchers about 4:30 this
afternoon.

She says no flights have been affected.

Australian Protective Services are now investigating the area.

It's believed some shops have been evacuated but the spokeswoman could not
confirm that.
