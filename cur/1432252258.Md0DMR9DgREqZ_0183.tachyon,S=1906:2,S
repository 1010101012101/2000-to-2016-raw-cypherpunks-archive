Oh. By all means. Let's protest physical reality, instead of actually
changing it.

The irony filter clogs in its own backwash: the very people who can solve
the problem by actually doing what they do *for* *a* *living*, meaning they
can solve the problem and get *rich* doing it, want to bleat away in the
halls of the legislature, begging for more laws to "fix" a problem caused
by too many laws...

Sheesh.


Cheers,
RAH
