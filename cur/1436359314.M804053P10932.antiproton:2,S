Is there and way a person can get their paycheck direct deposit to a
Bitcoin? So instead of a deposit to a checking account it goes to an
exchange that converts it for you? And then is there a good way to access
currency in rural areas?
I have seen a few videos and read overviews but they never get to how to
make it practical for people not in big cities, hell it just doesn't seem
practical at all unless you live near an exchange or are willing to do
credit card transactions that  cost on top of the exchange and make the
currency traceable.
