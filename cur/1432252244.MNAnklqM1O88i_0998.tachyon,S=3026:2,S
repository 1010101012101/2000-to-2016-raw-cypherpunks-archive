What is a Smart Gun?
The numerous gun-related deaths each year in the US has prompted widespread 
calls for improvements in the safety of handguns. This has led to the 
development of "smart guns".
100% electronic prototype
The O'Dwyer VLe - the world's first totally electronic handgun live firing 
prototype - is Metal Storm's 'smart gun', being developed for military and 
police. With advanced access limiting features, the O'Dwyer VLe operates 
without any moving parts. The only thing that moves in the weapon is the 
bullets.
