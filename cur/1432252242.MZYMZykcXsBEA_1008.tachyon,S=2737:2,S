But, but, but ... This is *government approved* metal foil. It's the
good stuff. You can trust them -- they're from the government, and
they're here to help.

On your broader point, yah. I'll check out /. once in a while for
pointers to news items and more rarely for the "ask slashdot" items, but
most of the comments are garbage and probably half of the posts are
garbage. The question is, has /. gotten worse since it was fresh, or
have I grown less tolerant of ill-informed, shoot-off-at-the-mouth
kiddies? (I have a 4-digit slashdot user id, to show how long ago I came
across them.)
