3. Public support for federal workers falls to pre-Sept. 11 level
By Brian Friel
Americans support federal workers and trust the government less today than 
they did immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a new survey shows.
The survey, issued Thursday by the Brookings Institution's Center for 
Public Service, found that support for federal workers had fallen to its 
pre-Sept. 11 level. The percentage of Americans who said they had a 
favorable opinion of federal workers fell from 76 percent in October 2001 
to 69 percent this month, the same percentage that reported a favorable 
opinion in July 2001.
The percentage of Americans who said they trust the federal government to 
do what is right just about always or most of the time fell from 57 percent 
in October 2001 to 40 percent this month. In July 2001, 29 percent of 
survey respondents said they had high levels of trust in the government.
