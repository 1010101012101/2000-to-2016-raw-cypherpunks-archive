A wonderful longline elucidation I had no trouble reading. Must remember
to do the math next time.

RR

Ps. Fuck experts AND their "studies". I KNOW SOMEONE got paid to to do
that, and THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY was SURELY the payee/beneficiary of
the study.

Have I ever mentioned that "If I were Stalin" the people I'd line up
against a wall for the firing squad would be marketers, and the
psychologists and sociologists that collude with them?

That would also take care of academics who pimp themselves to the
Pentagon's COIN programs.
