Perhaps this should be reason enough TO run a tor node?  Not for
Burma/Iran... but for those of us in the "first world" who are
threatened by police states ourselves?  It sometimes takes an
unfortunate rude awakening to realize this, but unfortunately there are
no real limits to the police in any country.

I for one no longer subscribe to the "smoke/fire" theory when I see the
police question or even arrest someone, or worse, the papers reporting a
crime.  When I see someone resist arrest, I cannot help but wonder "What
did the police officer do that is so unjust, because he (or more likely
an unjust law) must likely have done something to provoke a person to
resist arrest despite obvious overwhelming force!?"

I fear that if they someday come to take my computer, or much worse, my
children, that I might be easily driven mad, the knowledge of my
innocence will provide no comfort.  But I will not be stopped by this
fear.  I run an exit node to support those who share this fear and who
do not want to simply pretend that the authorities "know what they are
doing" or that "they have good reason", because I unfortunately already
know better from first hand experience.

Run a node for yourself, for the society you live in (it needs it), not
just for those far off in "oppressive regimes".  There is plenty of
oppression to go around locally.  If they come for you, remember what it
feels like to be innocent (assuming that you are); remember that when
they come for your neighbor (don't assume innocence or guilt, but
consider both), and consider lending your neighbor a helping or
comforting hand,
