I'm new to this list, so hello everyone.  I'm also on the other side of 
the pond, so I'm interested in what you are recounting.  Here, in the UK, 
stalking is illegal, so is recording phone conversations covertly.  But 
the police are installing a network of CCTV -- not the general 
surveillance cameras in town centres which everyone loves, but a new set 
of low-level cameras that are directed into the windscreens of vehicles 
passing.  So they can track exactly who goes where when.  I'm not sure 
what intelligence they have installed (so far).  In fact, I am not sure 
of anything about them, because they have never been mentioned in the 
media, and most people I've talked to haven't even noticed they are 
there!

I'm wondering whether to try marketing driving masks...  And whether, if 
I did, they would be outlawed (on grounds that they reduce driver vision 
and cause danger, of course).
