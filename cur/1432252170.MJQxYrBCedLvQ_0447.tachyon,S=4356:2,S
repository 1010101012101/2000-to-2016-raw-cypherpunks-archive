Hi John,

'mail', 'httpd'? I don't have a clue what the hell you're talking about.
einstein has a 54d19h32m uptime as I write this. None of my services have
been down or non-functional in that time.

You need to have your DNS checked, it's not picking IP's correctly.
Specifically when it is given a name->IP lookup that has two, yes I say
two, IP's provided. einstein is supposed to have two NIC's installed. I
removed one because I isolated my internal network completely because of a
variety of exploits. As a result that IP isn't available and it times out,
your services (be they httpd, mail, or whatever) should then try the
alternate IP. Apparently they're not. It's worth noting that timeout may
be as great as the default 2m high level TCP timeouts.

You can try flushing your DNS cache's and try it again or you could set a
direct IP-hostname link in your /etc/hostname file.
