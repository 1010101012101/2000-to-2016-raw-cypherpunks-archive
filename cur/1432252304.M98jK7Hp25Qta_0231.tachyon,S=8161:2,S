Here is some text from an order I was a party to some time ago:

Further, [someone who was kind of naughty] is hereby ordered to produce and
disclose all copies, originals, reproductions, derivations, translations or
other documents related to [a certain document] _within his direct or indirect
control_.  (Emphasis mine).

That's pretty typical, the control part.

Copy is an old term of art.  "A transcript, double, imitation, or reproduction
of an original writing, painting, instrument, or the like."  As distinguished
from original: "As applied to documents the original is the first copy or
archetype; that from which another instrument is transcribed, copied, or
imitated."  Part of the confusion is because "copies" and "originals" bear
different evidentiary weights.  Copies can only be submitted as evidence in
lieu of originals under certain circumstances (because of the risk of
alteration or forgery or suchlike) and blah blah blah.  "Copy" started to see
the use you are describing because of the following kinds of exchanges:

Prosecutor:  And do you still have this document?
Witness:  No.  (Thinks: but I have a xerox in my briefcase- ha ha ha).

Very true.  Consider:  "An original of a writing or recording is the writing
or recording itself or any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a
person executing or issuing it.  An 'original' or a photograph includes the
negative or any print therefrom.  If the data are stored in a computer or
similar device, any printout or other output readable by sight shown to
reflect the data accurately, is an 'original.'"  This leads to the very
strange situation where data on a disk (not readable by sight) is not an
original or a copy but a sort of "quasi-original."  A meta-original if you
will, capable of spawning infinite originals- as it were.  It's curious to me
that no one has pursued this kind of argument in a copyright/MPAA type case.
It's not readable by sight is it?  Might be too technical an argument.

I don't know the details but I suspect that they are trying to control
evidence that might compromise an investigation or otherwise collect all the
evidence to be sure that everything is covered?  It doesn't sound THAT
unusual.  Courts generally try to grab everything to make sure nothing is
destroyed, lost, stolen, tampered with... etc.

Since such a prospect is impossible it's a good tactic.

Never try to outsmart forced disclosures.  Make it impossible for you to
comply with them in good faith.  Outsmarting them just makes prosecutors mad.
Making such disclosures/surrenders impossible makes them frustrated (i.e. mad
but unable to do anything about it).
