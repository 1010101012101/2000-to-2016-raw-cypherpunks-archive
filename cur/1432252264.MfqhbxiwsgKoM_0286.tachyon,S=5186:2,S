Yemen - Public Announcement
January 14, 2002

The Department of State has received reports indicating a credible terrorist
threat to U.S. interests in Yemen, including the U.S. Embassy. In response,
the American Embassy in Sanaa has taken a number of measures to further
increase its already hightened security posture. As part of that response,
the Embassy in Sanaa has temporarily suspended public services, including
immigrant visa and routine American citizen services, beginning Monday,
January 14. Non-immigrant visa processing has been restricted since
September 12, 2001.

Americans requiring emergency citizen services can contact the Consular
Section at 303-155.

As stated in the Travel Warning for Yemen dated December 3, 2001, the U.S.
Embassy urges American citizens in Yemen to maintain their vigilance and
take appropriate steps to lessen their vulnerability. Americans should
continue to keep a low profile, vary routes and times of travel, and avoid
large crowds and demonstrations. They should also continue to treat mail
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens in Yemen should
exercise particular caution at locations associated with foreigners, such as
the Sanaa Trade Center, American-affiliated franchises, restaurants and
shops in the Haddah area, and, in Aden and elsewhere, at restaurants and
hotels frequented by expatriates.

If U.S. citizens believe they are being followed or threatened while driving
in Yemen, they should proceed as quickly as possible to the nearest police
station or major intersection and request assistance from the blue-and-white
police cars stationed there. The Embassy strongly recommends that American
citizens lock all their car doors and keep their windows rolled up when
driving.

For further information concerning travel to Yemen, travelers should consult
the Department of State's Travel Warning and Consular Information Sheet for
Yemen at http://travel.state.gov.

This Public Announcement supplements the Travel Warning for Yemen dated
December 3, 2001, to report recent threat information and the temporary
suspension of routine public services by the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa.

This Public Announcement Expires on February 14, 2002.
