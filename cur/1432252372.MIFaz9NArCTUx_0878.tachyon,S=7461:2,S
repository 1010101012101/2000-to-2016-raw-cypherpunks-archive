I don't know what your definition of military force is Marc, but any *group*
of persons who are armed and engaged in common cause qualify as a military
force in my book.

According to dictionary.com, "military" is defined as:

	military (ml-tr)
	adj.	 
	Of, relating to, or characteristic of members of the armed forces: a military
	bearing; military attire. 
	Performed or supported by the armed forces: military service. 
	Of or relating to war: military operations. 
	Of or relating to land forces. 

You may not approve of calling groups you disagree with "military", yet it
does not change the facts.

I assume you are referring to the WTC victims here.  Sorry, but they were not
"innocent".  They, as participants in the selection of the rulers of this
country, are 100% guilty of the many crimes perpetrated by the United States
against other peoples.

As for AQ being a "criminal association": how do you arrive at this?  I
suspect you get there by considering their acts to be outside of accepted
behaviour (of any "lawful" society).  If so, then I agree that they qualify
as a "criminal association", however, this definition also qualifies the USA
as a criminal association.

What's good for the goose should be good for the gander, ya?

Really? Fuhrer Bush disagrees with you.  Our Maximum Leader has "declared" a
"war on terrorism" (conveniently leaving out our own terrorist tendencies and
acts).  It was this "war" which led to the detention of these
prisoners.  Sorry Marc, these are indeed prisoners of war.  Or maybe you
consider that all the military force we just used over in Afghanistan was
something other than an act of war?  Terrorism maybe?

I just *hate* to agree with mattd, but he's right on target here.

You can't *possibly* be this naive.

Talk the talk, but do you walk the walk?

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and 
elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...
