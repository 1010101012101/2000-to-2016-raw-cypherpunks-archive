You (and apparently Eric) haven't ever heard of cron and tar? The job
you're speaking of is called a 'system administrator'. There job is to
archive the contents of the companies machines. Make multiple copies and
then escrow at least one of those copies in another physical location.

The reality is that if a company gets hit with this sort of problems (ie
document loss) then they have a competancy issue of a bigger proportion.
