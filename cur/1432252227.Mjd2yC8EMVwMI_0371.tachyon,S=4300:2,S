your point? it's trivial to change the rules from "try replacing o with
0 (zero)" to using a phonetics dictionary on a whole word. pattern
matching is likewise so trivial that I've used it in online games for
nothing more important than fixing typos of players.

yes, but you *still* reduce the key space by several orders of
magnitude, or rather: reorder it in your favor (I assume that when you
failed with all substitions, you'll go "real" brute force, skipping what
you already tried).
