	Oh OK. Just a wrong and unfounded opinion.

	I thought you were not arguing for statism? And yet you
	copypasted a statist slogan and now you think you are mocking
	me because I showed that your statist slogan is...just that,
	empty propaganda. 

	What you said about division of power IS bullshit. If you are
	not arguing for statism, then go ahead and acknowledge that
	your/the statist slogan is bullshit.

	"Who said anything about cooperation? " 

	You, of course. 

	"But we can either choose to take what we can from what seems
	to be a set of good ideas (separation of powers, checks and
	balances, etc) and build upon them or try implementing them in
	a more functional way," 


	Don't take me for an idiot rysiek.
