The same could be said about "good" and "evil", yet in ordinary
conversation, one doesn't use the words to refer to their zero values.

Unqualified "trust" is somewhere between "more likely than not" and
"absolutely certain."

To a Jewish friend of mine, everything is marketing.

I suppose it depends on ones perspective. :)

Sounds like a good description of the difference between confidentiality
and anonymity.  I prefer the latter.

This is the difference between wishful thinking and anonymity.

How silly.  Factoring is like the Poincare Conjecture.  Solving it doesn't
let us do anything new and exciting, and nothing else we care about has a
reduction into it.

Fast factoring will be greeted by "oh, yes, of course", and the sound of
mass yawning and moving on.  In 10 years, "factor" will be a commodity
microprocessor opcode.

Is anyone even working on factoring any more?  How long has it been since
the last RSA Challenge number was factored?  Seems like aeons.

There is a huge difference in the valuation *YOU* place on the "trust" in
these two cases.

Valuation is hardly an absolutely quantifiable notion, completely
independent of who is doing the valuating.

I choose to avoid both situation 1 and situation 2 above.

You avoid situation 1, and think you are safe in situation 2.

You very well could be, but then again...

Yes, I believe Joe Sixpack saying that he promises to keep my key safe to
be on the same footing as Joe Sixdiploma saying that because he can't
figure out how to factor 309 digit numbers quickly, it must not be
possible.

Vanity, Vanity, All is Vanity.

All RSA is faith-based crypto.
