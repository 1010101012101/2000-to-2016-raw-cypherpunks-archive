Agreed. I use the Caml part of OCaml. :)

But if you have a chance to start from scratch, you should look at
possible solutions and use a viable one. Especially the readability
and maintainability of a programming language should be considered.
Otherwise you end up with a piece of code which is not maintainable
once the PhDs have graduated. You have to pay the technical debt at
some point. And I'm not sure how to hand over a research project to
'the open source community'... Are there best practices/guidelines
availble?

I think the OCaml community is rather larger compared to other
functional programming languages, and it is very helpful. Both the
real world ocaml book, available online https://realworldocaml.org/,
and their package management system OPAM, are awesome contributions
over the last years to easily start with OCaml and to get more people
involved.


Cheers,

Hannes
