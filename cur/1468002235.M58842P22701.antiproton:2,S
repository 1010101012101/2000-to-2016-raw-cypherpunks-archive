Local PD used one to kill a guy who was already dead about 8/9 years ago.=


A cop saw a wanted fleeing felon in a van in a parking lot, approached
the door, gunfire exchanged and he retreated. An hour or two later in
the 'standoff' they sent out a robot to place a concussion grenade under
the van and detonated it. They found out the perp had been mortally
wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire and was dead when they blew
him up.

They've also used the robot to blow up a couple of Geotag gamer caches
around town ROTF!
