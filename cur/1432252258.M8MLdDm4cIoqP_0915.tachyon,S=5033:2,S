The laws of physics, including the laws of quantum mechanics, are
symmetric with respect to the arrow of time, with occasional and rare
exceptions that are only apparent at high magnification.

if quantum mechanical ambiguity exists about the future, then it also
exists about the past.

As you measure the past by examining the record of it, you of course
collapse wavefunctions, and produce eigenstates of what you are measuring.  
It is not necessary to assume the One True Past existed prior to those
measurments being made, simply because no measurements contradict.

This, of course, is the "hidden variable theory," in which we have a One
True Past, (and One True Future) as well, which evolves deterministically,
based in part on degrees of freedom which are by definition unobservable
by any experiment.

If this is true, we have no free will, and Stephen Wolfram's suspicion
that the universe contains only pseudorandomness produced by complex
deterministic mechanisms at a small scale holds true.

Still, Nature abhors overcomplexification, and plain old quantum mechanics
works just fine for predicting the results of experiments.

Nowhere does this imply that what was observed always existed in its
observed state prior to the measurement being made.
