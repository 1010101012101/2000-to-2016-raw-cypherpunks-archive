Attacks 'have made US a better country'
Washington: Most Americans say the country has permanently changed for the
better as a consequence of the September 11 attacks, and more than half
report that the tragedy has transformed their lives, according to a
Washington Post-ABC News Poll.
An overwhelming majority of the public also believes that the cost of
President Bush's "war on terrorism" will leave other programs short of cash
- but nearly all agree that the spending is worth it.
The survey of 755 adults from across the country also found that Americans
enter the new year optimistic, with eight in 10 more hopeful than fearful
about what 2002 holds for them.
Nearly everyone surveyed believes that life in the US has been permanently
changed in the aftermath of the attacks.
The poll found that 63 per cent thought the changes had been for the better.

"70 virgins waiting in heaven for the martyr who dies for allah"
Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, in a booklet entitled Political Guerilla Warfare.
Feltrinelli said that the task of the terrorist was to violate the law
openly  challenging and outraging institutions and public order in every
way. Then, when the state intervenes as a result, with the police and the
courts, it will be easy to denounce its harshness and repressive
dictatorial tendencies:Direct action_ is what it's all about. Undermining
the state through the
spread of espionage networks, through undermining faith in the tax system,
through even more direct applications of the right tools at the right times.
When Cypherpunks are called "terrorists," we will have done our jobs.Tim May.
