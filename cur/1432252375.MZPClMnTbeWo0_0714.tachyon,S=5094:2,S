  I can see it now -- "Mr. Lane, you are being convicted for reverse
enginerring the embedded encryption system in the IBM-SuperSekret-HD."

  "But! But! I was just trying to recover my Quicken 2001 backup!" as they

  The only way they can make this even begin to work in the marketplace is
to force manufacturers to stop producing uncontrollable drives. I wouldn't
be suprised if there was an amendment to enact this waiting to attach itself
to an obscure bill in Congress.

  Or maybe I'm just being paranoid? <G>
