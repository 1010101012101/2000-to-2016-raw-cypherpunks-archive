	Would it be possible to have a self adjusting dummy traffic generator feature in remailers? Operator decides that he wants to process x number of incoming and y number of outgoing messages each time period t. Then the software adjusts the number of dummy messages to this value using some statistical calculations of past t2 hours. If incoming traffic increases then the amount of dummy messages are decreasing and so on. Does this feature exist today?
