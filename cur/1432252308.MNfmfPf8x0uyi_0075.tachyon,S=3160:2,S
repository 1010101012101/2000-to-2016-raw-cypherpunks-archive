When the NSA (via the FBI) first asked everyone to participate in these
games (early 2002), I had the happy privilege of telling the FBI flunky
personally that they could go to hell (at Savvis - warning, then was then,
and NOT now: things have likely changed with Koen running the show now).

At the time, the only incentive was "Helping your country" <barf> - if
they have added financial incentives, I'd love to know how these monies
could be delivered without being disclosed by the telcos.

'The right of self defence is the first law of nature: in most governments
it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest
limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of
the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext
whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the
brink of destruction.'
