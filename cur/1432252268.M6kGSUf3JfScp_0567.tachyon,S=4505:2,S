In May, 2002, Mr. Allen travelled to Bosnia at the request of U.S. and 
European officials of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security 
Studies to share his experiences as a local prosecutor with foreign 
officials on meeting threats posed by white collar criminals. As the only 
American prosecutor chosen, Mr. Allen worked with Bosnian prosecutors, 
judges and lawmakers in their review of laws in the war-torn country 
attacking corruption, fraud and money laundering. Afterwards, he and the 
Bosnian representatives discussed the merits of adopting some aspects of 
the American criminal justice system, including grand juries, in dealing 
with white collar crime there.
"At a time when we are reminded that the stability of far away places can 
have a direct impact on the security of our nation, it is important to have 
an American leader come to Bosnia to share insights into the values and 
rule of law that serve as the cornerstones of democracy and freedom. Mr. 
Allen made a tremendous contribution toward these goals in Bosnia," said 
Alan G. Gorowitz, a Plans Officer for the George C. Marshall Center.
Mike and his wife Lisa (Magistrate, Hamilton County Municipal Court), live
