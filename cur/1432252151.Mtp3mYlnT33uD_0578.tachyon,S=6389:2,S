                           Call for Papers 
          First IEEE International Security In Storage Workshop
             December 11th, 2002 -- Greenbelt, Maryland, USA
                    http://ieee-tfia.org/sisw2002

                          Sponsored by the
    IEEE Computer Society Task Force on Information Assurance and the 
                 IEEE Security In Storage Working Group 
 
The ability to create large shared storage systems in a secure manner is an
area that has received little formal research or results. A comprehensive,
systems approach to storage security is required if storage consolidation is
to succeed. This workshop serves as an open forum to discuss storage threats,
technologies, methodologies and deployment.

The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel
research on all theoretical and practical aspects of designing, building and
managing secure storage systems; possible topics include, but are not limited
to the following:

  - Cryptographic Algorithms for Storage 
  - Cryptanalysis of Existing and Proposed Systems and Protocols
  - Key Management for Storage Novel Implementations
  - Attacks on Storage Area 
  - Networks and Storage Systems 
  - Insider Attack Countermeasures
  - Standardization Approaches 
  - Deployment of Secure Storage Mechanisms 
  - Defining and Defending Trust Boundaries in Storage 
  - Security in Federated Systems
  - Relating Storage Security to System and Network Security 
  - Security for Internet Storage Service Providers

The goal of the workshop is to disseminate new research, and to bring together
researchers and practitioners from both governmental and civilian areas.
Accepted papers will be published by IEEE Press in a proceedings volume.

Submissions 

Papers must list all authors and affiliations, begin with a title, a short
abstract, a list of key words, and an introduction. The introduction should
summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a
non-specialist reader. Papers may be submitted in ASCII text, PostScript, PDF,
HTML, or Microsoft Word.

Papers should be at most 15 pages in length including the bibliography,
figures, and appendices (using 10pt body text and twocolumn layout). Authors
are responsible for obtaining appropriate clearances. Authors of accepted
papers will be asked to sign IEEEcopyright release forms. Final submissions
must be in camera-ready PostScript or PDF. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.

Papers that duplicate work that any of the authors have or will publish
elsewhere are acceptable for presentation at the workshop. However, only
original papers will be considered for publication in the proceedings. 

Important Dates

Paper due:                  October 11, 2002
Notification of acceptance: November 1, 2002
Final papers due:           November 25, 2002
Workshop:                   December 11, 2002
