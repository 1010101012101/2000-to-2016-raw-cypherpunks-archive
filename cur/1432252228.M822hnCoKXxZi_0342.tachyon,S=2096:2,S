Iran is fostering war in Iraq and cooperating with Al Quaeda,
which after what happened to Saddam indicates a fair degree of
insanity.

Iranian financed military movements, Hezbollah and Sadr, have
been fairly well behaved - they don't target other people's
children - just their own, but their willingness to cause the
deaths of their own children is even more frightening than Al
Quaeda's antics, though marginally less repugnant morally.

People so willing to sacrifice children, are apt to be willing
to use nuclear weapons.
