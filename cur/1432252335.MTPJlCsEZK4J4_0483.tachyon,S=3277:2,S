Because e-mail goes over a wire and Wifi is broadcast.
Tapping wires is harder than setting up an antenna in
a truck outside your building.

It has a lot to do with psycology and magazine articles.  It has nothing
to do with security.  If a lot of people were getting screwed because
their e-mail was being read, and it got written up in PC magazine,
security would be a much bigger issue.  A lot of Wifi users have been
screwed and it's showed up in trade journals.  That's all!

Patience, persistence, truth,
