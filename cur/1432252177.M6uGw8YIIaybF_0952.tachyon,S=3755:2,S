I'm working on a second edition of _Disappearing Cryptography_, a 
book about steganography and anonymity on-line. Last week, I offered 
a $10 reward for anyone who reports the technical errors in the first 
edition to me. This week I'm doubling the reward to $20 per error. 
Why? Because I've only gotten one report. That means there are either 
few errors or the incentive isn't large enough. So let's try again.

Here are the rules:

*) Only the first person to report an error wins a prize. This is the 
only way to avoid many people submitting the same error again and 
again and again. I reserve the right to pay duplicate prizes to 
people who appear to have submitted a duplicate in good faith. (The 
only one reported is on page 27 in a sentence describing the Euler 
Totient Function.)

*) I reserve the right to decide the size of an error. If 
misspellings counted, spelling someone's name incorrectly throughout 
the entire book would only count as one error.

*) First person is judged by the time the error arrives in my 
mailbox, pcw@flyzone.com.

*) Only technical errors count. Grammar and spelling errors could 
bankrupt me, even after the copy editing fixes 99%.

*) Please submit the page number.

*) Please let me know if you want your name included in the thanks at 
the beginning of the book.


Thank you. You're free to forward this offer to any other list.
