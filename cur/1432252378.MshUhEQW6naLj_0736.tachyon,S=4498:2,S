Huifeng Biochemistry was formed in the year 20O0 with a view to become 
a cost effective producer and supp|ier of bulk Pharmaceutica| and 
Neutraceutica| products wor|dwide.

One of the major components of the value attached to the acquisition of

patented techno|ogy relating to the production of Rutin.

Rutin is a member of bioflavonoids, a |arge grOup of pheno|ic secondary 
metabolites of p|ants that include more than 2,OO0 different known 
chemicals. Biof|avonoids such as Quercetin, Rutin, and Hesperidin are 
important nutrients due to their ability to strengthen and modulate the 
permeabi|ity of the wal|s of the b|ood vesse|s including capillaries.
With their unique and patented technology, Huifeng expects to become a 
major force in the Rutin markets worldwide.

Secured Data Inc. stands to benefit from this acquisition through the 
ownership of proprietary techno|ogy, strong corporate re|ations with 
Chinese governmenta| agencies, certified manufacturing facilities and 
access to growing markets in which to se|l its drug products.

Estimated revenues for 2O04-20O5 are more then  $100 mil|iOn USD
