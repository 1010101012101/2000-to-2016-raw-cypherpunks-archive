Many Cypherpunks view the need to take up crypto arms to stem off an 
Orwellian, hyper-evil and hyper-competent dictatorship. I'm thinking a more 
likely (and no less threatening) scenario is one like "Brazil" (ie, the 
movie).

Don't forget, the World Trade Center management was on the Intercom trying 
to tell everyone to "Remain inside the Building...It's safest Inside the 
Building".

Fuck. Here on Wall Street I'm a dead man.
