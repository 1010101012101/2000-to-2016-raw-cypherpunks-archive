CALEA is just one ratchet-tooth that needs to be stripped. This shit is 
routinely abused for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with 
bona-fide law enforcement or court proceedings, and often in blatant 
violation of laws. No time for war stories, however.

There may come a time when people will question Tim May's restraint.

In the meantime, the following phrase may come in handy in concievable 
situations: "Go fuck yourself"

Punctuate as required.
