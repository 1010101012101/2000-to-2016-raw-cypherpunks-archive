I think what is silly is not proposing alternatives, and
then being shocked, SHOCKED when frightened "sheeple" make a
choice that is rational according to the information they
have.  A smartcard that contains my biometrics and the
signature of American Airlines, "This person is one of our
pilots" gives the same assurance as a system that sends them
to a central site to look up and add to my voluminous
dossier.  If we don't make the case now, the second system
will be adopted and it will be our fault.
