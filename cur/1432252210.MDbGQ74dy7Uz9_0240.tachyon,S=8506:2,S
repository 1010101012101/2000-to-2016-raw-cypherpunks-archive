MORE ABOUT FORTUCAST: As the name suggests, Fortucast specializes in market timing--knowing WHEN to execute a trade. Accurate timing is difficult to come by because the volatility of today's markets is creating false signals that wreak havoc with traditional timing models. Fortucast combines Elliott wave and Gann with 5 types of cycle analysis--including Barry Rosen's proprietary methods--to filter out ambiguous chart patterns and conflicting technical signals.

ABOUT FORTUCAST PUBLISHER BARRY ROSEN: Barry Rosen's frequent timing for entries at critical points in the market has been described as uncanny! For example in 1990 in Trader's World, he predicted that the US stock market would trend higher into 1998. In 1998, he predicted an important market peak around July 21 at the top of the market that year. By signing up for a free trial now, you can get Barry's latest long-term thinking about the future of the stock market over the next 4 years.
