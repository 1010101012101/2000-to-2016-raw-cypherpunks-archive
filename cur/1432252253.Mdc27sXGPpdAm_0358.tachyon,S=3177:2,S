Females are free to join this list. Some have joined in the past.

"On the Internet, no one knows you're a bitch."

Sorry that you think our list is lacking in "participatory estrogen."

But, then, you're probably the type to complain to about what you 
perceive as domination by whitemales. Tell you what, sistah, teach 
the brothers to read and maybe in 15 years we'll have more "posters 
of color."

Frankly, folks like you have earned extermination. Strong crypto will 
make this possible.
