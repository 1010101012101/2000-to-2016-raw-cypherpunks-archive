The double extension doesn't hide the .VBS - that's just
Microsoft's usual "hide the extension since the couch-potato
user doesn't want to see how the magic works" feature.
The trick with double extensions is that after
Explorer or Outlook hides the .VBS, the user sees the ".JPG"
and says "Oh, this is a picture, I'll click on it",
instead of "Hmmm, this is something I don't recognize,
better leave it alone."
Similar tricks are used for .doc.vbs, .xls.vbs, .txt.vbs, etc.
