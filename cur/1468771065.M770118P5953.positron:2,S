Peter, there is absofuckinglutely NO way I will EVER accept your desire
for me to cow before your authority of interpretation of this despotic
UK bill/Act!!!

You seriously lack self awareness of how I hear the words that you keep
writing, in particular the words in your email below.

You may live in the UK in a circle of folks who accept your authority.

I am not one of them.

Your attempt to impose your authority will succeed with many of the
people, most of the time, because most Western humans are extremely
schooled, and almost exclusively externalise their authority! This is a
fucking shame!!!

And even the folks on THIS list struggle with the conversation!!!! We
are the fringe so-called "anarchists" who bash all governments at every
opportunity, crave a world where individual authority ("sovereignty") is
respected above most other things!

And here you come, to a crypto, anarchist, email mailing list, and say
the things you say below, and the things you say in your other emails.



 You, Peter Fairbrother, are either seriously messed up and intensely
 lacking in self awareness, bombastic in your expectation that others
 submit to/ accept your authority by fiat of your own words (so who the
 fuck are you?!??),

 or you are intentionally trolling us!


Either take a deep breath and go learn to code and read a pschology
primer, or if you can't take the hint, leave this list. Leave us the
hell alone since your words are very dangerous to onlookers such as a
potential future whistleblower who actually needs to come to grips with
the UK jurisdiction and how to cope inside the physical boundaries of
that jurisdiction.


The useful part of the discussion is you quote which apparently (I hope
you are accurate) assembles the relevant bits from the act, which we and
other security minded folks DO need to know about. That's useful and
thanks. Other than that, you don't know what you're talking about.


So take your presumption of authority, and try to put that to a
constructive use. You are presently a fair way away from being
constructive in this conversation.
