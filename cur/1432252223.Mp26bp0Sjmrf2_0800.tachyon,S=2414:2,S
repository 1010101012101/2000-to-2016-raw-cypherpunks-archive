Eh?

OK, I wouldn't have expected you to have heard of Uthman dan Fodio 
and the Fulani Jihad, but you really ought to have some distant 
rumour of Muhammad Ahmad the so-called Mahdi, a generation or two 
earlier than the fall of the Turkish Empire. ()If only because it 
would be rather hard to make any sense of whats going on in North 
Africa without)

Sometimes I wonder if the would would be a better place if most 
Americans learned anything about history that happened east of New 
Bedford or west of the San Andreas fault.  Or that hadn't been 
filtered through a right-wing journalese dumbing-down 
small-c-conservative  small-l-liberal consensus.

But some miracles are too much to hope for.
