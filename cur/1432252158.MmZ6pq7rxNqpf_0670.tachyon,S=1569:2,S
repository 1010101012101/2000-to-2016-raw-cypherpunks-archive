Mixmaster 3.0b1 has just been released. This release includes two year's
worth of development on the Mixmaster software, numerous stability
improvements, anonymity benefits, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. We
would like to agressively move this out of beta into final release as
quickly as possible, so we're highly encouraging users and remailer
operators to send us their feedback.

Mixmaster can be obtained from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mixmaster/
