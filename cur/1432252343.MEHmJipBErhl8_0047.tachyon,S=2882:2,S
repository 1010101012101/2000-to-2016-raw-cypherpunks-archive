   Right. Where is that? It's absolutely impossible to walk or ride a bike down
a city street without breathing tobacco smoke. 
   I'm always amazed at how many so-called libertarians don't get the concept
that their rights end where my nose begins. Everyone should have the right to
enjoy whatever drug they choose -- as long as their use of it doesn't interfere
with other people's rights to not use it. 
   So you really think some drug addict has a right to stand on the street
getting his fix and at the same time forcing it upon everyone else in the
immediate vicinity? I'm amazed that anyone too stupid to understand such a
simple concept is even able to type on a keyboard. 
   By the same logic, it should be alright for me to mix up some LSD and DMSO
and carry it in a little squirtgun to spray smokers with, right?
