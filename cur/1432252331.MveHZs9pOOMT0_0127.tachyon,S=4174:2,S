There was a very large peace march and rally in Pakistan over the weekend 
focusing on the issue of drone strikes in the FATA.  The march was 
organized by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which appears to be a budding 
political party emerging from roots as a peace and justice organization.

The march was scheduled to travel from Islamabad to Waziristan, but was  
apparently impeded by Pakistani security forces which alleged the march  
was under threat.  The march stopped in Tank for a rally led by PTI head  
Imran Khan [ @ImranKhanPTI <http://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI> ].

Reprieve UK was prominent in helping organize the event, represented by  
Clive Smith [ @CliveSSmith <http://twitter.com/CliveSSmith> ]:
