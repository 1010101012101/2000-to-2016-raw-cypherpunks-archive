Agreed... I'm not disagreeing about the problem, just the remedy. As
an example, Sen. Leahy thought his "morphed child porn" bill was
constitutionally problematic, but introduced it anyway:

Same with debate over other bills -- "let the courts figure it out."
And that's assuming the 'critters are being nominally honest instead
of mouthing protect-the-children and other FUD throwaway lines.

If the Congress must approve federal judges, pay their salaries on an
annual basis, and has the constitutional power to limit the
jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, all I'm saying is that the
remedy of Congress passing a law to hold themselves criminally liable --
and having that law enforced by federal judges is not realistic given
the current state of our political system.
