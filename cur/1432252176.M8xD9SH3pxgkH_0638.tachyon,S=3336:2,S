It looks like the G8 fire extinguisher was of the ~20lb variety. This is
the same weight class as the bags of dog food I buy for my dogs. Next time
you buy one get a friend to toss 'em back and forth.

Then ask yourself, does that mass represent a deadly threat?

The reality is that unless they snuck up behind you and hit you in the
head a single might break a bone or arm but would not in any way be life
threatening.

If you've got access to skateboard wrist and elbow pads get a real fire
extinguisher and try to block it with your hand. It ain't that hard.
