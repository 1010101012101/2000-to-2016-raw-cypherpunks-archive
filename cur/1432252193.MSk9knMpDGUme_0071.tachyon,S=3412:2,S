Nice idea, but it won't ever achieve a critical mass of adoptees. Oinking
one's headlights to signify the presense of a cop in waiting is a well
established convention unlikely to be replaced by complicated technology.

People who want to play with gizmos to avoid becoming revenue sources will
buy radar detectors (unless they live in places like VA, where it is
illegal to possess radar detection devices.)
