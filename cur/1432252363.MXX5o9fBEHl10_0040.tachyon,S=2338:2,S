One thing the article said was:

While the point they're trying to make is about false positives,
the THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON THE FBI WATCH LIST just kind of slides by.
That's equal to 5% of the US population, on Federal watch lists.
         (Yes, obviously some of those are foreigners, but then half the US 
population
         are young enough that hopefully almost none of them attract 
Federal attention...)
What an outrage!
