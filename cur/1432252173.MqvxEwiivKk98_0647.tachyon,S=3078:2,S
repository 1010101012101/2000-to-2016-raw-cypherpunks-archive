If anyone needed further proof that Jim Choate is suffering from an 
advanced form of message-forwarding-related-dementia, or is a 'bot sent to 
infest cypherpunks, consider the below.

Recently we saw two call-for-papers messages for the 2002 Financial 
Cryptography conference forwarded to cypherpunks. Both were identical 
(except for headers). Yet Choate forwarded both: One on Tuesday evening and 
the other on Wednesday morning. The reason for this strange behavior is 
left as an exercise for the reader.
