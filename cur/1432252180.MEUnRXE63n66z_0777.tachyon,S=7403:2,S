As I understand it, Keybase is an API. The website/service is merely a
demonstration. The developers are aiming for mass adoption, and so
they've targeted the most popular sites. With some coding, arbitrary
sites could be used, with two requirements. First, it must be possible
for users to post persistent signed proofs. Second, it must be possible
for the API to access those signed proofs, in order to verify them.

That's the value of trackers. Those tracking such a comprised target
would see that various public signed proofs are no longer valid for the
target's key on Keybase. The adversary could alter all of the target's
public signed proofs. But even that wouldn't suffice, because trackers
have independent snapshot histories of public proofs. And furthermore,
snapshot histories are embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain.

Signed proofs could be placed anywhere that's accessible to the API. But
that takes coding, and developers have priorities. One can request.

Anyway, I've created a test identity: https://keybase.io/Proba. Once
I've added enough proofs, and have enough trackers, I plan to mess with
it by replacing the public key held by Keybase, altering some of the
proofs, and so on. Then we can see how that shows up for its trackers,
and for other users. I'll also explore impacts of malicious trackers.
