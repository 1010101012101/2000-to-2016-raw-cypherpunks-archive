Been tried.

Without property rights to separate one man's plan from another man's plan, 
only one plan can be permitted, and any pursuit of alternate goals, or 
pursuit of the same goals through alternate methods is "wrecking", and must 
be crushed.

Without property rights in the means of production there there can only be 
one plan, and one set of planners, to which all must submit.

The alternative to private property rights in the means of production is a 
single plan, one plan for all, one plan that must be imposed on all, which 
necessitates unending terror, as we have invariably and uniformly seen in 
practice.

Private ownership of the land by cattle ranchers, enforced by the shotguns 
of the ranchers.
