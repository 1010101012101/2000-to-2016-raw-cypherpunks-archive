I regularly condemn Israel as racist, partly theocratic  
nation, ruled by murderous bigots elected by homicidally  
bigoted voters.

But on this matter they are quite correct.  Ideally, one  
would to save the hostages and get the hostage takers.  But 
it is necessary to get the hostage takers, and if some 
hostages should die in the course of getting the hostage 
takers, that is the way the cookie crumbles.

The settlements are not human shields.  Rather, they are a
way  of sending contradictory messages:  One message to the
world  in peace initiatives that they are willing to give up
some  land for a peace settlement with the Palestinians, and
the other message to the Palestinians, that Israel is going
to  take it all, so Palestinians should move to Iran or  
someplace.
