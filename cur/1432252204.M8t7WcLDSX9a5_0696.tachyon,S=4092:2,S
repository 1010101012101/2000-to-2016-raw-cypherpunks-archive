Ken Adelman, the retired gazillionaire who has gained new fame as a  
photographer of the California coastline, lives a couple of parcels  
from me, perhaps half a kilometer.

For a while now, I'd  wondered who owned the heliport that had  
helicopters departing and arriving a few times a week (that I knew  
of...could have been more). I couldn't actually see the heliport, due  
to some ridges and some trees, but I could see the choppers banking  
over my hilltop and disappearing behind a ridge.

Well, today I did some Googling on Ken Adelman, who I already knew was  
a Corralitos resident. I had no idea where in my little community he  
lived, only that he had California's largest private solar cell array  
(and had gotten into yet another controversy, with PG&E, our power  
monopoly, when he proposed to connect his array to the grid and be paid  
for the power he _added_ to the grid, as per official law and PG&E  
policy...it seems PG&E really doesn't _want_ the sheeple generating  
power, though they tolerate tiny, hobbyist generators...but Adelman['s  
array was an actual competitor, and would cost them money, so they  
tried to nix it...another story).

In reading about the controversy over Streisand's property, I saw that  
Adelman is using his own helicopter. A bell went off in my head and I  
Googled to find his home address.

His address in the phone book is unlisted, but he gave his home address  
in one or more of his ventures, and so up it popped in a Google search  
on his name: 1365 Meadowridge Rd., the road just before mine (Allan  
Lane) off of Brown's Valley Road. My address is 427 Allan Lane.  
Entering these into Yahoo or Mapquest shows how close our properties  
are.

Here's one such street map:

His property is about where the first "d" in Meadowridge Rd. appears.  
My property is at the end of Allan Lane.

Obviously, then, it is his helicopter I've been seeing flying over to  
about that spot. (Tiny chance it's someone else's...)

BTW, I don't think this Ken Adelman, who is now 39-40, is the same Ken  
Adelman who advised Reagan in the 1980s on arms control--the D.C.-based  
Adelman was graying and balding at least 15 years ago, so I doubt  
they're the same person. But I haven't done enough Googling, nor have I  
found images of the Corralitos version, to be sure. More research is  
needed.
