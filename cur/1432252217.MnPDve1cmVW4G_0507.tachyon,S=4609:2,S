The letter signed by the 'economists' is already prima facia evidence in
support of 'network externality' and 'path dependence' as real effects.

A debate would only be further evidence in favor of their existance.

I've read only a small part of the various URL's that have been forwarded,
and a major reason for these sorts of effects to be out there, which is
ignored in this debate as near as I can tell, is 'nobody wants to be
first' with respect to bucking the trend.

The MS case is a perfect example: "Nobody ever lost their job for buying
IBM."

The reality is that people knew they were purchasing sub-optimal
resources. Their hope was that market effects with respect to support and
software would make up any difference. Sometimes the solution that gets
selected is 'good enough' rather than 'best'.
