[numerous foreign airspace violations by Turkey elided]

Out of interest, is there a word for "hypocrite" in the Turk's native language?

Well that plan didn't quite come together - with Russia's navy now on
a hair trigger "shoot to kill any air based threat" order (and Russia
closing their military comm lines with Turkey), Turkey had no option
but to ground their F-16 fleet.

There's a saying widely used in Russia - Russia never starts a war,
but she always ends them.

The terrorists, whether you call them moderate or otherwise, have
spread from the middle east (including Syria) to France, Russia and
other countries. Russia will end this war in Syria, with or without
support from "the West" - in defence of the sovereignty of Syria (the
overthrow of which by Western powers as we now know was planned and
attempted since decades ago), in defence of the Christians and other
minorities of Syria, and in defence of Russia's interests such as the
defence of a long time ally, as dignity and pride demands.

France's Napoleon, the Ottoman Empire, WWII Germany and more - when
you begin war against Russia, you sign your own "going to lose"
warrant. So Rule #1 of war is, make agreement with Russia prior to
starting war, no matter who else you are going to war with.

Rule #2 of war - refer to Rule #1.

Quite simple really.

Zenaan
