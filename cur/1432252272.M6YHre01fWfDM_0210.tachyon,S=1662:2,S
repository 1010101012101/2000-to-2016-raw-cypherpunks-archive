Thanks, interesting.  I think anyone with access to the original
picture would detect something is there, but the nice thing is
that they wouldn't know how to decode the message.  It still depends
on not messing up too many bits, which is similar to "obvious"
methods, but I like the use of erf() to estimate the message.

Patience, persistence, truth,
