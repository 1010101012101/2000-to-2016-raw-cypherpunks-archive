OK, more dumb questions about hiding a Tor node.

Even though the current list of Tor node IP addresses is basically public, 
I'm not 100% convinced it woul have to be.

Well, exit and entry nodes perhaps have to be public, but what about nodes 
inside the cloud? OK, anything sent to one of those nodes by an edge node 
has to use a unencrypted IP address on the packet header, right? BUT, the 
same machines that house the Tor nodes could (and probably do, right?) house 
other services as well...a packet sent to the Tor node has to be sent to the 
right socket and layer 4 service. Right? And THAT can be encrypted, and 
probably already is by Tor nodes. (Now remember I'm not a datacom guy...)

If the list of interior Tor nodes is encrypted and only machine-readable by 
other Tor nodes, AND if we have a few additional  services residing on the 
same machines as the Tor nodess, then a packet sent to a machine housing a 
Tor node may or may not actually be going to a Tor node.

If the operators of that machine are also unaware of the precise 
service-bundle existing on the machine (not unreasonable as long as someone 
is paying them for the consumed bandwidth) AND if packets destined for that 
machine can reasonably be said to be accessing a non-TOR service AND if the 
IP address list of interior TOR nodes is encrypted, is the Tor node now 
disguised? Seems to me it would be difficult for some  authorities to track 
down the location of some Tor nodes.

Or am I missing something? Like I said, I'm no datacom guy, but hiding a Tor 
node deosn't seem impossible to me.
