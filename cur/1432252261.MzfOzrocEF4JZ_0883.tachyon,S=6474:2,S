The quote said nothing to the contrary. Crude results in some 
fraction of gasoline/petrol, and taxes are applied. His point was 
that the taxes are about 4-5 times the cost of the underlying petrol, 
which is about what it is in the U.K. (Last I heard, gas in the U.K. 
is about the equivalent of about $4-5 a gallon for unleaded regular.)
