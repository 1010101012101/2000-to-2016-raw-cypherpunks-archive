Yep.  Everyone who's serious -from Dr. Kazcynzski to the ALF/Earth!
folks-
knows about keeping your DNA, prints, fibers, toolmarks off the product.

You even wipe the stuff from the hardware store so that the *clerk's*
prints are off, since that would tip location.

And McVeigh used ammonium nitrate which wasn't tested, and as a
highly soluable (in fact deliquescent) inorganic it probably won't
persist like a nitrated organic.  Also common as dirt in agville.

Nothing like dropping a little Miracle Gro in the men's room at the
airport to
keep the mass spec goon awake :-)

Note that if hair is collected they've got your DNA too.
