Perhaps, this is a clear demonstration of your own lack however.

It's interesting (and something I've commented on before, check the
archives :) that the 'leaders' of the C-A-C-L viewpoint are always ready
to bitch about how 'terrible' the government is and how it degrades their
profits. And then when somebody actually gets up and acts on it they're
the first ones to bail. The real reason they're not sensitive to these
particular 'anarchist' is that they aren't motivated by the alure of
money. They aspire to a higher calling than crass commercialism or
puritanical ego fulfillment. I've said it before, I'll say it again.

The majority of the C-A-C-L contingent, in particular their 'leaders', are
a bunch of money hungry hypocrites. God $ Fascism. Just more of the same.
