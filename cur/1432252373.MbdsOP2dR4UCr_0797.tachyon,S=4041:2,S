Ah...

(You're not back in tune with why you don't miss cpunks all
*that* much without a good, quick, Tim-May: "killing them 
would be fully justfied.")  I'm fully aware of cypherpunks' views
on libel law, for me they're not the issue in the Gold Age case
IMO. 

The lawyer thought the false headline libelous*, and wanted the
Wired site to (do what they've since done and) fix it. Personally,
I think the case against Parker's the outrage here, so if you're
all kind enough to pardon me letting lawyers be lawyers, I'll be
leaving now.

* Declan didn't (and apparently doesn't ever get to) write the 
headline for stories. I thought the headline was a weird joke
at first, frankly, but then I remembered an experience with a 
letter I once wrote for the Miami Herald, where the headline
and caption completely contradicted everything I said.
