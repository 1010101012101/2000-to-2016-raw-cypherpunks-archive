I had technical reasons to need to, and then momentum and a stream of
life events meant it took me ~8 years (since pre general availability
when it was invite only) to break that addiction!

That's long time to be without a libre email stack, and a long time to
be dependent on a company that, to justify the money they take from the
NSA, having already stopped saying "do no evil" a few years back when
they went into China, -now- has to further say:

Build your own network. Rollout your own home servers/ open stack/
etc.

It's the only way you will ever get any "reasonable expectation of
privacy" honoured!

Enjoy the ride, too :)

Few ISPs provide a fixed IP address for free if you ask, some certainly
provide a fixed IP if you pay a little extra every month.

Recommended to have two IP addresses too - have fun :)
