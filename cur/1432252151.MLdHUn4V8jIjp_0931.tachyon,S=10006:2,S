New 32-bit SIM Chip from STMicroelectronics Will Benefit Mobile Phone
Multimedia Services
 GENEVA, Oct. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- STMicroelectronics has announced
a new smartcard MCU in its ST22 range -- based on the SmartJ(TM)
Java-accelerated RISC architecture -- which integrates 256-kbytes of EEPROM
memory with a high performance CPU to support the demands of multimedia
applications on the latest mobile phones.


 With sales of multimedia-equipped handsets booming, mobile communications
operators supporting 3G (Third Generation) and 2.5G mobile phones need
(U)SIM cards (Universal Subscriber Identity Modules) that have sufficient
memory capacity to store Multimedia Messaging System (MMS) data, video, and
photographic images, coupled with the capability to transfer and use this
data efficiently to provide advanced phonebooks and audio-visual services.
2.5G is an intermediate level of service that uses an enhanced
second-generation technology to provide some of the 3G features over GPRS
(General Packet Radio Service).
 "The ST22N256 is perfectly in line with the growing demand for secure
high-performance chips with high-speed interfaces and a large memory
capacity, for use in 2.5 and 3G SIMs," said Reza Kazerounian, General
Manager of ST's Smart Card ICs Division. "ST already offers the largest
range of secure 32-bit processors for smartcard systems, and will remain at
the forefront of smartcard silicon suppliers as 3G takes off."
 The SmartJ CPU core at the heart of ST22 Family -- which the new ST22N256
now combines with 256-kbytes of EEPROM -- is a 32-bit RISC-architecture
core developed specifically to provide very fast execution of Java, the
programming language commonly used for small applications, or applets,
downloaded to mobile phones. The ST22 augments its own highly efficient
native RISC instruction set with a hardware decoder that directly converts
Java bytecodes into native microcode instructions, thereby eliminating the
overhead and lower performance of processors based on Java emulation. The
result is not only very fast Java execution but also reduced power
consumption.
 An essential component of all GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) mobile phones, the SIM card stores critical subscriber
authentication information; private data such as personal phone
directories, messages, audio, and images; and the operating system and
operator's multimedia environment. With the quantity and size of users' MMS
messages increasing, operators will now be able to provide increased
storage for subscriber data without impacting user friendliness, due to the
exceptional performance of the ST22N256's SmartJ processor, and its
communication through a fast Asynchronous Serial Interface (ASI) which
enables 440-kbit/s communication speeds with mobile equipment, in line with
the fastest deployments of ISO 7816 in the GSM world. Two additional serial
I/O ports are also provided.
 The Java-accelerated CPU ensures that the ST22N256 not only provides the
memory needed for today's multimedia services (M-services), but also the
processing power to exploit it. The core, with 24-bit linear memory
addressing, is complemented by 368-kbytes of on-chip ROM, 16-kbytes of RAM,
and a set of standard peripherals and custom plug-in circuits. Logical and
physical security mechanisms are fully integrated into the silicon,
including a hardware Memory Protection Unit for application firewalling and
peripheral access control, and a protected Context Stack. The core includes
dedicated DES (Data Encryption Standard) instructions for Secret Key
cryptography, and a fast Multiply and Accumulate instruction for Public Key
(RSA) and Elliptic Curve cryptography, plus a CRC (Cyclic Redundency Check)
instruction. A firmware cryptographic subroutine library is located in a
secure ROM area to save designers the need to code first-layer functions.
 The ST22 product platform is supported by a comprehensive Integrated
Development Environment, which allows coding, compilation, and debugging
using a common interface. It provides a code-generation chain that includes
a C/C++ compiler, a native and JavaCard assembler and a linker, plus a
SmartJ instruction set simulator, C/C++ source level debugger, and hardware
emulation tools. Operating System developers currently working with the
128-kbyte ST22L128 will be able to benefit from the design continuity
offered by the ST22N256, as well as its immediate availability and
compliance with the fastest communication standard adopted by handset
manufacturers.
 The SmartJ development methodology allows customers to significantly
reduce the time and cost of developing secure applications. It supports
concurrent hardware and software development, multiple development teams
and IP reuse, as well as security evaluation to the Common Criteria and the
use of formal methods for security assurance through executable high-level
specifications and model checking techniques.
 Development of the ST22N256 follows more than 20 years' experience in the
design of silicon products to the highest levels of security. ST is a major
manufacturer for the smartcard market, and is the number one supplier of
secure ICs to the financial sector for card applications. Over the years it
has evolved a "security culture" across design and manufacturing functions,
in addition to meeting the stringent requirements of formal security
certification.
 The ST22N256 is manufactured using 0.15-micron technology, and is
currently the only secure IC to combine 32-bit processing power with 256-
kbytes of EEPROM and 368-kbytes of ROM. It is available in sample form now,
with volume production starting 2005. US pricing for the product is between
$4 and $5, depending on quantity and final packaging.
