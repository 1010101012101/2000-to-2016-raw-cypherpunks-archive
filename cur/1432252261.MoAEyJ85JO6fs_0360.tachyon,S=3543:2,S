Has the fact that a disaster occurred changed much? The US was always
vulnerable, now the general population knows it. I'm expecting war in
the Middle East and reprisals in the States. There is not a great deal
anyone can do about it. 

As for the fallout of Tuesday's events, well...the heart of the crypto
issue hasn't changed one iota. Those idiots who are advocating bans and
back doors are off in the tall grass as they always have been. They are
promising safety that they cannot now or ever deliver no matter what
tools they are given. Like con artists soliciting donations that will
never make it to the people who need it they are trying to leverage a
tragedy as a means to further their own businesses, careers and power
with no regard for the outcome.

Are these advocates of the erosion of civil liberties enemies and
criminals? Sure, and they'll be fought the same way they've been fought
before - in the courts, in the press and in front of a monitor. As for
the talk of violence, I have no way, need or desire to sort the
rhetorical from the real so I won't even try.

Yesterday I was behind any action our government wanted to take, today,
after hearing calls to increase domestic surveillance capabilities and
learning that my keychain Victorinox is a felonious weapon, I'm back to
my usual pessimism. I think there are far too many clueless morons in
positions of power for the job of governing to be done well. I hope that
I'm wrong and that there are enough truly bright and dedicated people to
do a good job.

Mike
