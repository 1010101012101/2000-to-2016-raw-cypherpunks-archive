No dipshit, you have a right to TRY TO BE HAPPY.

Typical anarcho/libertarian bullshit misprepresentation. And another prime
example of 'freedom for me, but not for thee'.

This is a perfect example of the failure of libertarian/anarcho thought,
it is completely focused on the 'me'.

When will you learn that free market economics is about the market and its
stability and not the individuals attainment of nirvana. I'll answer my
own question, never.
