Years ago, John Gilmore pre-emptively tried to kill the Cypherunks list by
first attempting to censor it, and then giving everyone very short notice
that he would cease carrying the list at Toad.

When the list became even more popular, and distributed, John Gilmore kept
his node running, despite the fact it wasn't connected to any of the other
nodes, propagated huge amounts of spam, and wasn't officially part of the
new system.

Now that years have gone by since John Gilmore has made any meaningful
contribution to the Cypherpunks list, he sends out an "official"
announcement that Toad, which should have stopped carrying Cypherpunks a
long time ago, and isn't really even a legitimate node in the new scheme
of distribution, will now cease carrying Cypherpunks traffic.

This is spun by a clueless ReportWhore into a story that a "Founder" of
Cypherpunks has officially announced its demise.

Vulis had a nickname for Gilmore.  It began with a "C."
