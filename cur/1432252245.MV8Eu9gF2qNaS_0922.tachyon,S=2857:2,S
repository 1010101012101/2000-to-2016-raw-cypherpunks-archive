There's a specific niche of high-volume topical news lists. They're designed
to distribute the mining the news sources load. Life's too short for
everybody to read every news source just to learn what's new in a specific
area.

They can take a while to get started, but once they go critical they
can become a valuable resource.

My problem with cpunx-news is that I've found relying on other people
for critical infrastructure a mistake.
