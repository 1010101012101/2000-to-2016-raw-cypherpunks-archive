I think that filtering software is an interesting case.

While most of us would not use filtering software, I honestly think
that it's important to freedom.  

If nobody comes up with some filterware that works, then there will 
probably be continuing pressure to regulate content.  

Count me in favor of filtering software -- just not in favor of its 
*compulsory* use.  I want all the idiots who care about such things 
to filter out the sites I like and not see or think about them any 
more. 'cause if they think about them, they're likely to try and 
eliminate them.
