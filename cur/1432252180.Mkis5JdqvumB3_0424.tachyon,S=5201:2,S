Take a look at Barchart.com's recent BUY rating on LEXG.OB HERE, and look at their technical analysis page HERE  which shows more than 12 positive buy signals for the company!
 
Barchart.com buy signal looks nice, but it's only the beginning of the attention this company is likely to see!
 
It wouldn't surprise us to see LEXG.OB profiled in upcoming research with a price target that shows them to be extremely undervalued! We think $3.00 is on the conservative side of the spectrum.
 
You've probably seen the recent attention LEXG.OB has been getting around the trading world right now... recent news, trading patterns and much more tell us that LEXG.OB is making a play, and it could potentially be bigger than anyone is thinking...
 
The last few times we saw a company put out news and press with this type of volume and activity to report the stock moved from $.12 cents to $10.68 in mere weeks, resulting in returns of literally several thousand percent for traders who saw the play early on and got in on the action. What was that stock? Yes, you guessed it, it was LEXG.OB!!!
 
Will LEXG.OB make the same move AGAIN? It's impossible to say, but the one thing we know for sure is that the company is making some aggressive progress and appears to be increasing their activity, if anything. Regardless of where, what and when the play is in this situation, the bottom line is that we're looking at a company that has a goal in mind and is actively pursuing every possible avenue to reach that goal, which in our experience has spelled profits for shareholders!
 
Whether you decide this company is for you or not, it's worth your time to keep LEXG.OB on your radar and see how it plays out over the next day to week to month or more... one thing's for sure, LEXG.OB  has something brewing, and it could be something that takes it over the top!
