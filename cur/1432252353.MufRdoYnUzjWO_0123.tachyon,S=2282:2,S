What is characteristic of all these Bush-winning stories is that
the writers uniformly seem surprised it happened. More surpised
than the Democrats. Their post-election commentary conveys
that it is hard to believe by most Americans that Bush seems to 
have won, if you read the winners and losers accounts carefully.

Wolfe's piece shows the common feature of dumbfoundness,
as if not quite clear how it happened, despite all the cliches being
bruited, especially the one about the Bush campaign reaching 
all those millions who liked him and what he is doing.

There a nervousness in the winners' stories, an unsureness
that there was a legitimate win, that something might be discovered
to invalidate it, so its best to push the good news before it
evaporates or is transformed into bad news so closely associated
with the Bush administration. 

The Bush-win proponents sound like they are whistling in the dark. 
And their whistling keeps getting louder and more persistent and
more hysterical, if you bother to read the anxious urgings Herr 
Dr. Heidegger is posting here.
