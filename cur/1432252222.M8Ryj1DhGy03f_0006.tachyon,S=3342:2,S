 >>The Catalonian "anarchists" needed a leadership in order to
impose socialism, resulting in such bizarre and amusing
titles as "Anarchist minister of the economy". This had the
usual unfortunate side effect that the midlevel militants,
the nomenclatura that operated the bureacracy, the prisons,
and the killing fields, found themselves utterly powerless in
the hands of their leaders, as was illustrated when the
leadership casually dissolved the local committees. <<

Anarchist minister for justice! Yeah,Its funny how things went.Many grass 
roots anarchs knew all was lost by then and the revolution was well and 
truly lost shortly after it was won.See "homage to Catalonia."Hugh 
Thomas,then your stuff,then if your a thinking punk,see,"Objectivity and 
liberal scholarship".Luckily we'll have APster to revoce and rotate those 
anarchist "leaders" of the crypto-anarchist revolution that will try and 
sell us out.(such as that anarcho-charlatan, Tim May)
