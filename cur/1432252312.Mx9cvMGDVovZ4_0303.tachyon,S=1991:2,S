Microsoft Admits Flaw in Windows Software

WASHINGTON - Microsoft Corp. acknowledged a critical vulnerability
Wednesday in nearly all versions of its flagship Windows operating
system
software, the first such design flaw to affect its latest Windows Server
2003
software.
...

Microsoft said corporate firewalls commonly block the type of data
connections
that hackers outside a company would need for these attacks. The flaw
affects
Windows technology used to share data files across computer networks.

[Yes but a virus can exploit from *within* the system.]

...
But four Polish researchers, known as the "Last Stage of Delirium
Research
Group," said they discovered how to bypass the additional protections
Microsoft
added, just three months after the software went on sale.

[Gotta love that acronym..]
