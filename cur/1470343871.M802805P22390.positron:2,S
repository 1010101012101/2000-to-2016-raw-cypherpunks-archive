Agreed. I'm just saying that such an arrangement is not inconceivable in an
anarchic/voluntary society. And without the state to force it on everyone,
assuming no single "court" system comes to dominate and abuse its monopoly
position, I doubt it could be nearly as harmful. And even if some court
does become a monopoly, since opting out of even a monopoly voluntary court
system is far easier than opting out of a state.

Agreed. Though even under the status quo there are situations where
corporations lose their limited liability, such as in certain criminal
scenarios. Limited liability can only apply in a voluntary society where a
transaction has taken place. Third parties can always sue in some court
that does not recognize the limited liability, and it may well be that even
within the same court system, they decided to drastically limit the scope
of limited liability, for example only to situations where a transaction
has taken place. Not sure what that would mean to, say, product liability
where a third party is injured, though. But unlimited product liability
could result in a far smaller number of products. Who'd make a car, for
example? Or an airliner? Sure, the airline could require passengers to
agree not to sue, but they can't do that for people on the ground. Under
the status quo there's blanket indemnification for airlines and aircraft
manufacturers. That is probably not the best solution, but I also don't
know what is or how one would implement it in a purely voluntary society.
Intuitively I think (hope) it must be possible, but I am by no means
certain.

Or maybe unlimited liability is just no big deal and limited liability has
always just been a way for some people to gain advantage over others.
Perhaps without a system like the US's that encourages frivolous lawsuits,
there would be no need.

I think by the time revolution happens, people HAVE done these things, and
the government's response has been to crack down rather than reforming.
Exactly what is happening in the US right now with police brutality.
Perhaps if more people got involved, the government could have been
convinced to reform rather than cracking down further, but it is a central
tenet of governing that you need to have a reasonably large and productive
class that is happy with its modicum of control, i.e. the "middle" class.
Keep them happy and protected from the lower class, and you can keep
society under control.

I suppose it depends on how you're counting. Reform happens all the time.
Not often reforms the size of what you get from revolutions, but I'd say
far more positive change happens through gradual reform than directly from
revolution. But perhaps I'm setting the bar too low by qualifying it with
"directly."

"If only enough people would resist". But keeping people from resisting en
masse is government's specialty. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. As
Mike explains in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, sometimes you have to make
things worse before they get better. I.e. convince people to revolt by
making it so they are no longer comfortable.

I think Uruguay is actually on the forefront of drug legalization. Colorado
is ahead of Amsterdam, even, because drugs have never really been legal
there. Buying and using is legal, but a bunch of other necessary parts like
growing & transporting are not. The authorities just look the other way,
but can change their minds at any time and have cracked down in the past.

Indeed, and even if/when it succeeds, Google will just become another
vertically-integrated telecomms giant.

Research can never prove something is secure, only that it's insecure. Low
latency onion routing is about as crappy as you can get when it comes to
anonymity, just a step above a chain of proxies. I see no reason a high
latency mix net couldn't be made sufficiently secure with, say, operators
in mutually antagonistic countries.

Maybe. Definitely if you assume that government will eventually outlaw all
anonymous use of the Internet. Of course, then they could always phrase the
legislation in such a way that an N2N mesh network is also covered. Are you
forwarding packets from your neighbor to a different neighbor? Well, you're
"providing a public communications service" or some such bullshit.
