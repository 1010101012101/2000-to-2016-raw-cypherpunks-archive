Choate on Eco-Terrorism:
#    http://slashdot.org/science/01/07/01/1634213.shtml

While searching for 'fire unsolved "melt concrete"',
I came across:
    http://www.landrights.org/ALRA.oregonian.eco-terrorism.htm

The robotic blimp idea reminded me of a TV report I
saw where someone is occasionally setting fires around
the country using some sort of chemicals that burn
very, very hot. It burned holes through some concrete
building tops. A real mystery, and they didn't know
what the chemicals were.

No "cause" was involved, just the love of fire.

But I don't remember the channel, and I can't find a
trace of it using google. If anyone has heard of this
let me know. Sounds like good blimp payload for radomes. ;-)

Found a lot of weird stuff while searching.

    The melting point of concrete varies between 1800-25000C.

    Explode a hotdog using #24 copper wire and a large capacitor (pending)
    (did you know - a hotdog will dissipate 5 million watts at 20,000 volts???)

#    Speeder Clocked At -- 712 MPH?!

#    KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A driver accused of going 712
#    mph in a 56 zone says there must be some mistake that's nearly
#    the speed of sound.
#    
#    While he doesn't claim to be completely innocent, Lim Ang Hing
#    says his speedometer on his sedan goes only up to 161, The Star
#    newspaper reported Tuesday.
#    
#    In February, a taxi driver received a speeding ticket for
#    allegedly driving at 696 mph. Police said the problem is
#    probably a technical glitch.
