It wasn't a close election, was it?

Didn't think so.

In the U.S., when the election isn't close, the ballots are counted, 
and recounted, by midnight of the day of the election...maybe by 
mid-morning the next day.

It's the _closeness_ that magnifies potential hinge points into court 
cases, redefinitions, and recriminations.

As for "Hey, kids, let's all put on an electronic vote!," it's been 
discussed many times here. And elsewhere. RISKS had a major 
discussion of the...risks.

As someone said in recentl weeks, if we really want to see elections 
stolen efficiently, make them electronic. No paper trail, no 
evidence, no chads, just pure gleaming bits.
