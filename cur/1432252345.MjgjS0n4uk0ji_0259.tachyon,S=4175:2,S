No, but NSA's job is just the first part of that.  They don't target
drones, or anything like that.

yes, this is definitely a cost.  And the FBI finally said "enough"!  I
kinda wonder if this was due to miscommunication, and the FBI thought
they were getting finished analytical product.

This is how the Intelligence Community works.  Collection is considered
the A#1 task, and they are inveterate packrats.  It's far easier to fill
hard drives with junk than to make active use of it.  Sad, but true.

Well, realistically:  no, probably not.  The US is grieviously far
behind in this.  There is little or no chance in three years that
someone who can pass the security screen can achieve the necessary
language proficiency level in say, Dari or Uzbek, in 3 years -- meaning,
good enough to translate, with decent accuracy and speed, colloquial,
accented telephone chatter -- regardless of the amount of $ you throw at
the problem.

There are already a series of bonuses for military and civilian
government employees who can pass language proficiency tests, so it
isn't as though we aren't trying.

>So the answer to a fuck-up is to make it a clusterfuck?

I wasn't trying to justify it, just answer some of the questions you
posed.  I warned you they might not make sense when you received them :-)
