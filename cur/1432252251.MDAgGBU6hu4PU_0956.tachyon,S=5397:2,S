Hi Declan. Er, yes, the state probably appears to be claiming that.

The statute has a McIntyre-derived exception for people who spend less than 
$300 and act as lone gunm...pampleteers.  This is an intentional misreading 
of McIntyre as applying only to little old ladies in tennis shoes. Instead, 
the ohio statute, including the part applying to candidates, was found 
facially invalid. See Griset, 1999, and/or
Stewart v Taylor (http://communities.msn.com/robbinstewart under cases.)
Chandler v Georgia established that candidates for public office don't waive 
the rights they have as citizens, to be free from warrantless piss-testing 
(in that case) or from being threatened with jail for using a hotmail 
account (in this one.)

Unfortunately, in McIntyre the court used the term "narrowly tailored", so 
election authorities, acting in bad faith, have been inserting exceptions 
(the little old lady exception, the skywriting exception, the vote for smith 
exception, etc.) and then claiming their version is more narrowly tailored, 
and thus distinguishable. This becomes an annual event, so my job becomes 
sissiph....becomes frustrating. On the one hand, I have full employment for 
life, on the other the conspiracy to benevolently censor online election 
speech is able to continue its
progrom even while losing most of the cases.
I have found very little in the way of support from the online
community as to using these election cases for establishing a general 
principle that online speech is protected by state and federal free speech 
clauses.
Instead, most of the case law on our side has come from the ACLU's 
"indecency" cases.
I've been banging my head against a wall on this theme for about three years 
now, but I'm reaching a point where I'll need some kind of institutional 
support or will have to go back to having a day job and just do this as a 
hobby.  My bottleneck is that I don't know how to line up cocounsel in the 
30-some states that need to be sued over this.

Cordially, robbin
