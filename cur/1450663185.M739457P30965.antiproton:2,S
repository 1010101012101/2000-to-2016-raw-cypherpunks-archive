Also agree with thecthulhu.  Cryptome's stance on mirroring has become 
arcane, and they like to dole out plenty of criticism but refuse to adopt 
basic security protocols.  Yeah, it's not perfect.  It's what we have for 
the moment, though, and it's better than nothing.  Thecthulhu's 14-day key 
posting idea makes a lot of sense.  I'm interested in others' views as well.

Tbh, I'm wary of Cryptome admin these days.  When they recently tweeted out 
bullshit like 'Sabu's handler's number' to Jake then tried to backpedal as 
usual and say it was a joke, like all the other recent "jokes"... well, 
many of us are not amused.

Cryptome is, or was for a very long time, a respected repository of 
information.  It'd be perfectly understandable if you're ready to hang it 
up, just please do it soon before you run it off the rails.  Please pass it 
along to others who are ready to take up the task and maintain what you 
have so painstakingly built.

Sorry for veering slightly off-topic.  It recently came up in conversation 
and this seemed like a good time to bring it up.
