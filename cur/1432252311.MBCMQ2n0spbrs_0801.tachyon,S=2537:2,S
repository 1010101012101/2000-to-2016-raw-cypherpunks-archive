But do they have a right to use my property to queue up bulk ads
that I'm stuck either reading or putting in the trash?

And how unreasonable is it for each such medium to have an opt-in
do-not-contact list?  Should it be legal to dump stuff on my doorstep or
in my mailbox even when I've clearly indicated I don't want any of it?
Why do they have the right to assume, "maybe he didn't know what he was
saying... maybe he wants *this* ad?"

It's obvious where that line of reasoning goes with another more heinous
crime.
