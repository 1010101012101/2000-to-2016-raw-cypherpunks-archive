With all due respect,
you are not being very constructive.

If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you are loud-mouthing to identify
those not contempt with the current system.
Could you be a legislator/policeman?

The system legitimizes its existence with
destructive/ambiguous comments like the one you've made.

Try changing the system with pro-positive thinking.
