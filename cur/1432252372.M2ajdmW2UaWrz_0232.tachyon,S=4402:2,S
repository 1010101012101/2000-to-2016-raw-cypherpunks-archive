PayPal is a poor choice due to fraud and repudiation issues. From a 
transactor's viewpoint one should only exchange harder for softer money

However, eGold would be excellent: no repudiations.

First you must identify and reach your potential customers.  Does anyone 
know where I could get a relatively list of hushmail addresses?

Does using eGold change the MIX characteristics or feasibility?

Possible downsides
