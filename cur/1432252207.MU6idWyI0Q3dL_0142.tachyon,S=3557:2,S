Uh, excuse me?!

I can see how such an idea works if you add a random variable with a known
mean to the data.  A researcher could do this before storing the data, in
order to protect the confidentiality of individual respondents, and still
be able to compute aggregate statistics.

However, if you XOR a bit with a random bit, you have something equally
likely to be in either state.  Even a large collection of yes/no responses
XORed with random bits is indistinguishable from random data.

So I am afraid I must give the prior message my coveted "Silliest Thing
Said On the Internet This Week" award.  <Chortle>
