<b>RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY.</b>

production and transmission.  The current industry revenues
exceeds $900,000,000 and should reach a triple digit growth rate for =
the next five or more years.  Estimates today indicate that
there could be as much as $25 billion in revenues from "smell =
technology" by the end of 2003.   =20
