Subject: Legal FAQs on NSA Wiretaps

Dave:

        I have written ?Legal FAQs on NSA Wiretaps.?  It just went
up at www.americanprogress.org/FAQswiretaps and www.peterswire.net.

        There is a short executive summary, and also more detailed
Q&As.  The intent is to write for a smart lay audience, and not only
for lawyers.  The hope is to update over time.

        It reaches very different conclusions from the ?Myths and
Realities about NSA Wiretaps? that the Justice Department posted today.

        Best,

        Peter
