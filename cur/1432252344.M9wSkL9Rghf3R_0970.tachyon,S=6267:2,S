Payments Systems and Security
18/19th June 2004

Enhyper are proud to announce a conference with a difference, to be held at
The Innholders Hall on 18/19th Jun 2004.

 Overview


 At PaySec2004 we've brought together  payment systems developers, security
architects, operational risk practitioners and academics to address all
aspects of technology, security and operation in the payment systems
domain, both present and future  state.

 The best of the Internet versus the best of the City.  Short key technical
demonstrations will be interspersed  to bring context to the challenges and
the solutions.  Rump sessions will allow you to contribute your experiences
for the benefit of others.
 Headline Topics


 The conference will cover many crucial topics  in the Payment Systems field:
	* 	 Payment Transformations and integration: a revolutionary code
generation approach
	* 	 Settlement to T+0 and RTGS
	* 	 Programmatic electronic contract negotiation
	* 	 Systems Performance Monitoring: Service Level Compliance
	* 	 Extensible Electronic Currency Frameworks
	* 	 SSL/SSH based infrastructure to enhance federated security
	* 	 Payment Systems as Critical National Infrastructure
	* 	 Automated System Risk Audits for Operational Risk Compliance
	* 	 Strategies for Defending against Infrastructure Attacks
	* 	 Reusable Security Architecture via pre-risk assessed patterns

 Conference Ethos


 Security of payments is more than the application of cryptography over
the the Internet, and more than a secured private network between  banks:
it is the application of all of the disciplines - technology,  a legal
framework, risk analysis and mitigation, insurance, good management
practice and strong accounting.

 Our desire is to bring the following four streams together  in one
conference in the context of applied security:
 Applications, Infrastructure, Risk  and Research.


Applications

 Blending today's payment systems providers with state-of-the-art payment
technology developers combines experience with innovative technology.
	* 	 An Escape From Hard-Coded Application Integration:
Demonstration and discussion of a highly scalable  message format
definition, transformation and transport modelling toolset which solves
data integration issues for legacy systems, message-orientated middleware
and XML based  messaging systems.
	* 	Electronic Payments and Contracts: Live demonstration and
discussion of several  payments frameworks and electronic contract
mechanisms.  Discussion of operational aspects and how new  financial
instruments can be supported.

Infrastructure

 Computer infrastructure is changing from service-based to  web service
delivery. To deliver these services, Grid Infrastructures offer enhanced
platform utilistation and massive scalability.

	* 	 From Client/Server to Grid-based Web Services:  Government see
grid computing as the powerhouse behind  a new economy. We meet the
Director of the UK Government's initiative.

	* 	 Application Security and Risk Assessment:  Security is no longer
that last final step before production. Threat analysis must be considered
on all levels, not just any single one. Risk assessment is no longer a
subjective, paper based exercise. Many organisations face the challenge of
measuring their level of security, their level of risk and their progress
in securing their IT resources. We present a framework for the reuse of
security architecture patterns which streamlines the whole development
process and greatly enhances application security and awareness.

 Automated risk assessment techniques will be demonstrated in a
revolutionary approach to network vulnerability.

Risk

 The 21st century has brought risks and attacks never previously thought
realistic outside a Hollywood movie, but now have to be analysed,
quantified, and prepared for.
	* 	 Payment Systems as Critical National Infrastructure:  Discussion
of the threats posed by CNBR

 Research

 Regulatory and billing systems that assume one simple security model are
already under strain, and will need to accomodate the new efficient
security models of micropayments. The entry of the mobile phone into the
payments platform will lead to increasing convergance pressures on Banks
and Telcos.
 The Event


 The conference is held on a Friday and Saturday  in a friendly, relaxed,
cooperative environment, led by experienced payment  industry professionals
in a venue which combines the traditional with the modern -  one of the
City of London's oldest Livery halls with a WiFi network connected to  the
internet.

 There'll be opportunity to share your  experience and hear that of others
at one of our five minute rump sessions.
