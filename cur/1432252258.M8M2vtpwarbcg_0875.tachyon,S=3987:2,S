It's pretty light actually. Back in 1996/7 you could have seen thousands
of spem by now. 

Your problem is toad.com - there is no one central cypherpunks list, it
is in effect a number of lists that cross-post to each other. They
impose various degrees of editorial control, or not. (Almost) all of
them are open to postings from anyone - one of the points of the list is
to be a place where anonymous or unpopular postings are permitted.

The list working out of toad.com has some known problems and it is
probably not a good idea to be using it.  Jim Choate will probably be
along in a minute to tell you about his web pages at
http://einstein.ssz.com/cdr/index.html which would also fill you in on
some background and point you at some of the other mailing lists. There
has been a lot of good said about the cypherpunks@lne.com list, which I
haven't tried myself yet so can't comment on in detail. I think I'm
using majordomo@sirius.infonex.com at the moment, it's hard to keep
track. (Like a lot of people here I tend to join & unjoin using
different addresses - also I post from an address different from the one
I read it on)

ROFL :-) 

Do I really want to be around when the Doom generation grow up?
