1. New agreement between the French ISPs and record industries
============================================================

Under the patronage of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, an agreement
was signed on 23 November 2007 between some French ISPs and the music and
movie representatives in order to act directly against the big illegal
file-sharers. These could be warned in the first stage and then their
connection could be even cut-off..

The agreement was struck under the supervision of the Olivennes Commission,
named after its chairman Denis Olivennes who is also the President-Director
General of FNAC, the largest French retailer of cultural and consumer
electronics products. According to this convention and as already announced
by EDRI-gram one month ago, the French ISPs will spy on their users to see
if they are big file-sharers. Those who are identified could get first a
formal warning, but then they could be even cut-off or suspended. The
agreement foresees also the possibility to have a national register of the
subscribers that were suspended, but it is doubtful that such a register
will be accepted by the French Data Protection Authority - CNIL.

As a "compensation", the movie industry has agreed to release the DVD movies
just six months after the cinema run and the music industry to offer
DRM-free songs for legal download.

But the agreement is not applicable yet, since there is no authority created
to apply the agreement. The present authority created by the DADVSI law for
the regulation of DRMs and other technical measures does not have
attributions in these sense.

The administrative sanctions could be applied also to the ISPs that didn't
sign the agreement if they don't collaborate with the new authority.

Another problem of the new agreement is the open support to the filtering
technologies, that should be "tested" by the ISPs for maximum 2 years and
then implemented if they are "realistic from a financial and technical point
of view."

Nicolas Sarkozy used the opportunity to boast himself fro having respected
his presidential campaign commitments, and to first make such a type of
agreement in France, considering it as the "future of a civilised internet."

The deal was praised by the International Federation of the Phonographic
Industry (IFPI) that consider it as the single most important initiative to
help win the war on online piracy that  we have seen so far."

But colleagues of Mr. Sarkozy from the same party, such as Marc Le Fur and
Alain Suguenot, argued against it because it "creates a truly exceptional
jurisdiction for downloaders, contravening the principle of equality before
the law". Even the chair of the commission, Denis Olivennes, admitted that
the current penalties were "totally disproportionate" for those young people
who could be engaged in illegal file-sharing.

French consumer NGO UFC Que Choisir described the agreement as "very tough,
potentially destructive of freedom, anti-economic and against digital
history".

A response to the agreement was seen a few days later, when several major
web 2.0 actors such as AOL, Dailymotion, Google, PriceMinister and Yahoo
announced the creation of a French NGO called Association of Community
Internet Services ( L'Association des services internet communautaires -
ASIC) that wants to present the "opportunities that the web 2.0 offers for
the French economy and culture."

Unfortunately, the French bad example was quickly picked up and used in
other countries as a positive example. As EDRI-member Open Rights Group
reports, during an event in UK last week organised by the Social Market
Foundation with the title "Intellectual Property Rights and Consumer
Rights", the minister responsible for UK-Intellectual Property Office spoke
of the need for balance in reforming Britain intellectual property
regulation but the Government's actions do not yet evidence this commitment.

Richard Mollett from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) flagged moves
towards a voluntary agreement between the BPI and ISPs to reduce
copyright-infringing traffic, similar to French model. He expects "an
initial warning from the ISP that infringing traffic is
associated with a particular account will halt 75% of infringers. If
suspicious activity continues then account suspension is the next step,
before the final sanction of account termination." But "(...) fortunately
this point was recognised by all parties to the discussion, cutting off
internet access is very much the 'nuclear option'."

In the US, the Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Dan Glickman
confirmed this trend at a UBS AG media conference in New York, stating that:
"Within the next few years all the major ISPs will be much more aggressive
monitoring for people who use their Internet connections" for illegal
file-sharing,

2. RFID and Informed Consent - Using and removing of RFID functionality
============================================================

Following the the EDRi statements on RFID Privacy Issues and RFID Security
Issues published earlier this year, EDRi recently contributed with a third
written statement to the European Commission's RFID Expert Group focusing on
RFID and Informed Consent.

In this paper, EDRi deals with the possibilities of informing individuals
about RFID use and strongly asks for a strict opt-in regime for RFID usage.
Furthermore various mechanisms for removing, altering or disabling RFID
functionality are discussed and evaluated with respect to the protection of
personal data.

Finally, EDRi suggests a concept of responsibilities to ensure that RFID
technology is only disseminated to organisations that
explicitly consented to the use of RFIDs and that are able to take
appropriate measures to protect individuals' privacy.

EDRi's statement on RFID and Informed Consent is now publicly available.

3. Public letter on data security sent by MEPs to Frattini
============================================================

Two members of the European Parliament (MEPs), rapporteurs on the European
huge biometric databases Visa Information System (VIS) and the Schengen
Information System II (SIS II), have addressed a public letter to
commissioner Frattini asking for effective data protection and data security
provisions and thus excluding the copying or storage of sensitive data in
mobile formats such as, for instance, diskettes or CD-ROMs.

This letter comes as a reaction to the UK government data protection
security problems, after two CDs containing the personal data of 25 million
citizens were lost in the post.

The two MEPs - Baroness Sarah Ludford MEP, Liberal Democrat European justice
spokeswoman and European Parliament rapporteur on the VIS and Carlos Coelho,
responsible for the Schengen Information System - have reminded Commissioner
Frattini and the Portuguese Presidency that during the negotiations on the
SIS II one of the major concerns of the Parliament was exactly the problem
of the so-called "technical copies" that lead to personal data stored
off-line. The compromise with the Council was that all routine technical
copies which lead to data stored offline would have to be phased out, and
that only in exceptional cases could a copy be made offline if several
rigorous criteria were met and they were destroyed after 48 hours.

The letter, published by Statewatch, reminds that, in the current
discussions on the draft Common Consular Instructions/biometrics collection
measure, the European Commission provided the European Parliament with a
document in which "offline copies on disc are still presented as a possible
means of transfer of visa data, and that in a context in which encryption
may be challenged by the host country." This is seen as a major concern by
the 2 MEPs that asked the Commission to learn from the UK problems:

"Not only the UK government but the EU as a whole need to ensure that
lessons are learned from this monumental blunder at HMRC. We cannot allow
lax security standards on access or copying of vast centralised databases to
imperil the personal security of millions of people", said Sarah Ludford.
"EU data protection laws either need to be toughened up or accompanied by a
strict training and auditing regime in which data protection supervisors
must be given adequate resources and enforcement powers, both hitherto
lacking in the UK."

They also demand that the European Commission together with the Article 29
Working Party and European Data Protection Supervisor should draw up a green
paper on the risks that exist and the safeguards needed to keep data safe.

A new draft proposal that needs the ammend the European Privacy and
Electronic Communications Directive has been published by the European
Commission. One of the important changes will be the obligation of the
electronic communication companies to notify its customers  when a privacy
breach had occurred.

4. UK DNA database errors raise concerns
============================================================

The largest DNA database in the world covering details on about 4.5 million
people including information on every person arrested, convicted or not, and
on 900 000 children raises questions as inaccuracies and administrative
errors have been found in its records.

Incorrect dates, spelling mistakes and duplications have been found by Data
Quality and Integrity Team of the DNA database unit. These mistakes can lead
to innocent people being accused of crimes and wrongly arrested. Information
added to incorrect profiles has also obliged the police to erase affected
records.

The DNA Database Unit had also admitted in a report in May 2007 that between
1995 and 2005 it failed to load 26 200 records to the DNA database because
of errors, which resulted in 183 undetected crimes.

In August 2007 statistics released by the Home Office were showing around
550 000 files with wrongly recorded or miss spelt names. This created big
concerns among civil rights groups. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of civil
rights group Liberty, considered it was already bad that the database
included innocent people which had never been charged, many children and a
large percentage of ethnic minorities. "Now it turns out we don't know the
accuracy of the data. How many Postman Pats and Donald Ducks have entries on
a system worthy of the Keystone Cops?" she commented.

A spokesman from the National Policing Improvement Agency stated that most
of these errors have been corrected but admitted errors are still possible.
"Between January and November 1,450 demographic discrepancies have been
discovered and rectified. Some of these are spelling errors, date taken
amendments and Force code amendments (...) The Custodian Accreditation
Service has identified and logged 111 unexpected results - possible errors -
for the financial year 2006/07 that have resulted in the deletion of a
profile or an amendment to the profile."

John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley and an Internet
entrepreneur who is investigating the reasons of the occurrence of so many
errors stated: "It is important that people recognise Government databases
are not necessarily 100 per cent accurate (...) It is quite clear you can't
trust the Government with your personal information. They need to massively
tighten up the way they deal with these issues."

5. IP rules to be changed to give access to environmental technology
============================================================

On 20 November 2007, the Members of the European Parliament (EP) approved a
report that asks for the revision of the World Trade Organization Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in order to
allow the compulsory licensing of patented environmental technologies.

The European Parliament considers developing countries should be able to
have free access to the technologies developed to target the environmental
issues such as climate change. This action comes also as a result of the
environmental activists' criticism of the EU Global Paper stating the
intention to ask for a high level of Intellecutual Property (IP) standards
on European markets. According to environmental activists, such a policy
creates problems for developing countries that cannot afford expensive
environmentally-friendly technologies.

"With a high IPR (intellectual property rights) regime, products and
processes are now patented and less accessible (...) So to really achieve
the transfer of climate-friendly technology, the biggest incentive would be
to eliminate IPRs related to these technologies." said campaigner Meena
Raman from Friends of the Earth group.

Dalindyebo Shabalala of the Center for International Environmental Law in
Geneva believes TRIPS should include clearer provisions on the patent
excepts related to public health and environmental emergencies and waiving
patents should ensure wider availability of fuel-efficient cars.

French Green MEP Alain Lipietz, the author of the EP report drafted in
preparation to the international conference on climate change taking place
between 3-14 December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia, considers that not only IP
rules should be revised but also tariffs on "green goods" should be
eliminated and means should be found to subsidise polluting industries.

On the other hand, Stavros Dimas, the European commissioner for the
environment, stated that the cost of the IP rights in such technologies is a
relatively small part of the whole cost and that there are other issues to
be taken into consideration when talking about barriers to technology
transfer such as the economical policies of the developing countries. He
considers that many companies are not willing to invest in developing
countries where their IP rights are not protected and "if capacity-building
in the host country is inadequate."

More discussions on all the types of barriers to the transfer of
environmentally-friendly technologies will be held during the present
conference in Bali.

6. UK Retailers blow the whistle on DRM
============================================================

The Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) asks the music industry to get
rid of DRM which they consider responsible for the continuously decreasing
of online music sales in UK.

The industry music seems to ignore the consumers' preferences who are
displeased with the copy protection systems imposing limitations on the
content use. Additionally, the occurrence of various incompatible DRM
formats has led to confusion and reserve with the consumers who tend to
prefer file-sharing, lest they should find themselves in the position of not
being able to play the music on their electronic equipment.

According to Kim Bayley, ERA director, the DRM is "working against the
consumer interest" and "puts consumers off". In a statement to Financial
Times, she has made reference to a survey already discussed in the
EDRi-gram, carried out by Entertainment Media Research and media law firm
Olswang. The study has revealed the fact that four out of five consumers
would rather have copy protection free versions of the music they want to
buy. Therefore, many of them go to file-sharing peer-to-peer services.

Some recording companies, like EMI and Universal have already offered DRM
free catalogues and have experienced increased sales after that which is an
argument in favour of dropping DRM. During the last three years, an average
of one song per resident was sold online in UK, a sign that it's time the
music industry gave up DRM if they want to see any improvement in the online
sales.

7. European scientific information - too late on open access?
============================================================

The recent meeting on 22-24 November 2007 of the Competitiveness European
Council meeting adopted its conclusions on scientific information in the
digital age: access, dissemination and preservation.

The conclusions underline the importance of scientific output resulting from
publicly funded research being available on the Internet at no cost to the
reader under economically viable circumstances, including delayed open
access. They also ask the member countries "to systematically assess
conditions that affect access to scientific information", including:
a.The way in which researchers exercise their copyright on scientific
articles;
b.The level of investments in the dissemination of scientific
information as compared to total investments in research, and
c. The use of financial mechanisms to improve access, such as refunding
VAT for digital journal subscriptions to libraries.

But the Slovenian Minister for Growth, Ziga Tur, considered the conclusions
as coming too late, explaining in his blog: "The bottom line is
that in the scientific publishing process there is a decreasing value added
by the publishers. The research is funded by the governments or the
industry, performed by the researchers, papers are written and reviewed by
them for free, only at the very end a publisher comes along that takes over
the copyright, publishes the work and sells the journal at great expense to
the community that created and edited the content for free."

He also considers that the document aims too low, in talking only about
"delayed open access" and suggesting refunding VAT that would mean "simply
subsidizing commercial publishers".

The Slovenian Ministry suggests a much more categorical European approach to
the open access issues considering that "the explosion of the internet based
technologies in the US have been made possible by the (1) open access to
software, (2) open standards and (3) freely available scientific articles on
the subject. The cited document brings nothing like that to Europe."

8. Third international conference e-Society.Mk 2007
============================================================

The conference on the topic of "Inclusive e-Government" was organized by the
Metamorphosis Foundation last week within the frames of the project "Western
Balkans Network for Inclusive e-Government". The project aims at
strengthening the cooperation and coordination among all the relevant
stakeholders, decision-makers, government representatives, as well as
representatives of the business, academic and nongovernmental sector in
order to improve the quality and raise the level of usability and
accessibility of electronic services provided by the public administration.

"Although the inclusion is characteristic for the countries with a more
advanced degree of development of the information society, this does not
mean that we should not discuss this topic in Macedonia and work on it,
since our goal is becoming part of the European society", said Goran
Manchev, adviser in the Cabinet of the Minister in charge of Information
Society.

In the field of inclusion, as Manchev outlined, the Government is conducting
projects, such as "Computer for Every Child", the vouchers for the students,
intervals of free internet access etc., which, according to him, are an
introduction into bridging the digital divide in society.

The executive director of the Foundation Open Society Institute - Macedonia,
Vladimir Milchin, emphasized that the people working in the central and
local administration should increase their knowledge and improve their
skills in order to enable the users to increase their influence in society
and in shaping the public policies by using ICT : "This means reaching the
goal of having an open government and citizens who have access, i.e. coming
to a certain degree of inclusion, without which the democratic, nor open
society could not be imagined", said Milchin in his address to the
conference attendants.

"Knowledge and skills are among the prerequisites for establishing an
inclusive e-government into an information society. The digital divide is
increasing. The gap between the people using ICT technology and the ones
that are not is increasing. Therefore, we need to bridge the gap and enable
inclusion. We are aware that if Macedonia does not perform well in this
area, we will fall behind the European countries", stressed Marjan Gushev,
board member of the Metamorphosis foundation.

According to him, the "e" in the term "e-Government" stands more for
efficient rather than electronic Government, meaning that the Government's
activities should be reorganized in order to result in providing better
services for the citizens and businesses.

The second days focused on best practices in the e-Government.
Most participants claimed that the region benefits a lot from the
transfer of knowledge about good e-Gov practices from the EU, especially
from Austria, Slovenia and Estonia, three of the five top-ranked EU
countries in this area, according to Capgemini methodology.

On the other hand, reposts from different WBC pointed out not only to
the low level of e-Gov sophistication (around 2 out of 4), but also to
lack of interest in aspects of inclusion, especially lack of commitment
in applying standards for accessibility and usability in existing
e-services. Bardhyl Jashari from Metamorphosis Foundation emphasized the
importance of cooperation between different societal sectors:
governmental, business, educational and civic in overcoming these
obstacles. He also pointed out that in the case of Macedonia, around 70%
of the population does not use the internet at all, so in order to have
truly inclusive e-society, all the sectors must find mechanisms to
include this portion of population in the processes of development.

About 250 representatives of the governmental, nongovernmental,
education and business sector from 11 countries participated at the
conference that took place on 29-30 November 2007.

9. Progress in the European Digital Libraries EU Initiative
============================================================

A meeting on 27 November 2007 of a high level group on digital libraries and
officials of the European Commission formalised the agreement between
European libraries, archives and museums in a common effort to create a
European digital library that would give access to a common European
cultural and scientific heritage.

The EU European Digital Libraries initiative is part of "i2010: European
Information Society 2010" initiative launched in June 2006 with the purpose
to "foster growth and jobs in the information society and media industries",
followed, in August 2006, by the adoption of the Recommendation on
digitisation and digital preservation urging "EU Member States to set up
large-scale digitisation facilities so as to accelerate the process of
getting Europe's cultural heritage on line via the European digital
library".
In this sense, Member States were encouraged to tackle
questions related to copyright and "the systematic preservation of digital
content in order to ensure long term access to the material". The idea of
European Digital Libraries was backed by the Culture Ministers of all EU
Member States and by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 27
September 2007.

Recently, a European digital library foundation has been created gathering
European associations that represent museums, libraries and archives.
According to Information Society and Media Commissioner Viviane Reding, the
creation of the foundation "shows the commitment of Europe's cultural
institutions to work together and make their collections available and
searchable to the wide public through a common and multilingual access point
online".

The launching of a European digital library prototype is planned for
November 2008. The prototype will give direct access to at least 2 million
digital books, records, photographs, maps, films from the European
libraries, archives and museums. It is foreseen that by 2010 the digital
library will exceed the initially targeted 6 million digital objects.

The success of the initiative depends on the financing of the digitisation
and on finding solutions to make copyrighted works searchable through the
European digital library. Therefore, the discussions during the meeting on
27 November were focused on finding new ways to finance digitisation through
public private partnerships, in finding solutions for mass-digitisation of
out of print works and orphan works and on issues related to access to and
preservation of scientific information.

The group decided to find an agreement by June 2008 to deal with orphan
works that would including criteria to look for rightholders and an
agreement was also reached by libraries, scientists and scientific
publishers to experiment open access to scientific publications which have
