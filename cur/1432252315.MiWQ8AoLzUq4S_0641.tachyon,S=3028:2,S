  Turner: The Terrorists Are Among Us



Congressman Jim Turner, Ranking Member of the Select Committee on 
Homeland Security, issued the following statement regarding continued 
terror warnings in the Northeast and the President's announcements today:



The threats on New York, New Jersey and Washington DC serve as a 
reminder that the terrorists are among us here at home.  We have no idea 
how many more are still in this country surveying our ports, chemical 
plants and public transportation. We must assume there are other targets 
beyond the 5 buildings being protected today.



The President's announcement endorsing the creation of a Director of 
National Intelligence is a step in the right direction, but long 
overdue.  The recommendation was made over 18 months ago by the 
Congressional Joint Inquiry.  The 9/11 Commission report makes it clear 
that we have not moved fast enough to protect this country and have not 
closed the security gaps that threaten us today.



It is critical that we move forward to provide stronger homeland 
security and that we do it with great haste. Our terrorist enemies will 
not wait, and neither can we.
