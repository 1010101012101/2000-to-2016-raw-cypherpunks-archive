My comments will be about _any_ controversial server (*), not just an 
"AP server."

(* There is no need for a "server" in most cases, as we shall see.)

Someone offering some prize, or some payoff, or some lottery, need 
not be in an identifiable, traceable location. Payoffs are based on 
reputation, ultimately. As we have seen in the debate about meatspace 
identity, having someone's true name and location is only ONE FACET 
of increasing belief or confidence.

Put simply, some people will have more faith that they can collect 
from "the Controversial Practice Server" (substitute AP as desired) 
if they can find a DNS number and physical address for the CP Server.

But this increased faith is both illusory and unneeded.

Once decoupled from a DNS or address, and motivated by reputation, 
expectation, and other Bayesian issues, then the CP Server can itself 
post anonymously.

This is why I architected BlackNet as I did, back in 1993. No 
traceability, and Usenet and other such fora would have to be shut 
down to block it.

There is no need to have any such site. Think Mojo. Think BlackNet. 
Think peer-to-peer.

I agree. I said as much at the time Jim first came to us with his 
"wonderful idea." (He came to our list after being referred to it, 
and to my work on untraceable assassinations, by Hal Finney. When Jim 
first arrived, circa 1994-5, IIRC, he really didn't know much if 
anything about untraceable digital cash. He later wove this into his 
basic core ideas for AP.)

I fully agree that once untraceable payments may be made reliably 
that the targets will be picked more directly. I said this quite 
clearly in my "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto," published on the Net in 
1988. This was fully obvious to me even earlier than this, and 
apparently obvious to others soon after hearing enough details of how 
Chaum's protocols worked.

The late Phil Salin and I met with Chaum sometime around late 1988 
and it was clear he understood the implications, but had chosen not 
to focus on these political implications. I believe our discussions 
with him _may_ have been some factor in his increasing movement away 
from 2-way untraceability and towards his later favored scheme of 
"Joe Sixpack" being untraceable/anonymous to Fred Merchant, but not 
vice versa. Of course, in a distributed ("geodesic"--RAH) system of 
buyers and sellers, there is no particular distinction between buyers 
and sellers: all are traders.

And Chaum was NOT thinking clearly about why even a _seller_ might 
"legitimately" want untraceability: a seller of birth control 
information, for example. Absent "seller anonymity," such a seller 
could face sting operations by Saudi Arabian cops. Witness the 
controversy over sellers of "Nazi artifacts," pace Yahoo and France.

Indeed. And neither you nor I are likely to operate or participate in 
such markets.

But some people already DO participate in assassination markets. 
Happens every day. Some are caught, some are not. Governments are 
active players in this market, by the way.

Strong crypto will make the liquidation market...more liquid.
