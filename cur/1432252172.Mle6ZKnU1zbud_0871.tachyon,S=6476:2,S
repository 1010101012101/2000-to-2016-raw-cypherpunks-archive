Let's take a look at Daniel Nagy's list of desirable features for an
ecash system and see how simple, on-line Chaum ecash fares.

This is of course the main selling point of Chaum's system, where it
excels. I will point out that defining cash as merely "potentially"
anonymous leaves a loophole whereby fully non-anonymous systems get to
call themselves cash. This underplays the strength of Chaum's system.
It is not just "potentially" anonymous, it has a strong degree of
anonymity.

Certainly Chaum ecash has this property. Because deposits are
unlinkable to withdrawals, there is no way even in principle to
reverse a transaction.

Again this is precisely how Chaum ecash works. Everyone can receive
ecash and everyone can spend it. There is no distinction between
buyers and vendors. Of course, transactions do need the aid of the
issuer, but that is true of all online payment systems including
Daniel's.

I have to admit, I don't understand this point, so I can't say to what
extent Chaum ecash meets it. In most cases users will simply use their
software to perform transactions and no familiarity is necessary with
any antiforgery or other technical measures in the payment system. In
this sense all users are "naive" and no one is expected to be a
technical expert. Chaum ecash works just fine in this model.

This is the one aspect where Chaum ecash fails. It is a significant
strength of Daniel Nagy's system that it allows public audits of the
amount of cash outstanding.

However note that if the ecash issuer stands ready to buy and sell
ecash for "real money" then he has an incentive not to excessively
inflate his currency as it would create liabilities which exceed his
assets. Similarly, in a state of competition between multiple such
ecash issuers, any currency which over-inflates will be at a
disadvantage relative to others, as discussed in Dan Selgin's works on
"free banking".

Daniel Nagy also raised a related point about insider malfeasance,
which is also a potential problem with Chaum ecash, but there do exist
technologies such as hardware security modules which can protect keys
in a highly secure manner and make sure they are used only via
authorized protocols. Again, the operators of the ecash system have
strong incentives to protect their keys against insider attacks.

In summary, I don't think this is true at all. At least the first
three characteristics are met perfectly by Chaumian ecash, and
possibly the fourth is met in practice as naive users can access the
system without excessive complications. Only the fifth point, the
ability for outsiders to monitor the amount of cash in circulation, is
not satisfied. But even then, the ecash mint software, and procedures
and controls followed by the issuer, could be designed to allow third
party audits similarly to how paper money cash issuers might be
audited today.

There do exist technical proposals for ecash systems such as that from
Sander and Ta-Shma which allow monitoring the amount of cash which has
been issued and redeemed while retaining anonymity and unlinkability,
but those are of questionable efficiency with current technology.
Perhaps improved versions of such protocols could provide a payment
system which would satisfy all of Daniel Nagy's desiderata while
retaining the important feature of strong anonymity.
