Like this?

Proof of concept was been proven in 2010.  Practical application is
probably being done by now.  Somebody is asleep behind the wheel if it
is not.

Hex-encoded blobs, if not binary blobs that show up under /lib/firmware.

Subverting hardware during design means getting lots of engineers in
the private sector to shut up.  That is not always easy.  Spending
time reversing the binaries they require (which few people do anyway)
and developing a version that is subverted requires keeping the lid on
fewer people, and can be done entirely in house (i.e. without telling
the manufacturer).

Did somebody mention looking for outbound UDP packets encrypted with
RC-6 or something?

That would work so long as the radio is not otherwise in use.  Radio
chipsets can be flipped around but it generates heat and uses up power
faster.  It should be more detectable than a subverted hardline.

Until somebody that works there blabs about it.  Is that a risk an
intel agency would accept?  Good question; my wild-assed guess is 'no,
not these days'.
