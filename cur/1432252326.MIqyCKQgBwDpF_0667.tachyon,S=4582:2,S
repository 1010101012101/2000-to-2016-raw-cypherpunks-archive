How small of footprint?  50K (presuming you mean in currency) isn't really
a measurement of footprint size to me. :)  Would something along the lines
of a Java iButton <URL:http://www.ibutton.com/> match your requirements? =
=20
It truly depends on what you need the device to be capable of...and I don't=
=20
just mean the crypto implementation but is this a device to be self-powered?
How do you need to interface with it?  Etc.
