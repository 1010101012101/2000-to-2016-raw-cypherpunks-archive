this doesn't make sense. this is more or less same as de-anonymising the
voters secret ballot.

say 3 people are contesting the election and you make negative comments about
the first and the second contestant on the internet. That pretty much means
that everyone gets to know that you are voting for the third. it defeats the
whole purpose of a secret ballot.
