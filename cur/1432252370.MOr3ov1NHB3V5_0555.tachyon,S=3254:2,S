Absolutely appropriate, given cypherpunk goals.  It may be difficult
to apply in every case but the intention is laudable.

Here is an example of the principle put into practice, from the
anonymous web proxy service at http://proxy.magusnet.com/proxy.html:

: If you are accessing this proxy from a *.mil or *.gov address
: it will not work. As a taxpaying United States Citizen[TM],
: Business Owner, and Desert Storm Veteran, I do not want my 
: tax dollars being used by agencies I pay for to gawk(1) 
: at WWW pages and hide your origination point at my expense.
: Now, get back to work!
