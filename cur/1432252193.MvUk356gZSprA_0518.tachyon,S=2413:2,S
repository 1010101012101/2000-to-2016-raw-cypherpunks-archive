VisualRoute shows that pinging whitehouse.gov produces 
exactly the same path as pinging fbi.gov, both ending in 
Los Angeles. Is that where Cheney is holed up in the Getty 
Combustible Bunker? Sniff the LA impure air, is that La 
Brea tar or Halliburton grease?

Pinging the WH is will shortly be a terrorist act warns Patriot, 
so better hurry before the bush hammers john henry.

Anthrac, quack, quack.
