I always lie on the forms and send them in.  No blowback.

The Net has had a major impact on this Census since all the politically 
active types seem to be aware of the $100 fine which was not true before.

My brother refused to return his form and was contacted by his 
*Neighborhood Watch* representative who had been contacted by Census. Just 
like the Chinese block ladies who keep an eye on things.  Of course, he 
lives in the most commie state in the union.  He could sue in a case like 
this for a privacy violation by Census.

I doubt there will be any prosecutions this year.  There weren't any in 
1990 or 1980 and the 1970 prosecutions ran into First Amendment selective 
prosecution problems.
