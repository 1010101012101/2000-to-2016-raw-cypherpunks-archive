Who cares?  If I can get a key thats in the main browsers for 90% off,
who cares if other people have it?

I understand that getting the public half of the 2 main browsers will
run you about $250k in fees, plus all the setup work.  If I can buy a
slightly used Ncipher box whose public key bits are in the browsers
for a 10th to a 5th of that, the extra copies of the bits aren't all
that worrisome to me.
