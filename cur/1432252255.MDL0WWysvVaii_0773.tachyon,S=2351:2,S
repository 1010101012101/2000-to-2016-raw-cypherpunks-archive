So, if I have a right to free speech, and so do you, why would a voluntary 
association we formed together not have it?  And what impact would that 
have on the ability of people like you and me to actually get our ideas out 
there?  What happens when some media are so expensive that they're 
virtually never owned by a single person--does that mean laws can regulate 
what they are and aren't allowed to say?

So if I want to destroy Intel, all I have to do is get one provocateur into
