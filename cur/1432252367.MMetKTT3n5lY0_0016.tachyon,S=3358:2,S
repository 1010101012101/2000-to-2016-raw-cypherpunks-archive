This is a pre-announcement for the Saturday April 7 Cypherpunks Meeting in 
San Francisco.
This is the FIRST Saturday of the month, because the RSA conference will be
the following week and many usual suspects from out of town will be around.
The meeting will start at 1pm, and will be followed by dinner afterwards.

Agenda: The primary agenda is discussion of the work people are doing,
projects, things you're playing with, current events in crypto and privacy.
If you'd like to give a talk, please contact Bill or DDT.

We're still confirming the location, but it will either be at Moscone Center,
where the conference is being held, or within two blocks, at AT&T 795 
Folsom St.,
or at the Thirsty Bear Tavern on Howard.  All of these are 5-10 minutes walk
from Caltrain and BART.

A follow-on announcement will give the definite location.


	Thanks! Bill Stewart,  bill.stewart@pobox.com, Cell +1-415-307-7119.
