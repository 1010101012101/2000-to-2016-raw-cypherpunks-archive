hello,

 i was just wondering ... has anyone considered a time where the
governments will declare all encrypted blocks to contain messages
about illegal activities. that is to say, if you encrypt your
emails/communications, and the government wants to know the contents,
or use it against you, they will declare it to contain whatever they
want. it will then be up to you to prove it _doesn't_ contain this.

 how can we defend against this? deniable encryption? pretend the
block isn't encrypted at all, but that it is random data, or some
other type of content (data for a maths project, etc)?

 is it forseable that this will happen (in any given country)? i think
so. i think it already happens in some forms elsewhere. i.e. illegal
money. "prove this money came from valid resources, otherwise it's
illegal". i know that happens in australia already.
