We've never done mass anthrax testing before.  There is no control group.

We don't know the environmental incidence of the spores, which like
tetanus and botulism are ubiquitous.

Bush needs a justification to use his spiffy new B61-11s in the great and
noble Crusade against World Evil, Starring George W. Bush.

Draw your own conclusions as to the accuracy of the tiny number of
purported anthrax cases now sucking up 90% of the news coverage.
