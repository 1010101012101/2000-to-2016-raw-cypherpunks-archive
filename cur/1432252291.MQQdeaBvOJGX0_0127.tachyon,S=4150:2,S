Not that I am aware of.

This is due to the possible illegality.  Your "vaccine" would certainly
get investigated by any clued-in admin who noticed it.  You would possibly
get attention from some LEAs, regardless of your intentions.

A revised version of Code Red (called Code Red v2 or CRv2) was released
shortly after eEye discovered the original Code Red.  CRv2 had a much
better PRNG than the original Code Red worm, and did not attack the same
sequence of hosts.

The incidents@securityfocus.com list is probably tracking Code Red
infections and coordinating some soft of response to affected sites.

Ask Max Vision of whitehats.com what happened to him when he created a
program to patch vulnerable Internet software (bind, I think it was).  Oh
wait, he's in prison at the moment.  This probably had something to do
with him planting a backdoor along with the fix, but I wouldn't risk it.
