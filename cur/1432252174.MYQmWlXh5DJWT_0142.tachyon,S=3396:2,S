It's too bad so many people are so confused about what a "Web of Trust" 
is.

Do I need a "positive picture ID" of Lucky Green to communicate with him 
securely? Black Unicorn? Pr0duct Cypher? Eric Hughes? Attila the Hun?

The notion that a particular credential with a picture on it means 
anything, or should be given weight, is one of the most dangerous ideas 
there is. For the obvious reasons.

As a hint, the people you _don't_ want to trust are a helluva lot more 
likely to have nice, neat picture IDs than people like Lucky Green are.
