I found the logs on the USB before I posted about the GCHQ slide, that's
how I found the info. I verified that the data was also in coderman's
torrent from over a year ago. John rebuffed my initial inquiry and refused
to verify that the IPs I provided visited Cryptome at the times listed, and
then accused me of faking the data. So I released it for others to look at
themselves.

As far as calling Snowden a liar, as I said in note #4 of the GCHQ post...

If the slide is a mockup, it could be an internal mockup produced by GCHQ,
