Your point is taken.  That said, even if you could turn off TCPA &
Palladium and run some outdated version of Windows, whether users
would object is not entirely obvious.  For instance, suppose that,
thanks to TCPA/Palladium, Microsoft could design Office 2005 so that it
is impossible for StarOffice and other clones to read files created in
Office 2005.  Would some users object?  I don't know.  For many users,
being unable to read documents created in a recent version of Office
is simply not an option.  However, in any case we should consider in
advance the possible implications of this technology.
